A novel scheme, called the Image Compression Encryption Scheme (ICES), is presented. It combines the Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Significance-Linked Connected Component Analysis (SLCCA), and the Advance Encryption Standard (AES). Because of above reason the ICES efficiently reduce the overall processing time. This study develops a novel hardware system to compress and encrypt an image in real-time using an image compression encryption scheme. The proposed system exploits parallel processing to increase the throughout of the cryptosystem for Internet multimedia applications to implement the ICES. Using hardware acceleration for encryption and decryption, the FPGA implementation of DWT, SLCCA and the AES algorithm can be used. Using a pipeline structure, a very high data throughput of 330 Mbit/s at a clock frequency of 40 MHz was obtained. Therefore, the ICES is secure, fast and suited to high speed network protocols such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) or Internet multimedia applications.", "paper_title": "Improving the compression and encryption of images using FPGA-based cryptosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235308500001"}
