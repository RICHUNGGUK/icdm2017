The transmit power of wireless nodes in an ad hoc network is strictly limited. Thus, high PAPR of the 3D OFDM system is a possible drawback when it is considered as a physical layer transmission scheme for the WSNs. Here, we propose an improved partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique to reduce PAPR of the OFDM system with 3D modulation formats. In the proposed algorithm, the components of 3D signals are assigned to different subblocks using a diagonal rule (DR), increasing randomness of the signals in the disjoint subblocks forcibly. As a result, the proposed method reduces PAPR of the 3D OFDM system significantly without increase in computational complexity. Hence, the proposed algorithm makes the 3D OFDM system be a possible candidate for a physical layer transmission scheme in future WSNs.", "paper_title": "A Three-Dimensional OFDM System with PAPR Reduction Method for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334224000001"}
