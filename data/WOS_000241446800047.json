This paper studies the problem of semantic information providing Web Service composition. More specifically, we propose a new method to represent the semantic information providing Web Services in the CARIN language, which seamlessly integrates both database and semantic web technologies. Then, a semantic rewriting based framework and algorithm are proposed to compose the Web Services. Through a case study we show that the new method could find more compositions compared with both query rewriting and planning based Web Service composition methods.", "paper_title": "A semantic rewriting approach to automatic information providing Web Service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800047"}
