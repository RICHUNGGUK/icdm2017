For t > 0, Costa proved that e(2h(X+root tZ)) is concave in t, where the proof hinged on the first and second order derivatives of h(X +root tZ). In particular, these two derivatives are signed, i. e., (partial derivative/partial derivative t)h(X + root tZ) >= 0 and (partial derivative(2)/partial derivative t(2))h(X + root tZ) <= 0. In this paper, we show that the third order derivative of h(X + root tZ) is nonnegative, which implies that the Fisher information J(X + root tZ) is convex in t. We further show that the fourth order derivative of h(X +root tZ) is nonpositive. Following the first four derivatives, we make two conjectures on h(X + root tZ): the first is that (partial derivative(n)/partial derivative t(n))h(X + tZ) is nonnegative in t if n is odd, and nonpositive otherwise; the second is that log J(X + root tZ) is convex in t. The first conjecture can be rephrased in the context of completely monotone functions: J(X + root tZ) is completely monotone in t. The history of the first conjecture may date back to a problem in mathematical physics studied by McKean in 1966. Apart from these results, we provide a geometrical interpretation to the covariance-preserving transformation and study the concavity of h(root tX+root 1 - tZ), revealing its connection with Costa's entropy power inequality.", "paper_title": "Higher Order Derivatives in Costa's Entropy Power Inequality", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500014"}
