By resolving the reason why the algebraic expressions of AES-like S-boxes are so simple, the upper bound of items involved in the algebraic expressions of AES-like S-boxes is presented. Then, a new S-box structure named Affine-Power-Affine (APA) is designed such that the algebraic complexity is increased. With the APA structure, the algebraic complexity of the improved AES S-box is increased from 9 to 253, and its inverse S-box keeps 255. Furthermore, other good cryptographic characteristics of AES S-box are inherited.", "paper_title": "A new S-box structure named affine-power-affine", "paper_id": "WOS:000247493400022"}
