In particular, we aim to show, which subconstructions are needed in such results. Moreover, we recall that in some cases the undecidability of the reachability is achieved although the sets of all reachable objects are simple, or more formally, regular languages.", "paper_title": "ON THE POWER OF COOPERATING MORPHISMS VIA REACHABILITY PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272248900003"}
