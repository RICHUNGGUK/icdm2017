The initial and final density distributions are approximated by finite mass particles having a gaussian kernel. Mass conservation and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the potential are identically satisfied by constant mass transport along straight lines. The scheme is described in the context of existing methods to solve the problem and a set of numerical examples including applications to medical imagery are presented. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
