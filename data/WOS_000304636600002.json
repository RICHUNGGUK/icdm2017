According to the imprecise computations technique, a real-time job can trade off precision for timeliness. Each job that arrives at the system has an end-to-end deadline and is a directed acyclic graph of component tasks, where the output data of a task may be used as input by another task. In case the input data of a task are imprecise, the task's execution time is extended, in order to correct the error and produce a result of acceptable quality. Due to the data dependencies between the tasks of a job, schedule holes may appear in the schedule of a particular processor. Our approach is compared with other scheduling policies, under various workloads. The simulation results show that in the framework under study, the proposed strategy can lead to a better system performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
