Each sensor node has a sensor to observe the target and a processor to estimate the target position. It also has wireless communication capability but with limited range and can only communicate with neighbors. The moving target is assumed to be an intelligent agent, which is \"smart\" enough to escape from the detection by maximizing the estimation error. This adversary behavior makes the target tracking problem more difficult. We formulate this target estimation problem as a zero-sum game in this paper and use a minimax filter to estimate the target position. The minimax filter is a robust filter that minimizes the estimation error by considering the worst case noise. Furthermore, we develop a distributed version of the minimax filter for multiple sensor nodes. The distributed computation is implemented via modeling the information received from neighbors as measurements in the minimax filter. The simulation results show that the target tracking algorithm proposed in this paper provides a satisfactory result.", "paper_title": "A Game Theory Approach to Target Tracking in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388300001"}
