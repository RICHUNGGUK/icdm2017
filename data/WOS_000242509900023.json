This method is based on using the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) in the inner region and a modified conjugated infinite element (CIE) approach in the outer region. The aim of this formulation is to accurately simulate the acoustic radiation in the medium frequency range with a reasonable CPU time. The present formulation is developed for two dimensions but can be generalized in 3D. The easy applicability of this coupling scheme is demonstrated by investigation of the acoustic field around an infinite cylinder. Comparisons between computed results and those obtained from classical CIE approach illustrate the effectiveness of the new method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
