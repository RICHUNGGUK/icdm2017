Video scene/shot analysis and key frame extraction are used as a foundation to identify objects in video and be able to find spatial relationships within the video. The compounding of low level features such as colour, texture and abstract object identification lead into higher level real object identification and tracking and scene detection. The main focus is on using a video style that is different to the heavily used sports and news genres. Using different video styles can open the door to creating methods that Could encompass all video types instead of specialized methods for each specific style of video. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
