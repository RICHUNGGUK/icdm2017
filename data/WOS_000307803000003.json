For this purpose, Bayesian Networks (BNs) is one of the most successful and efficient Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) so far. Since the mid-90s, a growing number of BNs extensions have been proposed. Object-oriented, entity-relationship and first-order logic are the main representation paradigms used to extend BNs. While entity-relationship and first-order models have been successfully used for machine learning in defining lifted probabilistic inference, object-oriented models have been mostly underused. Structured inference, which exploits the structural knowledge encoded in an object-oriented PGM, is a surprisingly unstudied technique. In this paper we propose a full object-oriented framework for Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) and propose two extensions of the state-of-the-art structured inference algorithm: SPI which removes the major flaws of existing algorithms and SPISBB which largely enhances SPI by using d-separation.
