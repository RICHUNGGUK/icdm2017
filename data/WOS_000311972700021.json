The system takes as input a hand-drawn sketch and generates a set of 3D curves such that their orthogonal projection matches the input sketch. The main contribution is a method which is able to identify the symmetry relationship among the hand-drawn curves even in the presence of ambiguity in the sketch. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
