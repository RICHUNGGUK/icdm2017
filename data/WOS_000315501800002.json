A scene is captured directly by a camera and by placing a transparent medium between the scene and the camera. A depth map of the scene is then recovered from the displacements of scene points in the images. Unlike other existing depth from refraction methods, our method does not require prior knowledge of the pose and refractive index of the transparent medium, but instead can recover them directly from the input images. By analyzing the displacements of corresponding scene points in the images, we derive closed form solutions for recovering the pose of the transparent medium and develop an iterative method for estimating the refractive index of the medium. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Depth from Refraction Using a Transparent Medium with Unknown Pose and Refractive Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000315501800002"}
