The collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation approach is adopted and both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac gases are considered. The formulas for the split flux vectors are derived based oil the general three-dimensional distribution function in velocity space and formulas for lower dimensions can be directly deduced. General curvilinear coordinates are introduced to treat practical problems with general geometry. High-order accurate schemes using weighted essentially nori-oscillatory methods are implemented. The resulting high resolution kinetic flux Splitting schemes are tested for 1D shock tube flows and shock wave diffraction by a 2D wedge and by a circular cylinder in ideal quantum gases. Excellent results have been obtained for all examples computed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
