Mathematical model is based on finite volume solution of the Navier-Stokes equations and depth-integrated continuity equation to track the free surface. The Sommerfeld boundary condition is applied at the far-end of the truncated computational domain. A dissipation zone is formed by applying artificial pressure on water surface to dissipate the kinetic energy of the outgoing waves. The computational scheme is tested to verify the conservation of total fluid volume in the domain for long simulation durations. Combination of the Sommerfeld boundary and dissipation zone can effectively minimize reflections and prevent cumulative changes in total fluid volume in the domain. Solitary wave, nonlinear periodic waves and irregular waves are simulated to illustrate the numerical developments. Earthquake excited surface waves and nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures in a dam-reservoir are computed.
