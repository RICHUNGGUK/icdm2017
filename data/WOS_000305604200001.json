In particular, focus is placed on monitoring individuals in a home setting for their own well-being. This work is a high-level investigation focused on the structure of human behavior. Examples demonstrate the utility of this approach for (1) understanding the similarity of pairs of behaviors for an individual (or alternatively between individuals) and (2) detecting significant change between changing behavior and a baseline model. In the context of eldercare, significant change in behavior can be a precursor to cognitive and/or functional health related problems. Simulated resident behavior is used to show different scenarios and the response of the proposed measure.
