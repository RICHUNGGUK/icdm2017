This is complemented by lower bounds showing that a 3-fold exponential blow-up of the computed existential (existential-positive) sentence is unavoidable. Both algorithms can be extended (while maintaining the upper and lower bounds on their time complexity) to input first-order sentences with modulo m counting quantifiers (FO+MODm). Furthermore, we show that for an input FO-formula, a C-d-equivalent Feferman-Vaught decomposition can be computed in 3-fold exponential time. We also provide a matching lower bound.", "paper_title": "PRESERVATION AND DECOMPOSITION THEOREMS FOR BOUNDED DEGREE STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000373922900017"}
