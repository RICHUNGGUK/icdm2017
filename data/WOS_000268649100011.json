The key features of the approach include the introduction of a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the construction of an augmented matrix with uncorrelated terms. and the employment of a tighter bounding technique. As a result, significant performance improvement is achieved in system analysis and synthesis without using either free weighting matrices or model transformation. Examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
