The ultimate goal is to suggest the most convenient transverse reinforcement arrangements in terms of enhanced strength and ductility, as well as ease of construction and cost-effectiveness. The present study is particularly relevant with respect to confinement of hollow sections, for which previous experimental and analytical research is limited. Constitutive laws, modelling techniques, post-processing issues and preliminary applications are first introduced, and a large parametric model setup for circular and rectangular bridge piers of solid and hollow section, is subsequently presented. A detailed discussion follows on various issues concerning confinement modelling, aiming to broaden the scope and applicability of the suggested methodology. The respective numerical results and their interpretation and evaluation will be presented in a companion paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
