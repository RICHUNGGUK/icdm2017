In particular, we are interested in the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of maximum earliness and maximum tardiness costs. This kind of objective function is related to the just-in-time environment where penalties, such as storage cost and additional charges for late delivery, should be avoided. First we present a mixed integer linear model for the problem without availability constraints and we prove that this model can be reduced to a polynomial-time model. Secondly, we suppose that the machine undergoes a periodic preventive maintenance. We present then a second mixed integer linear model to solve the problem to optimality. Although the latter problem can be solved to optimality for small instances, we show that the problem reduces to the one-dimensional bin packing problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm best fit decreasing performs well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
