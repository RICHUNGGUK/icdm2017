By combining the bandwidth guarantee polling (BGP) scheme with the strict priority queuing (SPQ) mechanism, the proposed solution can greatly mitigate the light-load penalty while supporting differentiated services. The performance of the proposed solution has been demonstrated by the simulation results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
