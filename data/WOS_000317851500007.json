Integration with respect to the point process itself leads to the concept of the continuous wavelet transform of a point process. Applying then suitable translation, rotation and dilation operations through a non unitary operator, we obtain a transformed point process which highlights main properties of the original point process. The choice of the mother wavelet is relevant and we thus conduct a detailed analysis proposing three two-dimensional mother wavelets. We use this approach to detect main directions present in the point process, and to test for anisotropy.", "paper_title": "A CONTINUOUS WAVELET-BASED APPROACH TO DETECT ANISOTROPIC PROPERTIES IN SPATIAL POINT PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000317851500007"}
