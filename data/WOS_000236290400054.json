Based on it, we also present a fast optimal choice fractal image compression algorithm and an optimal method of constructing data tree which greatly improve the performances of the algorithm. Analysis and experimental results proved that it can improve PSNR over 1 dB and improve the coding speed over 30-40% than ordinary optimal choice algorithms such as algorithm based on center of gravity and algorithm based on variance. It can offer much higher optimal choice efficiency, higher reconstructive quality and rapid speed. It's a fast fractal encoding algorithm with high performances.", "paper_title": "A fast fractal image compression algorithm based on average-variance function", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400054"}
