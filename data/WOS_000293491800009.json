Due to the resource constraints of the sensor nodes, redundancy of coverage area must be reduced for effective utilization of the available resources. If two nodes have the same coverage area in their active state, and if both the nodes are activated simultaneously, it leads to redundancy in network and wastage of precious sensor resources. In this paper, we address the problem of network coverage and connectivity and propose an efficient solution to maintain coverage, while preserving the connectivity of the network. The proposed solution aims to cover the area of interest (AOI), while minimizing the count of the active sensor nodes. The overlap region of two sensor nodes varies with the distance between the nodes. If the distance between two sensor nodes is maximized, the overall coverage area of these nodes will also be maximized. Also, to preserve the connectivity of the network, each sensor node must be in the communication range of at least one other node. Results of simulation of the proposed solution indicate up to 95% coverage of the area, while consuming very less energy of 9.44J per unit time in the network, simulated in an area of 2500 m(2).
