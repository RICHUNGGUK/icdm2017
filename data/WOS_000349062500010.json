Candesartan cilexetil has been exposed to forced degradation conditions and degradation products have been subsequently identified with the assistance of HPLC-MS technique. Molecular descriptors have been computed for all compounds and were optimized together with significant chromatographic parameters employing developed QSRR models. In this way, QSRR has been used in development of HPLC stabilityindicating method, optimal conditions toward various outputs have been established and high prediction potential of the created QSRR models has been proved.
