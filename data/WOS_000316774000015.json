While the link to a particular indication has been established in man, the mode-of-action (MOA) of the formulations often remains unknown. In this study, we aim to understand the MOA of formulations used in traditional medicine using an in silica target prediction algorithm, which aims to predict protein targets (and hence MOAs), given the chemical structure of a compound. Following this approach we were able to establish several links between suggested MOAs and experimental evidence. In particular, compounds from the 'tonifying and replenishing medicinal' class from TCM exhibit a hypoglycemic effect which can be related to activity of the ingredients against the Sodium-Glucose Transporters (SGLT) 1 and 2 as well as Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP). Similar results were obtained for Ayurvedic anticancer drugs. Here, both primary anticancer targets (those directly involved in cancer pathogenesis) such as steroid-5-alpha-reductase 1 and 2 were predicted as well as targets which act synergistically with the primary target, such as the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, we were able to elucidate some targets which may point us to novel MOAs as well as explain side effects. Most notably, GPBAR1, which was predicted as a target for both 'tonifying and replenishing medicinal' and anticancer classes, suggests an influence of the compounds on metabolism. Understanding the MOA of these compounds is beneficial as it provides a resource for NMEs with possibly higher efficacy in the clinic than those identified by single-target biochemical assays.", "paper_title": "Chemogenomics Approaches to Rationalizing the Mode-of-Action of Traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic Medicines", "paper_id": "WOS:000316774000015"}
