Design/methodology/approach - Based on the criterion of system reliability, a RMS configuration model is presented - the hybrid parallel-series model with waiting system characteristics. The configuration model is evaluated from reliability, productivity, and cost by combining system engineering theory, Boolean algebra methodology with statistical analysis theory. The model reliability has been used to ameliorate by adopting the integrated algorithm based on Shrama and Misra optimization algorithm. Findings - The need for application of this method and model - some constraints must be limited, the hybrid parallel-series configuration is superior and the integrated algorithm is effective to RMS system configuration. Research limitations/implications - Cost constraints, equipment weight constraints, and function independency of equipment are main limitations. Practical implications - The model and method have been used to ameliorate the reconfigurable automobile parts product line in SH automobile motor company of Shanghai. The operation result illustrates the validity of this configuration model and algorithm. Originality/value - The new RMSs configuration model has been proposed. The new algorithm is proposed to ameliorate and optimize a reconfigurable product line with the integrated algorithm based on Shrama and Misra algorithm. The actual running effect is significant.", "paper_title": "Research and optimization of reconfigurable manufacturing system configuration based on system reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000280732800024"}
