The three schedulers find a maximum input/output matching in a Single iteration. They sustain 100% throughput under both uniform and bursty traffic They Work many times faster than existing scheduling schemes and their speed does not degrade with increased switch size. SRA and SRA+ algorithms are of O(1) time complexity and call he implemented in simple hardware. SRA trends to incur different delays to flows of different classes of service due to their different subscribed portions of the total bandwidth. SRA+, a weighted version of SRA, operates on cells that arrive uniformly and on cells of packets such that the cells of whole packets are switched contiguously. SRA+ improves over SRA in that all flows undergo tire same delays regardless of their bandwidth shares. The schedulers operate on queue groups at the crossbar arbiters in a distributed manner.(C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
