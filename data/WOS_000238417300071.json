The geometry was taken for a typical epicardial coronary artery with a side branch. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were solved with the hybrid spectral/hp element solver Nektar. Some simulations were visualized in the CAVE, an immersive 3D stereo display environment, and selected features are described and interpreted.", "paper_title": "Blood flow at arterial branches: Complexities to resolve for the angioplasty suite", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300071"}
