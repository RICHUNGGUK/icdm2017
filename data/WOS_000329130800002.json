Internally, CORFU is distributed over a cluster of machines in such a way that there is no single I/O bottleneck to either appends or reads. Data is fully replicated for fault tolerance, and a modest cluster of about 16-32 machines with SSD drives can sustain 1 million 4-KByte operations per second. The CORFU log enabled the construction of a variety of distributed applications that require strong consistency at high speeds, such as databases, transactional key-value stores, replicated state machines, and metadata services.", "paper_title": "CORFU: A Distributed Shared Log", "paper_id": "WOS:000329130800002"}
