This framework may be useful, particularly to small organizations, for two main reasons: it can help them to start seeing the implications of KM in their current technical infrastructure, and as a result, they should be in a better position to know how to include their current working tools in part of a KM strategy, thus facilitating the alignment of such a strategy to the daily work of the organization. Second, identifying the role that their current tools play in the flow of knowledge should help such organizations to identify means by which to improve such tools as KM enablers, before becoming engaged in costly KM efforts that could require the acquisition of new tools and often also big changes in their current work processes. The applicability of the framework is illustrated with a case study conducted in a software development environment in which it was successfully applied. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
