In this paper, we study a perceptual scale-space theory which differs from the traditional image scale-space theory in two aspects. (i) In representation, the perceptual scale-space adopts a full generative model. From a Gaussian pyramid it computes a sketch pyramid where each layer is a primal sketch representation (Guo et al. in Comput. Vis. Image Underst. 106(1):5-19, 2007)-an attribute graph whose elements are image primitives for the image structures. Each primal sketch graph generates the image in the Gaussian pyramid, and the changes between the primal sketch graphs in adjacent layers are represented by a set of basic and composite graph operators to account for the perceptual transitions. (ii) In computation, the sketch pyramid and graph operators are inferred, as hidden variables, from the images through Bayesian inference by stochastic algorithm, in contrast to the deterministic transforms or feature extraction, such as computing zero-crossings, extremal points, and inflection points in the image scale-space. Studying the perceptual transitions under the Bayesian framework makes it convenient to use the statistical modeling and learning tools for (a) modeling the Gestalt properties of the sketch graph, such as continuity and parallelism etc; (b) learning the most frequent graph operators, i.e. perceptual transitions, in image scaling; and (c) learning the prior probabilities of the graph operators conditioning on their local neighboring sketch graph structures. In experiments, we learn the parameters and decision thresholds through human experiments, and we show that the sketch pyramid is a more parsimonious representation than a multi-resolution Gaussian/Wavelet pyramid. We also demonstrate an application on adaptive image display-showing a large image in a small screen (say PDA) through a selective tour of its image pyramid. In this application, the sketch pyramid provides a means for calculating information gain in zooming-in different areas of an image by counting a number of operators expanding the primal sketches, such that the maximum information is displayed in a given number of frames.", "paper_title": "Perceptual scale-space and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000258901900010"}
