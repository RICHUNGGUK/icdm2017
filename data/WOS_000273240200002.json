Motivated by continuous variable quantum computing (CVQC), we are developing a universal set of components for classical computing that is as close as possible to the CVQC set. We demonstrate the basic behaviour of the experimental devices in two frequency regimes, 10 MHz propagating in co-axial cable, and 20 GHz propagating in rectangular waveguides.", "paper_title": "Analogue Computation with Microwaves", "paper_id": "WOS:000273240200002"}
