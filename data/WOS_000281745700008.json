The number of registered trademarks in the image trademark database has risen rapidly. Both the text description of the trademark registration and the image content of the trademark air important. This study focuses on how to effectively retrieve trademarks from a three-dimensional trademark database based on image content. One three-dimensional trademark consists of several images, whereas a two-dimensional trademark contains only one. Therefore, image retrieval methods designed for two-dimensional trademarks seem to be inadequate for three-dimensional trademarks. This study presents an automatic three-dimensional trademark image retrieval (3DTIR) system based on corner features. Experiments are undertaken on three-dimensional trademark images from. the website of Intellectual Property Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan. Experimental results manifest that the proposed approach provides accurate retrieval results on three-dimensional trademark image database.", "paper_title": "CONTENT-BASED IMAGE RETRIEVAL FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRADEMARKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700008"}
