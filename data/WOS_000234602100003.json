More specifically, if n is the number of edges, and m is the number of concave vertices of the polygon, we show how to compute: in O(m(4/3) log(1/3) m + K) time, all K combinations that allow a form-closure grasp with two contacts; in O(n(2)log(4)m + K) time, all K combinations that allow a form-closure grasp with three contacts; in O(nlog(4) m +(nm)(2/3) log(2+epsilon) m + K) time ( for any constante epsilon > 0), all K combinations of one concave vertex and one edge that allow a grasp with one contact on the vertex and one contact on the interior of the edge, satisfying Czyzowicz's weaker conditions for immobilization; in O(n(2) log(3)n + K) time, all K combinations of three edges that allow a grasp with one contact on the interior of each edge, satisfying Czyzowicz's weaker conditions for immobilization.", "paper_title": "Computing all immobilizing grasps of a simple polygon with few contacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000234602100003"}
