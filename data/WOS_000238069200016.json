Most of those results need to find r (number of rules) positive matrices P(i)s to satisfy r(2) Lyapunov inequalities. This paper combines the ideas of group-fired rules, estimation of the maximum distance between two successive states of the system, and the vertex expression of any point in a region together, so that the relaxed stability that satisfies fewer Lyapunov inequalities is derived. Finally, an example is illustrated to reveal the merit of the proposed stability criterion.", "paper_title": "An improved stability criterion for T-S fuzzy discrete systems via vertex expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000238069200016"}
