In order to facilitate the task of selecting lexical resources for automated SA systems, this paper sets out a detailed analysis of four widely used sentiment lexica. The analysis provides an overview of the coverage of each lexicon individually, the overlap and consistency of the four resources and a corpus analysis of the distribution of the resources' lexical contents in general and specialised language. This work aims to explore the characteristics of affective language as represented by these lexica and the implications of the findings for developers of SA systems.", "paper_title": "Is there a language of sentiment?
