In the proposed algorithm, artificial ants construct solutions by selecting values for each variable randomly biased by a specific variable-related normal distribution, of which the mean and deviation values are represented by pheromone modified by ants according to the previous search experience. Some methods to avoid premature convergence, such as local search in different neighborhood structure, pheromone re-initialization and different solutions for pheromone intensification are incorporated into the proposed algorithm. Experimental setting of the parameters are presented, and the experimental results show the potential of the proposed algorithm in dealing with the function optimization problem of different characteristics.", "paper_title": "A direct application of ant colony optimization to function optimization problem in continuous domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100029"}
