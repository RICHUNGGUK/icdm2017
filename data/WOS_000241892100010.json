Then, the mathematical models of mature MoA (mature monitoring agent), and dynamic memory MoA (memory monitoring agent) survival are established. Besides, effects of the important parameter T in the model of mature MoA on system performance are showed. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the model that has higher detection efficiency and steadier detection performance than the current models is a good solution to grid intrusion detection.", "paper_title": "Grid intrusion detection based on immune agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100010"}
