We derive a nontrivial outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of this channel which, in absence of security constraints, reduces to the best known outer bound to the capacity of the standard BC. An inner bound is also derived, which follows the behavior of both the best known inner bound for the BC and the wiretap channel. These bounds are shown to be tight for the deterministic BC with a general eavesdropper, the semideterministic BC with a more noisy eavesdropper, and the wiretap BC where users exhibit a less noisiness order between them. Finally, by rewriting our outer bound to encompass the characteristics of parallel channels, we also derive the secrecy capacity region of the product of two inversely less noisy BCs with a more noisy eavesdropper. We illustrate our results by studying the impact of security constraints on the capacity of the WBC with binary erasure and binary symmetric components.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Capacity Region of Some Classes of Wiretap Broadcast Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000361486800023"}
