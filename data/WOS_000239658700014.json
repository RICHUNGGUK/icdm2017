The key issue in tracking techniques is how to minimize the number of updates, while providing accurate locations for query results. In this paper, for tracking network-constrained moving objects, we first propose a simulation-based prediction model with more accurate location prediction for objects movements in a traffic road network, which lowers the update frequency and assures the location precision. Then, according to their predicted future functions, objects are grouped and only the central object in each group reports its location to the server. The group update strategy further reduces the total number of objects reporting their locations. A simulation study has been conducted and proved that the group update policy based on the simulation prediction is superior to traditional update policies with fewer updates and higher location precision.", "paper_title": "Tracking network-constrained moving objects with group updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700014"}
