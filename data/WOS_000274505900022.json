Well known devices for the key protection include smartcards and battery backup SRAMs (BB-SRAMs); however, these devices could be vulnerable to various physical attacks. in this paper, we propose a secure and cost-effective design of a cryptographic system on chip (SoC) that integrates the BB-SRAM with a cell-based design technique. The proposed SoC provides robust safeguard against the physical attacks, and satisfies high-speed and low-price requirements of IPTV set-top boxes. Our implementation results show that the maximum encryption rate of the SoC is 633 Mb/s. In order to verify the data retention capabilities, we made a prototype chip using 0.18 mu m standard cell technology. The experimental results show that the integrated BB-SRAM can reliably retain data with a 1.4 mu A leakage current.", "paper_title": "A Cryptographic SoC for Robust Protection of Secret Keys in IPTV DRM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900022"}
