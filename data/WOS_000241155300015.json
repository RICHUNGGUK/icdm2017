This paper studies three strategies for storing XML document including one representing schema-conscious approach (SHARED-INLINING) and two representing schema-oblivious approach (XParent and SUCXENT++). We implement and evaluate each approach using benchmark non-recursive XQueries. Our analysis shows an interesting fact that schema-conscious approaches are not always a better option than schema-oblivious approaches! In fact, it is possible for a schema-oblivious approach (SUCXENT++) to be faster than a schema-conscious approach (SHARED-INLINING) for 55% of the benchmark queries (the highest observed factor being 87.8 times). SUCXENT++ also outperforms XParent by up to 1700 times.", "paper_title": "A tale of two approaches: Query performance study of XML storage strategies in relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300015"}
