The algorithm analyzed is built on a Taylor series method developed by Pryce for solving a general class of differential algebraic equations. The problem may be fully implicit, of arbitrarily high fixed index and contain derivatives of any order. We give estimates of the residual which are needed to design practical error control algorithms for differential algebraic equations. We show that adaptive meshes are always more efficient than non-adaptive meshes. Finally, we construct sufficiently smooth interpolants of the discrete solution.", "paper_title": "Polynomial cost for solving IVP for high-index DAE", "paper_id": "WOS:000254178000004"}
