The multilevel octree structure, multilevel interpolation/projection, and subdomain FFTs techniques are employed in the MLFFT. Distinctions between the MLFFT and the conventional FFT-based methods are discussed carefully. Numerical results demonstrate that the MLFFT is more efficient than conventional FFT based methods, especially when analyzing inhomogeneous problems.", "paper_title": "A Multilevel FFT Method for the 3-D Capacitance Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000314677400014"}
