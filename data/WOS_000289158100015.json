The stability issue of the general nonlinear impulsive control system is first investigated via comparison criterion. Then, a novel impulsive control scheme is presented for chaotic systems based on the T-S fuzzy model. Some sufficient conditions are given to stabilize the T-S fuzzy model. Our results are proven to be less conservative theoretically and numerically. Moreover, we have also estimated the stable region of the impulsive interval. Finally, the proposed fuzzy impulsive control scheme is successfully applied to stabilize Rossler's system and Chua's circuit. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our main results.", "paper_title": "A New Fuzzy Impulsive Control of Chaotic Systems Based on T-S Fuzzy Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000289158100015"}
