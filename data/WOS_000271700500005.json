The dynamic phenomenon of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, infestation outbreaks is an inherent spatial and temporal complex process. Agent-based modeling (ABM) facilitates simulating spatial interactions that describe the ecological context in which insect populations spread. The main objective of this study was to develop a model of the MPB forest infestation dynamics. This spatially explicit model integrates geographic information systems (GISs) and ABM to simulate MPB outbreaks at the tree and landscape scales, providing spatiotemporal information of annual distribution and patterns of MPB outbreaks. This prototype was implemented with geographic data generated from aerial overview surveys carried out by the B.C. Ministry of Forests and Range, for the study site in Kamloops, Canada. Results show the direct influence that vigorous forest stands and trees have on higher breeding rates, and therefore in the MPB population increment at a tree scale, in a period of 5 years. The simulation results at the landscape level help to determine the most probable locations of future MPB infestations in a time frame of 10 years. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
