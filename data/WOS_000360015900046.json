In this paper, using Hermitian construction and classical constacyclic codes, we construct six classes of quantum MDS codes. Two of these six classes of quantum MDS codes have larger minimum distance than the ones available in the literature. Most of these quantum MDS codes are new in the sense that their parameters are not covered by the codes available in the literature.", "paper_title": "Some New Classes of Quantum MDS Codes From Constacyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900046"}
