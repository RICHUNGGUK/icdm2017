To make system designers benefit from this new technology, powerful infrastructures and programming environments are needed. In this paper, we will propose new concepts of an operating system (OS) infrastructure for reconfigurable networks that allow to efficiently design fault-tolerant systems. For this purpose, we consider a hardware/software solution that supports dynamic rerouting, hardware and software task migration, hardware/software task morphing, and online partitioning. Finally, we will present an implementation of such a reconfigurable network providing this OS infrastructure.", "paper_title": "An operating system infrastructure for fault-tolerant reconfigurable networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884200015"}
