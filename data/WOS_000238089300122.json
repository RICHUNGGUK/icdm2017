But previously, because colorimetric and chemical modeling was not introduced to simulate the color changing of frescoes, there was a lack of objectivity and sense of reality. In this paper, however, two kinds of color changing, namely, color changing due to chemical changing of the pigment as well as dust accumulation, are modeled. Since this modeling describes the natural behavior of the color changing process, the simulation result is quite striking.", "paper_title": "An integrated color changing simulation system based on colorimetric and chemical modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300122"}
