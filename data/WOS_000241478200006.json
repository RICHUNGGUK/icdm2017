We develop efficient approximation algorithms for two natural classes of curves: kappa-bounded curves and backbone curves, the latter of which are widely used to model molecular structures. We also propose a pseudo-output-sensitive algorithm for computing the discrete Frechet distance exactly. The complexity of the algorithm is a function of the complexity of the free-space boundary, which is quadratic in the worst case, but tends to be lower in practice.", "paper_title": "Frechet distance for curves, revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200006"}
