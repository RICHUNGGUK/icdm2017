Having to deal with uncertainty in model checking paradigm, this paper introduces a fuzzy Kripke model (FzKripke) and then provides a verification approach using a novel logic called Fuzzy Computation Tree Logic* (FzCTL*). Not only state space explosion is handled using well-known concepts like abstraction and bisimulation, but an approximation method is also devised as a novel technique to deal with this problem. Fuzzy program graph, a generalization of program graph and FzKripke, is also introduced in this paper in consideration of higher level abstraction in model construction. Eventually modeling, and verification of a multi-valued flip-flop is studied in order to demonstrate capabilities of the proposed models.", "paper_title": "Abstraction and approximation in fuzzy temporal logics and models", "paper_id": "WOS:000349854100005"}
