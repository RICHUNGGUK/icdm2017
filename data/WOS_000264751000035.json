Moreover, control of normalization procedures for balancing bias versus variance is often left to the user's experience. An approximate maximum likelihood procedure for fitting a model smoothing the dependences of log-fold gene expression differences on average gene intensities is presented. Central tendency and scaling factor are modeled by means of the B-spline smoothing technique. As an alternative to the outlier theory and robust methods, the approach presented looks for suitable distributional models, possibly generalizing the classical Gaussian and Laplacian assumptions, controlling for different types of censoring. The Bayesian information criterion is adopted for model selection. Distributional assumptions are tested using goodness-of-fit statistics and Monte Carlo evaluation. Randomization quantiles are proposed to produce normally distributed adjusted data. Three publicly available data sets are analyzed for demonstration purposes. Student's t error models reveal best performances in all of the data sets considered. More validating evidence is needed to evaluate the Asymmetric Laplace distribution, which showed interesting results in one data set. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
