This extension allows to perform UV-finite one-loop calculations of cMSSM processes almost fully automatically. The Feynman rules for the cMSSM with counterterms are available as a new model file for FeynArts. Also included are default definitions of the renormalization constants; this fixes the renormalization scheme. Beyond that all model parameters are generic, e.g. we do not impose any relations to restrict the number of input parameters. The model file has been tested extensively for several non-trivial decays and scattering reactions. Our renormalization scheme has been shown to give stable results over large parts of the cMSSM parameter space. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
