It is based on a previous framework which has been improved with agent groups, security and efficiency concerns. Therefore, the framework presented can be used in common Intelligent Virtual Environment domains such as education, commercial games and simulation.", "paper_title": "A SECURE GROUP-ORIENTED FRAMEWORK FOR INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301029300011"}
