It classifies corresponding points between two consecutive frames containing still/moving objects and chooses corresponding points appropriate for 3D measurement. Experiments are done extracting still corresponding points with 2 scenes from original computer graphics images. Results for scene 1 show that accuracy is 0.98, precision 0.96, and recall 1.00. Robustness against sensor noise is confirmed. Extraction experiment results with real scenes show that accuracy is 0.86, precision 0.88, and recall 0.94. We plan to include the proposed method in 3D measurement with real images containing still/moving objects and to apply it to obstacles avoidance for vehicles and to mobile robot vision systems.", "paper_title": "Still Corresponding Points Extraction Using a Moving Monocular Camera with a Motion Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200021"}
