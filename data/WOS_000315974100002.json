The model includes gravity which helps defining an hydraulic head. The model predicted an incremental increase of the overall water content in the medium over each cycle prior to a quasi-steady oscillatory state, a hydraulic ratcheting effect that has been previously observed in laboratory experiments. An empirical model was proposed to combine the transient and harmonic variations of the volumetric water content. The parameters of this empirical model were examined against physical quantities including the frequency of the driving water table oscillations and the porosity of the porous medium. The findings presented here may help to improve the formulation of constitutive models that are able to describe hydraulic processes of unsaturated soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
