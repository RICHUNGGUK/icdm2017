This proposal is a blockcipher-based hash function with hash rate 2/3. The designers claimed that it could achieve ideal collision resistance and gave a security proof. However, we find a collision attack with complexity of O(2(3n/4)) and a preimage attack with complexity of O(2(n)). Our result shows this construction is much worse than an ideal 2n-bit hash function.", "paper_title": "Attacks on a double length blockcipher-based hash proposal", "paper_id": "WOS:000358873600001"}
