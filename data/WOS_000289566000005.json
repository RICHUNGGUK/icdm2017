The control must be able to direct the airplane towards different waypoints while at the same time maintaining the UAV stable. Also, the control should be transferable to similar UAV models with little to no change to the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Adaptive Control for a UAV", "paper_id": "WOS:000289566000005"}
