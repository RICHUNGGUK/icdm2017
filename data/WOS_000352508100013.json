Three different values of the aspect ratio of the inlet channels, kappa(i), that is their width to height ratio are considered, namely kappa(i) = 0.75, 1 and 2. For the configurations with kappa(i) = 0.75 and 1, the same behavior as previously described in the literature, is found. In particular, as the Reynolds number is increased, the flow evolves from vortical to engulfment steady regimes, then to unsteady asymmetric and symmetric periodic regimes, until, finally, it becomes chaotic. All the critical values of the Reynolds number, at which the transitions between the different regimes occur, are found to be very similar for kappa(i) = 0.75 and 1, while some differences are highlighted in the vorticity dynamics and characteristic frequencies of the unsteady regimes. The observed scenario is completely different for kappa(i) = 2. Indeed, in this case, the flow evolves directly from the vortical regime to an unsteady symmetric behavior, with a vorticity dynamics that is significantly different from those observed for the other aspect ratios.
