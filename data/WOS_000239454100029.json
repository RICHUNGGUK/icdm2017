In this paper, we provide a procedure to decide whether a regular language is a reflexive splicing language, based on the above mentioned characterization that is given in terms of a finite set of constants for the language. The procedure relies on a basic result showing how to determine, given a regular language L, a finite set of representatives for constant classes of the syntactic monoid of L. This finite set provides the splice sites of splicing rules generating language L. Indeed, we recall that in [1] it is shown that a regular splicing language is reflexive iff splice sites of the rules are constants for the language.", "paper_title": "A decision procedure for reflexive regular splicing languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100029"}
