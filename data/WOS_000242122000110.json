Since passwords are easy to remember for human users, the password-based system is used widely. However, due to the fact that the passwords are chosen from small space, the password-based schemes are more susceptible to various attacks including password guessing attacks. Recently, Choe and Kim proposed a new password authentication scheme for keystroke dynamics. However, in this paper, we cryptanalyze the Choe-Kim scheme and show it is vulnerable to various types of attacks such as server-deception attacks, server-impersonation attacks and password guessing attacks. We also comment on the scheme that more care must be taken when designing password-based schemes and briefly show how the standard like IEEE P1363.2 can be used for strengthening those schemes.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of secure password authentication for keystroke dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000110"}
