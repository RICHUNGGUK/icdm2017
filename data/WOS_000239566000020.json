ArTVox, a Java programmed evolutionary environment, arose from the attempt to emulate computational creativity applied to artistic production, in visual and sound domains, by using interactive genetic algorithms. Objects inspired in Kandinsky's artworks are being programmed in Shape, an auxiliary Java environment, to be inserted in ArTVox. Today, ArTVox creates and evolves visual compositions of geometric primitives that, by their turn, guide the sound production in another evolutionary environment, JaVox, integrated to ArTVox.", "paper_title": "ArTVox: Evolutionary composition in visual and sound domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000020"}
