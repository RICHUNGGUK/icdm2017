Since a generative 3D face model consists of a large number of vertices, a 3D model based face recognition system is generally inefficient in computation time. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D face representation algorithm to reduce the number of vertices and optimize its computation time. Finally, we evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm with the Korean face database collected using a stereo-camera based 3D face capturing device.", "paper_title": "Face representation method using pixel-to-vertex map (PVM) for 3D model based face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238080300003"}
