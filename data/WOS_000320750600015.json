This review looks at papers published between 1970 and 2011 and examines the background and trends in this area. Based on the results, we establish a 4-step framework for managing and handling adaptive policies. We also demonstrate gaps in existing literature, the implications to theory and practice as well as avenues for potential future research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
