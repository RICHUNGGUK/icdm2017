However, it may lead to high misclassification rate in real decision procedures. Decision-Theoretic Rough Sets (DTRS) employs a three-way decision to avoid most direct misclassification. We integrate logistic regression and DTRS to provide a new classification approach. On one hand, DTRS is utilized to systematically calculate the corresponding thresholds with Bayesian decision procedure. On the other hand, logistic regression is employed to compute the conditional probability of the three-way decision. The empirical studies of corporate failure prediction and high school program choices' prediction validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
