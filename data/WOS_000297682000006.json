We propose a general probabilistic framework for entity search to evaluate and provide insights in the many ways of using these types of input for query modeling. We focus on the use of category information and show the advantage of a category-based representation over a term-based representation, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of category-based expansion using example entities. Our best performing model shows very competitive performance on the INEX-XER entity ranking and list completion tasks.", "paper_title": "Query Modeling for Entity Search Based on Terms, Categories, and Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000297682000006"}
