To protect the privacy of original content, the image owner perturbs the texture and randomizes the structure of the JPEG image by enciphering the quantized Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. After receiving the encrypted JPEG image, the service provider generates a rescaled JPEG image by down-sampling the encrypted DCT coefficients. On the recipient side, the encrypted JPEG image rescaled by the service provider can be decrypted to a plaintext image with a lower resolution with the aid of encryption keys. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a good capability of rescaling the privacy-protected JPEG file. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
