New design trends and the ongoing work in the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) partnership have significantly increased the industry's awareness to these issues. Now, timing is recognized as a major challenge and has been put explicitly on the agenda of AUTOSAR and other industry-driven research projects. The goals include complementing the existing standard by a timing view and adding methodological steps, if necessary. Clearly, establishing such timing models requires knowing well the implications of modern architectures and topologies. In this paper, we survey existing performance analysis approaches from real-time systems research and compare them to the established layered software architectures of automotive system design. We highlight key challenges for the application of performance analysis in this domain and identify structural as well as behavioral \"modeling gaps\". While structural gaps can be overcome by model transformations, behavioral gaps require real extensions to known analyses. We discuss two such extensions in detail, namely, the use of hierarchical event models and the specialties of timing analysis for multicore platforms. This paper concludes with an overview over qualitative comparisons of analysis techniques, both technically and concerning their industrial applicability.", "paper_title": "System Level Performance Analysis for Real-Time Automotive Multicore and Network Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000005"}
