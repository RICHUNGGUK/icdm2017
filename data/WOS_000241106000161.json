It takes advantage of multiple cascade face detector fusion by context. We propose the filtering classifier method for illumination face image. And then we constructed cascade classifier from applied different filtering method. The multiple cascade detectors made from six single context detectors. Six contexts are divided k-means algorithm, and classify illuminant. In this paper, we proposed the classifier fusion method by using correlation between face images. The proposed face detection achieves the capacity of the high level attentive process by taking advantage of the context-awareness using the information from illumination. We achieved very encouraging experimental results having varying illuminant.", "paper_title": "A face detection using multiple detectors for external environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000161"}
