The concomitant models of linear devices applied in the CE simulation are discussed. Then, a method to obtain the responses of the nonlinear circuits excited by multicarrier modulated signals is developed. A novel decimal-coding chaos genetic algorithm (DCGA) combined with the suitable crossover and mutation operations is firstly presented for solving the nonlinear equations encountered in the CE simulation. The chaos process is applied to find further ascendant solutions in the current genus space in order to update the current colony and avoid premature states in the whole evolution progress. Finally, some examples are studied to verify the validity of the DCGA.
