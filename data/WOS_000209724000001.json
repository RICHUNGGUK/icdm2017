A major challenge in this respect is the VN embedding problem that deals with the efficient mapping of virtual resources on InP network resources. Previous research focused on heuristic algorithms for the VN embedding problem assuming that the InP network remains operational at all times. In this paper, we remove this assumption by formulating the survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE) problem. We then develop a pro-active, and a hybrid policy heuristic to solve it, and a baseline policy heuristic to compare to. The hybrid policy is based on a fast re-routing strategy and utilizes a pre-reserved quota for backup on each physical link. Our evaluation results show that our proposed heuristics for SVNE outperform the baseline heuristic in terms of long term business profit for the InP, acceptance ratio, bandwidth efficiency, and response time.", "paper_title": "SVNE: Survivable Virtual Network Embedding Algorithms for Network Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724000001"}
