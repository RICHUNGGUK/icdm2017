The method uses a non-parametric clustering of genes with compatible trees, and reconstructs the primary concordance tree from clades supported by the largest proportions of genes. A population tree with branch lengths in coalescent units is estimated from quartet concordance factors.", "paper_title": "BUCKy: Gene tree/species tree reconciliation with Bayesian concordance analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000283919800020"}
