A March-element-based (MEB) compression scheme is proposed to reduce the volume of diagnostic data. The MEB compression scheme can efficiently compress the diagnostic data of a RAM tested by a March test for detecting SFs and DFs. Simulation results show that the compression ratio (the ratio of the number bits of the compressed diagnostic data to that of the original diagnostic data) is about 50.79% for an 8Kx16-bit memory. The area overhead of the BIST with the MEB compressor is about 2.73% for an 8Kx16-bit RAM using TSMC 0.18 um cell library.", "paper_title": "A BIST Scheme With the Ability of Diagnostic Data Compression for RAMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518500022"}
