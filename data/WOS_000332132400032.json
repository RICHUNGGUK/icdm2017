It is assumed that the sampling period is different from the period of zero-order hold. Some sufficient and necessary conditions for consensus, which reveal the relationship among the interaction topology, controller gains, and the periods of sampler and zero-order hold, are provided. Moreover, the convergence rate is compared with that in the case when the period of zero-order hold is the same as the sampling period. Simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results.
