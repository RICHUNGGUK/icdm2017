The controller is based on the brain-emotional-learning algorithm, which is inspired from a computational model of limbic system in the mammalian brain. The brain-emotional-learning-based intelligent controller (BELBIC) with quadratic reward, comparable to linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) control, is used in an omni-directional robot. The contribution of BELBIC in improving the control system performance is shown via simulation and experimental implementation. The results show that this method can be used in more practical problems efficiently. Optimization of the control effort or other objectives like energy minimization, as additional concerns constitute other advantages of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Motion Control of Omni-Directional Three-Wheel Robots by Brain-Emotional-Learning-Based Intelligent Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000283447800003"}
