Although TSIMT has been briefly mentioned before, it was not evaluated. We present a complete design and evaluation of TSIMT GPUs, along with the inclusion of scalarization and a combination of temporal and spatial SIMT, named Spatiotemporal SIMT (STSIMT). Simulations show that TSIMT alone results in a performance reduction, but a combination of scalarization and STSIMT yields a mean performance enhancement of 19.6% and improves the energy-delay product by 26.2% compared to SIMT.", "paper_title": "Spatiotemporal SIMT and Scalarization for Improving GPU Efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000363004100007"}
