This research proposes a model using graph theory which holistically considers all the major enablers of resilience and their interrelationships for analysis using an Interpretive Structural Modeling approach. The uniqueness of this model lies in its ability to quantify resilience by a single numerical index. The quantification of resilience will help organizations assess the effectiveness of various risk mitigation strategies. This will provide tools for managers to compare different supply chains while offering a deeper knowledge of how supply chain characteristics increase or decrease resilience and consequently affect supply chain risk exposure. Thus, the research supports organizations in measuring and analyzing supply chain resilience and facilitates supply chain decision-making. The proposed method could simplify the dynamic nature of environment for managing disruptions in a supply chain. This novel approach for determining the supply chain resilience index (SCRI) advocates the consideration of resilience aspects in supply chain design, thus giving a competitive advantage to achieve market share even during a disruption.
