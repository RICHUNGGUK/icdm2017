Our solution, CamLoc, enables a user taking two photos of an object using a smartphone at a fixed location and immediately knowing the location of the object in global coordinates, thus facilitating myriad location-based services. Such usage is user-friendly but error prone. We devise several techniques to mitigate the errors caused by cheap and noisy sensors, upgrading the positioning accuracy to an applicable level. We prototype CamLoc on Android OS, and evaluate its performance across different scenarios with various building densities. Experiment results show that our system achieves 89 percent and 72 percent physical location mapping accuracy in rural and downtown areas, respectively, which is competitive with existing solutions.", "paper_title": "Towards Accurate Object Localization with Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179600023"}
