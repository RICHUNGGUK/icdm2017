However, the premium accounted for 5.77% of GDP in 2001 and the Bureau of National Health Insurance had pressing financial difficulties, so it reformed its expenditure systems, such as fee for service, capitation, case payment and the global budget system in order to control the rising medical costs. Since the change in health insurance policy, most hospitals attempted to reduce their operating expenses and improve efficiency. Introducing the electronic logistics information system is one way of reducing the cost of the department of central warehouse and the nursing stations. Hence, the study proposes a technology acceptance research model and examines how nurses' acceptance of the e-logistics information system has been affected in the medical industry. Methods: This research combines innovation diffusion theory, technology acceptance model and added two research parameters, trust and perceived financial cost to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model. Taking Taiwan's medical industry as an experimental example, this paper studies nurses' acceptance of the electronic logistics information system. The structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model. Results: The results of the survey strongly support the new hybrid technology acceptance model in predicting nurses' intention to use the electronic logistics information system. Conclusion: The study shows that 'compatibility', 'perceived usefulness', 'perceived ease of use', and 'trust' all have great positive influence on 'behavioral intention to use'. On the other hand 'perceived financial cost' has great negative influence on behavioral intention to use. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
