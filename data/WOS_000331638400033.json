In this study, by adding 10 vol% SiC and 500 ppm MgO nanoscale particles on the microstructure of Al2O3 matrix and applying optimum sintering conditions, ceramic performance against high-speed projectile impact was improved. To perform this investigation, a number of specimens with two different types of front layers (alumina and Al2O3-SiC-MgO nanocomposite ceramic) were produced. Impact tests were conducted on these samples using 7.62 mm projectiles with a velocity of 820 +/- A 15 m/s. The diameter of the base of failure cone after impact tests was measured. The results of the impact tests on the samples made of Al2O3-SiC-MgO nanocomposite ceramics and pure alumina were also compared and analysed. The results indicate that measured diameter of the base of failure cone after impact test for all ceramic nanocomposites is more than raw specimen and increasing in the diameter of the base of failure cone is related to increasing of the angle of failure cone.", "paper_title": "Research on angle of the failure cone of lightweight nanoceramic/metal laminated composite in the impact test", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400033"}
