While the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoder using an exhaustive search method is prohibitively complex, simulation results show that the CA and UMDA optimized MIMO detection algorithms result in near optimal bit error rate (BER) performance with significantly reduced computational complexity. The results also suggest that the heuristic based MIMO detection outperforms the vertical bell labs layered space time (VBLAST) detector without severely increasing the detection complexity. The performance of UMDA is found to be superior to that of CA in terms of computational complexity and the BER performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
