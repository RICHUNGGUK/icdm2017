We find an explicit expression for the asymptotic behavior of the loss probability as K tends to infinity. With the result, it is shown that the loss probability tends to 0 at a geometric rate.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic analysis for loss probability of queues with finite GI/M/1 type structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000250467700004"}
