A fuzzy filter is constructed, which ensures both the robust stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance of the filtering error system. A linear matrix inequality approach is developed, and a delay-dependent sufficient condition is obtained. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity filter design of uncertain T-S fuzzy neutral systems with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000291857800017"}
