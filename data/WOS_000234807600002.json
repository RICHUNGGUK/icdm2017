A linear spring model with time delay described the neuromuscular system of the human arm. The obtained viscoelastic parameters ensured movement stability in spite of the time delay of 50 ms. The stiffness and viscosity ellipses appeared to be predominantly orthogonal to the movement direction, which reduced the effect of force perturbation in the direction orthogonal to the reaching movement. Thus, it can be argued that the viscoelastic properties of the neuromuscular system of the human arm are adjusted to the direction of movement according to a \"path preserving\" strategy, which minimizes the deviation of the movement path from a straight line, when exposed to an unexpected external force.", "paper_title": "Adjustment of the human arm viscoelastic properties to the direction of reaching", "paper_id": "WOS:000234807600002"}
