These OOB radiations are commonly referred to as in-device coexistence (IDC) interference. In this letter, we derive a new model for the IDC interference that captures the filtering characteristics of the transmitter spectrum mask and the receiver filter. Then, we propose a minimum power consumption radio resource allocation algorithm for LTE/WLAN networks that takes into account the mutual IDC interference between LTE and WLAN. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves considerable power and data rate gains with respect to an algorithm that overlooks the IDC interference.", "paper_title": "IDC Interference-Aware Resource Allocation for LTE/WLAN Heterogeneous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800002"}
