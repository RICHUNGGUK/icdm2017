The system avoids factorization of polynomials over extension fields, but gives the illusion of a genuine field to the user. All roots of an arbitrary polynomial defined over such an algebraically closed field can be constructed and are easily distinguished within the system. The difficult case of inseparable extensions of function fields of positive characteristic is also handled properly by the system. A technique of modular evaluation into a finite field critically ensures that a unique genuine field is simulated by the system but also provides fast optimizations for some fundamental operations. Fast matrix techniques are also used for several non-trivial operations. The system has been successfully implemented within the Magma Computer Algebra System, and several examples are presented, using this implementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
