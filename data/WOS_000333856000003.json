By constructing the quadtree of the input point data, we extract the \"grid-like\" boundaries of the quadtree, and smooth the boundaries using a modified Laplacian method. The skeleton of the smoothed boundaries is computed and thereby the initial curve is generated by circular neighboring projection. Subsequently, a normal-based processing method is applied to the initial curve to smooth jagged features at low curvatures areas, and recover sharp features at high curvature areas. As a result, the curve is reconstructed accurately with small details and sharp features well preserved. A variety of experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.
