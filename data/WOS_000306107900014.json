Therefore, SOM has numerous applications in visualized clustering. Many growing SOMs have been proposed to overcome the constraint of having a fixed map size in conventional SOMs. However, most growing SOMs lack a robust solution to process mixed-type data which may include numeric, ordinal and categorical values in a dataset. Moreover, the growing scheme has an impact on the quality of resultant maps. In this paper, we propose a Growing Mixed-type SOM (GMixSOM), combining a value representation mechanism distance hierarchy with a novel growing scheme to tackle the problem of analyzing mixed-type data and to improve the quality of the projection map. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is feasible and the growing scheme yields better projection maps than the existing method.
