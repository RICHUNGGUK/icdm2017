Our approach for task distribution uses an artificial hormone system, which is self-organizing and able to meet real-time constraints. Several enhancements to the artificial hormone system have been made, such as partial suppressing of tasks and distributed task termination.Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Implementation and evaluation of a self-organizing artificial hormone system to assign time-dependent tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309458500005"}
