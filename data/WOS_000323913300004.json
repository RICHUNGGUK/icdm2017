The proposed system fuses visual detections from wall mounted cameras and detections from a mobile robot-in a centralized manner-employing a \"tracking-by-detection\" approach within a Particle Filtering strategy. This tracking information is then used to endow the robot with passers-by avoidance ability to facilitate its navigation in crowds during the execution of a person following mission. The multi-person tracker's ability to track passers-by near the robot distinctively is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative off-line experiments. Finally, the designed perceptual modalities are deployed on our robotic platform, controlling its actuators via visual servoing techniques and free space diagrams in the vicinity of the robot, to illustrate the robot's ability to follow a given target person in human crowded areas.
