This system is based on a genetic algorithm that dynamically discovers \"good\" intervals in association rules by optimizing both the support and the confidence. The experiments on real and artificial databases have shown the usefulness of QUANTMINER as an interactive, exploratory data mining tool.", "paper_title": "QuantMiner for Mining Quantitative Association Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000328603600008"}
