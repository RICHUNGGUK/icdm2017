The accuracy of this assumption is investigated in this paper by means of numerical analyses, which employ a number of advanced features, such as pipe-backfill interface elements, large strain formulation and mesh rezoning. Following verification against well-documented experimental data, the analyses investigate: (a) the shape and size of the failure mechanism, as well as, (b) the potential trench effects on soil pressures and pipeline strains in the case of a strike-slip fault rupture. It is shown that for small embedment depths soil failure extends to the ground surface, in the form of a general shear failure mechanism, while for larger depths it becomes progressively localized and surrounds the pipeline. It is also shown that, for most cases of pipeline diameter and embedment depth, common trench dimensions cannot contain the \"free field\" failure surface dimensions. Finally, analyses for limited trench dimensions, reveal that the ultimate soil pressure increases exponentially with decreasing trench width, leading to high bending strains in pipelines subjected to differential lateral ground displacements.
