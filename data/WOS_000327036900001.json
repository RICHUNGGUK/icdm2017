Our main result is to show that for a given g, this conjecture is equivalent to the corresponding case (k = 2g) of a conjecture of Seymour claiming that every planar k-regular multigraph with no odd edge-cut of less than k edges is k-edge-colorable. To this end, we exhibit several properties of signed projective cubes and establish a folding lemma for planar even signed graphs.", "paper_title": "Homomorphisms of planar signed graphs to signed projective cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036900001"}
