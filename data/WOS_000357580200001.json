Firstly, we have introduced a faithful script to deal with public motion capture data, which will be friendly for us. Various functions through dynamic programming, by using the Body Segment Parameters (BSP) are edited and they configured the position of markers according to data. It is used to visualize and refine without the MLS view and the C3D editor software. It has opened a valuable way of sensor data in many research aspects as gait movements, marker analysis, compression and motion pattern, bioinformatics, and animation. As a result, performed on CMU and ACCAD public mocap data, and achieved higher corrected configuration scheme of 3D markers when compared with the prior art, especially for C3D file. Another distinction of this work is that it handles the extra markers distortion, and provides the meaningful way to use captured data.", "paper_title": "A New Bio-Informatics Framework: Research on 3D Sensor Data of Human Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580200001"}
