The inverse displacement is briefly analyzed. Then three methods: quintic polynomial, linear segment with parabolic blends (LSPB), and s-curve are utilized to generate trajectories for point-to-point motion in joint space. Since rapidness for the robotic manipulator is a critical performance index, the minimum traveling time for all the methods are obtained satisfying the actuators' velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits. Moreover, the analytical expressions for them are derived. The minimum time for all the methods is compared, and s-curve is demonstrated to have the best performance compared with the other two methods. The analytical procedure developed in this paper for obtaining the minimum time can be readily applied to other serial or parallel manipulators.", "paper_title": "MINIMUM TIME TRAJECTORY GENERATION FOR A NOVEL ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500012"}
