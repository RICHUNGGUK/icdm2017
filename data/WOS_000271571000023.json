Firstly, it is proved that mother wavelet function can build a set of complete base through horizontal floating and form the wavelet kernel function. And then, Wv-SVM with wavelet kernel function is proposed in this paper. Secondly, aiming to the disadvantage of standard PSO, HAGPSO is proposed to seek the optimal parameter of Wv-SVM. Finally, the load forecasting model based on HAGPSO and Wv-SVM is proposed in this paper. The results of application in load forecasts show the proposed model is effective and feasible.
