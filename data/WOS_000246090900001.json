The main contributions of this paper include a review of how machine learning has been used on Sony AIBO robots and at RoboCup, with a focus on the four-legged league during the years 1998-2004. The review shows that the application-oriented use of machine learning in the four-legged league was still conservative and restricted to a few well-known and easy-to-use methods such as standard decision trees, evolutionary hill climbing, and support vector machines. Method-oriented spin-off studies emerged more frequently and increasingly addressed new and advanced machine learning techniques. Further, the paper presents some details about the growing impact of machine learning in the software system developed by the authors' robot soccer team-the NUbots.", "paper_title": "Machine learning with AIBO robots in the four-legged league of RoboCup", "paper_id": "WOS:000246090900001"}
