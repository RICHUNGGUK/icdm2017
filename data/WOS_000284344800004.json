This research attempts to construct a classification approach based on the hybrid use of case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GAs) for hypertension detection using anthropometric body surface scanning data. The obtained result reveals the relationship between a subject's 3D scanning data and hypertension disease. The GA is adopted to determine the appropriate feature weights for CBR. The proposed approaches were experimented and compared with a regular CBR and other widely used approaches including neural nets and decision trees. The experiment showed that applying GA to determine the suitable weights in CBR is a feasible approach to improving the effectiveness of case matching of hypertension disease. It also demonstrated that different weighted CBR approach presents better classification accuracy over the results obtained from other approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Boy.
