In the deterministic setting, a closed reconstruction formula is derived when the subspaces satisfy certain cubature conditions, that require at least a quadratic number of subspaces. Moreover, we address reconstruction under the erasure of a subset of the norms; using the concepts of p-fusion frames and list decoding, we propose an algorithm that outputs a finite list of candidate signals, one of which is the correct one. In the random setting, we show that a set of subspaces chosen at random and of cardinality scaling linearly in the ambient dimension allows for exact reconstruction with high probability by solving the feasibility problem of a semidefinite program.", "paper_title": "Signal Reconstruction From the Magnitude of Subspace Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600022"}
