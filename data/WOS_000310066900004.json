The array antenna has an impedance bandwidth ranging from 5.5 to 6.2 GHz for S11 <-10 dB, and the directive gain reaches 18.4 dBi. According to the simulated result, a prototype was fabricated and measured. Good agreement was obtained between the simulated and measured results. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
