This protocol was then used to simulate the interactions of cathepsin L with a series of halogenated and non-halogenated inhibitors. Our results show that chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives have progressively narrower distributions of calculated geometries, which reflects the order of affinity I > Br > Cl, in agreement with the IC50 values. Graphs for the Cl, Br and I analogs show stable interactions between the halogen atom and the Gly61 carbonyl oxygen of the enzyme. The halogen-oxygen distance is close to or less than the sum of the van der Waals radii; the C-X center dot center dot center dot O angle is about 170A degrees; and the X center dot center dot center dot O=C angle approaches 120A degrees, as expected for halogen bond formation. In the case of the iodo-substituted analogs, these effects are enhanced by introduction of a fluorine atom on the inhibitors' halogen-bonding phenyl ring, indicating that the electron withdrawing group enlarges the sigma-hole, resulting in improved halogen bonding properties.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulation of halogen bonding mimics experimental data for cathepsin L inhibition", "paper_id": "WOS:000346913200004"}
