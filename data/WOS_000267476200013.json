Learners often fail to reach their desired learning objects due to the failure of indexing methods to provide them with a ubiquitous learning grid. The aim of this paper is to discuss how knowledge management can be used effectively in e-learning, and how it can provide a learning grid to enable the learner to identify the right learning objects in an environment which is based on the learner's context and personal preferences.
