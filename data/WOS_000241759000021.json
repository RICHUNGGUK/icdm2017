Markov chain is often adopted as the model in the detection systems, in which high-order Markov chain model is well suited for the detection, but as the order of the chain increases, the number of parameters of the model increases exponentially and rapidly becomes too large to be estimated efficiently. In this paper, one-class support vector machines (SVMs) using high-order Markov kernel are adopted as the anomaly detectors. This approach solves the problem of high dimension parameter space. Experiments show that this system can produce good detection performance with low computational overhead.", "paper_title": "High-order Markov kernels for network intrusion detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000021"}
