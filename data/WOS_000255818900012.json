One of the most challenging problems in recognizing characters with hand-held cameras is that captured images undergo motion blur due to the vibration of the hand. Since it is difficult to remove the motion blur from small characters via image restoration, we propose a recognition method without de-blurring. The proposed method includes a generative learning method in the training step to simulate blurred images by controlling blur parameters. The method consists of two steps. The first step recognizes the blurred characters based on the subspace method, and the second one reclassifies structurally similar characters using blur parameters estimated from the camera motion. We have experimentally proved that the effective use of motion blur improves the recognition accuracy of camera-captured characters. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
