We investigate several strategies for the constructive and improvement phases and several choices for critical search parameters. We perform extensive computational experiments with well-known instances which have been previously reported, first to select the best alternatives and then to compare the efficiency of our algorithm with other procedures. The results show that the GRASP algorithm outperforms recently reported metaheuristics. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
