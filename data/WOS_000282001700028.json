Each set is a binary (2(n+1) Z(cz), 2(n), Z(cz))-ZCZ sequence set, which is one of the best cases in the known constructions. 2. Among all the sets, the sequences still possess good cross-correlation property within the zone of length Z <= Z(cz). In particular, the first type sequence sets have a common zero correlation zone of length, which solves the previous research problem. These multiple binary ZCZ sequence sets are suitable for multiuser environments.", "paper_title": "Multiple Binary ZCZ Sequence Sets With Good Cross-Correlation Property Based on Complementary Sequence Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700028"}
