The principle idea is to place a transformation medium around the ridge structure, so that a single and easy-to-generate mesh can be used for each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation. Hence, this approach leads to less computational resources. The technique is validated by means of various finite element simulations in the context of 3D waveguides of uniform cross-section.
