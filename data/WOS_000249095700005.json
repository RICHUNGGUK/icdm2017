Not only HW-SW cosimulation, but also HW-SW codesign methodology involves system specification, functional simulation, design-space exploration, and hardware-software cosynthesis. The PeaCE codesign environment is the first full-fledged HW-SW codesign environment that provides seamless codesign flow from functional simulation to system synthesis. Targeting for multimedia applications with real-time constraints, PeaCE specifies the system behavior with a heterogeneous composition of three models of computation and utilizes features of the formal models maximally during the whole design process. It is also a reconfigurable framework in the sense that third-party design tools can be integrated to build a customized tool chain. Experiments with industry-strength examples prove the viability of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "PeaCE: A hardware-software codesign environment for multimedia embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249095700005"}
