To improve the performance of MPEG video over Internet, the present study modifies the multi-streaming mechanisms of SCTP, which enable SCTP to use network resources efficiently and provide a differential transmission priority for the encoding frame types of MPEG video stream. Furthermore, to further enhance the decodable frame ratio, the present study also modifies the queue management mechanism of RED which enable the modified RED to provide differential stream protection for MPEG video stream. The simulation results presented in this study confirmed that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of MPEG video stream.", "paper_title": "Improving transmission quality of MPEG video stream by SCTP multi-streaming and differential RED mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110300006"}
