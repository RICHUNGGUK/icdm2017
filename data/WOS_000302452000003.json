Furthermore, to solve the problem that present reputation models fail in the condition of open environment without previous exchanging information, i.e. lack of participant's communication and evidence, online social cognition reputation ratings model is offered. Information seeking online is used to achieve the online behaviors for rating and the reputation can be evaluated by social experience in virtual world based on individual and group social cognition according to the definition of online social cognition set in this model. As online social cognition experience is drawled from a sample set of the open system, when a newcomer enter the evaluation set default reasoning is used to guarantee the model's extension. Finally, the reputation rating evaluation in Health Care Products Web site demonstrates the validity of the model and the results also show that group online social cognition is better than individual's.
