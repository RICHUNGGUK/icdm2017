We study probability measures on the set of natural extensions of a causal set, especially those measures having the property of order-invariance: if we condition on the set of the bottom k elements of the natural extension, each feasible ordering among these k elements is equally likely. We give sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an order-invariant measure on the set of natural extensions of a causal set.", "paper_title": "Order-Invariant Measures on Fixed Causal Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000302875400002"}
