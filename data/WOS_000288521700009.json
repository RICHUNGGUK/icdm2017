This way they can facilitate the design of the built environment to cope with emergency events. Modelling and simulation applications can be particularly useful at pre-planning, predicting possible damage, training responders, raising public awareness, and performance evaluation for reconstruction. They can be used for the development of virtual scenarios that include aspects of rescue operations, social behaviour of building occupants, and basic design requirements to test the current building codes and regulations. Within this context, the contribution of crowd simulation to improving the design of the built environment and guidelines is highlighted in this paper. Current building guidance for emergencies are summarised and the methodology developed to use crowd modelling to define design information associated with exit preferences of people during evacuations is explained. The results of the case studies underlined that there is a difference between the assumptions used for static information in current building guidance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
