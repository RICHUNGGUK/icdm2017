The boundary of the shape is explored through finding empty regions recursively within a shell that encapsulates all of the points. Our algorithm is output sensitive and runs in linear O(ln) time determined by the output parameter l, which is proportional to the length of the nonconvex boundary measured by a threshold unit distance. The recursive nature of our algorithm allows a tree structure that characterizes the empty regions, and by complementarity, the nonconvex shape itself. We use a distance measure based on lowest common ancestor of a pair of nodes in this tree and define the complexity of a shape as the average of the distances between all pairs. We present computational results on data size, threshold, shape complexity and noise on a set of different nonconvex shapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
