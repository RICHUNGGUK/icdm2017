Both cost terms are interrelated because a trade-off exists between maintaining pumps frequently (with increased pump efficiency, reduced energy costs and increasing maintenance costs, and pump unavailability) and extending the intervals between the overhauls (increased loss of efficiency, increased energy costs, and decreased maintenance costs). The planner needs to forecast pump overhaul demands to determine budget levels because economic resources are limited. This process is assisted by using mathematical programming methods to prioritize funding for equipment requiring renewal in consideration of limited resources in a strategic time horizon (several years). This work proposes an efficient model to define an overhaul maintenance program for a pump network with a large number of pumps (a few hundred in the case study). The model minimizes the discounted total (energy+overhaul) cost by selecting and scheduling pumps for overhaul subject to budget constraints. The formulation uses 0-1 integer programming.
