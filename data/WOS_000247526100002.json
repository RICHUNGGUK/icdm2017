The fundamental security goal of PAKE is security against dictionary attacks. The protocols for verifier-based PAKE are additionally required to be secure against server compromise. Some verifier-based PAKE schemes in the three-party setting have been suggested to solve the server compromise problem. Unfortunately, the protocols are vulnerable to an off-line dictionary attack. In this paper, we present an efficient verifier-based PAKE protocol for three-parties that is secure against known-key attacks and provides forward secrecy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed protocol is the first secure three-party verifier-based PAKE protocol in the literature. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
