However, it is difficult to consider those abilities systematically in practice. In addition, the current management paradigm undergoes rapid transitions into knowledge management. In step with these trends, this study presents a framework for analyzing the knowledge of the candidates for managers and team members for the new team, and proposes a genetic algorithm and social network measures for choosing a team manager and team members. A prototype was built for testing the feasibility of the model. The testing data are from an R&D institute's human resource management department. The results show that our proposed approach is a quantitative and systematic method for selecting proper personnel for appropriate teams. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
