Whereas little attention has been paid to the architectural aspects of MRP process in academic studies, in practice, reports are often made of its time consuming characteristics due to intensive interactions with databases and difficulty in real time processing. This paper proposes a grid enabled MRP process in a distributed database environment and demonstrates the performance improvement of the proposed process by a simulation study.(C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
