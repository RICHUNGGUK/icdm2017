Our tool uses the National Human Genome Research Institute catalog of associations to generate instrumental variable trait files and provides methods for filtering of potential confounding associations as well as linkage disequilibrium. MeRP generates estimated causal effect scores via a MR-score analysis using summary data for disease endpoints typically found in the public domain. We utilize our pipeline to develop genetic instruments for seven traits and evaluate potential causal relationships with two disease endpoints, observing two putatively causal associations between blood pressure and bone-mineral density with type 2 diabetes. Our tool emphasizes the importance of careful but systematic screening of large datasets for discovery and systematic follow-up.", "paper_title": "MeRP: a high-throughput pipeline for Mendelian randomization analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000352268900021"}
