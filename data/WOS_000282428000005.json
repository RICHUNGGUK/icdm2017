We first show how to solve differential equations on a finite dimensional Riemannian manifold defined implicitly as a submanifold of a parameterized one, which in turn may be a Riemannian submanifold of an infinite dimensional one, using some optimal control techniques. We give an elementary example of the technique on a spherical submanifold of a 3-sphere and then a series of examples on a highly non-linear subspace of the space of closed spline curves, where we have restricted mean curvature motion, Geodesic Active contours and compute geodesic between two curves.", "paper_title": "On Restricting Planar Curve Evolution to Finite Dimensional Implicit Subspaces with Non-Euclidean Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000282428000005"}
