Recently, array processing for fields of DIFAR sonobuoys has attracted considerable attention in order to enhance the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation performance and accuracy. DIFAR sonobuoys may become irregularly spaced due to the deployment method and the drift experienced once deployed, resulting in a nonuniform array. In this paper, we demonstrate the fourth-order cumulant beamforming (FOC-BF) technique to estimate the DOA for a nonuniform linear array of DIFAR sonobuoys. FOC-BF was compared with the conventional beamforming (CBF) through simulation works. The results show that FOC-BF provides better spatial spectrum with lower sidelobes than CBF. Furthermore, FOC-BF provides superior DOA estimation accuracy over CBF at very low signal to noise ratios (SNR). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
