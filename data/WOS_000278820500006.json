We present an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Euler equations describing compressible flow, discretize them in space by the discontinous Galerkin method and introduce a semi-implicit linearized time stepping for the numerical solution of the complete problem. Special attention is paid to the treatment of boundary conditions and the limiting procedure avoiding the Gibbs phenomenon in the vicinity of discontinuities. The presented computational results show the applicability of the developed method. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
