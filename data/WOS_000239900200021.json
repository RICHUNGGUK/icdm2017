Using the principle of linkage through co-citation biologists can mine PubMed with these proteins or genes to identify relationships within a biological field of interest. In addition, PDQ Wizard provides novel features to define more specific relationships, highlight key publications describing those activities and relationships, and enhance protein queries. PDQ Wizard also outputs a metric that can be used for prioritization of genes and proteins for further research.", "paper_title": "PDQ Wizard: automated prioritization and characterization of gene and protein lists using biomedical literature", "paper_id": "WOS:000239900200021"}
