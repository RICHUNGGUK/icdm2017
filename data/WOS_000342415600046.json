In this paper, lower bounds on the partial Hamming correlation of FHSs and FHS sets are proposed. They slightly improve the known bounds by Eun et al. and Zhou et al. A construction of FHSs and FHS sets having optimal partial Hamming correlation with respect to the improved bounds is also presented based on the theory of generalized cyclotomy. Our construction yields optimal FHSs and FHS sets with new and flexible parameters not covered in this paper.", "paper_title": "A New Construction of Frequency-Hopping Sequences With Optimal Partial Hamming Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600046"}
