This effect can be easily detected by statistics methods. To defend this forensic method, we establish a model to evaluate the security and image quality influenced by the re-compression. Base on the model, an optimized adjustment of the DCT coefficients is achieved by Genetic Algorithm. Results show that the traces of double compression are removed while preserving image quality.", "paper_title": "A Countermeasure against Double Compression Based Image Forensic", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700026"}
