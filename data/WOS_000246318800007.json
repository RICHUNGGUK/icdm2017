The efficiency of these approaches depends on the quality of the state-space exploration, which may be inefficient due to a crude choice of the function used to sample in the associated probability space. A careful study of this issue led us to consider the modeling of the tracked dynamic system with partial linear Gaussian models. Such models are characterized by a non linear dynamic equation, a linear measurement equation and additive Gaussian noises. They allow inferring an analytic expression of the optimal importance function used in the diffusion process of the particle filter, and enable building a relevant approximation of a validation gate. Despite of these potential advantages partial linear Gaussian models have not been investigated. The aim of this paper is therefore to demonstrate that such models can be of real interest facing difficult usual issues such as occlusions, ambiguities due to cluttered backgrounds and large state space. Three instances of these models are proposed. After a theoretical analysis, their significance is demonstrated by their performance for tracking points and planar objects in challenging real-world image sequences.", "paper_title": "Partial linear Gaussian models for tracking in image sequences using Sequential Monte Carlo methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000246318800007"}
