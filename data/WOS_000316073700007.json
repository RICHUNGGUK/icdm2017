T is called a locally connected spanning tree of G if for every vertex of T, the set of all its neighbors in T induces a connected subgraph of G. In this paper, given an intersection model of a circular-arc graph, an O(n)-time algorithm is proposed that can determine whether the circular-arc graph contains a locally connected spanning tree or not, and produce one if it exists.", "paper_title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm for Finding Locally Connected Spanning Trees on Circular-Arc Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316073700007"}
