We show that if is large then there are at least ordinary lines, that is to say lines passing through exactly two points of . This confirms, for large , a conjecture of Dirac and Motzkin. In fact we describe the exact extremisers for this problem, as well as all sets having fewer than ordinary lines for some absolute constant . We also solve, for large , the \"orchard-planting problem\", which asks for the maximum number of lines through exactly 3 points of . Underlying these results is a structure theorem which states that if has at most ordinary lines then all but O(K) points of lie on a cubic curve, if is sufficiently large depending on K.", "paper_title": "On Sets Defining Few Ordinary Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000323105900006"}
