In this context, availability to care givers of all relevant patient health data and of specific healthcare co-operative work supporting tools is fundamental for best patient treatment. We designed and implemented He@lthCo-op, a web-based modular system supporting co-operative work and patient information secure sharing among healthcare personnel also from remotely located sites. He@lthCo-op enables easily gathering, storing, and accessing patient clinical and personal data anytime and from anywhere an Internet connection is available. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
