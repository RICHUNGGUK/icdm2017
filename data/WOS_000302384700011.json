Design/methodology/approach - An inverse problem has been dealt with. A 2D numerical analysis has been performed, which utilizes as a starting point a model identified with a simple analytical procedure based on measurements. Findings - A satisfactory equivalent model has been identified, and validated in several different conditions. Originality/value - The proposed approach can be applied when no detailed information of the source is available, in the case of a cathode without a ferromagnetic yoke.", "paper_title": "Identification of an equivalent model for the permanent magnets of a magnetron sputtering device", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700011"}
