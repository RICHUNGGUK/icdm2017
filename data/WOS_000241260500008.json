Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of literature survey authors discuss several important aspects of managing successful outsourcing relationship. Findings - Holistic perception of business processes and expertise on critical success factors in transformational outsourcing become increasingly important. For a collaboration in which the process of transformational outsourcing will prosper participants must be interdependent (and be aware of their interdependence) and have a long-termed strategic interest to cooperate. Originality/value - Introduced insight is important for understanding the long-term outsourcing partnership, and to recognize possible opportunistic behaviour and be able to avoid it.", "paper_title": "Cooperation and opportunistic behaviour in transformational outsourcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500008"}
