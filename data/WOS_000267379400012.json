Recent research on mobility has focused on two main points: analyzing models and studying their impact on data transport. These works investigate the consequences of mobility. In this paper, instead, we focus on the causes of mobility. Starting from established research in sociology, we propose SIMPS, a mobility model of human crowds with pedestrian motion. This model defines a process called sociostation, rendered by two complimentary behaviors, namely socialize and isolate, that regulate an individual with regard to her/his own sociability level. SIMPS leads to results that agree with scaling laws observed both in small-scale and large-scale human motion. Although our model defines only two simple individual behaviors, we observe many emerging collective behaviors (group formation/splitting, path formation, and evolution).", "paper_title": "SIMPS: Using Sociology for Personal Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000267379400012"}
