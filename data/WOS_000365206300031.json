In this brief, we propose a novel field programmable gate arrays design of matrix-vector multiplier that can be used to efficiently implement widely adopted iterative methods. The proposed design exploits the sparse structure of the matrix as well as the fact that spreading code matrices have equal magnitude entries. Implementation details and timing analysis results are promising and are shown to satisfy most modern communication system requirements.", "paper_title": "Design and Low-Complexity Implementation of Matrix-Vector Multiplier for Iterative Methods in Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300031"}
