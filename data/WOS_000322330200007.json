One of the performance measures for a successful application deployment is the ability to support application-data flows by heterogeneous networks within certain delay boundaries. However, the quantitative impact of this measure is unknown and practically infeasible to determine at real time due to the mobile device resource constraints. We research practical methods for measurement-based performance evaluation of heterogeneous data communication networks that support mobile application-data flows. We apply the lightweight Comparative Output-Input Analysis (COIA) method estimating an additional delay based on an observation interval of interest (e. g., 1 second) induced on the flow. An additional delay is the amount of delay that exceeds nonavoidable, minimal end-to-end delay caused by the networks propagation, serialization, and transmission. We propose five COIA methods to estimate additional delay, and we validate their accuracy with measurements obtained from the existing healthcare and multimedia streaming applications. Despite their simplicity, our methods prove to be accurate in relation to an observation interval of interest, and robust under a variety of network conditions. The methods offer novel insights into application-data delays with regards to the performance of heterogeneous data communication networks.", "paper_title": "Estimating Performance of Mobile Services from Comparative Output-Input Analysis of End-to-End Throughput", "paper_id": "WOS:000322330200007"}
