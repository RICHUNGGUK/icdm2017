These resources are usually allocated optimally through the generation of schedules. In this paper, variants of a differential evolution-based algorithm are employed to schedule flexible assembly lines (FAL). The performance of the assembly line is optimized based on two performance criteria, namely the weighted sum of Earliness/Tardiness penalties and the balance of the assembly line. Different variants of the Bi-level differential evolution (BiDE) algorithms are developed to study the effects of three FAL problems. The parameters of BiDE algorithm for FAL problems are fine-tuned. The performance of the BiDE algorithm is evaluated using the datasets and the Bi-level Genetic Algorithm (BiGA) available in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed differential evolution-based algorithm outperforms BiGA in terms of mean best fitness.", "paper_title": "Differential evolution variants to schedule flexible assembly lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000339375400007"}
