A new possibilistic mean-variance model to portfolio selection is proposed based on the definitions of the possibilistic return and possibilistic risk, which can better integrate an uncertain decision environment with vagueness and ambiguity. This possibilistic mean-variance model can be regarded as extensions of conventional probabilistic mean-variance methodology and previous possibilistic approaches since it contains less parameter and has a more extensive application. A numerical example of a possibilistic fuzzy portfolio selection problem is given to illustrate our proposed effective means and approaches.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy portfolio selection method based on possibilistic mean and variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702500010"}
