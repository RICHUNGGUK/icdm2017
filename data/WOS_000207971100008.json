In this paper, our primary goal is to acquire users' structural properties in mobile call networks. We take a novel perspective-structure correlation between two connected users perspective to study the structural properties. To investigate the structural properties in static and dynamic mobile call networks, we define some metrics which are based on the clique size vectors of mobile call users. By exploring several real-world mobile call networks, which contain hundreds of thousands of mobile call users respectively, we find that people tend to communicate with the one who has a similar structure in static mobile call networks. Moreover, It is found that the connected people have similar structural changes on the whole in dynamic mobile call networks, and the structures of some two connected persons both have growing or shrinking trends. We use a visualization toolkit to give a view of the growing or shrinking scenarios temporally.", "paper_title": "Correlation in mobile call networks from structure perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100008"}
