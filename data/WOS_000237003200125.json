To reduce its complexity, hierarchical radiosity decomposes the scene into a hierarchy of patches and computes the light exchanged between patches at different levels, according to their distance and/or to the amount of light they emit. A distributed memory implementation of this method has been developed through PIT, a problem independent library that supports hierarchical applications on distributed memory architectures. PIT functions exploit a distributed version of the tree representing the hierarchical decomposition.", "paper_title": "Parallel hierarchical radiosity: The PIT approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200125"}
