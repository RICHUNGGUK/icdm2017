In the proposed approach, the document structure recognition problem is divided into sub-problems. The first one is localizing logical structure elements within the document. The second one is recognizing segmented logical structure elements. The input to the method is an image of document page, the output is the XML file containing all graphic and textual elements included in the document, preserving the reading order of document blocks. This file contains information about the identity and position of all logical elements in the document image. The paper describes all details of the proposed method and shows the results of the experiments validating its effectiveness. The results of the proposed method for paragraph structure recognition are comparable to the referenced methods which offer segmentation only.", "paper_title": "Image-based logical document structure recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000358217600013"}
