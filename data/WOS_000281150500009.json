This is closely associated with some open problems formulated recently by Yang et al. Using Timofte's dimension-decreasing method for symmetric polynomial inequalities, combined with the inequality-proving package BOTTEMA and a program of implementing the method known as successive difference substitution, we provide a procedure for deciding the nonnegativity of the corresponding polynomial inequality such that the original integral inequality is mechanically decidable; otherwise, a counterexample will be given. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by some more examples.", "paper_title": "Mechanical decision for a class of integral inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500009"}
