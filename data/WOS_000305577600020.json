Using tensor voting, depth hypotheses from different focus operators are validated based on their likelihood to be part of a coherent 3-D surface, thereby exploiting scene geometry and focus information to generate reliable depth estimates. The proposed method is fast and yields significantly better results compared with existing SFF methods.", "paper_title": "Shape-From-Focus by Tensor Voting", "paper_id": "WOS:000305577600020"}
