Also, we prove that this sequence can be modified to form the sequence of lower bounds that are asymptotically sharp for the zero moduli. In particular, we show that obtaining the sequence of lower bounds with our algorithm effectively avoids the numeric overflow that might happen in other similar approach. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our work.", "paper_title": "A fixed-point approach to locating polynomial zeros", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700500018"}
