Mixer-settlers typically contain an impeller mounted on a shaft, and optionally can contain baffles. The hydrodynamic characteristics of mixer-settlers have been studied in the present study. The effect of different geometrical parameters on the efficiency characteristics of the system has been investigated. The effects of different width of impellers, impeller speed, inlet velocity, impeller diameter, etc. have been studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed to predict the efficiency characteristics. The model has been validated with the help of experimental data for different velocity outlets used in the work. This work has enabled developing efficiency that can produce higher condition than those reported in previous literature. From the CFD simulations results, optimum mixer-settler geometry has been proposed.", "paper_title": "Fluid flow characterization of liquid-liquid mixing in mixer-settler", "paper_id": "WOS:000295170100006"}
