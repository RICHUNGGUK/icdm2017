To this end, channel and communication primitives are firstly defined in MSVL. Further, based on these definitions, a mapping function F which transforms bounded p-p processes into MSVL programs is formalized. Moreover, the soundness of the transformation is proved. By the transformation, p-p can provide a mechanism to model, simulate and verify concurrent time-dependent systems by means of the techniques of MSVL. Finally, a case study is given to illustrate how the transformation can be used in practice.", "paper_title": "A structural transformation from p-pi to MSVL", "paper_id": "WOS:000350684400019"}
