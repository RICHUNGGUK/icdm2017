MPWM captures the interaction between syntactic and semantic processes in reasoning, and so it also technically supports the new mental metalogic theory which studies the bridging relations between two major competing theories in the field, mental logic and mental models, whose accounts are also discussed. An empirical study of MPWM is also given.", "paper_title": "The mental possible worlds mechanism and the lobster problem: an analysis of a complex GRE logical reasoning task", "paper_id": "WOS:000239427300004"}
