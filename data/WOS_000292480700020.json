The FVS has applications to several areas such that combinatorial circuit design, synchronous systems, computer systems, VLSI circuits and so on. The FVS problem is known to be NP-hard on general graphs but interesting polynomial solutions have been found for some special classes of graphs. In this paper, we present an 0(n(2.68) + gamma n) time algorithm for solving the FVS problem on trapezoid graphs, where gamma is the total number of factors included in all maximal cliques.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for Minimum Feedback Vertex Set Problem on a Trapezoid Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700020"}
