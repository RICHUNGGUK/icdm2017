The alignment rule set was created using AntMiner+, a rule induction technique with a reputation of inducing accurate, comprehensible, and intuitive predictive models from data. Our data set consisted of 18 alignment practices distilled from an analysis of relevant publications and validated by a Delphi panel of experts. The goal of our study was to describe practical guidelines for managers in obtaining better alignment of ICT investments with business requirements. Our obtained rule set showed the multi-disciplinary nature of B/ICT alignment. We discuss implication of the alignment rules for practitioners. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
