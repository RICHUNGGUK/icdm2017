Feature evaluation functions play essential roles in constructing feature selection algorithms. This paper introduces a new notion of knowledge granularity, called conditional knowledge granularity, reflecting relationship between conditional attributes and decision attribute. An evaluation function to measure significance of conditional attributes is proposed and equivalent characterization of attribute reduction is established based on the conditional knowledge granularity. An optimal algorithm for feature selection is developed on the basis of the proposed evaluation function. Furthermore, a novel approach to performing feature selection in an inconsistent decision system is put forward through establishing a rough communication between the inconsistent decision system and a consistent decision system. Simulated experiments verifies feasibility and efficiency of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Feature Selection in Decision Systems Based on Conditional Knowledge Granularity", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000021"}
