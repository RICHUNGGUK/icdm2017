We first demonstrate that there exists a hyperbolic quadric that contains S(m)(2) and is invariant under its projective stabiliser group G(S(m))(2). By embedding PG(2(m) -1, 2) into PG(2(m) -1, 4), a basis of the latter space is constructed that is invariant under G(S(m))(2) as well. Such a basis can be split into two subsets whose spans are either real or complex-conjugate subspaces according as m is even or odd. In the latter case, these spans can, in addition, be viewed as indicator sets of a G(S(m))(2)-invariant geometric spread of lines of PG(2(m) -1, 2). This spread is also related with a G(S(m))(2)-invariant non-singular Hermitian variety. The case m = 3 is examined in detail to illustrate the theory. Here, the lines of the invariant spread are found to fall into four distinct orbits under G(S(3))(2), while the points of PG(7, 2) form five orbits.", "paper_title": "On invariant notions of Segre varieties in binary projective spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000300321900009"}
