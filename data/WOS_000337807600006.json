We propose a scheme to enhance the cooling of optomechanical oscillator by introducing atomic medium. Our results show that the existence of the atom can lead to a lower effective temperature of mechanical oscillator comparing to the case without atom. The coherence of the injected atomic affects the population of the photon, which can lead to the change in the radiation pressure on the movable mirror. We also show that the cooling of the mechanical oscillator is affected by initial state of inserting atom.", "paper_title": "Enhanced cooling of micromechanical oscillator in the atom-assisted optomechanical cavity", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807600006"}
