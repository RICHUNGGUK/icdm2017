Though graph theoretical algorithms are available, the purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility of ant systems (AS). Design/methodology/approach - For hand optimization an ant colony algorithm based on AS is utilized. In this algorithm a local search procedure is also included to improve the solution. Findings - AS algorithms are found to be suitable for bandwidth optimization. Originality/value - Application of AS to the bandwidth reduction is the main purpose of this paper, which is successfully performed. The results are compared to those of a graph theoretical bandwidth optimization algorithm.", "paper_title": "Nodal ordering for bandwidth reduction using ant system algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000267477500006"}
