Design/methodology/approach - The method converts the nonlinear integral equation into a system of nonlinear equations. By solving the system, the solution can be determined. Comparing the methodology with some known techniques shows that the present approach is simple, easy to use, and highly accurate. Findings - The proposed technique allows the authors to obtain an approximate solution in a series form. Test problems are given to illustrate the pertinent features of the method. The accuracy of the numerical results indicates that the technique is efficient and well-suited for solving nonlinear integral equations. Originality/value - The present approach provides a reliable technique that avoids the difficulties and massive computational work if compared with the traditional techniques and does not require discretization in order to find solutions to the given problems.", "paper_title": "A Taylor expansion approach using Faa di Bruno's formula for solving nonlinear integral equations of the second and third kind", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400014"}
