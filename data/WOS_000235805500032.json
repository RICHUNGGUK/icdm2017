The simpler of these algorithms merges two sorted sequences of length n in time 4n with energetic cost for each station approximate to lg n. The energetic cost of broadcasting is constant. This yields the merge-sort for n elements in time 2n lg n, where the energetic cost for each station is 1/2 lg(2) n + 7/2 lg n (the energetic cost of broadcasting is only 2 lg n), which seems to be suitable for practical applications due to its simplicity and low constants. We also present algorithm for merging in time O(n lg* n) with energetic cost O(lg* n).", "paper_title": "Merging and merge-sort in a single hop radio network", "paper_id": "WOS:000235805500032"}
