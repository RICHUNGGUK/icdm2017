Since nanomedicine involves complex and massive data analysis and management, a new discipline named nanoinformatics is now emerging to provide the vision and the informatics methods and tools needed for such purposes. Methods from biomedical informatics may prove applicable with some adaptation despite nanomedicine involving different biophysical and biochemical characteristics of nanomaterials and corresponding differences in information complexity. Objectives: We analyze recent initiatives and opportunities for research in nanomedicine and nanoinformatics as well as the previous experience of the authors, particularly in the context of a European project named ACTION-Grid. In this project the authors aimed to create a collaborative environment in biomedical and nanomedical research among countries in Europe, Western Balkans, Latin America, North Africa and the USA. Methods: We review and analyze the rationale and scientific issues behind the new fields of nanomedicine and nanoinformatics. Such a review is linked to actual research projects and achievements of the authors within their groups. Results: The work of the authors at the intersection between these two areas is presented. We also analyze several research initiatives that have recently emerged in the EU and USA context and highlight some ideas for future action at the international level. Conclusions: Nanoinformatics aims to build new bridges between medicine, nanotechnology and informatics, allowing the application of computational methods in the nano-related areas. Opportunities for world-wide collaboration are already emerging and will be influential in advancing the field.", "paper_title": "International Efforts in Nanoinformatics Research Applied to Nanomedicine", "paper_id": "WOS:000286799500010"}
