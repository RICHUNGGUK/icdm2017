Sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure both global regularity and controllability in these uncertain systems. The conditions also provide the explicit relationships of bounds on parametric uncertainties to achieve regularity and controllability. One numerical and two engineering examples are given to illustrate the applications of the proposed sufficient conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
