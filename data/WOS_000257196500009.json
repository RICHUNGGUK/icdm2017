The PEs have small area, can be combined with components that use low operational voltage on the same CMOS logic process, are non-volatile, enable the use of fast thin-oxide pass transistors, and are reprogrammable. A novel non-volatile flip-flop for use within the logical elements is presented as well. In combination, these methods enable programmable logic devices with improved area efficiency, the speed advantages of SRAM-based FPGAs, and a wide range of opportunities for power down strategies.", "paper_title": "New non-volatile memory structures for FPGA architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500009"}
