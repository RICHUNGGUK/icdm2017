The corresponding equations are rewritten in terms of new variables adapted for numerical studies. In particular, the numerical scheme preserves the dynamics of solitary waves. Some numerical results are shown and compared to exact and/or experimental ones in different and significant configurations. A dam-break problem and an impact problem where a liquid cylinder is falling to a rigid wall are solved numerically. This last configuration is also compared with experiments leading to a good qualitative agreement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
