The traditional immersive VR system usually separates the users from the real environment and mainly provides CC-generated space. Recently an alternative approach is through Mixed Reality, which allows user to manipulate objects in a combined environment of the real world objects and virtual space. We propose a framework of shared mixed reality environment to show a real world object with a stereo view and natural operating interface for the separated users. In this paper we mainly describe the sketch of the system and the structure of each functional part and their implementation approaches.", "paper_title": "A framework of collaborative workspace based on multi-stereo vision and shared mixed reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300142"}
