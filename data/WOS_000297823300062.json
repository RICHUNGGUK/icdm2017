First, four common defect types of XLPE power cable joints are established, and a commercial PD detector is used to measure the PD signal by inductive sensor (L-sensor). Next, the feature parameters of fractal theory (fractal dimension and lacunarity) are extracted from the 3D PD patterns. Finally, the matter-element models of the PD defect types are built. The PD defect types can be directly identified by the degree of correlation between the tested pattern and the matter-element based on the extension method. The extension method needs representative features to define the interval of the matter-element. In order to enhance the extension performance, we add fractal features that are extracted from the PD 3D patterns. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the extension method with fractal feature enhancement, the identification ability is investigated on 120 sets of field-tested PD patterns of XLPE power cable joints. Compared with the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method, the results show that the extension method with fractal feature enhancement not only has high recognition accuracy and good tolerance when random noise is added, but that it also provides fast recognition speed.
