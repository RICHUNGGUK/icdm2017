Since it is recognized as a precision process, optimization of different aspects related to dimensional accuracy is a classic research topic. The so-called taper-cutting involves the generation of inclined ruled surfaces, and it is especially important in the manufacturing of tooling requiring draft angles. In this paper a computer simulation software for the analysis of error in wire EDM taper-cutting is presented. The software is based on previous research work, but it includes the effect of friction to model adequately the cutting of large angles. Experimental tests have been carried out to establish the limits of application of the software, and the results compared with those obtained by the classical trial-and-error method. Although this latter approach is more precise, computer simulation dramatically reduces experimental work and the degree of accuracy can be acceptable for many applications, one of which is presented in the current paper.", "paper_title": "Computer simulation of wire-EDM taper-cutting", "paper_id": "WOS:000239182100007"}
