We develop a probabilistic hypergraph model of residue relationships that generalizes traditional pairwise contact potentials to account for the statistics of multi-residue interactions. Using this model, we detected non-random associations in protein families and in the protein database. We also use this model in optimizing site-directed recombination experiments to preserve significant interactions and thereby increase the frequency of generating useful recombinants. We formulate the optimization as a sequentially-constrained hypergraph partitioning problem; the quality of recombinant libraries wrt a set of breakpoints is characterized by the total perturbation to edge weights. We prove this problem to be NP-hard in general, but develop exact and heuristic polynomial-time algorithms for a number of important cases. Application to the beta-lactamase family demonstrates the utility of our algorithms in planning site-directed recombination.", "paper_title": "Hypergraph model of multi-residue interactions in proteins: Sequentially-constrained partitioning algorithms for optimization of site-directed protein recombination", "paper_id": "WOS:000236991800002"}
