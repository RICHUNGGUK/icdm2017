A general result of asymptotic optimality for the plug-in bandwidth is presented, that is valid for the hazard function, as well as for the density and distribution functions. In a simulation study, this method is compared with the \"leave more than one out\" cross-validation criterion under dependence. Simulations show that smaller errors and much less sample variability can be reached, and that a good selection of the pilot bandwidth can be done by means of \"leave one out\" cross-validation. Finally, an application to an earthquake data set is made. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
