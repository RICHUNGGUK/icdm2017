We present our context-aware cross-layer (CACL) broadcast model as an alternative. The basic CACL model uses only contextual data available to the 802.11 MAC and so is usable by any routing protocol that uses the 802.11 MAC. CACL fits the total broadcasts in any two-hop neighborhood to wireless channel capacity. We compare collision rates for CACL and the 802.11 MAC and conclude that, for a wide range of network conditions, CACL offers superior single-hop transmission rates. We also present a geographically constrained extension to CACL, CACL-G and compare it against CACL in vehicular scenarios of varying node density. Our results show that CACL-G offers increasingly superior performance over the basic CACL model as node density increases.", "paper_title": "A context-aware cross-layer broadcast model for ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333341000011"}
