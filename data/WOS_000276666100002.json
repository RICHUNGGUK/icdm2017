Three different approaches, namely analytical, neural network (NN)-based and fuzzy logic (FL)-based, have been developed to solve the said problem. The former deals with the analytical modeling of the ditch-crossing gait of a biped robot, whereas the latter two approaches aim to maximize the dynamic balance margin of the robot and minimize the power consumption during locomotion, after satisfying a constraint stating that the changes of joint torques should lie within a pre-specified value to ensure its smooth walking. It is to be noted that the power consumption and dynamic balance of the robot are also dependent on the position of the masses on various links and the trajectory followed by the hip joint. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to provide training off-line, to the NN-based and FL-based gait planners developed. Once optimized, the planners will be able to generate the optimal gaits on-line. Both the NN-based and FL-based gait planners are able to generate more balanced gaits and that, too, at the cost of lower power consumption compared to those yielded by the analytical approach. The NN-based and FL-based approaches are found to be more adaptive compared to the other approach in generating the gaits of the biped robot. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
