The leader node is modeled as a higher order nonautonomous nonlinear system. It acts as a command generator giving commands only to a small portion of the networked group. Each follower is assumed to have nonidentical unknown nonlinear dynamics, and the communication network is also assumed to be a weighted directed graph with a fixed topology. A distributed robust adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for each follower node such that the tracking errors are cooperative uniform ultimate boundedness (CUUB). Moreover, these controllers are distributed in the sense that the controller designed for each follower node only requires relative state information between itself and its neighbors. The adaptive compensation term of the optimal approximation errors and external disturbances is adopted to reduce the effects of the errors and disturbances, which removes the assumption that the upper bounds of unknown function approximation errors and disturbances should be known. Analysis of stability and parameter convergence of the proposed algorithm are conducted that are based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory. Comparing with results in the literature, the CAFTFTC scheme can minimize the time delay between fault occurrence and accommodation and reduce its adverse effect on system performance. In addition, the FTC scheme requires no additional fault isolation model, which is necessary in the traditional active FTC scheme. Finally, an example is provided to validate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Networked Unknown Nonlinear Multiagent Systems With Time-Varying Actuator Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000337128900003"}
