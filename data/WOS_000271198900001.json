In Matousek and Skovron (Theory Comput. 3: 159-177, 2007), it is proved that in order to remove degeneracies of an LP-type problem, we sometimes have to increase its combinatorial dimension by a multiplicative factor of at least 1 + epsilon with a certain small positive constant epsilon. The proof goes by checking the unsolvability of a system of linear inequalities, with several pages of calculations. Here by a short topological argument we prove that the dimension sometimes has to increase at least twice. We also construct 2-dimensional LP-type problems with -infinity for which removing degeneracies forces arbitrarily large dimension increase.", "paper_title": "Removing Degeneracy in LP-Type Problems Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000271198900001"}
