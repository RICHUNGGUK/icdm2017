Our criterion applies also to a wide variety of logics outside the realm of normal modal logic. We give extensive example instantiations of our framework to various conditional logics. For these, we obtain fully internalised calculi which are substantially simpler than those known in the literature, along with leaner proofs of cut elimination and complexity. In one case, conditional logic with modus ponens and conditional excluded middle, cut elimination and complexity were explicitly stated as open in the literature.", "paper_title": "GENERIC MODAL CUT ELIMINATION APPLIED TO CONDITIONAL LOGICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290278900003"}
