The WSS is designed specifically for diagnostic bridge monitoring, providing independent conditioning for accelerometers, strain transducers, and temperature sensors in addition to high-rate wireless data transmission and is capable of supporting large-scale sensor arrays. A three-span simply supported structure was subjected to diagnostic load testing as well as ambient vibration monitoring. A total of 90 wireless and several wired sensors, including accelerometers and strain transducers were used in the deployment. Strain measurements provided capacity and demand characteristics of the structure in the form of neutral axis locations, load distributions, and dynamic allowances which ultimately produced an inventory and operating load rating for the structure. Additionally, modal characteristics of the structure, including natural frequencies and mode shapes, were derived from measured accelerations and discussed briefly.", "paper_title": "Wireless Monitoring of a Multispan Bridge Superstructure for Diagnostic Load Testing and System Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000293703600007"}
