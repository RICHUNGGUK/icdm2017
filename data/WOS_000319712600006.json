The disparity between the bandwidth offered by a wavelength and the bandwidth requirement of a multicast connection can be tackled by grooming multiple low bandwidth multicast connections into a high bandwidth wavelength channel or light-tree. Light-trees are known to be especially suited for networks that carry ample multicast traffic. In this paper, we propose new algorithms to address the problem of multicast traffic grooming. In particular, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is proposed for optimal assignments of hop constrained light-trees for multicast connections so that network throughput can be maximized. Hop constrained light-trees improve the scalability of the approach by reducing the search space of the ILP formulation. Since solving the ILP problem is very time consuming for realistically large networks, we are motivated to propose a heuristic algorithm with a polynomial complexity, called Dividable Light-Tree Grooming (DLTG) algorithm. This algorithm is based on grooming traffic to constrained light-trees and also divides a light-tree to smaller constrained light-trees on which traffic is groomed for better resource utilization. Simulations show that the proposed DLTG heuristic performs better than other algorithms. It achieves network throughputs which are very close to the ILP formulation results, but with far lower running times. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
