Previously, this problem has been formulated as a single-objective optimization problem, in which the objective is to minimize the total number of clients that are without QoS. This approach may cause considerable network traffic and processing overhead, as a large number of zones may need to be migrated across servers. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective approach to the zone mapping problem, in which both the total number of clients without QoS and the migration overhead are considered. To this end, we have proposed several new algorithms based on meta-heuristics such as local search and multi-objective evolutionary optimization techniques. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted with realistic network latency data modeled after actual Internet measurements, and different workload distribution settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
