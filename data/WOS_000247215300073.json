The discrimination is performed by a model of optic tectum that uses monocular vision to extract image size and rate of expansion. Nucleus isthmi which is reciprocally interconnected with tectum, is modeled to estimate object proximity and to scale image size to obtain object size, which if large enough interrupts approach by triggering avoidance.
