The state equation at the finest scale is known, and the measurement equations at J scales are also known. There is one sensor distributed at each scale, and the sampling rate of which decreases by a factor of M. M-band wavelet transform is used to build the state space projection equation, and a new state space model that satisfies Kalman filtering condition is derived. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation results are given to obtain insight into the efficiencies offered by our model and algorithm.", "paper_title": "Modeling and fusion estimation of dynamic multiscale system based on M-band wavelet and state space projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400121"}
