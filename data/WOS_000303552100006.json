In previous work an algorithm has been developed to determine the globally optimal solution of the cyclic scheduling problem. The obtained optimal schedule is modeled in a max-plus algebraic framework. The max-plus algebraic model can then be used to generate appropriate control actions to handle unexpected deviations from the predetermined cyclic operation during runtime. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
