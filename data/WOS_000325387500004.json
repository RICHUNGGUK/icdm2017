Objective: The main aim of this paper is to propose a novel model, AiOLoS, for assessing the level and characteristics of organizational learning (OL) in SDOs. Method: The primary contributions of this two-legged AiOLoS model are the identification of the major process areas and the core processes that a learning software organization (LSO) follows during its OL process and to provide the necessary measures and the corresponding definitions/interpretations for the assessment of the learning characteristics of the SDO. The research is supported with a multiple case-study work to identify the mapping of the core processes and the applicability of the AiOLoS model to SDOs, its utilization as a tool for assessing OL and providing a basis for software process improvement (SPI). Results: The case studies have shown that not only the AiOLoS measures are applicable to SDOs but also that they measure in great extent the actual OL that is realized in the organization and that the major process areas and core processes are actually related to the OL process of SDOs. Conclusion: AiOLoS has been designed to provide a starting point for the enhancement of OL capabilities of SDOs, which in turn should provide a basis to conduct SPI activities. Therefore, it is also important to investigate a possible binding of AiOLoS to SPICE and the inclusion of a maturity dimension to AiOLoS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
