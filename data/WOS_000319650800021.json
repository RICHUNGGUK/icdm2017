TRAPP performs accurate grid-based calculations of the shape and physicochemical characteristics of a binding pocket for each structure and detects the conserved and transient regions of the pocket in an ensemble of protein conformations. It also provides tools for tracing the opening of a particular subpocket and residues that contribute to the binding site. TRAPP thus enables an assessment of the druggability of a disease-related target protein taking its flexibility into account.", "paper_title": "TRAPP: A Tool for Analysis of Transient Binding Pockets in Proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000319650800021"}
