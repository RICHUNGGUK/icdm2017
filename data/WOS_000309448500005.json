Taking as a basis a location update scheme, based on the definition of an adaptive macro-location area, adapted to the mobility pattern of the terminals, we characterize the residence probabilities in each location area of a generic macro-area. With this information, we propose and evaluate different sequential group paging strategies, also taking into account their computational cost. Results show the suitability of some of the proposals (semiadaptive and hybrid schemes) and its applicability to new packet-based broadband cellular systems.
