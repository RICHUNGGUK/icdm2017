This paper presents a design of a dispensing system for microdrops generation operated in a drop-on-demand mode using a non-contact liquid transfer method. Unlike existing methods for droplets generation, which operate in an open-loop, this system operates in a closed-loop manner. Therefore, the system can potentially generate droplets with very high accuracy up to several picoliters in order to generate very high-density microarrays. Detailed finite element analysis is used to optimize the design, assess the performance of the system, and define suitable operating parameters. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
