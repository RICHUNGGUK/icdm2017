To generate this organization, we explored a wiring rule in which the establishment of a connection between two areas depended on the areas' distance as well as their respective time windows for connection establishment. The concept of time windows was based on the observation that the development of cortical areas partially overlaps in time. Our algorithm was able to generate multiple network clusters depending on the number and overlap of the time windows. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
