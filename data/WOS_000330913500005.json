To make such theories applicable throughout the entire design process from an abstract specification to an implementation, we need to reason about the possibility to effectively implement the theoretical specifications on physical systems, despite their limited precision. In the literature, this implementation problem has been linked to the robustness problem that analyzes the consequences of introducing small perturbations into formal models. We address this problem of robust implementations in timed specification theories. We first consider a fixed perturbation and study the robustness of timed specifications with respect to the operators of the theory. To this end we synthesize robust strategies in timed games. Finally, we consider the parametric robustness problem and propose a counterexample refinement heuristic for computing safe perturbation values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
