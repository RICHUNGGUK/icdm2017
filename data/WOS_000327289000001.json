Optical networks are ideal substrates for provisioning high-bandwidth virtual-network services. In this study, we investigate the problem of network virtualization over both WDM and flexible-grid optical networks by formulating the problems as mixed integer linear programs (MILP). Two heuristics, namely MaxMapping and MinMapping, are developed for each kind of network to solve the problem quickly but suboptimally. Numerical examples show that MinMapping consumes fewer spectrum resources than MaxMapping and performs very close to the optimal results derived by the MILP in both kinds of optical networks, by exploring the opportunities of traffic grooming. Also, it is verified that flexible-grid optical networks can be more spectrum efficient than WDM networks as the substrate for network virtualization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
