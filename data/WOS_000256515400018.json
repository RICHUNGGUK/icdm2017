A benzenoid graph G is elementary if every edge belongs to a 1-factor of G. The vertex set of the resonance graph of a benzenoid graph G consists of 1-factors of G, two 1-factors being adjacent whenever their symmetric difference forms the edge set of a hexagon of G. The resonance graphs of benzenoid graphs are partial cubes (as well as median graphs). The tau-graph G(T) of a partial cube G has the equivalence classes of the Djokovic-Winkler relation theta as vertices, two classes E and F being adjacent if some edges e epsilon E and f epsilon F induce a convex P(3). We show a new characterization of elementary benzenoid graphs based on 4-tiling. We also present a decomposition theorem for the resonance graph of a benzenoid graph without a coronene. Moreover, we show that the tau-graph of the resonance graph of a benzenoid graph without a coronene is closely related to 4-tiling.", "paper_title": "On elementary benzenoid graphs: new characterization and structure of their resonance graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256515400018"}
