In this paper, first, we review the calculation of such parameters and then present the GGMCalc software, which is prepared in Fortran 95 under GNU/Linux Operating System. This software is capable of using the files presented by the International Center for Global Earth Models (ICGEM) directly without need to apply any changes on them. The software is completely structural and user friendly and could be used conveniently for academic purposes.", "paper_title": "GGMCalc a software for calculation of the geoid undulation and the height anomaly using the iteration method, and classical gravity anomaly", "paper_id": "WOS:000305461100006"}
