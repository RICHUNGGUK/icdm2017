Serial data-rates from 2.5 to 20 Gb/s were studied for a 2(31)-1 bit random sequence. Error-free data transfer over a 0.3-m link was achieved at up to 10 Gb/s. Acceptable bit-error rates, < 10(-5) and 10(-3), were measured at up to 1.5 m for 10- and 15-Gb/s datarate, respectively. The performance was achieved using a transmitter that consists of an integrated wavelet generator, whereas the receiver was built from off-the-shelf waveguide components. The results demonstrate that very high data-rates may be achieved using binary modulation and short symbols generated in an efficient V-band transmitter. The system is benchmarked against state-of-the-art transceiver systems with multigigabit per second data-rates.", "paper_title": "A 15-Gb/s Wireless ON-OFF Keying Link", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800095"}
