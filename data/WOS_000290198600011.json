The USS is a complex electromechanical system used to seal aseptic packages for liquid foods that is the core of the most advanced filling machines. Since the overall device is the result of the interconnection of several subsystems that belong to different physical domains, the problem is tackled within the port-Hamiltonian framework, which is naturally multi-domain and multi-scale. On the other hand, the simulation of the whole sealing process is not a trivial task due to the presence of a Compact Transducer (CT) that can be modeled only by means of commercial finite-element software. Then, only extremely high-order models are available, which makes the simulation of the complete system impractical. Consequently, a novel model reduction procedure for port-Hamiltonian systems has been developed. The method is able to preserve the frequency behavior of the original system in a neighborhood of a predefined set of frequencies of interest. In this way, simulation times have been drastically shortened without loosing the essential dynamical information. The reduced order model can be adopted to test the validity of the controller, and to simulate and perform the diagnosis of the entire sealing process. The results of the model reduction algorithm have been experimentally validated. Moreover, also the complete USS model has been derived. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
