Our method is the first to cluster vertices in a dynamic graph based on arbitrary temporal behaviors. In order to successfully implement this method, we develop a feature based pipeline for dynamic graphs and apply Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to these features. We demonstrate these steps with a sample of the Twitter mentions graph as well as a CAIDA network traffic graph. We contribute and analyze a parallel NMF algorithm presenting both theoretical and empirical studies of performance. This work can be leveraged by graph/network analysts to understand the temporal behavior cluster structure and segmentation structure of dynamic graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
