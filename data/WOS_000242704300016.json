Several studies have showed that the sparse logistic regression is a useful classification method for gene expression data. Not only does it give a sparse solution with high accuracy, it provides the user with explicit probabilities of classification apart from the class information. However, its optimal extension to more than two classes is not obvious. In this paper, we propose a multiclass extension of sparse logistic regression. Analysis of five publicly available gene expression data sets shows that the proposed method outperforms the standard multinomial logistic model in prediction accuracy as well as gene selectivity.
