In an earlier article, Singh et al [Singh, R Gernaey, K. V Gani. R. (2009) Model-based computer-aided framework for design of process monitoring and analysis systems. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 33, 22-42] proposed the use of a systematic model and data based methodology to design appropriate PAT systems This methodology has now been implemented into a systematic computer-aided framework to develop a software (ICAS-PAT) for design, validation and analysis of PAT systems Two supporting tools needed by ICAS-PAT have also been developed a knowledge base (consisting of process knowledge as well as knowledge on measurement methods and tools) and a generic model library (consisting of process operational models) Through a tablet manufacturing process example, the application of ICAS-PAT is Illustrated, highlighting as well, the main features of the software (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "ICAS-PAT: A software for design, analysis and validation of PAT systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279488600013"}
