HBSC techniques aim at reducing the cochannel interference between a macrocell and a group of microcells by coordinating the transmissions of distributed antennas in the cell coverage area. We find that joint intra-and intersite cooperation will significantly reduce the intercell interference. Compared with the case without joint intrasite/intersite cooperation, we demonstrate that HBSC in the conventional pentagonal cell architecture can improve spectrum efficiency by 65% at the cell edge. When the narrow-beam trisector cell architecture is considered, the spectrum efficiency can be further improved by 16.42% at the cell edge.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Hierarchical Cellular Systems in LTE-A Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100012"}
