Obtained via an extension of cubic splines or splines in tension to networks of curves, they are efficiently computable and possess a variety of interesting applications. We present properties of fair webs and their discrete counterparts, i.e., fair polygon networks. Applications of fair curve and polygon networks include fair surface design and approximation under constraints such as obstacle avoidance or guaranteed error bounds, aesthetic remeshing, parameterization and texture mapping, and surface restoration in geometric models.", "paper_title": "Fair webs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613900008"}
