The constructed martingale is quite versatile in the sense that it captures queueing systems with Markovian and autoregressive arrivals in a unified manner; the second class is particularly relevant due to Wold's decomposition of stationary processes. Moreover, using the framework of stochastic network calculus, the martingales allow for a simple handling of typical queueing operations: (1) flows' multiplexing translates into multiplying the corresponding martingales, and (2) scheduling translates into time-shifting the martingales. The emerging calculus is applied to estimate the per-flow delay for FIFO, SP, and EDF scheduling. Unlike state-of-the-art results, our bounds capture a fundamental exponential leading constant in the number of multiplexed flows, and additionally are numerically tight. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
