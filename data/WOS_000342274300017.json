To achieve this goal, we propose a new scheme called E-AUSMPW in this paper. This scheme adopts the Zha-Bilgen splitting procedure by theoretical analysis and computes the convection flux like AUSMPW+. Moreover, it uses different methods to simulate the pressure flux's terms respectively. Series of numerical experiments show that E-AUSMPW is with a high level of robustness against shock anomalies. In addition, it is much more robust against the 'overheating phenomenon' than others. Besides these merits above, it is also with high accuracy and high efficiency orders in hypersonic heating predictions. Thus, E-AUSMPW is promising to be widely used to accurately and efficiently simulate both simple and complex flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
