We propose a general derandomization method which can be used to show that for every random auction there exists a deterministic auction having asymptotically the same revenue. In addition, we construct an explicit optimal deterministic auction for bi-valued auctions. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
