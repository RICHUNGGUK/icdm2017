A locally adaptive data compression scheme. Commun. ACM 29 (4), 320-330]. The scheme is based on a self-organizing move-to-front word list. However, a single error occurred on transmission channel could cause the lists of the encoder and decoder to differ, which could corrupt all reference data that follows. To reduce the impact of losing synchronization, a new list structure for the locally adaptive data compression scheme is proposed in this paper. From our analysis and experiments, the proposed scheme can enhance error resiliency of locally adaptive data compression while preserving high compression performance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
