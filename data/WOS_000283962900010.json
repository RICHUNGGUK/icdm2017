Although widely used in the manufacturing industries, these CNC simulation systems are usually software-centric rather than machine tool-centric. The user has to adjust himself from the 3D graphic environment to the real machining environment. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that supplements a real world with virtual information, where virtual information is augmented on to real objects. This paper builds on previous works of integrating the AR technology with a CNC machining environment using tracking and registration methodologies, with an emphasis on in situ simulation. Specifically configured for a 3-axis CNC machine, a multi-regional computation scheme is proposed to render a cutting simulation between a real cutter and a virtual workpiece, which can be conducted in situ to provide the machinist with a familiar and comprehensive environment. A hybrid tracking method and an NC code-adaptive cutter registration method are proposed and validated with experimental results. The experiments conducted show that this in situ simulation system can enhance the operator's understanding and inspection of the machining process as the simulations are performed on real machines. The potential application of the proposed system is in training and machining simulation before performing actual machining operations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
