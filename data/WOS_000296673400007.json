We posit that such a cloud computing system is vulnerable to DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks against quota. Attackers can force a cloud user to pay more and more money by exhausting its quota without crippling its execution system or congesting links. In this paper, we address this issue and claim that cloud should enable users to pay only for their admitted traffic. We design and prototype such a charging model in a Core Lab testbed infrastructure and show an example application.", "paper_title": "Rethinking Business Model in Cloud Computing: Concept and Example", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673400007"}
