We analyze the interevent time of avalanches with size larger than or equal to Sth by using rescaled range (R/S) analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) methods. Our results demonstrate positive correlation and persistent feature of the interevent time series. The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) has evidenced differences among the avalanches' interevents interval with different Sth. We determine generalized Hurst exponent and singularity spectrum and find that the interevent time series have multifractal nature.", "paper_title": "CORRELATIONS AND MULTIFRACTALITY IN AN EARTHQUAKE MODEL ON ASSORTATIVE SCALE-FREE NETWORKS FROM MONO- AND MULTI-FRACTAL ANALYSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309682000007"}
