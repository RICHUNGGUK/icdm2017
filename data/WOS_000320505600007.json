It enabled us to gain microsecond MD trajectories clearly showing that similar nucleoside triphosphates can bind surprisingly differently into the active site of the Norwalk virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase. It corresponds to their different modes of action (CTP-substrate, 2dCTP-poor substrate, coCTP-chain terminator, cocCTP-inhibitor). Moreover, extremely rare events-as repetitive pervasion of Arg182 into a potentially reaction promoting arrangement-were captured.", "paper_title": "Substrate recognition by norovirus polymerase: microsecond molecular dynamics study", "paper_id": "WOS:000320505600007"}
