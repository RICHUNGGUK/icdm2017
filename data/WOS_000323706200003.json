In this paper, we give the minimum value of H(G) for graphs G with given minimum degree delta(G) >= 2 and characterize the corresponding extremal graph. Furthermore, we prove a best-possible lower bound on the harmonic index of a triangle-free graph G with arbitrary minimum degree delta(G).", "paper_title": "On The Harmonic Index and The Minimum Degree of A Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000323706200003"}
