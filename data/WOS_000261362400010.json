MI-MAC was shown to be a good candidate for next generation wireless cellular networks, due to its superior performance in comparison to other (TDMA and WCDMA-based) protocols in the literature when integrating various types of multimedia traffic. In this paper we propose the combination of MI-MAC with a new efficient call admission control (CAC) mechanism, which will prevent bursty H.264 users from entering the network if system stability is not guaranteed. We proceed to evaluate the ability of our framework to efficiently integrate streams from latest technology video encoders with other types of packet traffic over noisy wireless networks, especially in the case of significant handoff loads. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works in the literature to study the integration of H.264 streams with other types of multimedia traffic over wireless cellular networks.
