This paper presents an in-depth survey of some of the CA approaches in the literature. First, the key design issues for these approaches are identified, laying down the basis for discussion. Second, a classification that captures their essentials is proposed. Third, the different CA approaches are examined individually, with their advantages and limitations highlighted; furthermore, categorical and overall comparisons for them are given in detail, clarifying their sameness and differences. Finally, the future research directions for CA are discussed at length. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.
