In this paper, we propose an image processing technique using a planar motion model to address the problem. Unlike previous methods that involve complex 3-D feature correspondences, a simple approach to the analysis of inter- and intraframe distortions is presented. The high-resolution velocity estimates used for restoring the image are obtained by global motion estimation, Bezier curve fitting, and local motion estimation without resort to correspondence identification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Analysis and compensation of rolling shutter effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000258030500008"}
