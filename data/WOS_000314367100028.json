In this study, we sought to contrast two strain estimation techniques directly (speckle tracking and elastic registration) in an in vivo setting by comparing both to a gold standard reference measurement. In five open-chest sheep instrumented with ultrasonic microcrystals, 2-D images were acquired with a GE Vivid7 ultrasound system. Radial (epsilon(RR)) , longitudinal (epsilon(LL)) , and circumferential strain (epsilon(CC)) were estimated during four inotropic stages: at rest, during esmolol and dobutamine infusion, and during acute ischemia. The correlation of the end-systolic strain values of a well-validated speckle tracking approach and an elastic registration method against sonomicrometry were comparable for epsilon(LL) (r = 0.70 versus r = 0.61, respectively; p = 0.32) and epsilon(CC) (r = 0.73 versus r = 0.80 respectively; p = 0.31). However, the elastic registration method performed considerably better for epsilon(RR) (r = 0.64 versus r = 0.85 respectively; p = 0.09). Moreover, the bias and limits of agreement with respect to the reference strain estimates were statistically significantly smaller in this direction (p < 0.001). This could be related to regularization which is imposed during the motion estimation process as opposed to an a posteriori regularization step in the speckle tracking method. Whether one method outperforms the other in detecting dysfunctional regions remains the topic of future research.", "paper_title": "Elastic Image Registration Versus Speckle Tracking for 2-D Myocardial Motion Estimation: A Direct Comparison In Vivo", "paper_id": "WOS:000314367100028"}
