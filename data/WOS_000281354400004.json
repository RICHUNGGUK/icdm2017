Explicit bi-soliton-like solutions of the equation are obtained under certain constraints on the coefficient functions. For different coefficient functions, the solutions can model different types of bi-soliton-like waves. Some interesting bi-soliton-like waves are graphically revealed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
