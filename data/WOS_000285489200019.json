In this paper, we consider permutation based compression functions that have input lengths shorter than that of the permutation. Under this assumption, we propose a permutation based compression function and prove its security with respect to collision and (second) preimage attacks in the ideal permutation model. The proposed compression function can be seen as a generalization of the compression function of MD6 hash function.", "paper_title": "EPC: A Provably Secure Permutation Based Compression Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200019"}
