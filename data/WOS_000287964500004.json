A novel metric called crosstalk error rate is developed which can be a valuable tool for designers to predict the crosstalk effects and explore interconnect design techniques in order to achieve the target performance with minimum overheads. Closed-form expressions of crosstalk error rate are presented. This metric is used to compare different crosstalk avoidance methods in the 90 nm technology.", "paper_title": "Statistical analysis of crosstalk-induced errors for on-chip interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000287964500004"}
