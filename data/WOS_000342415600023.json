An equivalence is established between the capacity of multiple unicast index coding (where each message is desired by exactly one receiver), and groupcast index coding (where a message can be desired by multiple receivers), which settles the heretofore open question of insufficiency of linear codes for the multiple unicast index coding problem by equivalence with groupcast settings, where this question has previously been answered. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievability of rate half per message in the index coding problem are shown to be a natural consequence of interference alignment constraints, and generalizations to feasibility of rate 1/(L + 1) per message when each destination desires at least L messages, are similarly obtained. Finally, capacity optimal solutions are presented to a series of symmetric index coding problems inspired by the local connectivity and local interference characteristics of wireless networks. The solutions are based on vector linear coding.", "paper_title": "Index Coding-An Interference Alignment Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600023"}
