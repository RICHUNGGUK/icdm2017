However, most surveillance cameras can only capture in one direction with limited viewing angle. This paper proposes an edge enhancement template-based method of omnidirectional action recognition that is able to detect specific actions at a 360 degree of view. A MACH filter captures intra-class variability by synthesizing a single action M A CH filter for a given action class. The proposed method, based on the wavelet MACH filter, provides additional flexibility of an adaptive choice of wavelet scale factors and, in doing so, enables the selection of the size and orientation of the smoothing function in edge enhancement to optimize the performance of the MACH filter. Moreover, the use of wavelet transform improves the performance of the MACH filter by enhancing the cross-correlation peak intensity in the recognition process. The unwarping of an omnidirectional image into a panoramic image further enables action recognition in 360 degree wide angle of view.", "paper_title": "WAVELET MACH FILTER FOR OMNIDIRECTIONAL HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200010"}
