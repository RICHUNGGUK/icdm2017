This improves on an earlier result of Schulman, who showed how to recover when the fraction of errors is bounded by 1/240. We also show how to simulate an arbitrary protocol with a protocol using the binary alphabet, a constant factor increase in communication, and tolerating a 1/8 - epsilon fraction of errors.", "paper_title": "Toward Coding for Maximum Errors in Interactive Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100035"}
