That means that scaling coefficients at a given scale can be constructed with the configuration at that scale only. This property is of particular interest when the refinement operation is data dependent, leading to adaptive multiresolution analyses. Moreover, the proposed class of wavelet transforms are constructed using a sequence of just two lifting steps, one of which contains a linear interpolating prediction operator. This operator easily allows extensions towards directional offsets from predictions, leading to an edge-adaptive nonlinear multiscale decomposition.", "paper_title": "Refinement independent wavelets for use in adaptive multiresolution schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300002"}
