Any polygon with n edges must be convexified after at most (n - 1)! flipturns. A recent paper showed that in fact it will be convex after at most n(n -3)/2 flipturns. We give here lower bounds. We construct a polygon such that if pockets are chosen in a bad way, at least (n - 2)(2) /4 flipturns are needed to convexity the polygon. In another construction, (n - 1)(2)/8 flipturns are needed, regardless of the order in which pockets are chosen. All our bounds are adaptive to a pre-specified number of distinct slopes of the edges.", "paper_title": "Polygons needing many flipturns", "paper_id": "WOS:000233601200005"}
