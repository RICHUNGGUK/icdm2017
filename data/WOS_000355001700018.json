Fortunately, the Web 2.0 technologies, proposed in recent years, bring us a new user experience (UE) that has a fast response speed and a good interface. In particular, the remote sensing image can be processed smoothly in the absence of client software by Web 2.0 technologies. Hence, a Web 2.0-based browser/server model is designed for SGMRSIP to enhance the UE in this paper. Firstly, functions of a parallel remote sensing image processing portal, based on high performance cluster and client/server model, are summarized. And then, a Web 2.0-based interaction model is built, and all these functions are accomplished again on the basis of this model. Finally, the Web 2.0-based Science Gateway is achieved. In addition, we design different workflows for different satellite data, and all the processing tasks are finished successfully to verify the feasibility of this Science Gateway. The experimental results showed that the software scalability and interaction were improved and a better UE was achieved, compared with the existing SGMRSIP.
