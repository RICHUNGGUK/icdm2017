Features extracted based solely on the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) have played a significant role in improving the prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel model called MBMGAC-PSSM by fusing PSSM and three autocorrelation descriptors: normalized Moreau-Broto autocorrelation, Moran autocorrelation and Geary autocorrelation. Then a 560-dimensional feature vector is constructed. Finally, 175 features are selected using principal component analysis (PCA) on the 1189 dataset. Rigorous jackknife cross-validation tests are performed on three widely used low-similarity benchmark datasets: 1189, 25PDB and 640. Our proposed model achieves the competitive performance on prediction accuracies and also outperforms the other existing PSSM-based methods. The fact shows that our approach can be used as a potential candidate for the accurate prediction of protein structural class.", "paper_title": "Prediction of Protein Structural Class Based on Different Autocorrelation Descriptors of Position-Specific Scoring Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000355887000009"}
