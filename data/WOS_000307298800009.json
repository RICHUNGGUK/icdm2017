In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to optimize the complexes and the shape of common base domains in cross parameterization for reducing the distortion of the bijective mapping. The optimization is also constrained by the anchor points. We investigate a new signature, Length-Preserved Base Domain (LPBD), for measuring the level of stretch between surface patches in cross parameterization. This new signature well balances the accuracy of measurement and the computational speed. Based on LPBD, a set of metrics are studied and compared. The best ones are employed in our domain optimization algorithm that consists of two major operators, boundary swapping and patch merging. Experimental results show that our optimization algorithm can reduce the distortion in cross parameterization efficiently.", "paper_title": "Efficient Optimization of Common Base Domains for Cross Parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000307298800009"}
