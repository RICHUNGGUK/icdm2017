Problems with parallel robots are that most are coupled, more difficult to control than serial robots, and have a small workspace. In this paper, new parallel robot is proposed, which can deliver accurate movements, is partially decoupled and has a relatively large workspace. The novelty of this parallel robot lies in its ability to achieve the decoupled state by employing legs of a different kinematic structure. The robot repeatability is evaluated using a CMM and so are the actual lead errors of its actuators. A simple geometric method is proposed for directly identifying the actual base and mobile reference frames, two actuator's offsets and one distance parameter, using a measurement arm from FARO Technologies. While this method is certainly not the most efficient one, it yields a satisfactory improvement of the robot accuracy without the need for any background in robot calibration. An experimental validation shows that the position accuracy achieved after calibration is better than 0.339 mm within a workspace of approximately 150 mm x 200 mm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
