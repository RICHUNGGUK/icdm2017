Zhang [X. Zhang, Fixed point theorem of generalized quasicontractive mapping in cone metric spaces, Comput. Math. Appl., 62 (2011), 1627-1633] is generalized by omitting the assumption of normality of the underlying cone, and much shorter proof is given. Respective common fixed point results, as well as the result for Fisher's quasicontraction, are also proved.
