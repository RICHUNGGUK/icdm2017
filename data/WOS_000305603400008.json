Nonetheless, existing methods do not offer an effective means of customizing the network layout in order to accommodate such large annotation labels while preserving its planar embedding. This paper presents a new approach for designing the metro map layout in order to annotate stations on a specific travel route with large annotation labels. Our idea is to elongate the travel route to be straight along the centerline of the map so that we can systematically annotate such stations with external labels. This is accomplished by extending the conventional mixed-integer programming technique for computing octilinear layouts where orientations inherent to the metro line segments are plausibly rearranged. The stations are then connected with external labels through leaders while minimizing intersections with metro lines for enhancing visual clarity. We present several design examples of metro maps and user studies to demonstrate that the proposed aesthetic criteria successfully direct viewers attention to specific travel routes.", "paper_title": "Travel-Route-Centered Metro Map Layout and Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305603400008"}
