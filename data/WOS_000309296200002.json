With the development of wireless communication and mobile devices, more and more users and applications will be accommodated in mobile environment. Since mobile users and applications compete for the limited wireless resources whose communication quality dynamically change, we need an adaptive mechanism for mobile users and applications to share the available network resources while satisfying each application's QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation mechanism where each node autonomously determines wireless network resources to assign to each of networked applications running on it. For this purpose, we adopt an attractor composition model, which is based on an autonomous and adaptive behavior of biological systems. Through numerical analysis, we confirmed that our mechanism could adaptively and stably allocate wireless network resources to applications, while considering their QoS requirements and fairly sharing network resources with other nodes. It also is shown that our mechanism superiors to a mechanism where a node determines resource allocation by solving an optimization problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
