The resulting cell, called STL which is extremely compact can be programmed to realize a large number of threshold functions, many of which would require a multilevel network of conventional CMOS logic gates. Next, we describe a novel array architecture consisting of STL cells onto which complex logic networks can be mapped. The resulting array, called STLA has several advantages not available with conventional logic. This type of logic (1) is non-volatile, (2) is structurally regular and operates like DRAM, (3) is fully observable and controllable, (4) has zero standby power. These advantages are demonstrated and compared by implementing a 16-bit carry look-ahead adder and a 32-bit Wallace tree multiplier in STLA and FPGA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
