Range restricted minimal residual methods have been found to be well suited for the solution of many such problems. This paper discusses the structure of matrices that arise in a range restricted minimal residual method for the solution of large linear discrete ill-posed problems with a symmetric matrix. The exploitation of the structure results in a method that is competitive with respect to computer storage, number of iterations, and accuracy.", "paper_title": "The structure of iterative methods for symmetric linear discrete ill-posed problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333080900007"}
