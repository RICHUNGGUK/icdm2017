The scheme introduces a product construction that employs two types of codes: \"standard\" good codes and codes that are more suitable for the fading environment. Short-blocklength codes of unique features are, thus, obtained for the bandwidth-limited regime. Using this approach, codes of bandwidth efficiencies 1, 2, and 3 bits/s/Hz are detailed. An iterative decoding algorithm for this product construction is devised. It relies on separate columns/rows decoding linked by (reliability) information transfer. Simulation results reveal that these codes compare favorably with known codes of short block-length when perfect channel state information is available to the receiver. The proposed approach is easily extended for the frequency-selective fading channel with multicarrier signaling.", "paper_title": "Product construction of codes for Rayleigh-fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600031"}
