In order to study the evolution rate more comprehensively, all 13 protein coding genes in 123 mammalian mitochondrial genomes are analyzed. The evolution rates of different codon position are analyzed as well. The evolution rate is estimated by Shannon entropy. We find that the distribution of 3rd codon position doesn't follow gamma distribution and the results suggest that it follows a mixed distribution of gamma distribution and normal distribution. The relationship between different codon positions is also studied. We find that there are significant positive correlation between three codon positions. Especially between 1st codon position and 2nd codon position, there is strong linear relationship. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
