Variations in material fatigue properties depend on stochastic stress responses due to their nonlinear relationships with other random variables such as stochastic loading and dimensions. In this work, an efficient fatigue reliability analysis method is developed to accommodate those uncertainties for structures under cyclic loads with known loading trend. To reduce the computational cost, the method incorporates the fatigue life analysis model and the saddlepoint approximation method with the fast integration method. The new method is applied to the fatigue reliability analysis of a cantilever beam and a door cam. The results show high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method benchmarked with Monte Carlo Simulations.", "paper_title": "Fatigue reliability analysis for structures with known loading trend", "paper_id": "WOS:000338333200002"}
