The notion of fuzzy skeleton by influence zones (SKIZ), or fuzzy generalized Voroni diagram, is derived. These definitions are based on fuzzy dilations and their interpretations in terms of distances. As another contribution, we show how this notion can be used to define a fuzzy median set, and a series of fuzzy sets interpolating between two fuzzy sets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
