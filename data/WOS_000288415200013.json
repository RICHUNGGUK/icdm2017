In particular, we emphasize the properties of discretized systems and the convergence of a hybrid direct-iterative solver for its approximate solution in view of the parameters of the continuous model. We found that the proposed solver is faster than standard sparse direct solvers for all the considered discrete models. Numerical tests confirm that the proposed techniques are crucial in order to get fast and reliable simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
