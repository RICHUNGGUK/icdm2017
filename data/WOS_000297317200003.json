A large database of manually segmented 3D-meshes is used to learn a boundary edge function. The function is learned using a classifier which automatically selects from a pool of geometric features the most relevant ones to detect candidate boundary edges. We propose a processing pipeline that produces smooth closed boundaries using this edge function. This pipeline successively selects a set of candidate boundary contours, closes them and optimizes them using a snake movement. Our algorithm was evaluated quantitatively using two different segmentation benchmarks and was shown to outperform most recent algorithms from the state-of-the-art.", "paper_title": "Learning Boundary Edges for 3D-Mesh Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297317200003"}
