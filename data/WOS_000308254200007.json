High-dimensional activity spaces result from the experimental evaluation of compound sets on large numbers of targets. We introduce a first concept to represent and navigate high dimensional activity landscapes that is based on a data structure termed ligand-target differentiation (LTD) map. This approach is designed to reduce the complexity of high dimensional bioactivity spaces and enable the identification and further analysis Of compound subsets with interesting activity and structural relationships. Its utility has been demonstrated using a set of more than 1400 inhibitors with exact activity measurements for varying numbers of 172 kinases.", "paper_title": "Navigating High-Dimensional Activity Landscapes: Design and Application of the Ligand-Target Differentiation Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000308254200007"}
