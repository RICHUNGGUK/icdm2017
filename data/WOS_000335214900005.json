The regular Pareto distribution is the basic model of choice, being the simplest heavy-tailed distribution. Real data suggest that modifications of the Pareto distribution may be a better fit; an alternative model is the truncated Pareto distribution (TPD). For further study, this paper proposed a TPD Sieve class of distributions. The properties and estimation on the Sieve class are also discussed. We fit the models to the largest Black Sea bass caught in Buzzard's Bay, MA, USA and the costliest Atlantic hurricanes from 1900 to 2005. Using measures of model adequacy, the TPD Sieve model is generally found to be the best-fitting model.", "paper_title": "A Sieve model for extreme values", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900005"}
