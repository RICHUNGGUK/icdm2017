However, individual works have focused on sophisticated methodologies with particular sport types and there has been a lack of scalable and holistic frameworks in this field. This article proposes a solution and presents a systematic and generic approach which is experimented on a relatively large-scale sports consortia. The system aims at the event detection scenario of an input video with an orderly sequential process. Initially, domain knowledge-independent local descriptors are extracted homogeneously from the input video sequence. Then the video representation is created by adopting a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model. The video's genre is first identified by applying the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers on the initially obtained video representation, and various dissimilarity measures are assessed and evaluated analytically. Subsequently, an unsupervised probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)-based approach is employed at the same histogram-based video representation, characterizing each frame of video sequence into one of four view groups, namely closed-up-view, mid-view, long-view, and outer-field-view. Finally, a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) structured prediction model is utilized for interesting event detection. From experimental results, k-NN classifier using KL-divergence measurement demonstrates the best accuracy at 82.16% for genre categorization. Supervised SVM and unsupervised PLSA have average classification accuracies at 82.86% and 68.13%, respectively. The HCRF model achieves 92.31% accuracy using the unsupervised PLSA based label input, which is comparable with the supervised SVM based input at an accuracy of 93.08%. In general, such a systematic approach can be widely applied in processing massive videos generically.", "paper_title": "A Generic Approach for Systematic Analysis of Sports Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763400008"}
