The method is based on divergence testing for each variable in the cone-of-influence of the loop's condition. The analysis allows us to automatically prove the termination of loops that cannot be handled using previous techniques. We also describe a method for integrating our nonlinear termination proving technique into a larger termination proving framework that depends on linear reasoning.", "paper_title": "Proving termination of nonlinear command sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000318568700004"}
