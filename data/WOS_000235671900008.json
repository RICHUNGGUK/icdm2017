The circuit of 12-b DAC employs segmented architecture, the least significant bits (LSB's) steer a binary weighted array, while the most significant bits (MSB's) are thermometer decoded and steer a unary array. The measured differential nonlinearity and integral nonlinearity are +/- 0.6 least significant bit (LSB) and +/- 0.9 LSB, respectively. The output spectrum of the DAC is -63 dB with an input frequency of 30 MHz at 150 MHz conversion rate. The circuit is fabricated in 0.5 mu m, two-poly two-metal, 5.0 V, mixed-signal CMOS process and occupies 1.27 x 0.96 mm, when operating at 150 MHz Sample/s, it dissipates 91.6 mW from 5.0 V power supply which is much lower than those of [1].", "paper_title": "A 12-b, 150 MHz sample/s CMOS current steering D/A converter with gradient error compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900008"}
