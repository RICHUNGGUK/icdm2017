A consequence of this property is that it is difficult to distinguish a long-memory process from a nonstationary process. In this paper, we study the impact of the periodicity and trend on different methods for estimating the long-memory processes parameter d.", "paper_title": "Impact of the periodicity and trend on the FD parameter estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242209300006"}
