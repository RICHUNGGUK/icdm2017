The objective of the CFA demosaicking is to render a full color image from the mosaicked image. This is commonly achieved by estimating the missing color information from the surrounding observed pixels. In this paper, we integrate the observation that color images have a strong intrachannel spatial correlation in low-frequency components and a dominant interchannel correlation in the high-frequency components. A new framework is proposed to utilize this information where the missing pixels in each color channel are estimated from the wavelet subbands. A modified median-filtering operation is then applied in the subband domain. The algorithm is adaptive and produces superior full-resolution images when compared with other methods.", "paper_title": "Subband synthesis for color filter array demosaicking", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900020"}
