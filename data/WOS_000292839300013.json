In this model, there are k background sequences, and each character in a background sequence is a random character from an alphabet Sigma. A motif G = g(1)g(2) ... g(m) is a string of m characters. Each background sequence is implanted with a probabilistically generated approximate copy of G. For a probabilistically generated approximate copy b(1)b(2) ... b(m) of G, every character is probabilistically generated such that the probability for b(i) not equal g(i) is at most alpha. In this article, we develop an efficient algorithm that can discover a hidden motif from a set of sequences for any alphabet Sigma with vertical bar Sigma vertical bar >= 2 and is applicable to DNA motif discovery. We prove that for alpha < 1/8(1 - 1/vertical bar Sigma vertical bar), there exist positive constants c(0), epsilon, and delta(2) such that if there are at least c(0) log n input sequences, then in O(n(2)/h(log n)(O(1))) time this algorithm finds the motif with probability at least 3/4 for every G is an element of Sigma(rho) - Psi(rho,h,epsilon)(Sigma), where n the length of longest sequences, rho is the length of the motif, h is a parameter with rho >= 4h >= delta(2) log n, and Psi(rho,h,epsilon)(Sigma) is a small subset of at most 2(-Theta(epsilon 2h)) fraction of the sequences in Sigma(rho).", "paper_title": "Discovering Almost Any Hidden Motif from Multiple Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000292839300013"}
