The measured insertion loss is -1.1 dB at 2.4 GHz. With stacked switching device, the circuit exhibits a high measured input input-referred 1 dB power compression point (IP1 dB) of 21.5 dBm, which has more than 7 dB enhancement compared to previous work. The measured isolation is 43 dB. The switch has a overall occupied die area of 1200 x 560 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A novel high-isolation RF-SOI switch for 2.4 GHz multi-standard applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000289103200004"}
