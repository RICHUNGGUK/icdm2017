A pillbox that integrates onto the body of the PDA was created as a place to store mid-day pills. Results from a lab and field experiment on older adults' perceptions and use of PDAs for medication minding are reported. In both the lab and field experiment, older adults were successfully trained to use PDA standard programs and a program for medication reminding. At the conclusion of the 3-month field experiment, a physical pill count yielded increased compliance with two-thirds of the participants missing I pill or less in the third month of the study. Implications for PDA training curricula, hardware design, and future research are discussed.", "paper_title": "Persuasive pillboxes: Improving medication adherence with personal digital assistants", "paper_id": "WOS:000238092800028"}
