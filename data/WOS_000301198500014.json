Therefore, predictions vary widely in terms of methodological rigor, data quality, extent of analysis, and uncertainty. Documentation of the prediction process employed is often not presented. These inconsistencies can leave the user of the prediction confused, uncertain of the prediction's true value, and unable to compare the results of two reliability predictions of the same hardware. IEEE has created a standard [1], IEEE 1413, that, when followed, results in consistent, complete documentation of a prediction. The prediction users can then understand the strengths and weaknesses of a prediction, and compare the value and usefulness of multiple predictions. The standard creates consistency by requiring documentation for specific processes, activities, and levels of knowledge.", "paper_title": "IEEE 1413: A Standard for Reliability Predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500014"}
