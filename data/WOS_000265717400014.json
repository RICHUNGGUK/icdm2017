In this paper we specifically introduce a new local refinement for triangulations based on the longest-edge trisection, the 7-triangle longest-edge (7T-LE) local refinement algorithm. Each triangle to be refined is subdivided in seven sub-triangles by determining its longest edge. ne conformity of the new mesh is assured by an automatic point insertion criterion using the oriented 1-skeleton graph of the triangulation and three partial division patterns.
