The problem is formulated as a multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problem in which (a) multiple items can be produced in each planning period, (b) sequence-independent set-ups can carry over from previous periods, (c) set-ups can cross over planning period boundaries, and (d) set-ups can be longer than one period. The formulation is extended to model time periods of non-uniform length, idle time, parallel units, families of products, backlogged demand, and lost sales. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
