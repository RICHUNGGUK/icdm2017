(2003), where a text is given as a truncation-free collage system < D, S > such that variable sequence S is encoded by any prefix code. We first build CPMA directly from P and D in O(vertical bar D parallel to P vertical bar) time and space, and then convert it into the decoder-embedded CPMA (DECPMA), where vertical bar P vertical bar is the pattern length and vertical bar D vertical bar is the number of variables defined in D. The bound O(vertical bar D parallel to P vertical bar) improves the bound O(vertical bar D parallel to P vertical bar + vertical bar P vertical bar(2)) achieved by a straightforward application of the method of Kida et al. We experimentally show that a combination of recursive-pairing compression and byte-oriented Huffman coding allows both a high compression ratio and a high speed CPM.", "paper_title": "A RUN-TIME EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPRESSED PATTERN MATCHING AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000268592200011"}
