The interesting phenomenon is often an event. In this paper, we develop control algorithms aggregate the interesting event based on energy-efficient communication topology. The communication topology is that each node keeps the k closest neighbors by adjusting the transmit power in the aggregating process. And it can not only remain communication connection but also decreases the energy consumption. Moreover we design local feedback controller for completing the global target. We simulate the aggregation motion. As the results, the sensor nodes converge to different formation and the utility of our proposed method is validated.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient aggregation control for mobile sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400026"}
