We obtain an effective upper bound for the multiplication complexity of n-term polynomials modulo f(x)(l). This upper bound allows a better selection of the moduli when the Chinese Remainder Theorem is used for polynomial multiplication over F-2. We give improved formulas to multiply polynomials of small degree over F-2. In particular, we improve the best known multiplication complexities over F-2 in the literature in some cases.", "paper_title": "Improved Polynomial Multiplication Formulas over F-2 Using Chinese Remainder Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000263526500010"}
