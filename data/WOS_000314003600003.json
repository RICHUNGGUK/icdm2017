LN metastasis is an important index for staging malignant tumors. The present study proposes a system that classifies lymph nodes according to pathological change from ultrasound (US) images. Features are selected and extracted from the US images. A feature selection method that integrates the particle swarm optimization neural network (PSONN) with the Boltzmann function is proposed to select significant features. A multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to classify diseases of the LN in the region of interests (ROIs) of US images into six categories. The experimental results show that the proposed approach decreases the number of selected features and that its classification is highly accurate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
