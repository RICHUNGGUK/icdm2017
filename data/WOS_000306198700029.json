The main issue in mesh simplification is to maximize the simplification ratio while minimizing the visual degradation. Therefore, effective and objective evaluation of the visual degradation is essential in order to select the simplification ratio. Some objective geometric and subjective perceptual metrics have been proposed. However, few objective metrics have taken human visual characteristics into consideration. To evaluate the visual degradation introduced by mesh simplification for a 3D triangular object, we integrate the structural degradation with mesh saliency and propose a new objective and multi-scale evaluation metric named Global Perceptual Structural Degradation (GPSD). The proper selection of the simplification ratio under a given distance-to-viewpoint is also discussed in this paper. The accuracy and validity of the proposed metric have been demonstrated through subjective experiments. The experimental results confirm that the GPSD metric shows better 3D model-based multi-scale perceptual evaluation capability.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Scale Structural Degradation Metric for Perceptual Evaluation of 3D Mesh Simplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198700029"}
