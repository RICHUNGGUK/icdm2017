Construction of such codes is extremely difficult. In fact, the only general lower bound known is the Gilbert-Varshamov type bound. In this paper, we establish a connection between permutation codes and independent sets in certain graphs. Using the connection, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor, when the code length goes to infinity.", "paper_title": "An Improvement on the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound for Permutation Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500030"}
