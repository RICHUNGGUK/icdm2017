As a remedy against traffic volume uncertainty, we propose a Robust Optimization model based on Multiband Robustness (Busing and D'Andreagiovanni, 2012), a refinement of classical F-Robustness by Bertsimas and Sim that uses a system of multiple deviation bands. Since the resulting optimization problem may prove very challenging even for instances of moderate size solved by a state-of-the-art optimization solver, we propose a hybrid primal heuristic that combines a randomized fixing strategy inspired by ant colony optimization and an exact large neighbourhood search. Computational experiments on a set of realistic instances from the SNDlib show that our original heuristic can run fast and produce solutions of extremely high quality associated with low optimality gaps.
