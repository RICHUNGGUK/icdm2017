In a recent study of visually evoked waves in rat cortex, compression and reflection of waves are observed as the activation passes from visual areas V1 to V2. The authors of this study apply bicuculline (BMI) and demonstrate that the reflection disappears. They conclude that inhibition plays a major role in compression and reflection. We present several models for propagating waves in heterogeneous media and show that the velocity and thus compression depends weakly on inhibition. We propose that the main site of action of BMI with respect to wave propagation is on the threshold for firing which we suggest is related to action on potassium channels. We combine numerical and analytic methods to explore both compression and reflection in an excitable system with synaptic coupling.", "paper_title": "The mechanisms for compression and reflection of cortical waves", "paper_id": "WOS:000297863700006"}
