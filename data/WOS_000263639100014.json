Both network-induced delay and packet dropout are concerned. In the developed control scheme, the FE is used to estimate the states of the controlled plant for the purpose of effectively reducing the network burden. Based on the limited knowledge of a controlled plant in the presence of a network, a disturbance attenuation term is also employed to attenuate the influence of modeling errors and external disturbances on the system. The sufficient condition for the robust stability with H(infinity) performance of the closed-loop system is obtained. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Model-Based Robust Networked Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263639100014"}
