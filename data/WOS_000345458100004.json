By analyzing the projections of the image, we are able to determine some coordinates corresponding to interest points that give significant information about features of the image of aid in the reconstruction. Our approach yields promising results in comparison to other methods in literature. Finally, we discuss how a similar approach could be extended to more complex problems deriving from tomographic applications, in order to develop an efficient method exploiting the prior knowledge assumed on an image.", "paper_title": "A New Approach for the Reconstruction of Object-Based Images in Discrete Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000345458100004"}
