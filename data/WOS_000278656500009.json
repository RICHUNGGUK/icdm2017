In TALISMAN MDE framework, we combine the principles of the two most important initiatives, Model-Driven Architecture and Software Factories. Both have their pros and cons, and we select the best from each in TALISMAN MDE. To show the advantages of TALISMAN MDE, we have developed a systems generator and used it to create applications for controlling food traceability. The applications are being used in dairies with different manufacturing processes, using software developed specifically for each dairy by working only with models, without additional programming.
