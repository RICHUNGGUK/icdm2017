By observing their error signals, the proposed alternating AP (A-AP) filter selects one of the two AP filters and updates the weights of the selected filter for each iteration. As a result, the total computations required for the proposed structure is almost the same as that for a single AP filter. Experimental results show that the proposed alternating selection scheme extracts the best properties of each component filter, namely fast convergence and small steady-state error.", "paper_title": "An Alternating Selection for Parallel Affine Projection Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619300012"}
