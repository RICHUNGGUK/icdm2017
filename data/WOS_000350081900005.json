In this paper, a visual tracking method is proposed based upon l(0)-norm minimization which directly seeks solution to the primal l(0) problem. To avoid solving a large number of l(0) minimization problems, we introduce to encode all samples simultaneously in a multi-task manner, which means that the number of minimization problem to be solved is only one, and an algorithm is presented to solve the minimization problem. Our tracking algorithm is then implemented under the framework of particle filter. Experiments on different challenging video sequences demonstrate that our method can achieve robust tracking results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
