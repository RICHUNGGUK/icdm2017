Unfortunately, owing to the strong correlations present in the neighbourhood covariate matrix, parameter estimation is complicated by the dichotomy between ill-conditionedness and rotation invariance. Exploiting the Fused Lasso framework, we here propose a compromise which incorporates two regularisers. The l(1)-norm induces stability and performs variable selection amongst strongly correlated radial samples; the total variation seminorm encourages clustering and promotes parsimony. Experiments confirm the potential utility. Parallels are drawn within the texture classification literature and beyond. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
