The force of diffusion that exists between neighbouring cells on the surface of the tumour has been paid due consideration. The study reveals that such a coupled system would show synchronization. Our computational results further show that such a prediction holds not only for individual tumours but also for multiple tumours coupled together. The degree of synchronization is found to be dependent on the strength of coupling, which is in turn determined by the cell density. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
