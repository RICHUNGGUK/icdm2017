Here neural network is considered as a part of large field called neural computing or soft computing. The model finds the approximated solution of fuzzy differential equation inside of its domain for the close enough neighborhood of the fuzzy initial point. We propose a learning algorithm from the cost function for adjusting of fuzzy weights. Finally, we illustrate our approach by numerical examples and an application example in engineering.
