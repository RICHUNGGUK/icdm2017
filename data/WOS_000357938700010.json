According to the definition of input-to-state stability, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the system is input-to-state stable based on the dwell time approach and the Gronwall-Bellman inequality. Compared with existing methods, it is more convenient to design the controller for each subsystem, because it does not need to construct the input-to-state stable control Lyapunov function and design the specific structure of the control inputs. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Input-to-state stability analysis for a class of nonlinear switched descriptor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357938700010"}
