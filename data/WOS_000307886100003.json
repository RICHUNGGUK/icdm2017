In this paper, previous results of Hong (Nonlinear Analysis 2011 74:72967303) are improved by relaxing some of their requirements. Carlson's, Sandor's, BushellOkrasinski's type inequalities and Fatou's lemma for universal integral are studied in a rather general form, thus generalizing some recent results.
