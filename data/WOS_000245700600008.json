TLMM is modular and straightforward as it leverages existing protocols, such as Mobile IPv4 as global mobility management and TeleMIP for intradomain mobility management for locating roaming nodes. It uses three dynamically autoconfigured care-of-addresses (CoAs) for routing the packets destined to mobile nodes. A Gateway Mobility Agent at the boundary of two domains provides a global CoA and identifies a mobile node's attachment to the current domain. A regional CoA provides the specific area of the mobile node's attachment within the domain, while a local CoA changes every time the mobile changes subnets and identifies the mobile's attachment to the subnet level granularity. A dynamic handoff policy for supporting fast and seamless handoff reduces latency at a mobile node and minimizes packet loss. Simulation results using ns-2 suppports our model. A detailed analytical framework for dynamic handoff has been presented in depth to estimate handoff initiation instance for reducing the probabilty of false handoffs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
