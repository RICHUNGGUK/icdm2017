Under the supervision and help of the third side, the sender and the receiver can securely share the private quantum entanglement keys used to encrypt and decrypt the secret message. According to the results of checking the eavesdropping on decoy photons, communicators can decide whether the quantum keys are reused in the next round. Not only will eavesdropping inevitably disturb the states of the decoy photons and be detected, but arbitrary transmission errors can also be corrected.", "paper_title": "Controlled quantum secure direct communication with quantum encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500013"}
