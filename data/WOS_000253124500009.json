In feature extraction stage, the modified finite Radon transform is proposed, which can extract principal lines effectively and efficiently even in the case that the palmprint images contain many long and strong wrinkles. In matching stage, a matching algorithm based on pixel-to-area comparison is devised to calculate the similarity between two palmprints, which has shown good robustness for slight rotations and translations of palmprints. The experimental results for the verification on Hong Kong Polytechnic University Palmprint Database show that the discriminability of principal lines is also strong. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
