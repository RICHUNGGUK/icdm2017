Algorithms used typically for this problem compute optimal trajectories from scratch in a new situation. In effect, extensive data is accumulated containing situations together with the respective optimized trajectories-but this data is in practice hardly exploited. This article describes a novel method to learn from such data and speed up motion generation, a method we denote tajectory pediction. The main idea is to use demonstrated optimal motions to quickly predict appropriate trajectories for novel situations. These can be used to initialize and thereby drastically speed-up subsequent optimization of robotic movements. Our approach has two essential ingredients. First, to generalize from previous situations to new ones we need a situation descriptor-we construct features for such descriptors and use a sparse regularized feature selection approach to improve generalization. Second, the transfer of previously optimized trajectories to a new situation should not be made in joint angle space-we propose a more efficient task space transfer. We present extensive results in simulation to illustrate the benefits of the new method, and demonstrate it also with real robot hardware. Our experiments in diverse tasks show that we can predict good motion trajectories in new situations for which the refinement is much faster than an optimization from scratch.", "paper_title": "Fast motion planning from experience: trajectory prediction for speeding up movement generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314021200007"}
