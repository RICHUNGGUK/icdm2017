Next, we describe the construction of a CWT on the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid, emphasizing the similarities between the two cases. Finally, we give some indications on the CWT on a paraboloid and we introduce a unified approach to the CWT on conic sections.", "paper_title": "The continuous wavelet transform on conic sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000254425300002"}
