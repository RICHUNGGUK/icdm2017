By employing homotopic mapping theory and constructing suitable Lyapunov functional method we present some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and globally exponential stability (GES) of the equilibrium point. These conditions obtained have important leading significance in the designs and applications of GES for reaction-diffusion neural circuit systems with delays. Finally, we show a numerical example to verify the theoretical analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
