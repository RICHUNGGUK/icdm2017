Its rod shaped specimen with 3.6 mm in diameter and 4.7 mm in height was punched out to have successfully observed by using a newly made algorithm due to refraction for x-ray CT. Its data was acquired by the x-ray optics DEI (diffraction-enhanced imaging). Data of 900 projections with interval of 0.2 degrees was used at Photon Factory, KEK in Tsukuba. A reconstructed CT image may include clearly revealed ductus lactiferi, microcalcification and other structure. The voxel resolution is approximately 50 mu m by the present instrumental condition. This modality could open up an x-ray pathological diagnosis.", "paper_title": "First attempt at 3D X-ray visualization of DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) due to refraction contrast - In good relation to pathological view", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900071"}
