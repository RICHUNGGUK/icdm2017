In this work, Gauss-Markov random field (MRF) priors are employed along with spatially varying mixture models to ensure the preservation of region boundaries in image segmentation. To preserve region boundaries, two distinct models for a line process involved in the MRF prior are proposed. The first model considers edge preservation by imposing a Bernoulli prior on the normally distributed local differences of the contextual mixing proportions. It is a discrete line process model whose parameters are computed by variational inference. The second model imposes Gamma prior on the Student's-t distributed local differences of the contextual mixing proportions. It is a continuous line process whose parameters are also automatically estimated by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed models are numerically evaluated and two important issues in image segmentation by mixture models are also investigated and discussed: the constraints to be imposed on the contextual mixing proportions to be probability vectors and the MRF optimization strategy in the frameworks of the standard and variational EM algorithm.", "paper_title": "Spatially Varying Mixtures Incorporating Line Processes for Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000274096700001"}
