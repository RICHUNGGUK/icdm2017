In this work, we compared two of these sensors, EM38 and EM38-MK2, with regards to their performance in (i) point-wise measurements with direct juxtaposition of the ECa readings, (ii) determining the soil texture and thickness of Quaternary sediments, (iii) the interpolation procedure (with semivariograms) of ECa and (iv) visual inspection maps of ECa and soil texture. Measurements were performed on a research area representing highly variable site conditions (sandy, gravelly, silty and clayey Tertiary and Quaternary sediments). The point-wise juxtaposition delivered no significant differences between the ECa values of both sensors. The determination of the soil texture and the interpolation results, however, exhibited distinct gradations between the two sensors. The regression analyses indicated a primarily higher R-2 with the EM38 in comparison to the EM38-MK2. Furthermore, the EM38 provided ii both modes lower semi-variogram range values. This result leads to the conclusion that EM38 delivers more small-scale area-wide ECa distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
