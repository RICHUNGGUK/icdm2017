In our approach, the pilot symbol used for frequency estimation is grouped into a number of pilot subsets so that the phase of pilots in each subset is unique. We show via simulations that such a design achieves not only a low computational load but also comparable performance, when compared to the conventional estimator.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Coarse Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems with Non-uniform Phased Pilots", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600049"}
