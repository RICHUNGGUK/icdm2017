In this paper, we settle the Harary-Hill conjecture for shellable drawings. We say that a drawing of is -shellable if there exist a subset of the vertices and a region of with the following property: For all , if is the drawing obtained from by removing , then and are on the boundary of the region of that contains . For , we prove that the number of crossings of any -shellable drawing of is at least the long-conjectured value . Furthermore, we prove that all cylindrical, -bounded, monotone, and 2-page drawings of are -shellable for some and thus they all have at least crossings. The techniques developed provide a unified proof of the Harary-Hill conjecture for these classes of drawings.", "paper_title": "Shellable Drawings and the Cylindrical Crossing Number of", "paper_id": "WOS:000345330700008"}
