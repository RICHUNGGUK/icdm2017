To connect with these agents easily and arbitrarily, wireless ad hoc network is a candidate. Wireless ad hoc network is a distinct network environment with characteristics in self-organisation, dynamical network topologies and easy construction. To provide such networks with secure communication, many researchers tried different ways to create the session key(s). However, there are some drawbacks in session key generation procedure, and the robust session key could not be created. The authors propose a cluster-based secure communication mechanism in wireless ad hoc networks. The proposal applies the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for the session key creation. It helps the clusterhead to reduce the communication overload, to avoid the time synchronisation problem in nodes authentication and to preserve the complete secrecy requirements.", "paper_title": "Cluster-based secure communication mechanism in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287341900014"}
