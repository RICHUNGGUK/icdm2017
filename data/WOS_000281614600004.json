Our results, which combine different types of data, suggest that cross-platform information, including discrepancy and consistency, reflects the mechanisms of nucleosome packaging in vivo more faithfully than individual studies. Furthermore, nucleosomes can be divided into two classes according to their stable and dynamic characteristics. By combining the nucleosome distribution information with a statistical positioning idea, we constructed a novel simulation model for nucleosome distributions in promoter regions.
