This platform intends to make easier the implementation of IEEE standards 1451.0, 1451.1, 1451.2 and 1451.5. The hardware was built using NIOS II processor resources on Alteras Cyclone II FPGA. The software was done using Java technology and C/C++ for the processors programming. This HW/SW system implements the IEEE 1451 based on a control module and supervisory software for industrial automation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
