JSCL supports the coordination of distributed services by exploiting an event notification paradigm. The design and the implementation of JSCL has been inspired and driven by its formal specification given as a process calculus, the Signal Calculus (SC). At the experimental level JSCL has been exploited to implement Long Running Transactions (LRTs).", "paper_title": "JSCL: A middleware for service coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000241691900004"}
