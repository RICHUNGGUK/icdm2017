The domain of 3D cadastres has clearly matured in both research and practice. The ever-increasing complexity of infrastructures and densely developed areas requires proper registration of their legal status (private and public), which the existing 2D cadastral registrations can only partly do. During the past decade, various R&D activities have provided better 3D support for the registration of ownership and other rights, restrictions and responsibilities (RRRs). Despite this progress, of which an overview is given in this introduction paper (and is further elaborated upon in subsequent papers of this special issue), our research agenda for the next decade involves many challenges. This paper sketches six remaining 3D cadastres research topics: (1) shared concepts and terminology (standardization), (2) full life cycle in 3D (not only the rights), (3) legal framework, (4) creation and submission of initial 3D spatial units, (5) 3D cadastral visualization, and (6) more formal semantics.
