Some are needed in connection with maps, hypermaps, configurations, polytopes, or covering graphs. In this paper, we briefly explore these connections and give motivation why some classes of cubic graphs should be generated. Then we describe the algorithms we used to generate these classes. The results are presented in various tables. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Generation of various classes of trivalent graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000325599700003"}
