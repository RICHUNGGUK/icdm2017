This model is dedicated to the development phase of new products for which product architecture is indeed not a priori defined and tasks will be set dynamically during the product development process. In an integrated design perspective, product behaviours must also be forecasted; that is achieved by assessing PPO behaviours. This paper presents the PPO model and the open IPPOP framework that instantiates this model. It investigates how such a model with such a digital platform may interact with other services used to assist other phases of the product life cycle.", "paper_title": "The PPO design model with respect to digital enterprise technologies among product life cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000254065800003"}
