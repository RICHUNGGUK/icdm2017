We use dynamic time-consistent formulations to approximate problems having a single coherent risk measure applied to the aggregated costs over all time periods. The dual representation of coherent risk measures is used to create a time-consistent cutting plane algorithm. Additionally, we also develop methods for the construction of universal time-consistent upper bounds, when the objective function is the mean-semideviation measure of risk. Our numerical results indicate that the resulting dynamic formulations yield close approximations to the original problem.", "paper_title": "Time-consistent approximations of risk-averse multistage stochastic optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300008"}
