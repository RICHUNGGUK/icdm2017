In this paper, we propose a decision-theoretic framework to systematically analyze ADRS in autonomic networks, with an objective to achieve its cost-sensitive and self-optimizing operation. In particular, each ADRS agent is viewed as an autonomous entity, making decision as its local operating environment. A global reward signal is then used to quantify the performance of ADRS as a whole in terms of those identified metrics. Furthermore, the analytical framework serves as a basis for developing an adaptive, robust, and near-optimal prototype termed ARSoS, along with a reinforcement learning algorithm for approximately inferring the optimal behavior of a reputation-based ADRS in a specific autonomic network variant, mobile ad-hoc network. The performance of ARSoS is validated through extensive simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
