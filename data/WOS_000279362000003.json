The result is based upon an O(1)-approximation algorithm for a special class of directed graphs called willows. Incorporating the method for willow graphs as a subroutine in a local improvement algorithm gives the bound for general directed graphs.", "paper_title": "An Approximation Algorithm for the Maximum Leaf Spanning Arborescence Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362000003"}
