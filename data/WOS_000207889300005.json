User studies on interactive voice response (IVR) systems have shown that these properties can be used effectively to \"tailor\" services to users or user groups who do not maintain personal preferences, e. g., because they do not use the service on a regular basis. The adopted approach to achieve individualization of services, without being able to personalize them, is based on the analysis of a caller's voice. This paper shows how this approach benefits service providers by being able to target entertainment and recommendation options. It also shows how this analysis at the same time benefits the customer, as it can increase accessibility of IVR systems to user segments which have particular expectations or which do not cope well with a \"one size fits all\" system. The paper summarizes the authors' current work on component technologies, such as emotion detection, age and gender recognition on telephony speech, and presents results of usability and acceptability tests as well as an architecture to integrate these technologies in future multi-modal contact centers. It is envisioned that these will eventually serve customers with an avatar representation of an agent and tailored interaction strategies, matching powerful output capabilities with advanced analysis of the user's input.", "paper_title": "Getting closer: tailored human-computer speech dialog", "paper_id": "WOS:000207889300005"}
