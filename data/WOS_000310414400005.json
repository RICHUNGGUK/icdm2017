The Clock Drawing Test, a paper-and-pencil test, has been used as one of the most popular cognitive screening tools for dementia. In this paper, we present our approach to developing a home-based computerized dementia screening tool, the ClockMe System, which we developed based on our observational study of the current practice of dementia screening at a clinic. The ClockMe System has two main parts: The ClockReader Application and the ClockAnalyzer Application. By using the ClockReader Application, older adults can self-administer dementia screening at home. The ClockAnalyzer Application enables medical practitioners to review and monitor the screening results of their patients. We conclude our paper with preliminary user evaluation results and suggestions for future implementation. The study shows the potential of computing technologies that can advance the current practice of dementia screening.", "paper_title": "Home-based computerized cognitive assessment tool for dementia screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000310414400005"}
