The proposed algorithm, Trimmer, iterates over each internal node d in the resolution graph that 'consumes' a large number of clauses M (i.e. a large number of original clauses are present in the unsat core only for proving d) and attempts to prove them without the M clauses. If this is possible, it transforms the resolution graph into a new graph that does not have the M clauses at its core. Trimmer can be integrated into a fixpoint framework similarly to Malik and Zhang's fix-point algorithm (RUN-TILL-FIX). We call this option TRIM-TILL-FIX. Experimental evaluation on a large number of industrial CNF unsatisfiable formulas shows that TRIM-TILL-Fix doubles, on average, the number of reduced clauses in comparison to RUN-TILL-FIX. It is also better when used as a component in a bigger system that enforces short timeouts.", "paper_title": "Deriving small unsatisfiable cores with dominators", "paper_id": "WOS:000240257000011"}
