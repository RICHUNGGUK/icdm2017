The main result is that w.h.p. G(n, d) has a large subgraph core(G(n, d)) such that the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian of core(G(n, d)) is >= 1-c(0) (d) over bar (-1/2)(min) in with high probability; here c(0) > 0 is a constant, and d(min) signifies the minimum expected degree. This result is of interest in order to extend known spectral heuristics for random regular graphs to graphs with irregular degree distributions, e.g., power laws. The present paper complements the work of Chung, Lu, and Vu [Internet Mathematics 1, 2003].", "paper_title": "The spectral gap of random graphs with given expected degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500003"}
