The authors work out the equations that connect the deformation of the block with the deformation of the shape embedded in it and then apply the desired transformation to the block in order to deform the embedded generic model until it fits the data. Two example applications are shown: fitting a jaw bone model to 3D MRI head data and fitting a scanned face model to MRI volume data. Both applications are akin to the development of a tool box for maxillofacial plastic surgery planning, with anatomically correct structures and realistic face appearance adapted to the individual patient.", "paper_title": "Generic approach to 3D elastic model fitting to volume data", "paper_id": "WOS:000273043800006"}
