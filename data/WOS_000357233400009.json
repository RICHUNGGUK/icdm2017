Clustering is widely used as a first step to interpreting high dimensional biological data, such as the gene expression data measured by microarrays. A good clustering algorithm should be efficient, reliable, and effective, as demonstrated by its capability of determining biologically relevant clusters. This paper proposes a new minimum spanning tree based heuristic B-MST, that is guided by an innovative objective function: the tightnesg and separation index (TSI). The TSI presented here obtains biologically meaningful clusters, making use of co-expression network topology, and this paper develops a local search procedure to minimize the TSI value. The proposed B-MST is tested by comparing results to: (1) adjusted rand index (ARI), for microarray data sets with known object classes, and (2) gene ontology (GO) annotations for data sets without documented object classes.
