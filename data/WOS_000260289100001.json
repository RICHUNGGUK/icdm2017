It has reduced search costs, opened up barriers to entry. and diminished distinctiveness of firms. Effective retention of customers allows firms to grow in size and popularity, thereby increasing their profitability. We extended Commitment-Trust theory, an expectation-confirmation model, and technology acceptance theory to develop a model of IS continuance intention of customers of web-based applications. Relationship commitment and trust were found to be central to IS continuance intention. Also, perceived empowerment influenced relationship commitment, while perceived security influenced trust. Our findings thus supported traditional intention factors, highlighting the role of trust as a stronger predictor of intention than commitment but, contradicting findings from marketing research, trust was found to be a stronger predictor of retention in the e-commerce context.
