This article presents a methodology which accounts for the aforementioned limitations in usability evaluation. A case study is presented, which illustrates the utility of the proposed methodology and indicates that the current methods underestimate the number of participants in usability evaluation studies.", "paper_title": "Effects of Importance and Detectability of Usability Problems on Sample Size Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000272798100008"}
