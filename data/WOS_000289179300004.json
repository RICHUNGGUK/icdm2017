The aim of the study is to design algorithms based on shape classification and to determine instructions executed on a chip as well as processed data sets. Information is extracted from the power consumption in order to recover secret information. Then geometrical features are determined and a syntactic analysis is achieved in order to recover secret algorithms and data. Some examples are given showing how code execution can be reversed on a recent secure component. These examples are essentially focused on instruction recovery but the algorithms also work on data recovery or on a combination of both instruction and data recovery. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
