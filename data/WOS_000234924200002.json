The intelligent system is a hybrid integration of two information processing modules: case-based reasoning and fuzzy ARTMAP-a supervised adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network with a multi-dimensional map. The developed system captures a company's strategic information, provides facilities to quantify qualitative attributes and analyses them alongside the quantitative attributes in an evaluation framework. Through the system, similar cases can be retrieved to enable managers to make effective use of their knowledge and experience of previously delivered technologies and projects as an input to the prioritization of future projects. Other salient features of the system include its ability to adapt and absorb new knowledge and responses pertaining to significant events in the business environment, as well as to extract and elucidate information from the knowledge database for explaining and justifying its analysis. The applicability of the developed system is evaluated using a real case study in collaboration with a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm.", "paper_title": "Managing manufacturing technology investments: an intelligent learning system approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000234924200002"}
