Using the crystal structure of p38 alpha, all the compounds were docked into the enzyme active site. The docking pose of each compound was subsequently used in a receptor-based alignment for the generation of the CoMSIA fields. \"Active\" and \"inactive\" compounds were used to build a Random Tree classification model using the docking score and the CoMSIA fields as input parameters. Domain of applicability indicated the compounds for which activity estimations can be accepted with confidence. For the active compounds, a 3D-QSAR CoMSIA model was subsequently built to accurately estimate the IC50 values. This novel multistep framework gives insight into the structural characteristics that affect the binding and the inhibitory activity of these analogues on p38 alpha MAP kinase, and it can be extended to other classes of small-molecule inhibitors. In addition, the simplicity of the proposed approach provides expansion to its applicability such as in virtual screening procedures.", "paper_title": "Molecular Modeling on Pyrimidine-Urea Inhibitors of TNF-alpha Production: An Integrated Approach Using a Combination of Molecular Docking, Classification Techniques, and 3D-QSAR CoMSIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000301884400008"}
