This autocorrelation leads to a large false- alarm rate. This article considers the problem of monitoring the mean of AR( 1) process with random error. We provide a simple algorithm to improve the estimation results of process parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed method can produce stable and adequate estimates for the AR( 1) process with random error, even though the sample size is small.", "paper_title": "Alternative estimation procedure in SPC when the process data are correlated", "paper_id": "WOS:000249549100004"}
