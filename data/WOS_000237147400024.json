We give a new proof method which is different from the method appearing in: K. Yanagi and H. W. Chen, \"Operator inequality and its application to information theory,\" Taiwanese J. Math., vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 407-416, Sep. 2000. We obtain the following results: C-n,C-Z (P) and C-n,C-FB,C-Z (P) are both concave functions of P, C-n,C-z(P) is a convex function of the noise covariance matrix and C-n,C-FB,C-Z(P) is a convex-like function of the noise covariance matrix. This new proof method is very elementary and the results shall help study the capacity of Gaussian channel. Finally, we state a conjecture concerning the convexity of C-n,C-FB,C-.(P).", "paper_title": "The convex-concave characteristics of Gaussian channel capacity functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400024"}
