The traffic safety problems of long tunnels caused by complex construction technology and management difficulties are becoming more and more significant. Nevertheless, there are no systematic studies on the \"Traffic\" safety of long tunnels. This paper makes use of speed variance index in place of the accident rate to analyze factors that have influence on tunnel safety by VISSIM, including lane number of tunnel, tunnel traffic volume, traffic composition, tunnel curve radius, tunnel slope gradient, and so on. Tunnel length is also one of the factors that have great effect on tunnel safety. Then, the studies try to model the relationship between the speed variation and some other selected traffic parameters related to the road tunnel traffic safety and build up a tunnel traffic safety assessment model. Finally, an application example is given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.", "paper_title": "COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY ASSESSMENT MODEL OF ROAD LONG TUNNEL BASED ON VISSIM", "paper_id": "WOS:000341990500004"}
