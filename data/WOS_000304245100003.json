This DSC problem is referred to as the generalized Gaussian CEO problem since it can be viewed as a generalization of the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem where the number of remote source K = 1. First, we provide a new outer region obtained using the entropy power inequality and an equivalent argument (in the sense of having the same rate-distortion region and Berger-Tung inner region) among a certain class of generalized Gaussian CEO problems. We then give two sufficient conditions for our new outer region to match the inner region achieved by Berger-Tung schemes, where the second matching condition implies that in the low-distortion regime, the Berger-Tung inner rate region is always tight, while in the high-distortion regime, the same region is tight if a certain condition holds. The sum-rate part of the outer region is also studied and shown to meet the Berger-Tung sum-rate upper bound under a certain condition, which is obtained using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the underlying convex semidefinite optimization problem, and is in general weaker than the aforesaid two for rate region tightness.", "paper_title": "On the Generalized Gaussian CEO Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100003"}
