Firstly, the existence of anti-periodic solution is discussed by using the method of coincidence degree and M-matrices. Then some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the global exponential stability of anti-periodic solution for such neural networks. The obtained results are new and improve some earlier publications. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
