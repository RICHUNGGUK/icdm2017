The well-known answer is \"no, Kolmogorov complexity is not computable.\" Faced with this barrier, one might instead seek a short list of candidates which includes a laconic description. Remarkably such approximations exist. This paper presents an efficient algorithm which generates a polynomial-size list containing an optimal description for a given input string. Along the way, we employ expander graphs and randomness dispersers to obtain an Explicit Online Matching Theorem for bipartite graphs and a refinement of Muchnik's Conditional Complexity Theorem.
