This representation is used to obtain direct controllability and observability criteria of this same class of discrete time 2-D systems. Not only classical controllability properties are considered, where control of the system is obtained by choosing its inhomogeneity appropriately, but also controllability of the system by steering it through boundary data control. From the point of view of technical applications, for instance in high pressure gas network modelling (see Azevedo-PerdicoA(0)lis and Jank in Proceedings of n-DS, international workshop on multidimensional systems, Thessaloniki. 2009), it seems to be more reliable to consider boundary data controls. Therefore, in this paper we emphasise boundary data control properties of the system. A disturbed optimal boundary control problem with a quadratic criterion is also solved.", "paper_title": "Boundary control of discrete repetitive processes with smoothing: controllability, observability and disturbance attenuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347953000008"}
