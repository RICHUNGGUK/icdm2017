We regard that the road in SAR images can be represented by the B-spline curve. Firstly, we manually select the road's extremities. Secondly, we calculate the each pixels's road membership value using local road detector in the original SAR images. Thirdly, with particle swarm optimization that is one of the most powerful methods for optimization problem we obtain the optimal B-spline control points from the result of road detection. Finally, according to the optimal B-spline control points, we obtain the B-spline curve that is the result of road extraction. The experimental result shows that the method in the paper can accurately extract the road.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization for road extraction in SAR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300040"}
