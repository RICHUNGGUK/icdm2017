In retina, input data was processed information processing that was data reduction, edge detection, and emphasizing region. The processed image was recognized by brain. Starting from research on the human visual system, we proposed algorithms that process data reduction and edge detection by using wavelet transform and emphasizing region contrast. The proposed retinal model improves sharpening spatial edges in the amacrine outputs. In simulations, the proposed model shows processing the retina outputs in the levels And compares with outputs.", "paper_title": "The study on three stages in retinal mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900121"}
