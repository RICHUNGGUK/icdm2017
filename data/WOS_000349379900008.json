We derive s-ipr as a supervised extension of our previously proposed iterative projections and rotations (ipr) algorithm for incoherent dictionary learning, and we employ it to learn incoherent sub-spaces that model signals belonging to different classes. We test our method as a feature transform for supervised classification, first by visualising transformed features from a synthetic dataset and from the 'iris' dataset, then by using the resulting features in a classification experiment.", "paper_title": "Learning Incoherent Subspaces: Classification via Incoherent Dictionary Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000349379900008"}
