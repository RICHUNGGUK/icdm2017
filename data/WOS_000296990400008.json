Elizalde and Winkler showed that (1) any n-element permutation can be sorted by n - 1 or less one-dimensional homing operations; (2) no n-element permutation admits a sequence of 2(n - 1) or more homing operations; and (3) the number of n-element permutations that admit a sequence of 2(n - 1) - 1 homing operations is super-exponential in n. In the present paper, we study sorting via two-dimensional homing operations and obtain the following observations: (1) Any m x n permutation can be sorted by at most mn - 1 two-dimensional homing operations. (2) If both vertical-first and horizontal-first homing operations are allowed, for any integers to m >= 2 and n >= 2, there is an m x n permutation that admits an infinite sequence of two-dimensional homing operations. (3) If only vertical-first homing operations are allowed, for any integers to m >= 3 and n >= 2, there is an m x n permutation that admits an infinite sequence of two-dimensional homing operations. (4) The number of 2 x n permutations that admit sequences of Omega(2(n)) vertical-first two-dimensional homing operations is super-exponential in n. (5) No 2 x n permutation admits a sequence of (2n)! or more vertical-first two-dimensional homing operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
