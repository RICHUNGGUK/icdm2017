Despite some studies about the impact on different aspects of the organization of these technologies, few studies have empirically tested their effects. This study confirms that the there is a positive relationship between Web 2.0 adoption and Innovativeness and between Innovativeness and Business Performance. We can conclude that Innovativeness is a mediating variable between Web 2.0 and Finn Performance. The relationships were tested in a sample of 244 hospitality firms, using a structural modeling approach. The results are presented and discussed. In the last section of the article, the conclusions are discussed and finally, some future lines of research are suggested.", "paper_title": "An application of Structural Equation Modeling for Continuous Improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000340077000020"}
