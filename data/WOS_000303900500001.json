The directional intra prediction has been proved as an effective tool for intra picture coding. However, in a directional intra prediction based coding structure, there is a considerable gap between the transform efficiency of DCT and the optimal transform KLT. In this paper, we analyze these problems and propose a pixel-wise directional intra prediction (PDIP) method to solve this problem. This method exploits the reconstruction value of the adjacent pixels to predict the current pixel, and keeps the block-based lossy coding structure of H.264/AVC. The proposed method can significantly improve the coding efficiency with little decoding complexity increment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
