The scheme is based on mapping on a SOM the process measurements and the calculated variables which provide insight into the chemical phenomena involved in fouling to classify faulty process conditions. The time-variant nature of the board making process was taken into account by regularly re-training the SOM. The monitoring scheme is demonstrated with industrial data, and the results are presented and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
