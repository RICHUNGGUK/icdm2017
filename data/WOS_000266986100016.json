In this paper we describe skinning templates, which define common deformation behaviors for common joint types. This abstraction allows skinning solutions to be shared and reused, and they allow a user to quickly explore many possible alternatives for the skinning behavior of a character. The skinning templates are implemented using cage-based deformations, which offer a flexible design space within which to develop reusable skinning behaviors. We demonstrate the interactive use of skinning templates to quickly explore alternate skinning behaviors for 3D models.", "paper_title": "Reusable Skinning Templates Using Cage-based Deformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100016"}
