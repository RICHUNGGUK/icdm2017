Most publications focus on the creation of models for the uncertainty quantification, however, neglect the inaccuracy of the applied finite element model itself. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of mesh quality on stochastic cogging torque calculations. Design/methodology/approach - The presented work consists of three steps. At first, a conventional analysis of the influence of mesh accuracy onto cogging torque is presented. Afterwards, the method is extended to stochastic calculations. Based on a comparison of the convergence behavior of both approaches, a method for more accurate cogging torque predictions with fewer necessary calculations is derived. Findings - An improved method to calculate probability predictions at minimum computational cost is presented and applied. Research limitations/implications - The presented approach requires the exact knowledge of the system's stochastic variation boundaries. Originality/value - A fast method for more accurate stochastic cogging torque calculations is developed.", "paper_title": "Mesh discretization for faster and more accurate probabilistic simulations: applied to cogging torque calculations in electrical machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000354645900017"}
