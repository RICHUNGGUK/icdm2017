Two parameters generated by loss functions divide the universe into three regions as the decision of acceptance, deferment and rejection. In this paper, we discuss the semantics of loss functions, and utilize the differences of losses replace actual losses to construct a new \"four-level\" approach of probabilistic rules choosing criteria. Ten types of probabilistic rough set models can be generated by the \"four-level\" approach and form two groups of models: two-way probabilistic decision models and three-way probabilistic decision models. A reasonable decision with these criteria is demonstrated by an illustration of oil investment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
