Peer-to-peer VoIP (voice over IP) networks, exemplified by Skype [5], are becoming increasingly popular due to their significant cost advantage and richer call forwarding features than traditional public switched telephone networks. One of the most important features of a VoIP network is privacy (for VoIP clients). Unfortunately, most peer-to-peer VoIP networks neither provide personalization nor guarantee a quantifiable privacy level. In this paper, we propose novel flow analysis attacks that demonstrate the vulnerabilities of peer-to-peer VoIP networks to privacy attacks. We then address two important challenges in designing privacy-aware VoIP networks: Can we provide personalized privacy guarantees for VoIP clients that allow them to select privacy requirements on a per-call basis? How to design VoIP protocols to support customizable privacy guarantee? This paper proposes practical solutions to address these challenges using a quantifiable k-anonymity metric and a privacy-aware VoIP route setup and route maintenance protocols. We present detailed experimental evaluation that demonstrates the performance and scalability of our protocol, while meeting customizable privacy guarantees.", "paper_title": "Privacy in VoIP Networks: Flow Analysis Attacks and Defense", "paper_id": "WOS:000287580000008"}
