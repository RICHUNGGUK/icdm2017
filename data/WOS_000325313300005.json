It has been applied to various fields, but there has been no detailed study of the various neuro-fuzzy models applicable to rule generation. In this paper, an experimentally verified five-layer and three-phase network is presented, which shows the effectiveness with which the neuro-fuzzy system automatically determines membership functions and selects activation fuzzy rules using both system identification and vibration control examples in engineering applications.", "paper_title": "Development of a rule selection mechanism by using neuro-fuzzy methodology for structural vibration suppression", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300005"}
