In this research, we provide an improvement in web caching by combining the result of web usage mining with traditional web caching techniques. Web cache replacement policy is used to select which object should be removed from the cache when the cache is full and which new object should be put into the cache. There are several attributes used for selecting the object to be removed, such as the size of the object, the number of times the object was used, and the time when the object was added into the cache. However, the flaw in these previous approaches is that each object is treated separately without considering the relation among those objects. We have developed a system that can record users' browsing behavior at the resources level. By using information gathered from this system, we can improve web cache replacement policy so that the number of cache hits will increase, resulting in a faster web browsing experience and less data bandwidth, especially at lower cache storage environments such as on smart phones.", "paper_title": "Web Caching Replacement Algorithm Based on Web Usage Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326264200005"}
