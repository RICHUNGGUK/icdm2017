Due to medical data regulations, security of BSNs is very important. However, the operational resources of biosensor nodes in BSNs are very restricted, and traditional security technologies are not directly applicable to BSNs. Due to characteristics of biosensors, time synchronization and low-energy communication are two challenging problems for BSNs. In this paper, a fuzzy commitment technology with weak time synchronization mechanism for keys negotiation is developed, with a multihop route key management scheme proposed for efficient energy consumption management, including an energy-based multihop-route-choice method. Security analyses and performance evaluation have been provided to validate the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Key Management Scheme for Body Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325170700009"}
