In this paper, we sketch the common properties of a class of networks called Matching Composition Networks (MCNs), such that the conditional edge-fault pancyclicity of MCNs can be determined from the derived properties. We then apply our technical theorem to show that an m-dimensional hyper-Petersen network is conditional (2m - 5)-edge-fault pancyclic.", "paper_title": "Pancyclicity of Matching Composition Networks under the Conditional Fault Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000298560500012"}
