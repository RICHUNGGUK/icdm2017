It is discovered by simulations, among the several kinds of networks, that the small-world network has the largest risk assessment of attack-induced cascade; the risk assessment of three other networks are all very low and the most protection against attack should be given to the small-world network accordingly. Furthermore, the percentage of the most fragile nodes in the scale-free network is very low, compared with that in the small-world network.", "paper_title": "RISK ASSESSMENT OF ATTACK-INDUCED CASCADE IN COMPLEX NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294809900001"}
