Word segmentation is one of the most important pre-processes of Chinese information processing. This paper reviews some popular word segmentation algorithms. Based on an improved Converse Chinese dictionary and an optimized reverse maximum matching algorithm, a Chinese word segmentation system is proposed. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the substantially ameliorated accuracy and speed of the system.", "paper_title": "Design of Chinese word segmentation system based on improved Chinese converse dictionary and reverse maximum matching algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300017"}
