Its use for tsunami simulations is introduced to reconstruct the initial condition automatically from buoy measurements. Based on this feature, a real-time tsunami model is developed, using several numerical tools such as a high-order discretization, hp-refinement, parallel dynamic load balancing and adjoint-based data assimilation. The model is able to reconstruct the tsunami source and accurately forecast its far-field propagation (e. g. from Japan to Chile, at a distance of about 17000 km) in a computational time 20 times faster than the physical propagation time, to which the data collecting time needs to be added. The work presented constitutes a step towards an efficient nonlinear tsunami warning model. Additional features could be added for more complete realistic forecasts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
