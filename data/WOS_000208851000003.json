The utilized fault model is the one in which the attacker is assumed to be able to fault a small number of coefficients in a specific polynomial during the signing process but cannot control the exact location of the injected transient faults. For NTRUsign with parameters (N, q = p(l), B, standard, N), when the attacker is able to skip the norm-bound signature checking step, our attack needs one fault, succeeds with probability approximate to 1 - 1/p and requires O((qN)(t)) steps when the number of faulted polynomial coefficients is upper bounded by t. The attack is also applicable to NTRUSign utilizing the transpose NTRU lattice but it requires double the number of fault injections. Different countermeasures against the proposed attack are investigated.", "paper_title": "Fault analysis of the NTRUSign digital signature scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000208851000003"}
