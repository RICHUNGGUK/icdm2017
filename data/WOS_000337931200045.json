The goal of the studied problem is to mine and annotate a semantic relation with temporal, concise, and structured information, which can release the explicit, implicit, and diversity semantic relations between entities. The temporal semantic annotations can help users to learn and understand the unfamiliar or new emerged semantic relations between entities. The proposed temporal semantic annotation structure integrates the features from IEEE and Renlifang. We propose a general method to generate temporal semantic annotation of a semantic relation between entities by constructing its connection entities, lexical syntactic patterns, context sentences, context graph, and context communities. Empirical experiments on two different datasets including a LinkedIn dataset and movie star dataset show that the proposed method is effective and accurate. Different from the manually generated annotation repository such as Wikipedia and LinkedIn, the proposed method can automatically mine the semantic relation between entities and does not need any prior knowledge such as ontology or the hierarchical knowledge base. The proposed method can be used on some applications, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed temporal semantic relations on many web mining tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
