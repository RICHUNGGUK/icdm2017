Parameters for the metal cations are derived from an ab initio bottom-up strategy. MD simulations of six cations solvated in bulk water are subsequently performed with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The calculated first-and second shell hydration numbers, water residence times, and free energies of hydration are consistent with experimental/theoretical values leading to a predictive modeling of f-elements compounds.", "paper_title": "Hydration gibbs free energies of open and closed shell trivalent lanthanide and actinide cations from polarizable molecular dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000343720200028"}
