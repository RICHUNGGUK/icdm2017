A critical part of the MAC layer specification is packet scheduling, which resolves contention for bandwidth and determines the transmission order of users. Evaluating the performance packet scheduling algorithms is of utmost importance towards realizing large-scale WiMAX deployment. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive performance study of scheduling algorithms in point-to-multipoint mode of OFDM-based WiMAX networks. We first make a classification of WiMAX scheduling algorithms, then simulate a representative number of algorithms in each class taking into account that vital characteristics of the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer and OFDM physical layer. We evaluate the algorithms with respect to their abilities to support multiple classes of service, providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees, fairness amongst service classes and bandwidth utilization. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive performance study has been reported in the literature. Simulation results indicate that none of the current algorithms is capable of effectively supporting all WiMAX classes of service. We demonstrate that an efficient, fair and robust scheduler for WiMAX is still an open research area. We conclude our study by making recommendations that can be used by WiMax protocol designers.
