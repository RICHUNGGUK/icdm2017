Furthermore, while visual representation facilitates design, maintenance and comprehension of planning domains and problems, very few systems incorporate it. This paper presents VLEPPO, an integrated system aiming at visually modeling planning domains and problems through a convenient graphical interface, while maintaining compatibility with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), with import and export features. Solutions to planning problems can be obtained by invoking different planners employing the web services technology. The demonstration of the system is performed through a case study involving web service composition viewed as a planning problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
