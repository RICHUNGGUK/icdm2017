We investigate the problem for any constant h and d > 0. We prove the first nontrivial lower bound on the solution cost for almost all Euclidean instances (i.e. the lower bound holds with high probability). Then we introduce an easy-to-implement, fast divide et impera heuristic and we prove that its solution cost matches the lower bound. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
