Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) is a library of spatial analytical functions written in the open-source language, Python. As part of a larger scale effort toward developing cyberinfrastructure of GIScience, we examine the particular case of choropleth map classification through alternative parallel implementations of the Fisher-Jenks optimal classification method using a multi-core, single desktop environment. The implementations rely on three different parallel Python libraries, PyOpenCL, Parallel Python, (PP) and Multiprocessing. Our results point to the dominance of the CPU-based Parallel Python and Multiprocessing implementations over the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-based PyOpenCL approach.", "paper_title": "Parallel optimal choropleth map classification in PySAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000319047600010"}
