However, a serious drawback of these approaches is the common misalignments of H-1 NMR spectra. To overcome this problem, bucketing or binning techniques have been used. In this work, an algorithm is proposed to perform an optimized bucketing that yields better results than the conventional bucketing implemented in some commercial software. The improvement proposed here for optimized bucketing deals with the bucket boundaries, which are defined by local minima from average NMR spectrum over all samples. Applicability of the new algorithm, named OBA (optimized bucketing algorithm), is demonstrated for real data sets in comparison to other alignment approaches and conventional bucketing.
