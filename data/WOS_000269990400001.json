This requires the construction of compact and delicate geometric features in the injection moulds that produce these parts. It is now common practice to employ electric discharge machining (EDM) whenever the conventional machining process fails to machine such delicate features. Although CAD/CAM systems are widely used in mould design and manufacturing, and specific commercial CAD/CAM systems that are customized for injection mould applications are also available, there are still no intelligent CAD tools that address the specific requirements of EDM electrode design. The aim of this research is to develop an intelligent CAD tool that supports EDM electrode design. This CAD tool uses a new technique that recursively splits the EDM region into sub-regions until machinable electrodes can be constructed. The CAD tool has been implemented and integrated into a commercial CAD/CAM system, and 40 different real designs has been used to test its capability in handling a wide variety of geometric shapes. Performance data show that the efficiency of the design process can be improved by at least 50%, with a potential to achieve 85% through improved implementation and further research.
