This landmark is based on extracting the contour free of obstacles around the robot from a local evidence grid. This contour is represented by its curvature, calculated by a noise-resistant function which adapts to the natural scale of the contour at each point. Then, curvature is reduced to a short feature vector by using Principal Component Analysis. The landmark calculation method has been successfully tested in a medium scale real environment using a Pioneer robot with Polaroid sonar sensors.", "paper_title": "A new sonar-based landmark for localization in indoor environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241456100009"}
