The information capacity of these protocols is twice of the original protocols and their security is ensured by the use of detection time slots, random choice of bases and quantum entanglement. These double-coding protocols are feasible with present technology.", "paper_title": "DOUBLING THE CAPACITY OF QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION BY USING BOTH POLARIZATION AND DIFFERENTIAL PHASE SHIFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000265087300006"}
