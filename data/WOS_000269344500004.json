The key point of the model is that it could reconstruct images with blur and non-uniformly distributed noise. We develop this approach by adding several statistical control parameters to the cost functional, and these parameters could be adaptively determined by the given observed image. In this way, we could adaptively balance the performance of the fit-to-data term and the regularization term. The Numerical experiments have demonstrated the significant effectiveness and robustness of our model in restoring blurred images with mixed Gaussian noise or salt-and-pepper noise.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Method for Recovering Image from Mixed Noisy Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000269344500004"}
