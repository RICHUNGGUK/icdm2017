Due to the unique characteristics of underwater acoustic communication, providing energy-efficient and low-latency routing protocols for UWSNs is challenging. Major challenges are water currents, limited resources, and long acoustic propagation delay. Network topology of UWSNs is dynamic and complex as sensors have always been moving with currents. Some proposed protocols adopt geographic routing to address this problem, but three-dimensional localization is hard to obtain in underwater environment. As depth-based routing protocol (DBR) uses depth information only which is much more easier to obtain, it is more practical for UWSNs. However, depth information is not enough to restrict packets to be forwarded within a particular area. Packets may be forwarded through multiple paths which might cause energy waste and increase end-to-end delay. In this paper, we introduce underwater time of arrival (ToA) ranging technique to address the problem above. To maintain all the original advantages of DBR, we make the following contributions: energy-efficient depth-based routing protocol that reduces redundancy energy cost in some blind zones; low-latency depth-based routing protocol that is able to deliver a packet through an optimal path. The proposed protocols are validated through extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Improving Both Energy and Time Efficiency of Depth-Based Routing for Underwater Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364076500001"}
