Accordingly, this study devises a multilevel model for examining the links among contextual variables and collects data via a multi-informant questionnaire design. To clarify the multilevel influence of these individual-level (e.g., knowledge sharing) and organizational-level variables (e.g., organizational memory) on individual-level outcome (e.g., employee service performance), this study applies hierarchical linear modeling to examine three hypotheses. Using data from a study of 266 healthcare employees and 34 supervisors sampled from 34 hospitals, the HLM results clearly indicate how organizational memory moderates the relationship between knowledge sharing and employee service performance. Finally, the findings of this study and their implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
