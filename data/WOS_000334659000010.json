It uses a noninvertible transformation to map an original template to a transformed domain to prevent the recovery of the original template from a compromised transformed template. Generally, cross-template attacks over cancellable template schemes are evaluated through statistic independence metrics. In this paper, we investigate approaches to launch attacks through cryptanalysis. Four typical cancelable fingerprint template design algorithms have been investigated by applying the attack via record multiplicity attack to retrieve the original template. Concrete attack examples are also given to make the demonstration more intuitive and comprehensive. The results show that all of them are vulnerable if an attacker can obtain multiple transformed templates and their corresponding transformation parameters.
