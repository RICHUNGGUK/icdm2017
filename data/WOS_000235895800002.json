To obtain the scoring that corresponds to the best alternative, or the ranking of the alternatives, we need to use a total order for the graded numbers involved in the problem. In this article, we consider a definition of such a total order, which is based upon two subjective aspects: the degree of optimism/pessimism and the liking for risk/safety. As several operations, such as product, quotient, and so forth, of fuzzy numbers do not preserve the triangularity, we also use the graded numbers that are analogous to the fuzzy numbers; however, the operations with graded numbers are carried out as a simple extension of operations with real intervals.
