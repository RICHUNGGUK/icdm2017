The first model is derived from original TAM that includes perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude and behavioral intention, while the alternative model is a parsimonious version in which the attitude was taken out. The results indicated that TAM, either original or parsimonious, is successful in explaining user intention to use wireless technology in organizations. In addition, the parsimonious model showed a better model fit than that of the original model. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
