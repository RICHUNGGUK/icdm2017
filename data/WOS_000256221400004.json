Potential flowsheets include stream bypassing and mixing and use sharp separations as well as non-sharp splits where key component distribution is allowed. Compared to conventional sharp distillation sequence synthesis, this leads to a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem of increased complexity, including non-convexities as well as multi-modalities. Product specifications create additional constraints while simultaneously call for a rigorous modeling of the non-key distribution. A synthesis method is proposed that models the various flowsheet configurations with a new and flexible superstructure concept and connects the gradient-free optimization technique of application-orientedly developed Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to the rigorous modeling capabilities of the Aspen plus (TM) simulation system, thus enabling realistic process design and cost objective function calculation. The re-examination of two published examples illustrates the applicability and the potential of the approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
