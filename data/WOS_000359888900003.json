Numerical experiments are conducted in the framework of high-dimensional semi-supervised learning based on some popular data sets. The classification accuracy rate is used as the performance metric to quantitatively assess the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the new method (named SemKFR) can efficiently handle the nonlinear features in these data sets. Moreover, the comparison between SemKFR and other algorithms also justify its competitiveness in the semi-supervised learning area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
