To cope with the bus planning problem, it is desirable to consider this issue in early floorplanning stage. Recently, the bus-driven floorplanning problem has attracted much attention in the literature. However, current algorithms adopt an over-simplified formulation which ignores the orientation of the bus pin, the chip performance may be deteriorated. In this paper, we propose the bus-driven floorplanning algorithm that fully considers the impact of the bus pin. By fully utilizing the position and orientation of the bus pin, bus bendings are not restricted to occur at the module of the same bus, then more flexible bus shape is obtained. With more flexibility on the bus shape, the size of the solution space is increased and a better bus-driven floorplanning solution can be obtained. In conference version, compared with the bus-driven floorplanner 161, experimental results show that our algorithm performs better in runtime by 3.5 x, bus wirelength by 1.4 x, and deadspace by 1.2 x, respectively. In this paper, we improve the algorithm in [111 to obtain better driver-load delay variation among all bus bits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
