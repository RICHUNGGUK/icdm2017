In this method cognitive radios share the same base software defined radio ontology, which allows the radios to understand the concepts in a uniform way, thus enabling transfer of more complex concepts from one node to another. In the process of reconfiguration, nodes can receive specifications of waveforms expressed in Web Ontology Language (OWL) and rules and then automatically configure their processing according to the specification. Such specifications contain both structural descriptions of software components and descriptions of finite state machines necessary to compose the waveform from simpler software modules. The waveform configuration process encompasses, first, generating state machines and building a model of the waveform by generating OWL individuals and relationships between them using the inference engine and the specified rules. The constructed model is then used to instantiate state machines and other software components and to connect them according to the model. The result of the overall process is such that a cognitive radio is able to receive a description of a waveform it did not know before (from another cognitive radio) and construct the waveform from the description. Then both radios can use the waveform for further communication. A proof-of-concept system has been built confirming the feasibility of the proposed method. In the process of this system's evaluation three different waveforms (BPSK31, QPSK31 and RTTY) have been described in OWL and rules, the descriptions were successfully transferred from one node to another and then used by the receiving node to construct fully functional software modules implementing the waveforms.", "paper_title": "Waveform reconstruction from ontological description", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500019"}
