Description of the eigenspace (set of all eigenvectors) for matrices in max-min or max-drast fuzzy algebra was presented in previous papers. In this paper the eigenspace of a three-dimensional fuzzy matrix in max-Lukasiewicz algebra is investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions are shown under which the eigenspace restricted to increasing eigenvectors of a given matrix is non-empty, and the structure of the increasing eigenspace is described. Complete characterization of the general eigenspace structure for arbitrary three-dimensional fuzzy matrix, using simultaneous row and column permutations of the matrix, is presented in Sections 4 and 5, with numerical examples in Section 6.", "paper_title": "EIGENSPACE OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAX-LUKASIEWICZ FUZZY MATRIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000303851300011"}
