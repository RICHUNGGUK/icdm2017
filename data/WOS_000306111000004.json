Previous attempts to use algorithmic tools in this field focused typically on tempo and dynamics alone. We base our analysis on ten different performance categories (such as bowing, vibrato and durations). We adapt phylogenetic analysis tools to resolve the inherent inconsistencies between these categories, and describe the relationships between performances. Taking samples from 29 different performances of two pieces from Bach's sonatas for solo violin, we construct a 'phylogenetic' tree, representing the relationship between those performances. The tree supports several interesting relations previously conjectured by the musicology community, such as the importance of date of birth and recording period in determining interpretative style. Our work also highlights some unexpected inter-connections between performers, and challenges previous assumptions regarding the significance of educational background and affiliation to the historically informed performance (HIP) style.", "paper_title": "A Phylogenetic Approach to Music Performance Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000306111000004"}
