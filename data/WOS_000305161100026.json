The time-varying delay is interval-range. Although large delay period (LDP) is often present in practical control systems, the problems of stability analysis for such systems have been unsolved to date. In this paper, a new method based on switching technique is proposed to solve the case of LDP. It addresses how long and how frequent the LDP can be and still maintain the system exponentially stable. We first utilize switched delay systems, which may include an unstable subsystem, to model such a system. Then, the concepts of frequency and length rate of LDP are introduced. Next, based on a novel piecewise Lyapunov functional including the large-delay-integral terms (LDITs), sufficient conditions guaranteeing exponential stability are developed. Without LDP, the criterion obtained in this paper contains results already published as a special case. Two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR SYSTEMS WITH LARGE DELAY PERIOD: A SWITCHING METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100026"}
