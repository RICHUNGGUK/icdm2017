The hop count bound suffices to ensure a certain probability of the data being delivered to the BS within a given maximum delay under a light traffic model. We observe that the problem is NP-Hard. For this problem, we propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm based on iteratively constructing shortest path trees and heuristically pruning away the relay nodes used until the hop count bound is violated. Results show that the algorithm performs efficiently in various randomly generated network scenarios; in over 90% of the tested scenarios, it gave solutions that were either optimal or were worse than optimal by just one relay. We then use random graph techniques to obtain, under a certain stochastic setting, an upper bound on the average case approximation ratio of a class of algorithms (including the proposed algorithm) for this problem as a function of the number of source nodes, and the hop count bound. To the best of our knowledge, the average case analysis is the first of its kind in the relay placement literature. Since the design is based on a light traffic model, we also provide simulation results (using models for the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer and medium access control) to assess the traffic levels up to which the QoS objectives continue to be met.
