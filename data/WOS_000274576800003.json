Several paradigmatic wave problems including simple wave equation, convection-diffusion equation, driven harmonic oscillating charge and nonlinear Korteweg-cle Vries (KdV) equation are solved with this method and calibrated with known solutions to demonstrate its use. With this method, time marching scheme is explicit, and the nonreflecting boundary condition is automatically fulfilled. Compared to other solution methods in coordinate space, this method preserves the complete information of the wave during time evolution which is an useful feature especially for scattering problems.
