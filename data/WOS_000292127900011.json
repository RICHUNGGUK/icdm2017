However, many DHT implementations in the wild, such as Kad and Mainline, do not enforce such uniqueness. Most previous works and measurements on DHTs do not take into account that IDs among peers may not be unique. Unfortunately, we observe that a significant portion of peers, i.e. 19.5% of the peers in Kad and 4.0% of the peers in Mainline, do not have unique IDs. These repetitions would mislead the measurements and modeling on those networks. We further focus on investigating the repetition in Kad considering its wider usage and more serious situation of repetition. We observe that there are a large number of peers that frequently change their UDP ports, and there are a few IDs that repeat for a large number of times and all peers with these IDs do not respond to Kad protocol. We also analyze the effects of ID repetitions under simplified settings and find that the current repetition degrades Kad's performance on publishing and searching, but has insignificant effect on lookup process. These measurement and analysis are useful to further determine the sources of repetitions and are also useful for finding suitable parameters in publishing and searching processes in DHT networks without compulsive ID uniqueness.", "paper_title": "ID Repetition in Structured P2P Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292127900011"}
