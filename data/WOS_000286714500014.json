The upcoming IEEE 802.11v standard is expected to play a key role because it will include new specific mechanisms for TOA-based positioning with WEAN. This article analyzes some of these new capabilities and evaluates the performance enhancement that they can provide in practice. To this end, a comparative assessment between an existing WEAN TOA-based approach that uses IEEE 802.11 b/g and an analogous solution employing IEEE 802.11v is performed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
