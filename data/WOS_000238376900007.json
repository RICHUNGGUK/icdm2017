Data traffic is transmitted with the DCF, while voice transmission is carried out with the PCF. Based on the performance analysis of the MAC protocol for integrated data and voice transmission by simulation, this paper puts forward a self-adaptive transmission scheme to support multi-service over the IEEE 802.11 WLAN. The simulation results show that, on the premise of satisfying the maximum allowable delay of packet voice. the self-adaptive transmission scheme can improve the data traffic performance and increase the WLAN capacity through dynamic and appropriate adjustment of the protocol parameters. Especially, voice traffic is sensitive to delay jitter, and the self-adaptive scheme can effectively decrease it. Finally, it is worth noting that the adaptive scheme is easy to be realized, whereas no change in the MAC protocol is needed.
