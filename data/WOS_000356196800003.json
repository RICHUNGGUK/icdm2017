Environmental researchers have recently maximized the synergy between passive sensors and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for land cover classification by means of machine learning. Although object-based paradigm is frequently used to classify high resolution imagery, it often requires a high level of expertise and time effort. Contextual classification may lead to similar results with a decrease in time and costs for non-expert users. This work shows a novel contextual classifier based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an Evolutionary Majority Voting (SVM-EMV) to develop thematic maps from LiDAR and imagery data. Subsequently, the performance of SVM-EMV is compared to that achieved by a pixel-based SVM as well as to a contextual classified based on SVM and MRF. The classifiers were tested over three different areas of Spain with well differentiated environmental characteristics. Results show that SVM-EMV statistically outperforms the rest (SVM, SVM-MRF) for the three datasets obtaining a 77%, 91% and 92% of global accuracy for Trabada, Huelva and Alto Tajo, respectively.
