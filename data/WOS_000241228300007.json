Based on the modified descriptor, a new measurement, Angle Measurement, is proposed for image shape analysis. The rationality of this measurement is analyzed and its mathematical definition is given. We use it for rose flower shape analysis and the experiment results show that this measurement is quite efficient for image shape analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
