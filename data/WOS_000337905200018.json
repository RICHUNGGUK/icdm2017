The reason is ever increasing complexity of processors, which modern EDA tools struggle to keep up with. This paper focuses on the design of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), a significant part of the whole processor design flow. Optimal design of an instruction set for a particular combination of available hardware resources and software requirements is crucial for building processors with high performance and energy efficiency, and is a challenging task involving a lot of heuristics and high-level design decisions. This paper presents a new compositional approach to formal specification and synthesis of ISAs. The approach is based on a new formalism, called Conditional Partial Order Graphs, capable of capturing common behavioural patterns shared by processor instructions, and therefore providing a very compact and efficient way to represent and manipulate ISAs. The Event-B modelling framework is used as a formal specification and verification back-end to guarantee correctness of ISA specifications. We demonstrate benefits of the presented methodology on several examples, including Intel 8051 microcontroller.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Processor Instruction Sets from High-Level ISA Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000337905200018"}
