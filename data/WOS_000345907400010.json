In this work, we explore whether a stacked-detector configuration with a germanium and a silicon detector, used with I-123 (27-32, 159 keV), where little multiplexing occurs in the Si projections, can reduce image artifacts caused by highly-multiplexed Ge projections. Simulations are first used to determine a reconstruction method that combines the Si and Ge projections to maximize image quality. Next, simulations of different pinhole configurations (varying projection multiplexing) in conjunction with digital phantoms are used to examine whether additional Si projections mitigate artifacts from the multiplexing in the Ge projections. Reconstructed images using both Si and Ge data are compared to those using Ge data alone. Normalized mean-square error and normalized standard deviation provide a quantitative evaluation of reconstructed images' error and noise, respectively, and are used to evaluate the impact of the additional nonmultiplexed data on image quality. For a qualitative comparison, the differential point response function is used to examine multiplexing artifacts. Results show that in cases of highly-multiplexed Ge projections, the addition of low-multiplexed Si projections helps to reduce image artifacts both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "paper_title": "Reducing Multiplexing Artifacts in Multi-Pinhole SPECT With a Stacked Silicon-Germanium System: A Simulation Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345907400010"}
