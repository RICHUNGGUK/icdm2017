At present, there is a high demand from industry for a new machining technique that can efficiently cut pockets. Aggressive rough machining, in which the largest possible cutters are always employed and are fully immersed in workpieces, can be a solution. Although aggressive roughing is by far the most efficient machining strategy, compared to prior pocketing methods, no computer numerical control (CNC) programming technique has been developed to support it, resulting in few applications in machine shops. To address this urgent industrial need, based on the medial axis transform of a pocket, this work proposes an optimal approach to multiple tool selection and their numerical control (NC) path generation for aggressive roughing of the pocket. First, the NC paths of a specific tool are quickly generated using the pocket's medial axis transform. Thanks to the unique characteristic of the medial axis transform, the paths can ensure the tool the largest accessible space for pocketing. At the same time, they can guarantee the tool to be free of gouging and interference. Then, an optimization model of selecting multiple cutters and generating their NC paths is built in order to achieve the highest efficiency of the aggressive rough machining. To demonstrate the advantages of this innovative approach, two examples are rendered, and their results are compared to those obtained by the existing methods. This approach can be directly implemented into current CAD/CAM software to promote aggressive rough machining of pockets in industry. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
