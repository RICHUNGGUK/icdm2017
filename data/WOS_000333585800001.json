To overcome the limitations, a novel localization scheme is then proposed, which includes site survey, received signal comparison, and location correction phases. The main improvement of our proposed scheme is to filter the noises and interference added to the received RSSI signal; the detailed procedure is then provided with mathematical analysis. Finally, the experiment and simulation results are presented with analysis.", "paper_title": "Improving the Indoor Localization Accuracy for CPS by Reorganizing the Fingerprint Signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000333585800001"}
