However, nowadays it has never been more imperative for educators to understand how to adapt new functionalities and technologies into real teaching contexts to improve knowledge construction; web-based real-time experimentation under a collaborative environment can be a good solution. This article presents a web-based tool, the Collaborative Lab for FPGA-based Digital Image Processing, that has been applied as a teaching aid in an undergraduate course using digital image processing and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technologies. Finally, collaborative experimentation in diverse digital image processing practices is shown. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
