Those protocols can be divided into two categories: ALOHA-based and binary query tree (QT) based algorithms. The ALOHA-based protocols avoid collisions by distributing tags into different stochastic timeslots. In contrast, the QT-based protocols utilize prefix matching techniques, in the meanwhile, achieving the reliable identification throughput. This paper proposes a kind of QT protocol, called enhanced BQT (EBQT), which is based on our previous BQT (Bit collision detection based Query Tree) [19]. In addition to the employments of individual bit collision detection mechanism, the new protocol also uses the correlated information between two sequential identification to accelerate its process. Analysis and simulation show that EBQT reduces tag collisions, which accelerates the tag identification process for mobile tag identification.", "paper_title": "BIT COLLISION DETECTION BASED QUERY TREE PROTOCOL FOR ANTI-COLLISION IN RFID SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000011"}
