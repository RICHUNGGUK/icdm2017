However, these systems are unable to satisfy user desires because these systems only reply to the results of user queries or consider static information, such as a user's sex and age. In order to solve these problems, this paper attempts to define context information to select music and design a music recommendation system that is suited to a user's interests and preferences using a filtering method. The recommendation system used in this study uses an Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework to recognize context information. Not only does this framework promote a higher user satisfaction rate for music recommendations, service quality is also improved by applying service mobility and distributed processing.", "paper_title": "Design of music recommendation system using context information", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100083"}
