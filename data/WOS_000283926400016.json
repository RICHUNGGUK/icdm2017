One potentially important biological problem is to infer the population genealogical history from these genetic variation data. Partly due to recombination, genealogical history of a set of DNA sequences in a population usually cannot be represented by a single tree. Instead, genealogy is better represented by a genealogical network, which is a compact representation of a set of correlated local genealogical trees, each for a short region of genome and possibly with different topology. Inference of genealogical history for a set of DNA sequences under recombination has many potential applications, including association mapping of complex diseases [41], [28], [39]. In this paper, we present two new methods for reconstructing local tree topologies with the presence of recombination, which extend and improve the previous work in [12], [13], [35]. We first show that the \"tree scan\" method [35] can be converted to a probabilistic inference method based on a hidden Markov model. We then focus on developing a novel local tree inference method called RENT that is both accurate and scalable to larger data. Through simulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of our methods by showing that the hidden-Markov-model-based method is comparable with the original method in [35] in terms of accuracy. We also show that RENT is competitive with other methods in terms of inference accuracy, and its inference error rate is often lower and can handle large data.", "paper_title": "New Methods for Inference of Local Tree Topologies with Recombinant SNP Sequences in Populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000283926400016"}
