Moreover, robust stability for such switched Cohen-Grossberg neural networks is analyzed based on a Lyapunov approach and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Simple sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the switched Cohen-Grossberg neural networks to be globally asymptotically stable for all admissible parametric uncertainties. The proposed LMI-based results are computationally efficient as they can be solved numerically using standard commercial software. An example is given to illustrate the usefulness of the results.", "paper_title": "Robust stability of switched Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000242690600016"}
