We present a domain decomposition algorithm for a two phase Darcy flow model coupling nearwell regions locally refined in space and time with a coarser reservoir discretization. The algorithm is based on an optimized Schwarz method using a full overlap at the coarse level. The main advantage of this approach is to apply to fully implicit discretizations of general multiphase flow models and to allow a simple optimization of the interface conditions based on a single phase flow equation.
