The inter-layer information is utilized to improve both the coding efficiency and the subjective quality of the moving region (MR). Firstly, we propose an MR extraction method by combining the inter-layer and inter-frame information. The difference between the current frame and the previous frame is used as the inter-frame information to detect moving areas. The motion information of the reference layer is used as the inter-layer information to combine with the inter-frame information to achieve a suitable MR extraction. Secondly, according to the coding result of the reference layer, we propose to sub-divide the non-MR into complex regions and flat regions based on a MacroBlock (MB) complexity measure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can obtain better quality both subjectively and objectively by using different weighting factors for the three regions.
