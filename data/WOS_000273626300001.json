The method considers a combination of local properties and discrimination between different classes. Not only the correlations between sample pairs but also the correlations between samples and their local neighborhoods are taken into consideration in LDCCA. Effective class separation is achieved by maximizing local within-class correlations and minimizing local between-class correlations simultaneously. Besides, a kernel version of LDCCA (KLDCCA) is proposed to cope with nonlinear problems in experiments. The experimental results on an artificial dataset, multiple feature databases and face databases including ORL, Yale, AR validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "A New Canonical Correlation Analysis Algorithm with Local Discrimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000273626300001"}
