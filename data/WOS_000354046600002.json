Servers in data centers require a constant supply of cold air from on-site cooling mechanisms for reliability. An increased computational load makes servers dissipate more power as heat and eventually amplifies the cooling load. In thermal- aware scheduling, computations are scheduled with the objective of reducing the data- center-wide thermal gradient, hotspots, and cooling magnitude. Complemented by heat modeling and thermal- aware monitoring and profiling, this scheduling is energy efficient and economical. A survey is presented henceforth of thermal- ware scheduling and associated techniques for green data centers.", "paper_title": "Thermal-Aware Scheduling in Green Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000354046600002"}
