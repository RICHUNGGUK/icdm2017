The minimum status of a connected graph is the minimum of statuses of all vertices of this graph. In this paper we obtain the sharp lower bound and the sharp upper bound on the minimum status of a connected graph with maximum degree k and order n. All the graphs attaining the lower bound are obtained, and a necessary condition is given for those graphs attaining the upper bound.", "paper_title": "Minimum statuses of connected graphs with fixed maximum degree and order", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969100001"}
