Previous super-resolution (SR) approaches have succeeded in resolution enhancement when the motion in the LR sequence is simple. However, when the motion is complex, new artifacts will be introduced in the SR processing. To solve this problem, we develop a robust Bayesian SR algorithm with two steps. We first isolate the frames individually to get their corresponding initial SR solutions within the Bayesian framework. Secondly, with a robust cost function to reject outliers and noise, final SR images are achieved with multiple LR frames. In the mean time, we impose the constraint that the distribution of high-resolution (HR) image gradient should be equal to one of the corresponding decompressed LR images to sharpen the edges of the results. As a result of these steps, we are able to produce high-quality deblurred results, which show a suppressing of high-frequency artifacts and less ringing artifacts, with a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).", "paper_title": "Robust super resolution of compressed video", "paper_id": "WOS:000310538700003"}
