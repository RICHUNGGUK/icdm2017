It is essential that those errors be correctly and quickly diagnosed. In this paper, we analyze the multiple-delay-fault diagnosis problem and propose a novel approach to solve it. We enhance the diagnostic resolution by processing failure logs at various slower-than-nominal clock frequencies. We evaluate the utility of n-detection and timing-aware automatic-test-pattern-generated (ATPG) sets. Experimental results show that using timing-aware ATPG sets yields better diagnostic resolution and results in better delay-defect-size estimations compared to n-detection ATPG sets. We experimentally determined our diagnosis algorithm's sensitivity to delay variations.", "paper_title": "Timing-Aware Multiple-Delay-Fault Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000262816900007"}
