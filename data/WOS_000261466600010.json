The designers claimed that it resists meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In this paper, we present an advanced MITM attack oil the APSSNMP and hence show that it fails to achieve its design objective of providing better Security against MITM attacks. Since the APSSNMP has been presented in several journals, and IEEE and IASTED conferences, our result is important to highlight to network implementers and users of distributed systems that the APSSNMP is not Secure for practical deployment.
