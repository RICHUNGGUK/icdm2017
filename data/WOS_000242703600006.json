Traditional web technologies are unable to meet the new business requirements which are derived from the rapid growth of e-Marketplaces. In this research, a service-oriented framework is proposed in order to address the issues associated with the development of e-Marketplaces. Specifically, it introduces a generic trading model oriented to e-Marketplaces so as to overcome the inadequacy of existing models and to facilitate the development of a computational trading process. In the proposed framework, required services are identified through the utilization of the business-centric trading model. Using a service metamodel, services are equipped with intelligence such that they work seamlessly and coherently within and across e-Marketplaces. A multi-model driven integrated development platform has been developed to support the proposed models and framework. The proposed framework and concepts have been validated through a case study of a mutual funds auction in an e-Marketplace.", "paper_title": "The realization of service-oriented e-Marketplaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000242703600006"}
