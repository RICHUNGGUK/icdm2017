The proposed method is based on an identity between the sinusoidal signal and its second order derivative. For a set of chosen parameters, the proposed method is robust to the initial phase, the amplitude, and the frequency in a wide range. The convergence rate can be adjusted by the chosen parameters. The estimation error mainly depends on the frequency of the sinusoid, the measurement noise and a key design parameter.", "paper_title": "Robust on-line frequency identification for a sinusoid", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100053"}
