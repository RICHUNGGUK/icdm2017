This scheme accommodates the needs of the dot generation on the base of the round light guide and offers flexibility in the adjustment of dot distribution, which can been easily integrated with the optical design phase to reach the uniformity condition for a plane source. The scheme employed a fixed boundary technique, incorporated with the tangential elliptical force field to provide the best enclosure ability-this allows the dots to be kept within the boundary points during the force regulation. A validation of present scheme is presented, and finally, an example of the integration of the present scheme and optical design of the round light guide is presented and discussed.
