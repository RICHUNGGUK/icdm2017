In this paper, a new secret handshake scheme is designed for supporting delegations. The definitions and security requirements are first formalized for delegatable secret handshakes. Based on a variant of message recoverable signature without public verification, a delegatable secret handshake scheme is presented. By assuming the intractability of the Discrete Logarithm Representation Problem and the q-Strong Diffie-Hellman Problem, our new scheme is proven secure under the random oracle model.
