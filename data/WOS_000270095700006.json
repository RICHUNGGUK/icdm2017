In a light-trail, the optical shutters at the start node and the end node are configured to be in OFF state and the optical shutters at the intermediate nodes are configured to be in ON state. Thus, an optical bus is formed, allowing traffic multiplexing without the state change of any optical shutter. This, however, limits the system throughput and also makes it impossible to implement a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol to assure quality of service (QoS) in a light-trail. With the recent development on ultrafast optical shutter, we propose an improved light-trail architecture, called opportunistic hyperchannel in this paper. In an opportunistic hyperchannel, an intermediate node can dynamically control its optical shutter which makes it possible to design a fully distributed QoS assuring MAC protocol. We then present a QoS assuring distributed dynamic scheduling protocol, namely, minimum source round robin (minSrcRR) protocol, for opportunistic hyperchannels. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed QoS assuring protocol and the worst-case delay bound are also derived in this paper. The simulation results quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of opportunistic hyperchannels and the effectiveness of minSrcRR protocol.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Optical Hyperchannel and Its Distributed QoS Assuring Access Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000270095700006"}
