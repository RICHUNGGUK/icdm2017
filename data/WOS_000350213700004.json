In order to alleviate the challenge of the said diversity, content adaptation is essential. However, because of the diversity of the mobile users, networks and the rich media learning content, it is a major challenge for the access of learning content by the desired devices in the mobile learning environment. In order to alleviate the challenge of learning content mismatch, content adaptation is essential. This paper describes a content adaptation framework for mobile e-learning.", "paper_title": "Media Content Adaptation Framework for Technology Enhanced Mobile e-Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000350213700004"}
