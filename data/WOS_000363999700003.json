For that, and to particularly address threats associated with malware, various techniques are developed in the literature, including ones that utilize static, dynamic, on-device, off-device, and hybrid approaches for identifying, classifying, and defend against mobile threats. Those techniques fail at times, and succeed at other times, while creating a trade-off of performance and operation. In this paper, we contribute to the mobile security defense posture by introducing Andro-AutoPsy, an anti-malware system based on similarity matching of malware-centric and malware creator-centric information. Using Andro-AutoPsy, we detect and classify malware samples into similar subgroups by exploiting the profiles extracted from integrated footprints, which are implicitly equivalent to distinct characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate that Andro-AutoPsy is scalable, performs precisely in detecting and classifying malware with low false positives and false negatives, and is capable of identifying zero-day mobile malware.
