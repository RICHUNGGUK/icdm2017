In addition, many problems in ubiquitous environment are solved by interaction between computational elements rather than by performing individual actions. Therefore, it needs to approach context-awareness from in a cooperative point of view. In this paper, we discuss about context model for cooperation system in ubiquitous environment and describe context ontology focused on interaction process with general context. Moreover, we propose cooperation architecture based on context ontology supporting ontological processes. This architecture introduces community as an organization of elements solving common problem and provides context-aware mechanism within community.", "paper_title": "Context-based cooperation architecture for ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100014"}
