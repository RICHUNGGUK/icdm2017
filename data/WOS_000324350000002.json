We also apply the proposed weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning method to deal with the truck backer-upper control problem. The proposed method satisfies the seven evaluation indices for fuzzy interpolative reasoning. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. It provides us with a useful way for dealing with fuzzy interpolative reasoning in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
