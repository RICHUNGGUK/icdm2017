A general expression of the probability of error is obtained where the prior probabilities of hypotheses could be equal or unequal and the additive noise is assumed to be uncorrelated Gaussian noise with possibly unequal variances. Upper and lower bounds of the probability of error are also derived using the restricted isometry property (RIP) constant and then the more computationally feasible mutual coherence of a given sampling matrix in CS. When the difference between the prior probabilities is sufficiently small and the signal to noise ratio is relatively large, an approximate but simpler expression of the probability of error is obtained. Furthermore, a new bound of the probability of error is derived in terms of a piecewise function. Numerical simulations are also provided to illustrate the new theoretical results.
