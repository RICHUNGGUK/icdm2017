The artificial chemical reaction optimization (ACROA) inspiring the chemical reaction process is used to implement the local and global search. A new repair operator integrating a greedy strategy and random selection is used to repair the infeasible solutions. The experimental results have proven the superior performance of ACROA compared to genetic algorithm, and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm.", "paper_title": "Solving 0-1 knapsack problem by artificial chemical reaction optimization algorithm with a greedy strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000357312800020"}
