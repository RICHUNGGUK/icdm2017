We show some connections between the Euclidean distance function d to a,Omega and the solution u of the Poisson problem Delta u(x)=-1 if x is in Omega and u(x)=0 if x is on a,Omega. This enables us to propose a new and fast algorithm to compute an approximation of the skeleton of a,Omega. We illustrate the approach with some numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Poisson Skeleton Revisited: a New Mathematical Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000329234700011"}
