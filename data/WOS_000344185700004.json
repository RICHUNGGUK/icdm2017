In these kinds of virtual learning environments, u-TA is often used to assist learners by using desktop computers or laptops. With the development of u-learning, u-TA should consist of good mobility for guiding students and answering students' questions on mobile handheld devices. Therefore, the mobility of u-TA should be enhanced. This study proposes a system that uses the u-TA framework to construct a context-aware and location-based service (LBS) guiding system to introduce the essence of Service-Learning courses to students and help them browse the content of the course resources on campus. We gave a case study for using our proposed system to promote the Service-Learning courses in Feng Chia University, Taiwan. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the proposed system can help students enhance understanding on Service-Learning courses in school and encourage students to participate in these curricula.(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
