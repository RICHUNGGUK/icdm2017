The signal overheard from the channel provides information about the activity of the other sources and thus furnishes the basis for cooperation. This two-part paper studies achievable strategies (Part I) and outer bounds (Part II) for the general discrete memoryless IFC-GF with two source-destination pairs. In Part I, the generalized feedback is used to gain knowledge about the message sent by the other source and then exploited in two ways: a) to relay the messages that can be decoded at both destinations, thus realizing the gains of beam-forming of a distributed multiantenna system, and b) to hide the messages that can not be decoded at the nonintended destination, thus leveraging the interference \" precancellation\" property of dirty-paper coding. We show that our achievable region generalizes several known achievable regions for the IFC-GF and that it reduces to known achievable regions for the channels subsumed by the IFC-GF model. For the Gaussian channel, it is shown that source cooperation enlarges the achievable rate region of the corresponding IFC without generalized feedback/cooperation.", "paper_title": "Interference Channel With Generalized Feedback (a.k.a.
