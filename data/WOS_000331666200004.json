Despite their natural applications to games with incomplete information, logic synthesis with constrained input dependencies, etc., DQBFs remain a relatively unexplored subject however. This paper investigates their basic properties, including formula negation and complement, formula expansion, prenex and non-prenex form conversions, and resolution. In particular, the proposed DQBF formulation is established from a synthesis perspective concerned with Skolem-function models and Herbrand-function countermodels. Also a generalized resolution rule is shown to be sound, but incomplete, for DQBF evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
