Mathematical modelling of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) could provide a better understanding of its performance and help to represent blood flow and pressure in systemic arteries before and after inserting the pump. Methods: A mathematical modelling of the whole cardiovascular system was formulated using MATLAB software. The block diagram of the model consists of 43 compartments. All the anatomical data was extracted from the physiological references. In the next stage, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in the model by decreasing the contractility of the left ventricle. The IABP was mathematically modelled and inserted in the model in the thoracic aorta I artery just before the descending aorta. The effects of IABP on MI were studied using the mathematical model. Results: The normal operation of the cardiovascular system was studied firstly. The pressure-time graphs of the ventricles, atriums, aorta, pulmonary system, capillaries and arterioles were obtained. The volume-time curve of the left ventricle was also presented. The pressure-time curves of the left ventricle and thoracic aorta I were obtained for normal, MI, and inserted IABP conditions. Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation results with the clinical observations reported in the literature. Conclusions: IABP can be described by a theoretical model. Our model representing the cardiovascular system is capable of showing the effects of different pathologies such as MI and we have shown that MI effects can be reduced using IABP in accordance with the modelling results. The mathematical model should serve as a useful tool to simulate and better understand cardiovascular operation in normal and pathological conditions.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modelling of intra-aortic balloon pump", "paper_id": "WOS:000281851500007"}
