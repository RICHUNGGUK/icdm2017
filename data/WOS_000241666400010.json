However, currently available LPV techniques are both computationally demanding and (potentially) very conservative. In this chapter we propose to address these difficulties by combining Receding Horizon and Control Lyapunov Functions techniques in a risk-adjusted framework. The resulting controllers are guaranteed to stabilize the plant and have computational complexity that increases polynomially, rather than exponentially, with the prediction horizon.", "paper_title": "Risk adjusted receding horizon control of constrained linear parameter varying systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241666400010"}
