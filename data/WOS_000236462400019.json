Unfortunately, Solomonoff complexity is not algorithmically computable. This paper deals with a Genetic Programming approach to inductive inference of chaotic series, with reference to Solomonoff complexity, that consists in evolving a population of mathematical expressions looking for the 'optimal' one that generates a given series of chaotic data. Validation is performed on the Logistic, the Henon and the Mackey-Glass series. The results show that the method is effective in obtaining the analytical expression of the first two series, and in achieving a very good approximation and forecasting of the Mackey-Glass series.", "paper_title": "Genetic programming for inductive inference of chaotic series", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400019"}
