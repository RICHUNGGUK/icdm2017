By encompassing the main features of the most popular Web scripting languages (e.g., PHP, ASP, and Java Servlets), our scripting language is powerful enough to model the dynamics of complex Web applications, where the interactions among Web servers and Web browsers are formalized through a landmark communicating protocol that abstracts HTTP. We provide a detailed characterization of browser actions via rewrite rules and show how our models can be naturally model-checked by using the Linear Temporal Logic of Rewriting (LTLR), which is a Linear Temporal Logic that is specifically designed for model-checking rewrite theories. The framework has been completely implemented in Maude, and we report on some successful experiments that we conducted using the Maude LTLR model-checker. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
