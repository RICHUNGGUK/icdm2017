Two models (M) were built varying the PDL representation: Mh (homogeneous PDL) and Mht (heterogeneous PDL with beam3 elements). Stress and displacements were determined for three loading conditions (L): Ll, lingual face loading at 45 degrees with the tooth long axis; Li, perpendicular to the incisal edge; and Lip, on the incisal edge, parallel to the tooth long axis. Evaluation was performed on ANSYS software. Lip provided lower stress variation on the tooth and support structures when compared to Ll and Li. PDL's influence on stress values was lower for Lip. Oblique loading showed stress and displacement not observed in parallel loading condition through PDL's heterogeneous representation and it is probably incompatible with the in vivo condition.", "paper_title": "Mechanics of the maxillary central incisor.
