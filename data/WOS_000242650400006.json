Despite the great efforts, the problem is still open. In this paper, we present a fully automated system processing digital postero-anterior (PA) chest radiographs, that starts by producing an accurate segmentation of the lung field area. The segmented lung area includes even those parts of the lungs hidden behind the heart, the spine, and the diaphragm, which are usually excluded from the methods presented in the literature. This decision is motivated by the fact that lung nodules may be found also in these areas. The segmented area is processed with a simple multiscale method that enhances the visibility of the nodules, and an extraction scheme is then applied to select potential nodules. To reduce the high number of false positives extracted, cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) are trained to recognize the true nodules. Different learning experiments were performed on two different data sets, created by means of feature selection, and employing Gaussian and polynomial SVMs trained with different parameters; the results are reported and compared. With the best SVM models, we obtain about 1.5 false positives per image (fp/image) when sensitivity is approximately equal to 0.71, this number increases to about 2.5 and 4 fp/image when sensitivity is approximate to 0.78 and approximate to 0.85, respectively. For the highest sensitivity (approximate to 0.92 and 1.0), we get 7 or 8 fp/image.", "paper_title": "A fully automated method for lung nodule detection from postero-anterior chest radiographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242650400006"}
