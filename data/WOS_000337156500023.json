However, less attention has been paid on the scope of dismantling hand tracking problems. There is also limited publicly available database developed as benchmark data to standardize the research on hand tracking area. For this purpose, we develop a versatile hand gesture tracking database. This database consists of 60 video sequences containing a total of 15,554 RGB color images. The tracking sequences are captured in different situations ranging from an easy indoor scene to extremely high challenging outdoor scenes. Complete with annotated ground truth data, this database is made available on the web for the sake of assisting other researchers in the related fields to test and evaluate their algorithms based on standard benchmark data.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Biometric Group Hand Tracking (IBGHT) database for visual hand tracking research and development", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500023"}
