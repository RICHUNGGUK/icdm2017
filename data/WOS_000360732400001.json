Therefore, real time data collection is difficult. In wireless communication for simultaneousmultidata collection (WC-SDC), sensed data are projected onto the parameters of the wireless communication. The specific feature of the sensed data appears in received signals. Even if the transmitted signal from each sensor collides by simultaneous access, the mixture sensed can be separated by using the specific features. Therefore, the real time data collection is achieved. However, frequency mismatch causes the fluctuation of sensed data, which gives the adverse impact to data separation. In this paper, a data tracking method is used for the data separation in the WC-SDC. We clarify the accuracy of data separation and the impact from the frequency offset. We propose a method for coping with the frequency offset and the error tracking. From the numerical results, our proposed method accurately achieves data separation even under 7% frequency offset normalized by the minimum frequency resolution.", "paper_title": "Data Tracking and Effect of Frequency Offset to Simultaneous Collecting Method for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360732400001"}
