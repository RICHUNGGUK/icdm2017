Due to its high prevalence, early detections are necessary so as to avoid vision loss. This paper aims to discuss the design and development of a retinopathy predictive system which is based on data mining and case based reasoning (CBR). To be specific, C5.0 was used to produce the decision tree whereas k-nearest neighbour and Hamming distance algorithms were used to select the three most similar cases for every new case entered into the system. Then a voting mechanism makes the final prediction. Results show that the hybrid system has a better accuracy prediction rate (85%) compared to C5.0 (76%) and CBR (73%) implemented solely.", "paper_title": "Developing a hybrid predictive system for retinopathy", "paper_id": "WOS:000318157000018"}
