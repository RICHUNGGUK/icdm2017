In this article, we propose a new, thin, and flexible active electrode for use as a capacitive ECG measurement electrode. This electrode contains a shielding plate over its surface and it is extremely thin and can bend freely to cover larger body surfaces of the curve-shaped human torso. We evaluated the characteristics of flexible active electrodes under conditions of varying cloth thickness, electrode size, and contacting pressure. Electrodes of two sizes (45 and 12 cm(2)) were attached to a chest belt to measure the ECG from the human torso, and the results obtained for both the sizes were compared. Cloth thickness and electrode size showed a dominant effect on the SNR, whereas contacting pressure had almost no effect. The flexible active electrodes attached to chest belts wrapped closely and uniformly over the curved surface of the torso and SNR was increased with an increase in electrode size. Although the ECG signal became more distorted as the cloth thickness increased, the larger-sized flexible active electrode (45 cm(2)) showed less distortion than the smaller-sized one (12 cm(2)).", "paper_title": "Thin and flexible active electrodes with shield for capacitive electrocardiogram measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000276771800005"}
