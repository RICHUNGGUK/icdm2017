Error correction in the rank modulation scheme is done by considering permutation codes. In this paper, we consider codes in the set of all permutations on n elements, S-n, using the Kendall tau-metric. The main goal of this paper is to derive new bounds on the size of such codes. For this purpose, we also consider perfect codes, diameter perfect codes, and the size of optimal anticodes in the Kendall tau-metric, structures which have their own considerable interest. We prove that there are no perfect single-error-correcting codes in Sn, where n > 4 is a prime or 4 <= n <= 10. We present lower bounds on the size of optimal anticodes with odd diameter. As a consequence, we obtain a new upper bound on the size of codes in S-n with even minimum Kendall tau-distance. We present larger single-error-correcting codes than the known ones in S-5 and S-7.", "paper_title": "Bounds on the Size of Permutation Codes With the Kendall tau-Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600019"}
