It is a key challenge to achieve semantic interoperability in building the Semantic Web. This paper proposes a new generic and adaptive ontology mapping approach, called the PRIOR+, based on propagation theory, information retrieval techniques and artificial intelligence. The approach consists of three major modules, i.e., the IR-based similarity generator, the adaptive similarity filter and weighted similarity aggregator, and the neural network based constraint satisfaction solver. The approach first measures both linguistic and structural similarity of ontologies in a vector space model, and then aggregates them using an adaptive method based on their harmonies, which is defined as an estimator of performance of similarity. Finally to improve mapping accuracy the interactive activation and competition neural network is activated, if necessary, to search for a solution that can satisfy ontology constraints. The experimental results show that harmony is a good estimator of f-measure; the harmony based adaptive aggregation outperforms other aggregation methods; neural network approach significantly boosts the performance in most cases. Our approach is competitive with top-ranked systems on benchmark tests at OAEI campaign 2007, and performs the best on real cases in OAEI benchmark tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
