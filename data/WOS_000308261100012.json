The dynamic range of a HDR image needs to be mapped onto the range of the output device where it will be displayed, this is called tone reproduction or tone mapping. iCAM06, a representative HDR rendering algorithm also uses tone compression for image reproduction on the dynamic range of output devices. However, iCAM06 causes a white point shift during its tone compression process. Therefore, we propose a compensation method for white point shifts using corrected channel gain. Experiment results show that the proposed method has better performance than iCAM06.", "paper_title": "A Tone Compression Model for the Compensation of White Point Shift Generated from HDR Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261100012"}
