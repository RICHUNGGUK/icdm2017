Current methods and programs for running energy simulations are not very timely, are difficult to understand, and lack high interoperability between BIM and energy simulation software. It is necessary to improve on these drawbacks as design decisions are often made without the aid of energy modeling leading to the design and construction of nonoptimized buildings with respect to energy efficiency. The goal of this research project is to develop a new methodology to produce energy estimates from a BIM model expeditiously and to improve interoperability between the simulation engine and BIM software. In the proposed methodology, the extracted information from a BIM model is compiled into an input file and run in a popular energy simulation program on an hourly basis for a desired period. The case applied in this paper showed that the application of this methodology can be used to quickly provide energy simulations from BIM models. With the aid of an easy-to-run and easily understood energy simulation methodology, designers will be able to make more energy conscious decisions during the design phase and as changes in design requirements arise.
