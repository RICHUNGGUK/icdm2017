Mobile, electronic handheld guides offer the opportunity to improve a visitor's experience by recommending exhibits of interest, and adapting the delivered content. The first step in this personalisation process is the prediction of a visitor's activities and interests. In this paper we study non-intrusive, adaptive user modelling techniques that take into account the physical constraints of the exhibition layout. We present two collaborative models for predicting a visitor's next locations in a museum, and an ensemble model that combines the predictions of these models. The three models were trained and tested on a small dataset of museum visits. Our results are encouraging, with the ensemble model yielding the best performance overall.", "paper_title": "Using interest and transition models to predict visitor locations in museums", "paper_id": "WOS:000261613000008"}
