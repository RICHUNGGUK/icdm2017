This occurs for instance if the points of P can only occur in one land cover type. We extend the definition of clusters to region-restricted clusters, and give efficient algorithms for exact computation and approximation. The algorithm determines all axis-parallel squares with exactly m out of n points inside, size at most some prespepcified value, and area of a given land cover type at most another prespecified value. The exact algorithm runs in O(nmlog(2) n+(nm + nn(f)) log(2)n(f)) time, where n(f) is the number of edges that bound the regions with the given land cover type. The approximation algorithm allows the square to be a factor 1 + epsilon too large, and runs in O(nlogn + n/epsilon(2) + n(f)log(2)n(f) + (nlog(2)nf)/(m epsilon(2))) time. We also show how to compute largest clusters and outliers.", "paper_title": "Region-restricted clustering for geographic data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200035"}
