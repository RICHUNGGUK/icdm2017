This paper presents a method for fast subspace integration for example-based elastic material, which is suitable for real-time simulation in computer graphics. At the core of the method is the formulation of a new potential using example-based Green strain tensors. By using this potential, the deformation can be attracted towards the example-based deformation feature space, the example weights can be explicitly obtained and the internal force can be decomposed into the conventional one and an additional one induced by the examples. The real-time subspace integration is then developed with subspace integration costs independent of geometric complexity, and both the reduced conventional internal force and additional one being cubic polynomials in reduced coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve real-time simulation while providing comparable quality with the prior art.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Subspace Integration for Example-Based Elastic Material", "paper_id": "WOS:000358326600038"}
