The main difficulty lies with the ill-posedness of the problem, and there is no consensus as to how best to formulate image models that can both impose smoothness and preserve the edges in the image. Here we develop a new image prior based on the Pearson type VII density integrated with a Markov random field model, which has desirable robustness properties. We develop a fully automated hyperparameter estimation procedure for this approach, which makes it advantageous in comparison with alternatives. Our recovery algorithm, although very simple to implement, it achieves statistically significant improvements over previous results in underdetermined problem settings, and it is able to recover images that contain texture.
