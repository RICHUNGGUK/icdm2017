The deployment of such a network, however, has its own technical challenges, including network architecture, resource management, and high-speed transmission. To address these issues, a service-oriented-architecture-based distributed optical internet architecture is proposed. Thereafter, key technologies of an optical internet, such as optical multicasting, distributed resource control, and high-speed transmission, are analyzed and investigated. The proposed schemes are verified through experimentation and simulation.", "paper_title": "Analysis and experimentation of key technologies in service-oriented optical internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200001"}
