Resistance and inductance of interconnects depend on frequency, and hence the extraction frequency strongly affects the modeling accuracy of interconnects. The proposed method determines an extraction frequency based on the transfer characteristic of interconnects. By choosing the frequency where the transfer characteristic becomes maximum, the extracted RL values achieve the accurate modeling of the waveform. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides accurate transition waveforms over various interconnect topologies.", "paper_title": "Interconnect RL extraction based on transfer characteristics of transmission-line", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600026"}
