Sampled processor simulation speeds up the simulation by several orders of magnitude by simulating a limited number of sampling units rather than the execution of the entire program. This work presents a survey on sampled processor simulation and discusses solutions to the three major challenges to sampled processor simulation: how to choose representative sampling units; how to establish efficiently a sampling unit's architecture starting image; and how to efficiently establish an accurate sampling unit's microarchitecture starting image.", "paper_title": "Sampled processor simulation: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000257315600004"}
