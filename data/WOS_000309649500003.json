Moreover, automatic timing-devices based on RFID technology, have become cheaper. However, these devices cannot operate as stand-alone because they need a computer measuring system that is capable of processing incoming events, encoding the results, assigning them to the correct competitor, sorting the results according to the achieved times, and then providing a printout of the results. This article presents the domain-specific language EasyTime, which enables the controlling of an agent by writing the events within a database. It focuses, in particular, on the implementation of EasyTime with a LISA tool that enables the automatic construction of compilers from language specifications, using Attribute Grammars.", "paper_title": "Implementation of EasyTime Formal Semantics using a LISA Compiler Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000309649500003"}
