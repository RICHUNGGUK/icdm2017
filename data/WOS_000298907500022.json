Although, several multi-user channel estimation algorithms have been proposed to mitigate MAI, these algorithms require high computational complexities. In this paper, we address the problem of iterative least squares (LS) mobile channel estimation at high channel efficiency that requires a short training sequence along with the spreading sequences. We employ an efficient iterative method based on conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of the estimation method. Computer simulations illustrate that the proposed method performs almost identical to the exact LS estimate for reasonable training lengths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
