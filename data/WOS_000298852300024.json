In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a star-shaped drawing of a biconnected planar graph with the minimum number of concave corners. We first show new structural properties of planar graphs to derive a lower bound on the number of concave corners. Based on the lower bound, we prove that the problem can be solved in linear time by presenting a linear-time algorithm for finding a best plane embedding of a biconnected planar graph with the minimum number of concave corners. This is in spite of the fact that a biconnected planar graph may have an exponential number of different plane embeddings.", "paper_title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm for Star-Shaped Drawings of Planar Graphs with the Minimum Number of Concave Corners", "paper_id": "WOS:000298852300024"}
