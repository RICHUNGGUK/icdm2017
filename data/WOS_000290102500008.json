The cooperative power control optimization problem is modeled as a concave minimization problem. According to the properties of the power control optimization problem, an improved branch and bound algorithm is proposed. On the other hand, for the noncooperative power control case, a game theoretic model with the exponential pricing function is adopted to restrict the interference to the licensed users. Further, Nash equilibrium for the power control game is discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed models is evaluated by computer simulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
