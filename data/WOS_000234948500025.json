One of these example is the scheme based on the quadratic residuosity (QR) problem. However this scheme is less efficient than the other examples. In this paper, we construct a new variant of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme which is related to the QR problem. Our variant is more efficient than the scheme based on the QR problem.", "paper_title": "A Cramer-Shoup variant related to the quadratic residuosity problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500025"}
