The implantation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) is seen as a key step in all the strategies envisaged to address this problem, and there are several major initiatives to standardize such artifacts. In this paper, we present a system that aims to promote medication adherence in contexts of daily life, interacting with standards-based EHR repositories from both domestic and mobile devices. This approach represents an advance with regard to previous works on smart medicine managers, which could only record information in local logs and required the users to enter their prescriptions and medications regimens manually. Experiments with real users confirm the added value of applications with automatic access to ERR and interfaces for various types of devices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
