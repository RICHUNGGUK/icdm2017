This contribution shows that this is not always the case. Thus, the contribution is a reminder that computer aided analyses results always need to be double-checked. Furthermore, the contribution shows how to interpret the results obtained from a computer program that does not provide the expected results.", "paper_title": "On the computer solutions of kinematics analysis of linkages", "paper_id": "WOS:000347404400002"}
