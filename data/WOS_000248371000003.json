In this scenario, this paper proposes an algorithm for resource discovery that is based on navigating such a surface, in search of the deepest valley (global minimum, that is, the best node). The algorithm, which aims at fairly distributing among nodes the quantity of leased resource, is based on some heuristics that mimic the laws of kinematics. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.
