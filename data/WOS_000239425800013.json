Rather than computing an approximate distribution of the model (as done in previous methods), we develop an exact analysis of an approximate model. The design of this method leads to a uniform handling of the computation of the transient and steady state behaviour of the model. This method is an adaptation of a former one developed by the same authors for general stochastic processes (which was shown to be more robust than alternative techniques). Using Petri nets as the modelling formalism enables us to express the behaviour of the approximate process by tensorial expressions. Such a representation yields significant savings w.r.t. time and space complexity.", "paper_title": "A new approach to the evaluation of non Markovian stochastic Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425800013"}
