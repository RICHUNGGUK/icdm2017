It means the users can get cognitive influence to the other users. Thus, it is important to understand how the information can be diffused by interactions among users through online social media. In this paper, we design a social media monitoring system (called \"TweetPulse\") which can analyze and show meaningful diffusion patterns (DP) among the users. Particularly, TweetPulse focuses on visualizing information diffusion in Twitter, given a certain time duration. Also, this work has investigated the relationships 1) between DP and event detecting, 2) between DP and emotional words, and 3) between DP and the number of followers of the users. Thereby, to understand the continuous patterns of the information diffusion, we propose two different types of analytic methods, which are 1) macroscopic approach and 2) microscopic approach. For evaluating the proposed method, we have collected and preprocessed the dataset during about 4 months (14 March 2012 to 12 July 2012). As a conclusion, Tweet Pulse has helped users to easily understand DP from a large scale dataset streaming through Twitter.", "paper_title": "SOCIAL DATA VISUALIZATION SYSTEM FOR UNDERSTANDING DIFFUSION PATTERNS ON TWITTER: A CASE STUDY ON KOREAN ENTERPRISES", "paper_id": "WOS:000343020100007"}
