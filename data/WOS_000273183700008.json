The model is even a valuable tool to set up the control law according to the expected environmental condition, with a special attention to wave motion. A model of this kind can complete the range of software tools used in designing laying operations, where there is an increasing reliance on simulation methods because of the ever-deeper waters and hostile environments that must be faced. The paper illustrates the mathematical model whereby the numerical model was developed, discusses the validation tests, and concludes with an application example demonstrating how maximum allowable limits for wave motion can be evaluated in order to ensure safe and reliable operation. The aim of the work is to provide a tool to verify the congruency of a tensioner performance with the field requirements without requiring a detailed model of pipeline. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
