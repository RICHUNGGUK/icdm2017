The energy of G is defined to be E(G) = Sigma(n)(i=1)vertical bar lambda(i)vertical bar. In this note, for a given k-regular graph we find explicit formulas for the energy of <(L(G))over bar>, the complement of line graph of G. This provides us with some practical ways to compute the energy of a large family of regular graphs.", "paper_title": "On the energy of complement of regular line graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200014"}
