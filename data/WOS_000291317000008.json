An alternative stability-analysis approach using an artificial fuzzy system based on the Lyapunov stability theory is proposed. To facilitate the stability analysis, the continuous membership functions of the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model are represented by the staircase ones. With the nice property of the staircase membership functions, it turns the set of infinite number of linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) based stability conditions into a finite one. Furthermore, the staircase membership functions carrying system information can be brought to the stability conditions to relax the stability conditions. The stability of the original FMB control systems is guaranteed by the satisfaction of the LMI-based stability conditions. The proposed stability analysis is applied to the FMB control systems of which the T-S fuzzy model and fuzzy controller do not share the same premise membership functions and, thus, is able to enhance the design flexibility of the fuzzy controller. A simulation example is given to illustrate the merits of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "LMI-Based Stability Analysis for Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems Using Artificial T-S Fuzzy Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317000008"}
