The systems under consideration include the well-studied Lipschitz system as a special case and possess inherent advantages with respect to conservativeness. For such systems in the presence of noises, we develop a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based approach to design a nonlinear H-infinity observer by carefully dealing with the one-sided Lipschitz condition together with the quadratic inner-bounded condition. The resulting nonlinear H-infinity observer guarantees asymptotic stability of the estimation error dynamics with a prescribed H-infinity performance. Moreover, for the design purpose, the existence condition of the proposed nonlinear H-infinity observer is formulated in terms of LMIs by using a matrix generalized inverse technique. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
