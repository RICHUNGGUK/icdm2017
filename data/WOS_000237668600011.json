The proposed scheme can reduce handover latency for MIPv6 (mobile IPv6) by removing the router discovery time. Moreover, when the proposed mechanism is applied to a FMIPv6 (fast handovers for MIPv6), we can increase the probability that FMIPv6 can be per-formed in a predictive mode by reducing the handover initiation time. As a result, we can get the reduced handover latency in FMIPv6. In addition, with the proposed scheme, we can design the cost-effective network by reducing cover-age overlap between adjacent cells. This is due to the decreased handover initiation time in FMIPv6. From simulation results, it is proven that the proposed scheme can provide a higher goodput for UDP and TCP because it has less service disruption during handovers.", "paper_title": "Enhanced fast handover mechanism using MIH services in MIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237668600011"}
