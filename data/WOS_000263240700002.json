After studying the paper, we realize that the paper correctly introduces the basic procedures and some of the most advanced ones when comparing a control method. However, it does not deal with some advanced topics in depth. Regarding these topics, we focus on more powerful proposals of statistical procedures for comparing n x n classifiers. Moreover, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining adjusted and comparable p-values in multiple comparison procedures.", "paper_title": "An Extension on \"Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets\" for all Pairwise Comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000263240700002"}
