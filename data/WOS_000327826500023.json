Based on the optical MoCap system, this paper proposes a novel cross-mapping based facial expression simulating method. To overcome the problem of the false upper and lower jaw correlation derived from the facial global RBF-based cross-mapping method, we construct a functional partition based RBF cross-mapping method. During model animating, enhanced markers are added and animated by our proposed skin motion mechanism. In addition, based on the enhanced markers, an improved RBF-based animating approach is raised to derive realistic facial animation. Further more, a pre-computing algorithm is presented to reduce computational cost for real-time simulation. The experiments proved that the method can not only map the MoCap data of one subject to different personalized faces but generate realistic facial animation.", "paper_title": "On the simulation of expressional animation based on facial MoCap", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500023"}
