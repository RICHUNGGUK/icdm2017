In this paper, we present a new fuzzy interpolative reasoning method based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. By means of calculating the ranking values of the upper and the lower membership functions of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, we can deal with fuzzy interpolative reasoning in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems in a more flexible and more intelligent manner.
