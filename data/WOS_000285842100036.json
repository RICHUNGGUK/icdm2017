A framework for near-complementary sequences is given by an explicit Boolean expression and an equivalent matrix structure. The framework transforms seed pairs to near-complementary sequences by the aid of Golay complementary sequences. New families of near-complementary sequences of various lengths and PMEPR < 4 are then presented, where the sequences are constructed by the framework employing the seeds of shortened and extended Golay complementary pairs. The families present in a constructive way a large number of sequences of PMEPR < 4 for the lengths (< 100) of 24, 28, 30, 34, 36, 48, 56, 60, 62, 66, 68, 72, and 96 where no Golay pairs have been reported. The sequence families can find potential applications for peak power control requiring codewords or sequences of various lengths as well as low peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR).", "paper_title": "Near-Complementary Sequences With Low PMEPR for Peak Power Control in Multicarrier Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100036"}
