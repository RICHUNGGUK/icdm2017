We prove that there are no free cyclic self-dual codes over finite chain rings with odd characteristic. It is also proven that a self-dual code over a finite chain ring cannot be the lift of a binary cyclic self-dual code. The number of cyclic self-dual codes over chain rings is also investigated as an extension of the number of cyclic self-dual codes over finite fields given recently by Jia et al.", "paper_title": "On self-dual cyclic codes over finite chain rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000331210200006"}
