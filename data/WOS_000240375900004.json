In the numerical formulation of the method, the approximation of the unknown functions and their derivatives are constructed on a set of nodes in a local circular-shaped region. The Boussinesq equations studied in this paper is a fully nonlinear and highly dispersive model, which is composed of the exact boundary conditions and the truncated series expansion solution of the Laplace equation. The resultant system involves a sparse, unsymmetrical matrix to be solved at each time step of the simulation. Matrix solutions are studied to reduce the computing resource requirements and improve the efficiency and accuracy. The convergence properties of the present numerical method are investigated. Preliminary verifications are given for nonlinear wave shoaling problems; the numerical results agree well with experimental data available in the literature.
