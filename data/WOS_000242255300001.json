Delay-dependent sufficient conditions on, stability and stabilizability are developed. A design algorithm for a memoryless state feedback controller which guarantees that the closed-loop dynamics will be regular, impulse free and stable is proposed in terms of the solutions to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent stabilization of singular linear systems with delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300001"}
