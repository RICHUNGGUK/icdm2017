However, this kind of robustness no longer has any significance for model free or data-driven control theory because the controller is designed only using I/O data of the controlled plant. In this paper, a novel robustness of the model free control or data-driven control is presented when the system is controlled by the model free adaptive control (MFAC) scheme. It is assumed that an MFAC scheme is implemented via a network control system and that data dropout occurs due to a failing sensor, actuator or network failure, resulting in what it is called intermittent MFAC. The stability of such a MFAC scheme is analyzed by the statistical approach. It is shown that the MFAC system is still stable when data dropout occurs, and the data dropout impacts the convergence speed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
