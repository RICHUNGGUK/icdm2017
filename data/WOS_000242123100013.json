The early system was road guide but it is giving much serviceableness to user because various functions are added by the development of various techniques. However the growth of the most important guide thing of navigation system is yet not conspicuous. In this paper, intelligent guide system that infers information of various recommended road and can guide suitable road to personal tendency was proposed. By using fuzzy logic, it updates user's driving tendency at regular intervals and infers road state. Also path breakaway inference system that learns user's movement path and can secure personal security was proposed by using GPS information.", "paper_title": "Study for intelligent guide system using soft computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100013"}
