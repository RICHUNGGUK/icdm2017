Such networks are characterized by highly dynamic state due to high arrival and departure rates. This makes it difficult to build and maintain structured networks and to use state-based resource allocation techniques. We build our system to work in an environment similar to Current file-sharing networks such as Gnutella and Freenet. In doing so, we are able to leverage vast network resources while providing resilience to random failures, low network overhead, and an open architecture for resource brokering. This paper describes the underlying analytical and algorithmic substrates based on randomization for job distribution, replication, monitoring, aggregation and oblivious resource sharing and communication between participating hosts. We support our claims of robustness and scalability analytically with high probabilistic guarantees. Our algorithms do not introduce any state dependencies, and hence Lire resilient to dynamic node arrivals, departures, and failures. We Support all analytical claims with a detailed simulation-based evaluation of our distributed framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
