Drawing on the flow theory, this research identified the factors affecting user adoption of mobile games. The results indicated that perceived ease of use, connection quality and content quality affect flow. Among them, content quality has the largest effect. Flow, social influence and usage cost determine usage intention. The results imply that service providers need to improve users' experience in order to facilitate their adoption and usage of mobile games.", "paper_title": "Understanding the effect of flow on user adoption of mobile games", "paper_id": "WOS:000316819900011"}
