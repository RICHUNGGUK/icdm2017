In this paper, we investigate these avoidance results in the context of partial words, or sequences that may have some undefined symbols called holes. Here, a square has the form uu with u and v compatible, and consequently, such a square is compatible with a number of full words that are squares over the given alphabet. We show that (1) holds for partial words with at most two holes. We prove that (2) extends to partial words having infinitely many holes. Regarding (3), we show that there exist binary partial words with infinitely many holes that avoid cubes and have only eleven full word squares compatible with factors of it. Moreover, this number is optimal, and all such squares xx satisfy |x| <= 4. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.
