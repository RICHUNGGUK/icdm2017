They can then be used in the formulation and retrieval of knowledge. In developing a knowledge-based system for Parkinson's Disease, a procedure of knowledge map was used to capture and harness the intellectual resources of an organization, and new paradigms for knowledge mapping were also formulated. Knowledge bases for symptoms and drugs, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, and dieting that affect patient care were developed. Finally, the knowledge bases were merged to form a single central repository of knowledge base.", "paper_title": "A semantically enabled formalism for the knowledge management of Parkinson's disease", "paper_id": "WOS:000238306900002"}
