In this method, differing from our previous approach, the SDP is a function with respect to two different state variables, which is realised by the use of a 2-D wavelet series expansion. Here, an optimised model structure selection is accomplished using a PRESS-based procedure in conjunction with orthogonal decomposition (OD) to avoid any ill-conditioning problems associated with the parameter estimation. Two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear system identification using two-dimensional wavelet-based state-dependent parameter models", "paper_id": "WOS:000271614300006"}
