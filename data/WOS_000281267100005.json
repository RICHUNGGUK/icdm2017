Since the bridge is still in the design phase, the geometry and the mechanical characteristics are subjected to changes. In order to avoid creating different structural models, a computer code was written to produce a model from geometrical and mechanical data and solve the optimization problem. At the end of the document, two examples are included to show the capabilities of the methodology presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
