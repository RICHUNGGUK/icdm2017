In the literature, various empirical correlations between these elements and some parameters indicating soil state have been suggested. Herein, by using two well-known empirical expressions for state dependent peak friction and dilatancy angles, proper constitutive equations are derived and implemented in a stress ratio-based bounding surface plasticity framework. It is shown that the modified model is capable of simulating sand response in either loose or dense states using a unique set of parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
