This paper proposed a novel passive acoustic Source location method based on blind source separation and thoroughly analyzed this new location algorithm. Experiments show that a more stable and accurate location results may be obtained by this new location method. The implementation of this location method is relatively simple and effective. which can satisfy the demand of engineering application.", "paper_title": "Application of blind source separation to five-element cross array passive location", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000176"}
