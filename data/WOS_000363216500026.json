For stability, an optimization derived from the implicit time integrator is solved in each timestep under the inequality constraints coming from collisions. To achieve fast convergence, we extend the MPRGP based solver from handling box constraints only to handling general linear constraints and prove its convergence. This generalization introduces a cost of solving dense linear systems in each step, but these systems can be reduced into diagonal ones for efficiency without affecting the general stability via pruning redundant collisions. Our solver is an order of magnitude faster, especially for elastic objects under large deformation compared with iterative constraint anticipation method (ICA), a typical method for stability. The efficiency, robustness and stability are further verified by our results.", "paper_title": "Deformable Objects Collision Handling with Fast Convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500026"}
