This paper, however, shows that the use of minimum area does not result in minimum power and/or delay in nanometer-scale technologies due to thermal effects and, in some cases, may cause thermal runaway. A methodology using area as a design parameter to reduce the leakage power and prevent thermal runaway is presented A 16-bit adder example in 70-nm technology shows total power savings of 17% with 15% increase in area and no increase in delay. The power savings using this technique are expected to increase in future technologies.", "paper_title": "Area optimization for leakage reduction and thermal stability in nanometer-scale technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000252611600004"}
