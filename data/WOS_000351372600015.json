To extend the capacity, this article presents a control and data signaling decoupled architecture, namely, C/U-plane decoupled architecture for railway wireless networks, in which the relatively important C-plane of passenger services is kept on high-quality lower frequency bands to handle mobility, while the corresponding U-plane is moved to higher frequency bands to gain broader spectra. In this railway wireless network with C/U-plane decoupled architecture, the U-plane and C-plane handovers are also physically decoupled. To achieve the seamless and soft U-plane handover, we introduce a handover scheme based on coordinated multi-point transmission and reception and bi-casting. In addition, channel mappings and physical layer frames are redesigned to facilitate the design. Our study has demonstrated that by decoupling the C/U planes, the network performance is greatly enhanced, leading to a more effective way to provide high speed communications for railway systems.", "paper_title": "CONTROL AND DATA SIGNALING DECOUPLED ARCHITECTURE FOR RAILWAY WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000351372600015"}
