Pooling design is a very helpful tool for reducing the number of tests for DNA library screening. In this paper, we present two Las Vegas algorithms for efficient constructions of d-disjunct and (d;z)-disjunct matrices respectively. These new constructions can be directly applied to construct error-free and error-tolerant pooling designs.", "paper_title": "Efficient constructions of disjunct matrices with applications to DNA library screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000251051200006"}
