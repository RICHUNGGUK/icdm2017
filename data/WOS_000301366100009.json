This article suggests starting the statistical analysis using a 5-step descriptive procedure: 1) Data characterization, 2) Data coding, 3) Data table drafting, 4) Data table analysis and 5) Result presentation. In order to illustrate this preliminary statistical analysis, two data set examples are considered - one from a small simulated system and one from a large mechatronic system-using two different methods: Principal Component Analysis with usual statistical summaries and Multiple Correspondence Analysis with indicators obtained through fuzzy space windowing. In an Intelligent Data Analysis context, the discussion weighs out the pros and the cons of these approaches, prior to using procedures 5-step inference procedures.", "paper_title": "A scale fuzzy windowing comparison applied to multivariate descriptive analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000301366100009"}
