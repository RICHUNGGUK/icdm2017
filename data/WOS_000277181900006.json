Using numerical methods, the characteristic function of the differential nonlinear phase noise cos(Delta phi) in the received electrical current of signals and the accurate computation formula of the BER are achieved when SPM is dominant comparing to cross phase modulation and four wave mixing. The result is verified by a simulation of a 40-Gbit/s transmission system.", "paper_title": "Accurate computations of the nonlinear phase noise and BER in DPSK modulation-balanced direct detection high-speed optical fiber communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277181900006"}
