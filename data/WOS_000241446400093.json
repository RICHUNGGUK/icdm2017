An empirical evaluation of the method is provided by comparing the new proposal with the CHC algorithm and other well known EAs with varying population. A fitness landscape generator was chosen to test and compare the algorithms: the Spear's multimodal function generator. The performance of the algorithms was measured in terms of success rate, quality of the solutions and evaluations needed to attain them over a wide range of problem instances. We will show that SRP-EA performs well on these tests and appears to overcome some recurrent drawbacks of traditional EAs which lead them to local optima premature convergence. Also, unlike other methods, SRP-EA seems to self-regulate its population size according to the state of the search.", "paper_title": "Self-regulated population size in evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400093"}
