Energy-conserving BRDFs can produce plausible rendered images with accurate reflectance behavior, especially near grazing angles. Using our framework, we create an empirical BRDF that allows easy specification of diffuse, specular, and retroreflective materials. We also present a second BRDF model that is useful for data fitting; although it does not preserve energy, it uses the same halfway vector domain as the first model. We show that this data-fitting BRDF can be used to match measured data extremely well using only a small set of parameters. We believe that this is an improvement over table-based lookups and factored versions of BRDF data.", "paper_title": "The halfway vector disk for BRDF Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000236885100001"}
