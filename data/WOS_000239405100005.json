One of the important features in modern networks is differentiated service. Along with differentiated service, rapidly changing network environments result in congestion problems. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of representative congestion control applications-scheduling and queue management algorithms, and we propose application-specific acceleration techniques that use instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and packet-level parallelism (PLP) in these applications. From the PLP perspective, we propose a hardware acceleration model based on detailed analysis of congestion control applications. In order to get large throughputs, a large number of processing elements (PEs) and a parallel comparator are designed. Such hardware accelerators provide large parallelism proportional to the number of processing elements added. A 32-PE enhancement yields 24x speedup for weighted fair queueing (WFQ) and 27x speedup for random early detection (RED). For ILP, new instruction set extensions for fast conditional operations are applied for congestion control applications. Based on our experiments, proposed architectural extensions show 10%-12% improvement in performance for instruction set enhancements. As the performance of general-purpose processors rapidly increases, defining architectural extensions (e.g., multi-media extensions (MMX) as in multimedia applications) for general-purpose processors could be an alternative solution for a wide range of network applications.", "paper_title": "Architectural enhancements for network congestion control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239405100005"}
