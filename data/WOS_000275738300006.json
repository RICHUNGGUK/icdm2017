This paper aims to illustrate this gap by Studying the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, focusing on diagnosed preexplosion problems in decision-making processes, and prescribed post-explosion recommendations. The paper's research contribution is two-fold: 1) consolidating two KM frameworks to one research tool, to serve as lens for studying decision-making processes and 2) providing convincing evidence regarding the role of the KM perspective in organizational decision-making processes.
