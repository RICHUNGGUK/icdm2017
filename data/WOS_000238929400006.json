To generate inbetweens, linear interpolation is applied between points evenly taken in parametric domain of two DBSCs without incorporating characteristics of shape or motion, which results in distortion and unrealistic motion in animation. In this paper, more information in keyframes is extracted and utilized in inbetween generation. Points with high curvature are computed and corresponded between strokes in interpolation, Which preserves features of strokes in animation. In addition, global motion of a character or its various components is estimated and interpolated as well, Which retains the shapes during the motion. By applying the information to interpolation, the distortion is eliminated and smoother sequence of animation is achieved.
