The suspended clamped-free mu CB can move via the application of an external electrically induced force. The nonlinear model of the mu CB is linearized in multiple operating points with respect to the beam's displacement. A robust H-infinity-controller relying on the LMI-theory is designed for the set of the resulting multiple linearized submodels. Particular attention is paid in order to examine the stability issue within the intervals of the operating points. Various test cases are presented in this article, in order to investigate the efficacy of the suggested modeling and control techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
