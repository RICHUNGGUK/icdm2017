Nevertheless they seem sub-optimal in the representation of deformations. Object deformations are often continuous and not confined to big parts. Therefore we propose to replace the DPM star model based on big parts by a deformation field. This consists of a grid of small parts connected with pairwise constraints which can better handle continuous deformations. The naive application of this model for object detection would consist of a bounded sliding window approach: for each possible location of the image the best part configuration within a limited bound around this location is found. This is computationally very expensive. Instead, we propose a different inference procedure, where an iterative image-level search finds the best object hypothesis. We show that this approach is faster than bounded sliding windows yet produces comparable accuracy. Experiments further show that the deformation field can better approximate real object deformations and therefore, for certain classes, produces even better detection accuracy than state-of-the-art DPM. Finally, the same approach is adapted to model-free tracking, showing improved accuracy also in this case.", "paper_title": "An Elastic Deformation Field Model for Object Detection and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000348345500001"}
