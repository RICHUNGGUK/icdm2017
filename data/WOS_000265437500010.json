We describe the structures in the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the gradient tensor and how these structures can be used to infer the behaviors of the velocity field that can represent either a 2D compressible flow or the projection of a 3D compressible or incompressible flow onto a 2D manifold. To illustrate the structures in asymmetric tensor fields, we introduce the notions of eigenvalue manifold and eigenvector manifold. These concepts afford a number of theoretical results that clarify the connections between symmetric and antisymmetric components in tensor fields. In addition, these manifolds naturally lead to partitions of tensor fields, which we use to design effective visualization strategies. Moreover, we extend eigenvectors continuously into the complex domains which we refer to as pseudoeigenvectors. We make use of evenly spaced tensor lines following pseudoeigenvectors to illustrate the local linearization of tensors everywhere inside complex domains simultaneously. Both eigenvalue manifold and eigenvector manifold are supported by a tensor reparameterization with physical meaning. This allows us to relate our tensor analysis to physical quantities such as rotation, angular deformation, and dilation, which provide a physical interpretation of our tensor-driven vector field analysis in the context of fluid mechanics. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we have applied our visualization techniques and interpretation to the study of the Sullivan Vortex as well as computational fluid dynamics simulation data.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric Tensor Analysis for Flow Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437500010"}
