On wireless sensor fields, sensors closer to a sink node have a larger forwarding traffic burden and consume more energy than nodes further away from the sink. The uneven node power consumption dramatically reduces sensor network lifetime, leading to what is known as an energy hole problem (EHP). From the literatures, most research works have focused on how to optimally increase the probability of sleeping states using various wake-up strategies to mitigate EHP. In this article, we propose a greener strategy for optimizing power consumption of sensor node using the N-policy M/G/1 queuing model expressed in terms of a Petri Net design for qualitative analysis. A comprehensive mathematical analysis on the optimal control parameters has been made. Much data analysis and network simulations have been conducted to validate the proposed model. Comprehensive design illustrations and network simulation are presented to demonstrate some mission-oriented application scenarios, and hence the proposed approach indeed provides a feasibly cost-efficient design framework for sustainable computing requirement.", "paper_title": "Toward Sustainable Sensor Field by Greener Technique of Optimization with Queue-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600009"}
