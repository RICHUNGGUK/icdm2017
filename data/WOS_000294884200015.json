Design/methodology/approach - From a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective, the authors researched the constitution and operating mechanism of China's software industry innovation system. By using methods and theories of CAS theory, the innovation problems of the software industry in China were analyzed and valuable suggestions put forth for its future development. Findings - Innovation system is one kind of complex systems and it has the characteristics of CAS. Research limitations/implications Quantitative analysis of the software industry innovation system should be emphasized in the next stage of research. Practical implications - The paper provides a new perspective and useful advice for technology policymakers. Originality/value - The paper applies CAS theory to the area of social management and provides a new approach to study industrial innovation systems.", "paper_title": "Research on the innovation system of China's software industry based on CAS theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000294884200015"}
