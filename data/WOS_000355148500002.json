It allows modification of the SOFC's governing equations, as well as the configuration of the cell's fuel-air flow pattern at the flowsheet level. Initially, the dynamic behaviour of single compartment of a cell was examined with a OD model, which became the building block for more complex SOFC configurations. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was performed at the channel (1D) scale for different flow patterns. Thirdly, the effect of fuel and air flow rates on the predominant distributed variables of a cell was tested on a 2D assembly. Finally, an optimisation study was carried out on the 2D cell, leading to a robust, optimal air distribution profile that minimises the internal temperature gradient. This work forms the foundation of future stack and system scale studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
