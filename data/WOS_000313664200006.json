The old client-server architecture is gradually becoming unable to satisfy users' various requests and deal with the heavy loading of networks. Many applications adopt P2P architecture to provide more flexible and efficient service. However, P2P systems are not flawless. The anarchic property of P2P systems keeps participant behaviour uncontrolled. Thus, the behaviour of free riding occurs. This paper uses game theory to explore what results from free riding, designs a co-opetition framework to solve the free riding problem, and also proposes a fairness index to monitor the efficiency of the whole system. Simulations are used to test co-opetition under different environments.
