Because femtocells can use the same frequency bands as the cellular network, the cochannel interference is a critical issue in femto networks. To efficiently reduce interference between femto BS and other BSs, low duty mode (LDM) operation has been developed. In this work, we construct a mechanism integrating the LDM in femto BS and sleep mode in MSs to achieve higher power-saving efficiency. On the basis of the IEEE 802.16m system architecture, we build a practical system model and analyze the performance of the proposed scheme. The simulation result shows that with simple modification of sleep-cycle operation, the proposed mechanism can reduce the power consumption in femtocells. With the above characteristics, the proposed mechanism provides a solid basis for energy efficient femtocells.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Networking with IEEE 802.16m Femtocell Low Duty Mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000309349400010"}
