The controllers employ user position and force measurements to replace the natural dynamics of the haptic interface with that of an adjustable mass-damper tool. The transparency and stability of the resulting systems are investigated using a Lyapunov analysis and by taking into account uncertain nonlinear dynamics for the haptic device, and uncertain mass-spring-damper type dynamics for the user and virtual environment. It is shown that low-pass filtering of the hand force can largely reduce the synthesized mass that can be stably presented to the user in a discrete-time implementation of the controllers. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to balance impedance reduction against noise amplification in choosing the filter gain and bandwidth. The proposed controllers as well as a conventional penalty-based method are compared in a set of experiments. The results indicate that the controller with an admittance-type virtual environment and a constraint-based rigid wall has far superior performance in terms of the range of impedances that it can stably display to the user.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Control for Improved Transparency in Haptic Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000207898100002"}
