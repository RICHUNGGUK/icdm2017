Our approach uses the locally linear embedding (LLE) to represent each pixel as a linear combination of its neighbors in a feature space. While previous methods require similar pixels to have similar results, we seek to maintain the manifold structure formed by all pixels in the feature space. Specifically, we require each pixel to be the same linear combination of its neighbors in the result. Compared with previous methods, our proposed algorithm is more robust to color blending in the input data. Furthermore, since every pixel is only related to a few nearest neighbors, our algorithm easily achieves good runtime efficiency. We demonstrate our manifold preserving edit propagation on various applications.", "paper_title": "Manifold Preserving Edit Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311298900006"}
