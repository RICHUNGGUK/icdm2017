By an (N, M, w, 1; lambda)-multilength optical orthogonal code (MLOOC), we mean an MLOOC of autocross correlation value and intracross correlation value one and intercross correlation value lambda. The code contains m(i) codewords of weight w and length ni for 0 <= i <= k - 1. The study of MLOOCs is motivated by an application in optical networks requiring multiple signaling rates and quality-of-services. In this paper, we study (N, M, w, 1; lambda)-MLOOCs with lambda = 2 (the least value among the nontrivial intercross correlations). Some new upper bounds on code size are derived under certain restrictions and a novel encoding approach is established. A number of series of new MLOOCs are then produced. These codes are of optimal sizes with respect to the new bounds.", "paper_title": "Multilength Optical Orthogonal Codes: New Upper Bounds and Optimal Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600023"}
