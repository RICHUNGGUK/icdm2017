Low-power optimizations are therefore often applied toward the development of Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors (ASIPs). In this paper ASIP accelerators for a typical DSP task are developed and synthesis results from six different cell-based and FPGA architectures are shown. By carefully analyzing algorithms and implementing appropriate accelerators with logic, it is shown that an increase in design performance is achieved while still reducing energy consumption due to the reduced latency of the task. In addition, we show cases when classic synthesis options can outperform new power optimization features in Xilinx ISE 11.1. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
