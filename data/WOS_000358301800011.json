In this paper, we study the problem of object recognition, where the training samples are missing during the classifier learning stage, a task also known as zero-shot learning. We propose a novel zero-shot learning strategy that utilizes the topic model and hierarchical class concept. Our proposed method advanced where cumbersome human annotation stage (i.e., attribute-based classification) is eliminated. We achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art algorithms in four public datasets: PubFig (67.09%), Cifar-100 (54.85%), Caltech-256 (52.14%), and Animals with Attributes (49.65%), when unseen classes exist in the classification task.", "paper_title": "Zero-Shot Object Recognition System Based on Topic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000358301800011"}
