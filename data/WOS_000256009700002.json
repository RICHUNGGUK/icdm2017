Starting from a variational formulation of such a problem on a shape manifold we introduce a regularization technique incorporating statistical shape knowledge. The key idea is to consider a Riemannian metric on the shape manifold which reflects the statistics of a given training set. We investigate the properties of the regularization functional and illustrate our technique by applying it to region-based and edge-based segmentation of image data. In contrast to previous works our framework can be considered on arbitrary (finite-dimensional) shape manifolds and allows the use of Riemannian metrics for regularization of a wide class of variational problems in image processing.", "paper_title": "Regularized reconstruction of shapes with statistical a priori knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000256009700002"}
