A number of 2D grammar models have been proposed motivated by a variety of applications. A P system is a biologically motivated new computing model, proposed by Paun in the area of membrane computing. It is a rich framework for dealing with different problems, including the problem of handling picture array generation. In this paper, the generative power of the array-rewriting P system with pure 2D context-free rules is investigated by comparing it with other 2D grammar models, thus bringing out the suitability of this P system model for picture array generation.
