We also obtain two representation results. Then, for the sake of the application of fuzzy n-ellipsoid numbers, we define some special kinds of fuzzy n-ellipsoid numbers, investigate their properties, set up a specific iterative algorithm of their membership function value, and prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm. And then, we establish an algorithmic version of constructing fuzzy n-ellipsoid numbers to express an object that is characterized by a group of uncertain multichannel digital information, as well as give practical examples to show the application and rationality of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy n-Ellipsoid Numbers and Representations of Uncertain Multichannel Digital Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200006"}
