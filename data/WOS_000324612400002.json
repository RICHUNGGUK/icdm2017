Quasi-static non-injurious axial compression and three-point bending tests were first conducted on a male clavicle followed by a dynamic three-point bending test to fracture. Then, two types of FE models of the clavicle were developed using bone material properties which were set to vary with the computed tomography image density of the bone. A volumetric solid FE model comprised solely of hexahedral elements was first developed. A solid-shell FE model was then created which modelled the trabecular bone as hexahedral elements and the cortical bone as quadrilateral shell elements. Finally, simulations were carried out using these models to evaluate the influence of variations in cortical thickness, mesh density, bone material properties and modelling approach on the biomechanical responses of the clavicle, compared with experimental data. The FE results indicate that the inclusion of density-based bone material properties can provide a more accurate reproduction of the force-displacement response and bone fracture timing than a model with uniform bone material properties. Inclusion of a variable cortical thickness distribution also slightly improves the ability of the model to predict the experimental response. The methods developed in this study will be useful for creating subject-specific FE models to better understand the biomechanics and injury mechanism of the clavicle.", "paper_title": "Development and validation of a subject-specific finite element model of a human clavicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000324612400002"}
