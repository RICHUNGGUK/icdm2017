In this paper, we propose a preference perception system by combining fuzzy set with data mining technology to detect the information preference of each user on a web-based environment. An experiment was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system in this study. It indicates that the proposed system can effectively perceive the change of information preference for users in a Web environment.", "paper_title": "A web user preference perception system based on fuzzy data mining method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200054"}
