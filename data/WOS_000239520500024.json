Accordingly, a tool to generate an adapter which integrates interfaces of several web services is proposed in this paper. The concept of the adapter for the integration of web services interface is described. The purpose of the adapter is to help developers use several web services with little effort for their application development. Then, implementation of the tool to generate an adapter is presented. The architecture of the tool, the process, and the algorithm to generate an adapter are described. The tool will help developers integrate several web services when they develop applications.", "paper_title": "A tool to generate an adapter for the integration of web services interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000239520500024"}
