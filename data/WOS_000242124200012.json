Mildly context-sensitive languages are able to represent some context-sensitive constructions, those most common in natural languages, such as multiple agreement, crossed agreement, and duplication. These languages are attractive for natural language applications due to their expressiveness, and the fact that they are not fully context-sensitive should lead to computational advantages as well. We realize one such computational advantage by presenting the first polynomial-time algorithm for inferring Simple External Context Grammars, a class of mildly context-sensitive grammars, from positive examples.", "paper_title": "Inferring grammars for mildly context sensitive languages in polynomial-time", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124200012"}
