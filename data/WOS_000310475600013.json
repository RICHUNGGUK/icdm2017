Despite wide adoption of physics simulation for the animation of passive phenomena, such as fluids, cloths and rag-doll characters, commercial applications still resort to kinematics-based approaches for the animation of actively controlled characters. However, following a renewed interest in the use of physics simulation for interactive character animation, many recent publications demonstrate tremendous improvements in robustness, visual quality and usability. We present a structured review of over two decades of research on physics-based character animation, as well as point out various open research areas and possible future directions.", "paper_title": "Interactive Character Animation Using Simulated Physics: A State-of-the-Art Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000310475600013"}
