Authentication is provided for both auctions and exhibitions, where users can use their own mobile devices to authenticate works of art. Transport is provided by a secure protocol that makes use of position-time information and wireless sensors providing context information. The system has been used in several real case studies in the context of the CUSPIS project and continues to be used as a commercial product for the transportation and exhibition of cultural assets in Italy.", "paper_title": "Context-based authentication and transport of cultural assets", "paper_id": "WOS:000277245300002"}
