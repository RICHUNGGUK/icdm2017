By appropriate parametrization of the underlying manifolds, i.e. using triangular and orthogonal Jacobi matrices we replace a high dimensional minimization problem by a sequence of simple one dimensional minimization problems. In addition, a new scale-invariant cost function for non-orthogonal joint diagonalization is employed. These algorithms are step-size free. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the methods.", "paper_title": "Simple LU and QR based non-orthogonal matrix joint diagonalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300001"}
