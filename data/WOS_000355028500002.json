However, most of the previous works focus on supervised methods in which the data labelling is known to be time-consuming and sometimes error-prone. In addition, due to the randomness and erratic nature of human behaviours in realistic environments, supervised models trained with data from certain subject might not be scaled to others. Further more, unsupervised methods, with little knowledge about the activities to be recognised, might result in poor performance and high clustering overhead. To this end, we propose an activity recognition model with labelled and unlabelled data in smart environments. With small amount of labelled data, we discover activity patterns from unlabelled data based on proposed similarity measurement algorithm. Our system does not require large amount of data to be labelled while the proposed similarity measurement method is effective to discover length-varying, disordered and discontinuous activity patterns in smart environments. Therefore, our methods yield comparable performance with much less labelled data when compared with traditional supervised activity recognition, and achieve higher accuracy with lower clustering overhead compared with unsupervised methods. The experiments based on real datasets from the smart environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, being able to discover more than 90% of original activities from the unlabelled data, and the comparative experiments show that our methods are capable of providing a better trade-off, regarding the accuracy, overhead and labelling efforts, between the supervised and unsupervised methods.
