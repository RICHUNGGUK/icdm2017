Here, we describe an artificial neural network based on a twisted torus topology, which allows for the generation of regular triangular grids. The association of the activity of pre-defined hippocampal place cells with entorhinal grid cells allows for a highly robust-to-noise calibration mechanism, suggesting a role for the hippocampal back-projections to the entorhinal cortex.", "paper_title": "A model of grid cells based on a twisted torus topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000249024600003"}
