We give applications to alcoved polytopes, using normal idempotent matrices (which form a subclass of Kleene stars). For a normal matrix we define a norm and show that this is the radius of a hyperplane section of its tropical span.", "paper_title": "ON TROPICAL KLEENE STAR MATRICES AND ALCOVED POLYTOPES", "paper_id": "WOS:000330747300005"}
