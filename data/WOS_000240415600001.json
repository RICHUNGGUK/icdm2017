While recognizing features, the workpiece is sliced at some assigned positions. The sectional curves of the workpiece faces and slicing plane constitute the feature profiles. Not only the isolated machining features but also the intersecting machining features can be identified by the information from these intersection profiles. Moreover, the recognized machining features, can be employed for scheduling the manufacturing sequence. Different kinds of tool paths can be automatically generated for various machining features to improve the cutting efficiency.
