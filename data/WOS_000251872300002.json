Previous work has assumed an independent overlay model: a graph with independent link capacities. We introduce a model of overlays that incorporates correlated link capacities and linear capacity constraints (LCC) to formulate hidden shared bottlenecks; we refer to these as LCC-overlays. We define metrics to qualitatively measure overlay quality in terms of its accuracy ( in representing the true network topology) and efficiency ( that is, performance). Through analysis and simulations, we show that LCC-overlay is perfectly accurate and, hence, enjoys much higher efficiency than the inaccurate independent overlay. We discover that even a highly restricted LCC class-node- based LCC-yields near-optimal accuracy and significantly higher efficiency. We study two network flow problems in the context of LCC-graphs: widest path and maximum flow. We prove that Widest Path with LCC is NP-complete. We formulate Maximum Flow with LCC as a linear program and propose an efficient distributed algorithm to solve it. Based on the LCC model, we further study the problem of optimizing delay while still maintaining optimal or near-optimal bandwidth. We also outline a distributed algorithm to efficiently construct an overlay with node-based LCC.", "paper_title": "Overlay networks with linear capacity constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000251872300002"}
