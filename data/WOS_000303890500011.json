Recent advances in identity-based cryptography (IBC) sheds light on this problem and has become popular as a solution base. We present a comprehensive picture and capture the state of the art of IBC security applications in MANETs based on a survey of publications on this topic since the emergence of IBC in 2001. In this paper, we also share insights into open research problems and point out interesting future directions in this area.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Applications of Identity-Based Cryptography in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303890500011"}
