Moreover, in order to make palmprint recognition more accurate, we introduced 2DPCA technique into the extraction of palmprint features, and removed the illumination information from the collected palm images using w/o3 technique. Our approach was compared with several existing methods, and obtained a satisfying classification performance on the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Palmprint Database.
