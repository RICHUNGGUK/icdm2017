However, it is difficult combinatorial optimization problem for engineers. Swarm intelligence (SI) was very popular and widely used in many complex optimization problems which was collective behavior of social systems such as honey bees (bee algorithm, BA) and birds (particle swarm optimization, PSO). This study proposed an optimization hybrid swarm algorithm namely particle-bee algorithm (PBA) based on a particular intelligent behavior of honey bee and bird swarms by integrates theirs advantages. This study compares the performance of PBA with that of BA and PSO for hypothetical construction engineering of CSL problems. The results show that the performance of PBA is comparable to those of the mentioned algorithms and can be efficiently employed to solve those hypothetical CSL problems with high dimensionality.
