In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Such mapping diversity and channel coding. We calculate the capacity of the Popular bitinterleaved-coded modulation (BICM) to draw qualitative and approximate quantitative Conclusions that are valid for strong codes approaching the capacity limits. We conclude that the choice/design of the appropriate mapping depends on the targeted spectral efficiency and we demonstrate that certain form of mapping diversity may be Counterproductive. We also show that iterative demapping may be Successfully applied to significantly reduce (by more than 1 dB) the gap between the BICM and coded modulations (CM) capacities. The analysis is illustrated With results obtained when the mapping diversity is combined with practical turbo codes.
