The proposed approach uses a new scheme for interpolation of look-up tables (LUTs) with respect to process parameters. The effect of various process parameters, viz., channel length, fin width, and effective oxide thickness is studied for three circuits: buffer chain, static random access memory cell, and high-gain low-voltage op-amp. Compared to mixed-mode (device-circuit) simulation, the proposed LUT-based approach is shown to be much faster, thus making it practically a feasible and attractive option for variability analysis especially for emerging technologies where compact models are not available for circuit simulation.", "paper_title": "A Table-Based Approach to Study the Impact of Process Variations on FinFET Circuit Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000275851700011"}
