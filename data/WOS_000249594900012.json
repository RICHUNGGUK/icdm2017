This paper presents an event stream-based online algorithm that fuses the data reported from the processors in such a network to detect time-based predicates. The algorithm has low space, time, and message complexities. The paper also considers the detection of simultaneous events as a special case.", "paper_title": "Temporal predicate detection using synchronized clocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249594900012"}
