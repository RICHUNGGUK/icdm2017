The problem is to find a minimum energy subgraph for a given subset and a destination node such that there are k node-disjoint paths from each node in the subset to the destination node in the subgraph. Firstly, we prove that the problem is NP-hard, and then propose two approximation algorithms: the minimum weight k node-disjoint paths based (MWkNDPB) algorithm and the minimum energy k node-disjoint paths based (MEkNDPB) algorithm. Extensive simulations have been conducted to show that proposed algorithms are efficient. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
