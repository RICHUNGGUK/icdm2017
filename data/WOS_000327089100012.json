The shared segment-based protection (SSBP) method is used in this article to protect the delay-constrained multicast transmission. Two heuristic methods are proposed to find the delay-constrained primary tree and the backup segments with delay constraint. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, and the performance to be evaluated includes wavelength efficiency ratio (WER), blocking ratio (BR), and executing time. Simulations show that the SSBP method can get better BR and WER than the previous results demonstrated Din and Jiang (Comput Commun 35(10):1172-1184, 2012).", "paper_title": "Delay-constrained survivable multicast routing problem in WDM networks with shared segment-based protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100012"}
