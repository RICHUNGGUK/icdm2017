Sunscald is the representative of physiological diseases. This paper presented a novel computer modeling and simulation method for fruit sunscald. We mainly focus on the morphology change of fruit appearance affected by sunscald disease under the condition of water loss. An improved mass spring model is proposed, by combining cell turgor pressure with mass spring. We adopt this physical deformation model for dynamic simulation of fruit sunscald disease. We calculate the cell turgor pressure variation due to water loss and thereby get the displacement changing of every mass particle in our simulation system. Finally, the software of Maya is adopted to render the deform model to render the simulation result. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Computer Modeling and Simulation of Fruit Sunscald", "paper_id": "WOS:000362355800006"}
