A matrix is said to have a statistical restricted isometry property (StRIP) of order k if most submatrices with k columns define a near-isometric map of R-k into R-m. As our main result, we establish sufficient conditions for the StRIP property of a matrix in terms of the mutual coherence and mean square coherence. We show that for many existing deterministic families of sampling matrices, m = O(k) rows suffice for k-StRIP, which is an improvement over the known estimates of either m = Theta (k log N) or m = Theta (k log k). We also give examples of matrix families that are shown to have the StRIP property using our sufficient conditions.", "paper_title": "Restricted Isometry Property of Random Subdictionaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400022"}
