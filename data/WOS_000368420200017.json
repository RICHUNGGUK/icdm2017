This paper analyzes the TH-CDMA with random spreading, by determining whether peculiar theoretical limits are identifiable, with both optimal and suboptimal receiver structures, in particular in the archetypal case of sparse spreading, that is, N-s = 1. Results indicate that the TH-CDMA has a fundamentally different behavior than DS-CDMA, where the crucial role played by energy concentration, typical of TH, directly relates with its intrinsic uneven use of degrees of freedom.", "paper_title": "Spectral Efficiency of Random Time-Hopping CDMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200017"}
