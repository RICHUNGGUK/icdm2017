In real images, the full gradients of the edge indicator function along the object boundaries are often small. Hence, the curve evolution of edge-based active contours can terminate early before converging to the object boundaries with a careless contour initialization. We propose a novel Geodesic Snakes (GeoSnakes) active contour that requires the full gradients of the edge indicator to vanish at the optimal solution. Besides, the conventional curve evolution approach for minimizing active contour energy cannot fully solve the Euler-Lagrange equation of our GeoSnakes active contour, causing a pseudo stationary phenomenon (PSP). To address the PSP problem, we propose an auxiliary curve evolution equation, named the equilibrium flow (EF) equation. Based on the EF and the conventional curve evolution, we obtain a solution to the full Euler-Lagrange equation of GeoSnakes active contour. Experimental results validate the proposed geometrical interpretation of the early termination problem, and they also show that the proposed method is able to overcome the problem.", "paper_title": "Active Contour with a Tangential Component", "paper_id": "WOS:000350241300001"}
