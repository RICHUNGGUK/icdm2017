But, received signals in a relay station of a cell edge have a large error because a neighboring cell transmits the signals for other users. Since the transmitted signals for other users are interference for received signals in the relay station of the cell edge, the relay station has a negative effect on the bit error ratio performance. The cell coverage can not be extended stably. In order to expand the cell coverage stably, the inter-cell interference has to cancel. Thus, in this paper, the technique that the inter-cell interference (ICI) is canceled by cooperative relays is proposed. Also, diversity gain is obtained by cooperative relays.", "paper_title": "Performance Improvement Technique with Cooperative Relay in Cellular System", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600028"}
