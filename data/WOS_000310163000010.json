Its effects on circuit timing can be especially pronounced for circuits with standby-mode equipped functional units, because these units can be subjected to static NBTI stress for extended periods of time. This article describes Internal Node Control (INC), in which the inputs to some individual gates are directly manipulated to prevent this static NBTI fatigue. We prove that the INC selection problem is NP-complete and present a linear-time heuristic that can quickly determine near-optimal placements. This near-optimality is confirmed by comparing results for small benchmarks against optimal solutions from a mixed integer linear programming formulation of our problem. We evaluate the heuristic on the ISCAS85 benchmarks and the Synopsys DesignWare Library. Our heuristic reduces static NBTI-induced delay over a ten year period by 30-60% and can reduce total path delay by an average 9.4% when NBTI degradation is severe. The INC placements and sleep signal routing require only a 1.6% increase in area.", "paper_title": "Static NBTI Reduction Using Internal Node Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000310163000010"}
