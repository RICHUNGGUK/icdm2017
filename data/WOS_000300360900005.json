The targeted feature is the unlicensed band around 60 GHz suitable for wireless personal area network application (WPAN). To optimize the linearity, the PA is designed under class A biasing to have an output compression point (OCP1) close to its saturated Power (P-sat). S-parameters and large signal measurement results are demonstrated and compared with electromagnetic simulations. The PA offers a P-sat of 8.3 dBm, an OCP1 of 6 dBm and a gain of 6.7 dB. The die area is 0.29 mm(2) with pads. Considering those results, one-tone simulations are not sufficient to characterize the linearity performances of the PA in its real conditions of use. Consequently, two-tone simulations are firstly performed. After, linearity figures of merit (FoM) are discussed applying an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signal. The PA offers an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of 15 dB and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 20% at PA compression operating mode.", "paper_title": "A linear 60 GHz 65 nm-CMOS power amplifier realization and characterization for OFDM signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000300360900005"}
