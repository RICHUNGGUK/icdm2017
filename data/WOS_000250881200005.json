Innovative transaction execution schemes and concurrency control mechanisms are therefore required to exploit the full potential of MDS. In this paper, we report our investigation on a multi-versions transaction processing approach and a deadlock-free concurrency control mechanism based on multiversion two-phase locking scheme integrated with a timestamp approach. We study the behavior of the proposed model with a simulation study in a MDS environment. We have compared our schemes using a reference model to argue that such a performance comparison helps to show the superiority of our model over others. Experimental results demonstrate that our model provide significantly higher throughput by improving degree of concurrency, by reducing transaction wait time, and by minimizing restarts and aborts.", "paper_title": "A transaction model and multiversion concurrency control for mobile database systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250881200005"}
