The problem, denoted as the bin packing problem with conflicts, is of practical and theoretical interest because of its many real-world applications and because it generalizes both the bin packing problem and the vertex coloring problem. We present new lower bounds, upper bounds, and an exact approach, based on a set covering formulation solved through a branch-and-price algorithm. We investigate the behavior of the proposed procedures by means of extensive computational results on benchmark instances from the literature.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts", "paper_id": "WOS:000280476300005"}
