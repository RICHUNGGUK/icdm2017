In practical situations, the predetermined schedule often changes under the influence of the unpredictable or variable environment in the factory. The reactive scheduling (RS) is a methodology to modify the predetermined schedule to cope with variable situations without suspending the proceeding of the processes on the schedule. Therefore, the RS requires a method to improve the schedule with fast computational time. To obtain an effective method for the RS, this paper proposes a novel RS method using local clustering organization. Also, this paper examines its effectiveness by a numerical experiment. Our results suggest that the proposed method is more effective than the method using genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "Application of local clustering organization to reactive job-shop scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000351408300010"}
