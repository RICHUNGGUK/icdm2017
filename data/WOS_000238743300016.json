In this paper we extend the understanding of how sampling affects the solution quality of multistage stochastic programming problems. We present a new heuristic for determining good feasible solutions for a multistage decision problem. For power and log-utility functions we address the question of how tree structures, number of stages, number of outcomes and number of assets affect the solution quality. We also present a new method for evaluating the quality of first stage decisions.", "paper_title": "Solving multistage asset investment problems by the sample average approximation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000238743300016"}
