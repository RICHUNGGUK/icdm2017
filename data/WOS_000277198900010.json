The obstacle number (convex obstacle number) of G is the smallest number of obstacles (convex obstacles) in any obstacle representation of G. In this paper, we identify families of graphs with obstacle number 1 and construct graphs with arbitrarily large obstacle number (convex obstacle number). We prove that a graph has an obstacle representation with a single convex k-gon if and only if it is a circular arc graph with clique covering number at most k in which no two arcs cover the host circle. We also prove independently that a graph has an obstacle representation with a single segment obstacle if and only if it is the complement of an interval bigraph.", "paper_title": "Obstacle Numbers of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000277198900010"}
