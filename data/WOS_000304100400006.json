However, lack of any time-related data in the analysis process implicitly denies much of the dynamic nature of social tagging activity. In this paper we claim that holding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopic users' interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events. To this end, we propose a time-aware co-clustering approach for acquiring semantic and temporal patterns out of the tagging activity. The resulted clusters contain both users and tags of similar patterns over time, and reveal non-obvious or \"hidden\" relations among users and topics of their common interest. Zoom in & out views serve as visualization methods on different aspects of the clusters' structure, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the approach.", "paper_title": "In & out zooming on time-aware user/tag clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000304100400006"}
