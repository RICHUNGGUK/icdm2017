In this study, a hybrid computational model was developed for the simulation of whole-cell migration behaviors. The model integrates submodels of reaction-diffusion, actin filaments (F-actin) and the plasma membrane. Reaction-diffusion was calculated as if enclosed by a moving membrane. Individual F-actins were reorganized on the basis of stochastic kinetic events, such as polymerization, capping, branching and severing. Membrane dynamics were modeled using an optimization of energy function that depends on cell volume, surface area, smoothness and the elasticity of F-actin against the membrane. Simulations of this model demonstrated self-organization of F-actin networks, as in lamellipodia, and chemotactic migration. Furthermore, this method was extended to address external obstacles to simulate the dynamic cellular morphological changes seen during invasive migration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
