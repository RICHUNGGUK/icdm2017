By applying linear interpolation method, the displacement data can be transferred between nonconforming interfaces. With the application of energy conservation principle, a relationship between the forces on different surfaces is constructed. By considering the displacement compatibility conditions together with force equilibrium conditions over the common interfaces, a relation between different components of a system is established. However, this interpolation method is only applicable to object components with the same or similar mesh densities. For models with different mesh densities between neighboring components, abnormities arise in the deformation. The causes of these abnormities are parsed by experiments and theoretical analysis. To eliminate the abnormal deformation, a traction superimposition method is proposed to enforce the force constraints on the interfaces. Experimental results are provided to verify this approach.
