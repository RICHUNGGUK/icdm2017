Under the assumption of uniform linear motion between the camera and the scene during finite exposure time, both the pinhole model and the camera with a finite aperture are considered. The blur extent is estimated by intensity profile analysis and focus measurement of the deblurred images. The proposed method has been verified experimentally using edge images.", "paper_title": "Depth recovery from motion and defocus blur", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600012"}
