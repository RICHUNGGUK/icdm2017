However, such an assumption may be unrealistic, obscuring important features of within- and among-unit variation. A simple and robust Bayesian parametric approach that relaxes this assumption by using a multivariate skew-elliptical distribution, which includes the Skew-t, Skew-normal, t-Student, and Normal distributions as special cases and provides flexibility in capturing a broad range of non-normal and asymmetric behavior is presented. An appropriate posterior simulation scheme is developed and the methods are illustrated with an application to a longitudinal data example. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
