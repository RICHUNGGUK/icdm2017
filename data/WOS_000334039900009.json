Firstly, the concept of the knowledge representation technique of SOEKS-DDNA is discussed, and then an attempt is made to organize the past research related with it in chronological order. This work focuses on the review on SOEKS-DDNA, its application in different domains, the various implementation platforms, as well as its benefits and its limitations. The second part of this article provides an idea of the SOEKS-DDNA-related research endeavors currently carried out by us and the last part is a sneak peek into our planned future work.", "paper_title": "Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decisional DNA (DDNA): Past, Present and Future", "paper_id": "WOS:000334039900009"}
