We present two equivalent sets of design properties and draw links with the literature. In particular, the two-level construction based on a P-0-consistent and a stabilization part provides a systematic way of designing these operators. We present a simple example of piecewise constant reconstruction in each mesh cell, relying on geometric identities to fulfill the design properties on polyhedral meshes. Finally, we use these reconstruction operators to define a Hodge inner product and build Compatible Discrete Operator schemes, and we test the influence of the reconstruction operators in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency on an anisotropic diffusion problem.
