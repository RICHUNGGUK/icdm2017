The standard solution to this problem involves adding an auxiliary clock to take care of the non-Zenoness. In this paper, it is shown that this simple transformation may sometimes result in an exponential blowup. A construction avoiding this blowup is proposed. It is also shown that in many cases, non-Zenoness can be ascertained without an extra construction. An on-the-fly algorithm for the non-emptiness problem, using a non-Zenoness construction only when required, is proposed. Experiments carried out with a prototype implementation of the algorithm are reported.", "paper_title": "Efficient emptiness check for timed Buchi automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000302069300002"}
