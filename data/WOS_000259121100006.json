Nevertheless, there is the need for modeling adaptation of fuzzy logic programs, so that machine learning techniques, such as connectionist-based learning, can be applied. Weighted fuzzy logic programs bring fuzzy logic programs and connectionist models closer together by associating a significant weight with each atom in the body of a fuzzy rule: by exploiting the existence of the weights, it is possible to construct a connectionist model that reflects the exact structure of a weighted fuzzy logic program. Based on the connectionist representation, we first define the weight adaptation problem as the task of adapting the weights of the rules of a weighted fuzzy logic program, so that they fit: best a set of training data, and then we develop a subgradient descent learning algorithm for the connectionist model that allows us to obtain an approximate solution for the weight adaptation problem.
