We can find analytical solutions for the most used and well-known robots in the literature. However, these solutions are specific to a particular robot configuration and are not generally applicable to other robot morphologies. The proposed method is general in the sense that it is independent of the robot morphology. The method is based on the evolutionary computation paradigm and works obtaining incrementally better neuro-controllers. Furthermore, the proposed method solves some specific issues in robotic neuro-controller learning: it avoids any neural network learning algorithm which relies on the classical supervised input-target learning scheme and hence it lets to obtain neurocontrollers without providing targets. It can converge beyond local optimal solutions, which is one of the main drawbacks of some neural network training algorithms based on gradient descent when applied to highly redundant robot morphologies. Furthermore, using learning algorithms such as the neuro-evolution of augmenting topologies it is also possible to learn the neural network topology which is a common source of empirical testing in neuro-controllers design. Finally, experimental results are provided when applying the method to two multi-link robot learning tasks and a comparison between structural and parametric evolutionary strategies on neuro-controllers is shown.
