In 2006, Dolati and Ubeda-Flores presented multivariate generalizations of this class, also they investigated symmetry, dependence concepts and measuring the dependence among the components of each classes. In this paper, a new method of constructing binary copulas is introduced, extending the original study of Rodriguez-Lallena and Ubeda-Flores to new families of symmetric/asymmetric copulas. Several properties and parameters of newly introduced copulas are included. Among others, relationship of our construction method with several kinds of ordinal sums of copulas is clarified.
