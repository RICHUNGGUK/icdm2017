The throughput Of a multiplier is dependent on the required number of clock cycles to reach a result and its critical path delay. However, most bit-serial GF(2(m)) multipliers do not manage to reduce the required number of clock cycles below the threshold of in clock cycles without increasing dramatically their critical path delay. This increase is more evident if a Multiplier is designed to be versatile. In this article, a new versatile bit-serial MSB multiplier For GF(2(m)) fields is proposed that achieves a 50% increase on average ill throughput when compared to other designs, with a very small increase in its critical path delay. This is achieved by an average 33.4% reduction in the required number of clock cycles below in. The proposed design call handle arbitrary bit-lengths upper bounded by in and is Suitable for applications where the field order may vary. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
