To reduce the computational complexity of the Fisher score extraction and the training phases, we also propose a score space selection method and show that, similar or even higher accuracies can be obtained by using only a subset of the score spaces Based on the proposed score space selection method, a signer adaptation technique is also presented that does not require any re-training (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A multi-class classification strategy for Fisher scores: Application to signer independent sign language recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000275615800005"}
