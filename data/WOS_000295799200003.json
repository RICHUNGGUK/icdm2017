Challenging issues in their research agenda include the sparsity of user preference data and the lack of flexibility to incorporate contextual factors in the recommendation methods. To a significant extent, these issues can be related to a limited description and exploitation of the semantics underlying both user and item representations. The authors propose a three-fold knowledge representation, in which an explicit, semantic-rich domain knowledge space is incorporated between user and item spaces. The enhanced semantics support the development of contextualisation capabilities and enable performance improvements in recommendation methods. As a proof of concept and evaluation testbed, the approach is evaluated through its implementation in a news recommender system, in which it is tested with real users. In such scenario, semantic knowledge bases and item annotations are automatically produced from public sources.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Semantic Layer for Hybrid Recommender Systems: Application to News Recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000295799200003"}
