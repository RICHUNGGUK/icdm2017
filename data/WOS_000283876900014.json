The RASFC scheme is composed of a robust adaptive controller and a self-structuring fuzzy controller. In the self-structuring fuzzy controller design, a novel self-structuring fuzzy system (SFS) is used to approximate the unknown plant nonlinearity, and the SFS can automatically grow and prune fuzzy rules to realise a compact fuzzy rule base. The robust adaptive controller is designed to achieve an L2 tracking performance to stabilise the closed-loop system. This L2 tracking performance can provide a clear expression of tracking error in terms of the sum of lumped uncertainty and external disturbance, which has not been shown in previous works. Finally, five examples are presented to show that the proposed RASFC scheme can achieve favourable tracking performance, yet heavy computational burden is relieved.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive self-structuring fuzzy control design for nonaffine, nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283876900014"}
