IPSs need to keep up with ever-increasing line speeds, which has lead to the use of custom hardware. A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later. We present algorithms that apply speculation in single-threaded software running on commodity processors as well as algorithms for parallel hardware. Experimental results show that speculation leads to improvements in latency and throughput in both cases.", "paper_title": "Speculative Parallel Pattern Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000290737100016"}
