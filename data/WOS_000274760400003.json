Convergecast is an important communication pattern commonly used to collect continuous data. The prior broadcast trees are not suitable for convergecast, because convergecast is a reverse broadcast process. We point out the load-balancing problem in the current design of sensor networks. A non-load-balancing tree makes some nodes consume energy faster than others. It is important to design a distributed load-balancing solution due to the lack of global knowledge about the network topology. This paper presents a novel convergecast tree protocol and a distributed adjustment algorithm to attain load balancing and to extend network lifetime. The tree protocol constructs an approximate load-balancing convergecast tree. Additionally, the adjustment algorithm dynamically adjusts tree structure to avoid breaking tree link. The tree adjustment only needs localized information and operations at the sensors. Moreover, the tree adjustment is controlled by a sensor's grandparent to avoid loop problem. This study performs extensive simulations, demonstrating that the proposed protocols can effectively increase convergecast throughput. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
