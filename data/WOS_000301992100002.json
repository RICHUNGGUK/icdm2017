Here, contrary to recent analytical and numerical results, we find for the three-dimensional three-state random-bond Potts model whose pure version exhibits a first-order phase transition a random fixed point whose nu < 2/d and alpha > 0 using a finite-time scaling combining with extended dynamic Monte Carlo renormalization-group method. This suggests further studies are still needed to clarify the issue in three-dimensional systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
