We reduce the runtime necessary to self-organize access to the channel over the previous algorithm of Cai, Lu and Wang. The runtime of that algorithm is 0(n). The goal of our work is to improve the constant factor in this estimation. Apart from the experimental evidence of algorithm quality, we provide a rigorous probabilistic analysis of its behavior.
