LMNtal is an outcome of the attempt to unify constraint based concurrency and Constraint Handling Rules (CHR), the two notable extensions to concurrent logic programming. LMNtal is intended to be a substrate language of various computational models, especially those addressing concurrency, mobility and multiset rewriting. Although the principal objective of LMNtal was to provide a unifying computational model, it is of interest to equip the formalism with a precise logical interpretation. In this paper, we show that it is possible to give LMNtal a simple logical interpretation based on intuitionistic linear logic and a flattening technique. This enables us to call LMNtal a hierarchical, concurrent linear logic language. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
