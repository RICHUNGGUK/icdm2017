This optical queue can be used at the output port of an optical packet switch/router in an optical switching network (OPS), which resembles its electronic equivalent in terms of operational functionality. Detailed construction and operation scenarios of the optical queue are elaborated. Analytical modeling is done to investigate the switch with this optical buffer structure. Results obtained demonstrate the capability of providing service differentiation by using our proposed optical buffer system with multiple thresholds control mechanism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
