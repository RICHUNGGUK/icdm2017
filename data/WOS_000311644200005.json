The direction based regulator when used with dimension splitting solvers, is set to moderate the excess multidimensional diffusion and hence cause genuine multidimensional upwinding like effect. The basic idea of this regulator driven method is to retain a full upwind scheme across local discontinuities, with the upwind bias decreasing smoothly to a minimum in the farthest direction. The discontinuous solutions are quantified as gradients and the regulator parameter across a typical finite volume interface or a finite difference interpolation point is formulated based on fractional local maximum gradient in any of the weak solution flow variables (say density, pressure, temperature, Mach number or even wave velocity etc.). DDR is applied to both the non-convective as well as whole unsplit dissipative flux terms of some numerical schemes, mainly of Local Lax-Friedrichs, to solve some benchmark problems describing inviscid compressible flow, shallow water dynamics and magneto-hydrodynamics. The first order solutions consistently improved depending on the extent of grid non-alignment to discontinuities, with the major influence due to regulation of non-convective diffusion. The application is also experimented on schemes such as Roe, Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel and some second order accurate methods. The consistent improvement in accuracy either at moderate or marked levels, for a variety of problems and with increasing grid size, reasonably indicate a scope for DDR as a regular tool to impart genuine multidimensional upwinding effect in a simpler framework.
