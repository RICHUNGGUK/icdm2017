We model the WDM network as a collection of wavelength layers with sparse lightsplitting (LS) and wavelength conversion (WC) capabilities. We apply the degree constraint technique to solve the problem. The approach is capable of completing multicast routing and wavelength assignment (MCRWA) in one step. We propose two generic frameworks to facilitate heuristic development. Any heuristic that is derived from either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm can be easily imported to solve the MCRWA problem. One example is given for each framework to demonstrate heuristic development. Extensive simulations were carried out to measure the performance of heuristics developed from the frameworks. The results show that the STRIGENT scheme is suitable for hardware design and it is advisable to deploy light splitters and wavelength converters to the same node for better performance.", "paper_title": "Layered-routing approach for solving multicast routing and wavelength assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000246109000001"}
