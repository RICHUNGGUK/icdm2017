All atomic action terms on the left-hand side of an action rule have to be covered by well chosen meta-actions in order for it to be executed. The choice of meta-actions depends on the antecedent side of action rules; however, it also depends on their list of atomic actions that are outside of the action rule scope, seen as side effects. In this paper, we strive to minimize the side effects by decomposing the left-hand side of an action rule into executable action rules covered by a minimal number of meta-actions and resulting in a cascading effect. This process was tested and compared to original action rules. Experimental results show that side effects are diminished in comparison with the original meta-actions applied while keeping a good execution confidence. ding effect.
