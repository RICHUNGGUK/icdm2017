Chinese ink painting is a form of nonphotorealistic rendering. Terrain is the major subject in Chinese landscape painting, and surface wrinkles are important in conveying the orientation of Mountains and contributing to the atmosphere. Over the centuries, masters of Chinese landscape painting have developed various kinds of wrinkles. This work develops a set of novel methods for rendering wrinkles in Chinese landscape painting. A three-dimensional terrain is drawn as an outline and wrinkles, using information oil the shape, shade and orientation of the terrain's polygonal surface. The major contribution of this work lies ill the modeling and implementation of six major types of wrinkles on the surface of terrain. using traditional Chinese brush techniques. Users can select a style of wrinkle and input parameters to control the desired effect. The proposed method then completes the painting process automatically.", "paper_title": "Wrinkle rendering of terrain models in Chinese landscape painting", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400045"}
