Due to the high-dimensionality of the molecule con-figuration space and missing rotational invariance, a computationally cheap, 1D approximation of the arising integral expressions as in the single-centered case is not possible anymore. We propose a simple, yet accurate model invoking standard molecule-and site-based RDFs to approximate the respective integral equation. The new open boundary force model is validated for ethane in different scenarios and shows very good agreement with data from periodic simulations.", "paper_title": "A radial distribution function-based open boundary force model for multi-centered molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000335010700003"}
