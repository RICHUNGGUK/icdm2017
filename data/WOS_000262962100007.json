Nowadays, most watermarking schemes hide payloads according to predefined rules or empirical perceptual models. Therefore, the performance of digital watermarking schemes can be determined only passively. In this study, a genetic algorithm-based framework for watermarking performance enhancement is proposed. Watermarked results having better robustness, guaranteed fidelity, and fixed payload size can be obtained. Existing blind-detection watermarking schemes can be improved significantly by incorporating the proposed framework. In addition, the proposed framework has many desirable advantages such as asymmetric embedding/detection overhead, easy integration with existing data-hiding schemes, and direct control over fidelity and robustness.
