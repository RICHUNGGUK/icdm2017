The platforms of service-oriented grids are often Web-based where participants collaborate to achieve a common goal by sharing scarce Web-Based Computational/ Computing Resources (WBCR). To share the WBCR effectively is a challenging problem in boundary-spanning grid environments, particularly when these resources are subject to both static and dynamic usage. To set up the certificate-based usage policy described in this paper, we first explore a workflow engine-driven SOA-based resource access control mechanism. Then, aiming at setting up a cooperative computing paradigm from the resource sharing perspective, an infrastructure derived from a specific project of SOA&EDSCCE (SOA-Based&Engine-Driven Structured Cooperative Computing Environment) is proposed for promoting its cooperative computing in grid environment based on the control disciplines and the WBCR usage policy. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) a workflow engine-driven SOA-based WBCR sharing mechanism is presented in accordance with to the certificate-based usage policy; and 2) a specific infrastructure of cooperative computing is put forward for the collaboration based on the WBCR sharing mechanism.", "paper_title": "A workflow engine-driven SOA-based cooperative computing paradigm in grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000258920200005"}
