Many applications (esp. stream processing and big data applications) rely on graph-based inter-process communication patterns that are very similar to those in computer networks. To our mind, this network abstraction spanning over different types of entities is highly suitable for and would benefit from central (SDN-inspired) control for the same reasons classical networks do. In this work, we investigate the commonalities between such intra-host networks and classical computer networking. Rased on this, we study the feasibility of a central network controller that manages both network traffic and intra-host communication over a custom bus system.", "paper_title": "Extending the Software-defined Network Boundary", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600071"}
