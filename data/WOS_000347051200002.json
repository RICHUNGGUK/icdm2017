We show that set disjointness requires Omega(root n/2(k)k) bits of communication, where n is the size of the universe. Our lower bound generalizes to quantum communication, where it is essentially optimal. Proving this bound was a longstanding open problem even in restricted settings, such as one-way classical protocols with k = 4 parties [Wigderson 1997]. The proof contributes a novel technique for lower bounds on multiparty communication, based on directional derivatives of protocols over the reals.
