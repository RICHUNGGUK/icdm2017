The unknown time-varying delay uncertainties are compensated for using appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals in the design, and the effect of the uncertain hysteresis with the Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model representation is also mitigated using the proposed control. By utilizing the integral-type Lyapunov function, the closed-loop control system is proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Uncertain Hysteresis Inputs and Time-Varying State Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267941800007"}
