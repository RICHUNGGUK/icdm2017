Inspired by cartoon arts, a motion photograph is a still image in which moving objects are depicted as informative and motion-evocative. With a still image that contains moving objects, the user can add and edit various motion effects by a simple but efficient user interface. As a result, the edited object conveys an effective motion effect without blurring the object. The proposed system is so user-friendly that novices can create motion photographs without any special skills. Furthermore, the extensible nature of the system means that new effects can be developed and plugged in. The experimental results and user study show that the proposed motion photography system can produce a variety of interesting motion photographs. Compared with general image editing tools (such as Photoshop), the proposed system can create high-quality motion photographs in a significantly shorter time.", "paper_title": "Interactive motion photography from a single image", "paper_id": "WOS:000282123700001"}
