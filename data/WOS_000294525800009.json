After the superfield content of a specific model has been implemented, the user can study the properties of the model, such as the supersymmetric transformation laws of the associated Lagrangian, directly in MATHEMATICA. While the model dependent parts of the latter, i.e., the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian and the superpotential, have to be provided by the user, the model independent pieces, such as the gauge interaction terms, are derived automatically. Using the strengths of the FEYNRULES program, it is then possible to derive all the Feynman rules associated to the model and implement them in all the Feynman diagram calculators interfaced to FEYNRULES in a straightforward way.

Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 1614 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No Nature of problem: Study of the properties of N = 1 supersymmetric field theories using the superfield formalism, derivation of the associated Lagrangians. Solution method: We use the FeynRules package and define internally the N = 1 superspace. Then, we implement a module allowing to: 1. Perform the Grassmann variable series expansion so that any superfield expression can be developed in terms of the component fields. The resulting expression is thus suitable to be treated by the FeynRules package directly. 2. Execute a set of operations associated to the superspace. such as the superderivatives of an expression or the calculation of its supersymmetric transformation laws. Reasons for new version: This is an interim update to the FeynRules-1.4 (AEDI_v1_0), package which includes a new superspace module. Further modules will be added in the future and eventually published as FeynRules-1.6. Summary of revisions: This revised version contains, in addition to the core program, the superfield module of FeynRules. Restrictions: Superfields related to spin 3/2 and 2 particles are not implemented. Unusual features: All calculations in the internal routines are performed completely. The only hardcoded core is the Grassmann variable algebra. Running time: It depends on the users purposes. The extraction of a Lagrangian in terms of the component fields may take a few minutes for a complete model with complex mixing between the fields. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
