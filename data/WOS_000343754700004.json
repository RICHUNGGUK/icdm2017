Two well-known examples are compositions and graphs of given genus. The 'parts' of a graph are the subgraphs that are maximal trees. We show that large part sizes have asymptotically geometric distributions. This leads to asymptotically independent Poisson variables for numbers of various large parts. In many cases this leads to asymptotic formulas for the probability of being gap-free and for the expected values of the largest part sizes, number of distinct parts and number of parts of multiplicity k.", "paper_title": "Part Sizes of Smooth Supercritical Compositional Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000343754700004"}
