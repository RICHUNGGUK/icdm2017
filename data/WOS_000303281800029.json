In this paper, an ontology-driven decision support system for designing complex railway portal frames is presented and developed. A knowledge-rules database has been also developed relying on experts knowledge and complying with railway standards. Our system outperforms the current portal frames design methods by decreasing construction time and costs. As a result, an intelligent computer-aided design tool is provided, thus facilitating the task of seeking for the optimal portal frame, which is geometrically and structurally feasible, and cost-effective.
