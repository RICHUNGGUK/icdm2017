We define some new preference relations, including additive consistent incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, multiplicative consistent incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation and acceptable incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation. Based on the arithmetic average and the geometric mean, respectively, we give two procedures for extending the acceptable incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations to the complete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. Then, by using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy averaging operator or the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy geometric operator, an approach is given to decision making based on the incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, and the developed approach is applied to a practical problem. It is worth pointing out that if the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation is reduced to the real-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, then all the above results are also reduced to the counterparts, which can be applied to solve the decision making problems with incomplete intuitionistic fuzzy preference information.", "paper_title": "Incomplete interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000272712300005"}
