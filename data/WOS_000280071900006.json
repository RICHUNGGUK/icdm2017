It was found that the fluctuation of unsteady heat release due to the deformation of flame surface was significantly decreased as the equivalence ratio increased because of the change in interaction between inner vortical structures and flames. This phenomenon was another evidence of the amplification mechanism in the combustion instabilities due to the strong flame-vortex interactions under lean premixed conditions.", "paper_title": "Numerical visualization of vortical structures in a lean premixed swirl combustor using LES", "paper_id": "WOS:000280071900006"}
