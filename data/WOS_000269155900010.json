In particular, in visual secret sharing schemes, a secret image can be encoded into halftone shares taking meaningful visual information. In this paper, HVC construction methods based on error diffusion are proposed. The secret image is concurrently embedded into binary valued shares while these shares are halftoned by error diffusion-the workhorse standard of halftoning algorithms. Error diffusion has low complexity and provides halftone shares with good image quality. A reconstructed secret image, obtained by stacking qualified shares together, does not suffer from cross interference of share images. Factors affecting the share image quality and the contrast of the reconstructed image are discussed. Simulation results show several illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Halftone Visual Cryptography Via Error Diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155900010"}
