This controller feedforwards the cross-coupling terms, based on the geometrical relationship between the tracking and contouring errors, to compensate for the contouring error in real-time. Compared with the conventional multi-axis cross-coupling control (CCC) system, this new structure has the advantage that its compensators in CCC have a simpler design process than conventional ones, as does its stability analysis. The proposed controller is evaluated and compared experimentally with a traditional uncoupled and a conventional CCC controller on a multi-axis positioning system controlled by microcomputer. The experimental results show that the new structure remarkably reduces contour error. In addition, this new controller can be implemented easily on most current systems by reprogramming the reference position command subroutine. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
