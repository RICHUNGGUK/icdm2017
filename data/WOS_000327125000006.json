Although double rounding is, in general, innocuous, it may change the behavior of some useful small floating-point algorithms. We analyze the potential influence of double rounding on the Fast2Sum and 2Sum algorithms, on some summation algorithms, and Veltkamp's splitting.", "paper_title": "Some issues related to double rounding", "paper_id": "WOS:000327125000006"}
