It is shown that for many chip waveforms the user capacity for asynchronous systems is larger than for optimally designed synchronous systems. The degree to which the user capacity improves by exploiting asynchrony is characterized by defining the effective dimension of the chip waveform. Finally, simulation results are shown to verify the analysis.", "paper_title": "Increasing user capacity by interference avoidance and intentional asynchrony in CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300028"}
