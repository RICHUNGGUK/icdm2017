A possible mechanism of the attractive interaction between the negatively charged Ti surface and the negatively charged osteoblasts is described theoretically. It is shown that adhesion of positively charged proteins with internal charge distribution may give rise to attractive interaction between the Ti surface and the osteoblast membrane. A dynamic model of the osteoblast attachment is presented in order to study the impact of geometrically structured Ti surfaces on the osteoblasts attachment. It is indicated that membrane-bound protein complexes (PCs) may increase the membrane protrusion growth between the osteoblast and the grooves on titanium (Ti) surface and thereby facilitate the adhesion of osteoblasts to the Ti surface. On the other hand, strong local adhesion due to electrostatic forces may locally trap the osteoblast membrane and hinder the further spreading of osteointegration boundary. We suggest that the synergy between these two processes is responsible for successful osteointegration along the titanium surface implant.", "paper_title": "Mechanics and electrostatics of the interactions between osteoblasts and titanium surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000289806900008"}
