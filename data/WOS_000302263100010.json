The alternating assumption is unreliable for long recordings, non-breathing events, such as apnea, swallow or cough change the alternating nature of the phases. Using lung sounds intensity requires the addition of a secondary channel and the associated labor. Hence, an automatic and accurate method for breath-phase detection using only tracheal sounds would be of great benefit. We present a method using several breath sound parameters to differentiate between the two respiratory phases. The proposed method is novel and independent of flow level; it requires only one prior-and one post-breath sound segment to identify the phase. The proposed method was tested on data from 93 healthy individuals, without any history of pulmonary diseases breathing at 4 different flow levels. The most prominent features were from the duration, volume and shape of the sound envelope. This method has shown an accuracy of 95.6% with 95.5% sensitivity and 95.6% specificity for breath-phase identification without assuming breath-phase-alteration and/or using any other information.", "paper_title": "Acoustic breath-phase detection using tracheal breath sounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000302263100010"}
