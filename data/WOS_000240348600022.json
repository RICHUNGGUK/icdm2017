This problem has many applications to computational molecular biology, including ortholog assignment and fingerprint assembly. We prove better approximation ratios for k-MCIP by looking at what we call the redundancy Of X-1,..., X-k, which is a quantity capturing the frequency of integers across the different X-i. Namely, we show .614k-approximability, improving upon the previous best known (k - 1/3)-approximability for this problem. A key feature of our algorithm is that it can be implemented in almost linear time.", "paper_title": "Better approximations for the minimum common integer partition problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600022"}
