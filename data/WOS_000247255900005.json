However, aggressive scaling of technology results in different leakage components (subthreshold, gate and junction tunneling) to become significant portion of total power dissipation in CMOS circuits. High-V-t devices are expected to have high junction tunneling current (due to stronger halo doping) compared to low-V-t devices, which, in the worst case can increase the total leakage in dual-V-t design. Moreover, process parameter variations (and in turn V-t variations) are expected to be significantly high in sub-50-nm technology regime, which can severely affect the yield. In this paper, we propose a device aware simultaneous sizing and dual-V-t design methodology that considers each component of leakage and the impact of process variation (on both delay and leakage power) to minimize the total leakage while ensuring a target yield. Our results show that conventional dual-V-t design can overestimate leakage savings by 36% while incurring 17% average yield loss in 50-nm predictive technology. The proposed scheme results in 10%-20% extra leakage power savings compared to conventional dual-V-t design, while ensuring target yield. This paper also shows that nonscalability of the present way of realizing high-V-t devices results in negligible power savings beyond 25-nm technology. Hence, different dual-V-t process options, such as metal gate work function engineering, are required,to realize high-performance and low-leakage dual-V-t designs in future technologies.", "paper_title": "Device-aware yield-centric dual-V-t design under parameter variations in nanoscale technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000247255900005"}
