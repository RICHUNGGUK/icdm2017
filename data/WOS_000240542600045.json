Sensors with low cost, low power and multifunction are expected to last until their energy drains, so energy-conserving forms of communication and computation are essential to the sensor node lifetime. Given the unreliable nature of the wireless channel and the high failure rate of the individual sensors, a fault tolerant routing protocol with energy-efficiency is expected to overcome these problems. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient multipath routing algorithm (EMRA) for wireless sensor networks. EMRA can efficiently find a disjoint multipath and provide a protection for routing failure. From the observed results, EMRA performs well in terms of average dissipated energy and delay to set up backup path.", "paper_title": "A multipath routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600045"}
