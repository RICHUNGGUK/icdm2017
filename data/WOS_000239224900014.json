The family of flux-continuous schemes is characterized in terms of quadrature parameterization, where the local position of continuity defines the quadrature point and hence the family. A convergence study is carried out for the discretization in physical space and the effect of a range of quadrature points on convergence is explored. Structured cell-centred and unstructured cell-vertex schemes are considered. Homogeneous and heterogeneous cases are tested, and convergence is established for a number of examples with discontinuous permeability tensor including a velocity field with singularity. Such cases frequently arise in subsurface flow modelling. A convergence comparison with CVFE is also presented.
