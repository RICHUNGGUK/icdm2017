The parameter uncertainties belong to a convex polytopic set, and the delays are time varying. A sufficient condition is obtained in terms of a priori designed feedback matrix for determining if a given set is in inside the domain of attraction. Using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, an estimate of the domain of attraction is presented. The problem of designing a state feedback controller such that the domain of attraction is enlarged is formulated through solving an optimisation problem with LMI constraints. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "On stability and stabilisation for uncertain stochastic systems with time-delay and actuator saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000277149800003"}
