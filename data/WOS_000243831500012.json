The study of the shuffle product of words leads to the construction of an automaton whose structure is deeply connected to a family of trees which we call araucarias. We prove many structural properties of this family of trees and give some combinatorial results. We introduce a family of remarkable symmetrical polynomials which play a crucial role in the computation of the size of the araucarias. We prove that the minimal partial automaton which recognizes the shuffle of a finite number of special words contains an araucaria for each integer k > 0.(1)", "paper_title": "Shuffle of words and araucaria trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243831500012"}
