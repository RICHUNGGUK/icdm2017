We show that their linear complexity and k-error linear complexity take a value only from some specific ranges. We then present the minimum value k for which the k-error linear complexity is strictly less than the linear complexity in a new viewpoint different from the approach by Meidl. We also derive the distribution of p(m)-periodic binary sequences with specific k-error linear complexity. Finally, we get an explicit formula for the expectation value of the k-error linear complexity and give its lower and upper bounds, when k <= [p/2].", "paper_title": "On the k-error linear complexity of p(m)-periodic binary sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000246862300027"}
