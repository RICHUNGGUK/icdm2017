By giving up this uniform-spacing feature, we propose an APSK optimization method based on the uniform APSK with Gray labeling (Gray-APSK). The aim of the optimization is to maximize the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) for the targeted code rate and channel. We show that our optimized non-uniform APSK could offer further performance gain compared with the conventional uniform Gray-APSK and considerably outperforms the traditional quadrature amplitude modulation at the targeted SNR and channel.", "paper_title": "Non-Uniform APSK Optimization for BICM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364490200006"}
