The procedure consists of initially determining the optimal meter set under normal conditions, followed by the optimal reliable meter locations that are obtained under two types of contingencies termed as single meter failure or loss and single branch outages. This is achieved by modifying the derived scheme from the normal condition using penalty functions. The effectiveness of the meter placement algorithm is demonstrated for IEEE standard systems.
