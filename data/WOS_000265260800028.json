Our method identifies actual effective attacks against tasks, and quantitatively evaluates the risks that every grid service will attack the tasks based on the identified attacks. Further, our method quantitatively evaluates the risks that the confidentiality and integrity of given tasks will be attacked by the whole grid system. The identification of attacks and, risk evaluation are based on the analysis of the past actions of grid services, and consider the protection mechanisms employed by tasks well. The prototype implementation of our method shows that our method is feasible and applicable in stock grid systems with little modification.", "paper_title": "A QUANTITATIVE METHOD FOR EVALUATING THE SECURITY THREATS OF GRID SYSTEM TO TASKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800028"}
