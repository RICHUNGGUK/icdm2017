To address this issue, we propose a virtual-appliance-based autonomic resource provisioning framework for large virtualized data centers. We present the architecture of the data center with enriched autonomic features. We define a non-linear constrained optimization model for dynamic resource provisioning and present a novel analytic solution. Key factors, including virtualization overhead and reconfiguration delay, are incorporated into the model. Experimental results based on a prototype demonstrate that the system-level performance has been greatly improved by taking advantage of fine-grained server consolidation, and the whole system exhibits flexible adaptation in failure scenarios. Experiments with the impact of switching delay also show the efficiency of the framework due to significantly reduced provisioning time.", "paper_title": "An autonomic provisioning framework for outsourcing data center based on virtual appliances", "paper_id": "WOS:000257867000003"}
