Solvation by water molecules and interaction with cation make the cyano bond more polarized and exhibits ketene-imine character. Bond order in nitrile-cation complexes has been predicted based on the s character of the covalent bond orbitals. Mulliken, CHELPG, and NPA charges are in good agreement in predicting positive charge buildup and GIAO nuclear deshileding on C1. G4 enthalpies show that Mg2+ is more strongly bound to acrylonitrile than to acetonitrile by 3 kcal mol(-1), and the proton affinity of the former is higher by 0.8 kcal mol(-1). G4 enthalpies of reductions support prior experimental observation that metalated conjugated nitriles show enhanced reactivity toward weak nucleophiles to afford Michael addition products.", "paper_title": "Does cation break the cyano bond?
