As a teacher, it is easy to show the saliency in synchronous and buried permanent magnet machines, but it is difficult to illustrate that induction machines can have saliencies because they are usually considered as non-salient. It is even more difficult to teach students that induction motor saliencies can give useful information to estimate speed and rotor position without using speed or position sensors. The developed VI has been used by students to identify the different types of saliencies in induction machines at the laboratory of electric machinery. Excellent results have been achieved by using this computer-based teaching tool.
