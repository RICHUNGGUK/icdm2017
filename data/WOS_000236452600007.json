The potential energy functions for these simulations were constructed in a semi-empirical way from existing potentials and experimental energetic data. The MID simulations were employed to analyze the dynamic properties of the benzene-zeolite systems. The adsorption energies of benzene/siliceous zeolite complexes increase with increasing loading number, due to the intermolecular attraction between benzene molecules. The self-diffusion coefficient of' benzene in siliceous zeolites decreases with increasing loading due to the steric hindrance between the sorbates passing each other. From the zeolite-benzene radial distribution functions it was found that the benzene molecules are relatively far from each other, about 5.2 angstrom for siliceous FAU, 5.2 angstrom for siliceous ZSM-5, and 4.8 angstrom for siliceous MCM-22. In the case of FAU, the benzene molecules prefer to be adsorbed parallel to the surface of the socialite cage above the six-membered-ring. In ZSM-5, We found a T-structure of the benzene molecules at loadings 2, 4, and 8 molecules per supercell. At loadings of 16 molecules per supercell, the molecules are lined up along the straight channel and their movement is highly correlated. For MCM-22 we found adjacent benzene molecules at a loading of 4 molecules with an orientation similar to the stacked conformation of benzene dimer in the gas phase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
