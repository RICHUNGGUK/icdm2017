Traditionally, this problem has been formulated as a deterministic integer program, which has been shown to be NP-hard. The proposed formulation is based on dynamic programming and allows greater flexibility since dynamic and stochastic components of the problem can be embedded into the optimization framework. By temporal decomposition we reduce the size of the integer program and using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods we tackle the curse of dimensionality. The numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms well-known heuristics under different network topologies. Finally, the proposed ADP methodology can be used not only as an upper bound but also as a generic framework where different heuristics can be integrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
