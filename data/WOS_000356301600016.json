However, the decrease in secrecy rate due to the increase in the number of Eve's antennas is not well understood. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to characterize the secrecy rate of the AN scheme as a function of Eve's SNR, Bob's SNR, the number of antennas in each terminal, and the power allocation scheme. We first derive a closed-form expression for the average secrecy rate. We then derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic instantaneous secrecy rate with large number of antennas at all terminals. Finally, we derive simple lower and upper bounds on the average/instantaneous secrecy rate that provide a tool for the system design.", "paper_title": "Artificial Noise Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600016"}
