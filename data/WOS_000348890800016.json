Convective boundary condition is used for the analysis of thermal boundary layer. In addition the combined effects of thermal radiation and magnetic field are taken into consideration. The developed nonlinear problems have been solved for the series solution. The convergence of the series solutions is carefully analyzed. The behaviors of various physical parameters such as viscoelastic parameter (beta), magnetic field parameter (M), radiation parameter (R), Biot number (Bi) and velocity ratio parameter (alpha) are examined through graphical and numerical results of velocity and temperature distributions.
