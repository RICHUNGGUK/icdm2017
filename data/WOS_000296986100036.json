The algorithm is inspired by the laws in physics. The CSS utilizes a number of charged particles which influence each other based on their fitness values and their separation distances considering the governing law of Coulomb. A comparison between the characteristics of the CSS algorithm and other well-known meta-heuristics is performed to indicate their similarities and differences. Some benchmark frame examples are optimized with the CSS algorithm. Comparison of the results of CSS with some other meta-heuristic algorithms shows the robustness of the new algorithm.
