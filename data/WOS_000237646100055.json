However, both techniques also have serious limitations, particularly when dealing with high-bandwidth, dynamic flow as like Grid. Fixed-capability reservations tend to be wasteful of resources and it cannot permit dynamic adaptation in application performance when resource management policies are changed. Adaptation scheme inevitably fails when congestion reduces available resources below acceptable limits. In this paper, we describe an approach to QoS that combines features of both reservation and adaptation to address the difficulties above noted. In addition, we propose extended GARA and advanced reservation and reserved resource saving scheme that provide more effective QoS.", "paper_title": "Design of network aware resource allocation system for grid applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100055"}
