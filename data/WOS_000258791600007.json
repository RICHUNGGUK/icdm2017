Hence, capturing the effect of virtual channels has always been an important issue in developing analytical performance models for these interconnection networks. Almost all previous models relayed on a method proposed by Dally to compute the probability of the number of busy virtual channels per physical channel. Dally's method is based on a Markov chain and after extensive investigation our results reveal that its accuracy degrades as traffic increases. In this study we propose and validate a new general method to compute this probability. The new general method is based on an M/G/I queue and it exhibits a good degree of accuracy at different traffic conditions. We further showed that Dally's method can be deduced as a special case of the general method. Predictions from both, Dally's method and the new general method are validated against results obtained from an event-driven simulator that mimics the behaviour of wormhole-switch networks.
