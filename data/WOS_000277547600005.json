For example, advances in range sensor technology and design software have dramatically reduced the manual labor required to construct 3D models. As collections of 3D content continue to grow rapidly, the ability to perform fast and accurate retrieval from a database of models has become a necessity. At the core of this retrieval task is the fundamental challenge of defining and evaluating similarity between 3D shapes. Some effective methods dealing with this challenge consider similarity measures based on the visual appearance of models. While collections of rendered images are discriminative for retrieval tasks, such representations come with a few inherent limitations such as restrictions in the image viewpoint sampling and high computational costs. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for model similarity that addresses these issues. Our proposed method exploits techniques from spherical signal processing to efficiently evaluate a visual similarity measure between models. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets are provided.", "paper_title": "Spherical Correlation of Visual Representations for 3D Model Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000277547600005"}
