The new idea uses four different waves instead of traditional waves, which were used in the original MCB scheme corresponding to coordinate axes. In the new selection of waves, the number of compatibility relations is increased to eight, and therefore, more information reaches to each face in order to estimate convective fluxes. Numerical tests show that the new improved MCB scheme is faster in terms of convergence and demonstrates the same accuracy by the older one. Also, it needs less CPU time in comparison with traditional MCB scheme for running the computer code at the same conditions. The new scheme is able to use higher CFL numbers compared with the old MCB scheme. Results obtained by the new proposed method are in good agreement with the benchmark solutions at the wide range of Reynolds numbers.
