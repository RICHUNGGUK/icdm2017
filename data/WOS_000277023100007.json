The algorithm has been tested to evaluate the quality of decoded video bitstreams after transmission over error-prone networks. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed quality assessment algorithm by measuring the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the structural similarity metrics computed in full-reference mode and the one provided by the proposed reduced-reference algorithm. The proposed reduced-reference algorithm achieves good correlation values (higher than 0.85 with packet loss rate equal up to 2.5%).", "paper_title": "A reduced-reference structural similarity approximation for videos corrupted by channel errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000277023100007"}
