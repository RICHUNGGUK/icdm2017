However, the accurate estimation of ultrasonic time-of-flight (TOF) is essential in NDT. In this letter, a novel method for TOF estimation through envelope is proposed. Firstly, the wavelet denoising technique is applied to the noisy echo to improve the estimation accuracy. Then, the Hilbert transform (HT) is used in ultrasonic signal processing in order to extract the envelope of the echo. Finally, the TOF of each component of multi-echo signals is estimated by the local maximum point of signal envelope. Furthermore, the time resolution of time-overlapping ultrasonic echoes is discussed. Numerical simulation has been carried out to show the performances of the proposed method in estimating TOF of ultrasonic signal.", "paper_title": "Hilbert Transform Based Time-of-Flight Estimation of Multi-Echo Ultrasonic Signals and Its Resolution Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000342783900018"}
