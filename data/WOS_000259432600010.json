The approach consists of three stages. First, different features, including time-domain statistical characteristics, frequency-domain statistical characteristics and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) energy entropies, are extracted to acquire more fault characteristic information. Second, an improved distance evaluation technique is proposed, and with it, the most superior features are selected from the original feature set. Finally, the most superior features are fed into ANFIS to identify different abnormal cases. The proposed approach is applied to fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, and testing results show that the proposed approach can reliably recognise different fault categories and severities. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method is also demonstrated by the testing results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
