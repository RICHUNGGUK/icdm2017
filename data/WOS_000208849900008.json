(J Opt B Quantum Semiclass Opt 6:L19-L20, 2004) that the existence of a complete set of MUBs in C-d is linked to the existence of a complete set of MOLS of side length d. Since more is known about MOLS than about MUBs, most research has concentrated on constructing MUBs from MOLS (Roy and Scott, J Math Phys 48: 072110, 2007; Paterek et al., Phys Rev A 70: 012109, 2009). This paper gives a simple algebraic construction of MOLS from two known constructions of MUBs in the odd prime power case.", "paper_title": "Mutually orthogonal Latin squares and mutually unbiased bases in dimensions of odd prime power MOLS and MUBs in odd prime power dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849900008"}
