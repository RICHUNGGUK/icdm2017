DDM is able to hide memory and synchronization latencies providing significant performance gains whereas the use of of the CMP architecture offers high-degree of parallelism at low complexity design and is therefore power efficient. This paper presents the hardware budget analysis and the runtime support system for the DDM-CMP architecture. The hardware analysis shows that the DDM benefits may be achieved with only a 17% hardware cost increase compared to a traditional chip-multiprocessor implementation. The support for the runtime system was designed in such a way that allows the DDM applications to execute on the DDM-CMP chip using a regular, non-modified, Operating System and CPU cores.", "paper_title": "Hardware budget and runtime system for Data-Driven Multithreaded Chip Multiprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500019"}
