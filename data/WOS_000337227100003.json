An interesting and yet little-explored possibility is the computer as highly autonomous performer of popular music, capable of joining a mixed ensemble of computers and humans. Considering the skills and functional requirements of musicians leads to a number of predictions about future human-computer music performance (HCMP) systems for popular music. We describe a general architecture for such systems and describe some early implementations and our experience with them.", "paper_title": "Methods and Prospects for Human-Computer Performance of Popular Music", "paper_id": "WOS:000337227100003"}
