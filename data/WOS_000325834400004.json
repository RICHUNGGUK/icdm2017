Our model solves the computationally and numerically critical forces on a coarsely sampled particle simulation. Pressure and friction forces are expressed as constraint forces which are iteratively computed. We realize stable and realistic interactions with rigid bodies by employing pressure and friction-based boundary forces. Stable formations of sand piles are realized by employing the concept of rigid-body sleeping. Furthermore, material transitions from dry to wet can be modeled. Visual realism is achieved by coupling a set of highly resolved particles with the base simulation at low computational costs. Thereby, detail is added which is not resolved by the base simulation. The practicability of the approach is demonstrated by showing various high-resolution simulations with up to 20 million particles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
