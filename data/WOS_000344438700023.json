As a possible solution, the danger immune algorithm is used to achieve ship collision avoidance strategy optimization, which is a multiobjective problem concerning safety and economy. Collision avoidance operations are encoded as the individuals of optimization algorithm. In the system, ship domain and ship arena, among others, are used for collision risk evaluation to assess the fitness of individuals. Through the optimization, the navigator will obtain the optimal collision avoidance strategy to achieve safe and efficient collision avoidance. The simulations indicate that the optimization algorithm is valid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
