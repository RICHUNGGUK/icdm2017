Under these circumstances the data remain dependent and non-Gaussian, this model can make full use of the information of the given data to estimate the missing data and can visualize the handled high-dimensional data. Compared with mixture of principal component analyzers (MPCA), mean method and standard SOM-based fuzzy map model, ISOM-DH model can be applied to more cases, thus performing its superiority. Meanwhile, the correctness and reasonableness of ISOM-DH model is also validated by the experiment carried out in this paper.", "paper_title": "Handling of incomplete data sets using ICA and SOM in data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000244199900007"}
