The proposed method models the problem of deinterleaving pulse trains as an underdetermined system of linear equations. After determining the mixing matrix, we find sparsest solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations using basis pursuit denoising. This method is superior to previous ones in a number of aspects. First, spurious and missing pulses would not cause any performance reduction in the algorithm. Second, the algorithm works well despite the type of pulse repetition interval modulation that is used. Third, the proposed method is able to separate similar sources.", "paper_title": "A Novel Method of Deinterleaving Pulse Repetition Interval Modulated Sparse Sequences in Noisy Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738400014"}
