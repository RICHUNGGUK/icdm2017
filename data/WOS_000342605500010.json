Timely and effective research in nanotechnology over the coming years will allow Europe to establish a major world lead in the area of security of nano communications and place Europe as the world class science performer in this area. In this paper, we discuss the importance of nano technology, nano applications. We also provide a literature survey of IDS in the nano and adhoc network domains. In addition, we propose an intrusion detection system for nano communication systems in order to reduce the impact of malicious nodes and malicious data.", "paper_title": "Secure Nano Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000342605500010"}
