In order to enhance the fault-tolerance and reliability of the wireless ad-hoc networks, we revisit the Byzantine Agreement problem in the zone-based wireless ad-hoc network in this paper. The proposed protocol is called as the Zone-Oriented Agreement Protocol (ZOAP) which can make each fault-free mobile processor reach an agreement value to cope with the faulty component in the zone-based wireless ad-hoc network.", "paper_title": "Zone-oriented Byzantine Agreement on zone-based wireless ad-hoc network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300088"}
