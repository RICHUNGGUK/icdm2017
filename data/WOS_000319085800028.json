First, one-pixel-wide edge is obtained to represent the direction of the binary vein pattern. Second, based on 8-neighbor pattern analysis, we design a feature-coding strategy to characterize the vein edge. Finally, the edge code flooding operation is defined to characterize all of other vein pixels according to the nearest neighbor principle. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Finger Vein Verification Based on Neighbor Pattern Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800028"}
