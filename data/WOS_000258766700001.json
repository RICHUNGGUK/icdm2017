Some delay-dependent robust periodicity criteria guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of periodic solution for all admissible parametric uncertainties are devised by taking the relationship between the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula into account, Because free weighting matrices are used to express this relationship and the appropriate ones are selected by means of linear matrix inequalities the criteria are less conservative than existing ones reported in the literature for delayed neural networks with parameter uncertainties. Some examples are given to show that the proposed criteria are effective and are all improvement over previous ones.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent criteria for global robust periodicity of uncertain switched recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000258766700001"}
