In this paper, we extend the path following algorithm to the matching problems on directed graph models by proposing a concave relaxation for the problem. Based on the concave and convex relaxations, a series of objective functions are constructed, and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is then utilized to minimize them. Several experiments on synthetic and real data witness the validity of the extended path following algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Extended Path Following Algorithm for Graph-Matching Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000304138300016"}
