Let A be an alphabet of t letters and let psi : A* -> N-t be the corresponding Parikh morphism. Given two languages L-1, L-2 subset of A*, we say that L-1 is commutatively equivalent to L-2 if there exists a bijection f : L-1 -> L-2 from L-1 onto L-2 such that, for every u is an element of L-1, psi(u) = psi(f (u)). Then every bounded context-free language is commutatively equivalent to a regular language. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
