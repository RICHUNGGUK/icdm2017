The trimaterial is made of a thin elastic layer sandwiched between two elastic half-spaces. The parallel planar interfaces are modeled as containing periodic arrays of randomly generated micro-cracks. The micromechanical-statistical model of the interfaces is formulated and numerically solved in terms of hypersingular boundary integral equations in which the displacement jumps across the micro-cracks are unknown functions. The numerical results obtained from the model demonstrate that the effective stiffness coefficients are influenced by the elastic moduli of the trimaterial, the thickness of the elastic layer and the densities of the micro-cracks.
