Destruction of these efficiency indices into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency sub-indices is to capture sources of inefficiency in relation to the development of an economy. The results indicate that for developed countries the enhancement of the pure technical efficiency in the energy use and the scale efficiency of CO2 emission control are important tasks to pursue. On the contrary, developing countries have to seek the improvement of the pure technical efficiency of CO2 emission control and scale efficiency of energy use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
