Moreover, these dyes are used as photoactive materials in the field of solar cells. In the present study, we investigated the structural, electronic, photophysical, and charge transport properties of six benzothiazole-based squaraine dyes (Cis-SQ1-Cis-SQ3 and Trans-SQ1-Trans-SQ3). The effect of electron donating (-OCH3) and electron withdrawing (-COOH) groups was investigated intensively. Ground state geometry and frequency calculations were performed by applying density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory. Absorption spectra were computed in chloroform at the time-dependent DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory. The driving force of electron injection (Delta G(inject)), relative driving force of electron injection (Delta G(r)(inject)), electronic coupling constants (vertical bar V-RP vertical bar) and light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of all six compounds were calculated and compared with previously studied sensitizers. The Delta G(inject), Delta G(r)(inject) and vertical bar V-RP vertical bar of all six compounds revealed that these sensitizers would be efficient dyesensitized solar cell materials. Cis/Trans-SQ3 exhibited superior LHE as compared to other derivatives. The Cis/Trans geometric effect was studied and discussed with regard to electro-optical and charge transport properties.", "paper_title": "An electro-optical and electron injection study of benzothiazole-based squaraine dyes as efficient dye-sensitized solar cell materials: a first principles study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700007"}
