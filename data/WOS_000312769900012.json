Transconductances and gate-to-source capacitances of the MOS transistors are employed instead of passive resistors and capacitors. The proposed circuit exhibits important features such as simplicity, low-voltage/power operation, reduced chip area and wide frequency range compared to classical analog circuits that require active elements with large number of transistors. Simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "MOS-only second order current-mode LP/BP filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900012"}
