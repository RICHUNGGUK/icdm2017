Then we compute the new chaotic watermark of each recovered block and perform comparison with the extracted one Therefore, we can detect whether the original image is modified. If it, is, then the modification can be located Besides, by the use of chaotic watermark, the complicated nonlinear and sensitive dependence within image feature, secret key, and watermark is established to ensure the watermarking security. Theoretical analysts and computer simulation have verified the successful achievement of the proposed image authentication scheme", "paper_title": "A REVERSIBLE IMAGE AUTHENTICATION SCHEME BASED ON CHAOTIC FRAGILE WATERMARK", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400034"}
