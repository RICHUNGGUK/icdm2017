On-line testing offers a promising method for detecting defects, fluidic abnormalities, and bioassay malfunctions during chip operation. However, previous techniques for reading test outcomes and analyzing pulse sequences are cumbersome, sensitive to the calibration of capacitive sensors, and error-prone. We present a built-in self-test (BIST) method for on-line testing of digital microfluidic lab-on-chip. This method utilizes microfluidic compactors based on droplet-based AND gates, which are implemented using digital microfluidics. An optimization method is proposed to schedule logic AND operations in the compactor to minimize the end time for the compaction procedure. Dynamic reconfiguration of these compactors ensures low area overhead and it allows BIST to be interleaved with bioassays in functional mode. We evaluate the on-line testing method using a multiplexed in vitro diagnostics bioassay.", "paper_title": "On-Line Testing of Lab-on-Chip Using Reconfigurable Digital-Microfluidic Compactors", "paper_id": "WOS:000267249500003"}
