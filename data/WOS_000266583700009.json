To embed a message in an image, the image is divided into three-pixel blocks, each of which is, then, transformed into a TCP block with two differences. When the pixel value of the largest pixel in the TCP block is increased, two differences are increased-one is between the largest and the smallest, and the other is between the largest and the middle. Expanding the two differences in the block by increasing the largest pixel value may make the image less modified. In addition, the number of pixel pairs is increased to two thirds of the number of pixels in the image. Compared to Tian's study, both the visual quality and the embedding capacity of the image are significantly improved.", "paper_title": "Reversible Data Hiding Based on Three-Circular-Pixel Difference Expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583700009"}
