The developed AQM is designed based on coefficient diagram method (CDM), which is a new indirect pole placement method that considers the speed, stability and robustness of the closed loop system in terms of time domain specifications. Simulation results indicate that the new method (CDM-AQM) performs very well for network variations both in topology and traffic. Besides, a new adaptive controller based on CDM as an AQM method is introduced. In the developed adaptive AQM (ACDM), the output feedback pole placement is implemented in an indirect model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme, in which the closed loop characteristic polynomial is determined by CDM and the system parameters are estimated using a modified recursive gradient method. This method preserves the existing features of CDM controller in the control of networks with unknown or time-varying parameters. Simulation results illustrate high capability of the controller in coping with the network variations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
