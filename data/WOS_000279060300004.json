This algorithm originates from an idea which relates to a simple experience when humans search for an optimal solution to a 'real-life' problem, i.e. when humans search for a candidate solution given a certain objective, a large area tends to be scanned first; should one succeed in finding clues in relation to the predefined objective, then the search space is greatly reduced for a more detailed search. Furthermore, this new algorithm is extended to the multi-objective optimisation case. Simulation results of optimising some challenging benchmark problems suggest that both the proposed single-objective and multi-objective optimisation algorithms outperform some of the other well-known Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The proposed algorithms are further applied successfully to the optimal design problem of alloy steels, which aims at determining the optimal heat treatment regime and the required weight percentages for chemical composites to obtain the desired mechanical properties of steel hence minimising production costs and achieving the overarching aim of 'right-first-time production' of metals.
