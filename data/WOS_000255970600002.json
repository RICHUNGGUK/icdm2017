We provide a task model which integrates job parallelism. We prove that the time-complexity of the feasibility problem of these systems is linear relatively to the number of (sporadic) tasks for a fixed number of processors. We propose a scheduling algorithm theoretically optimal (i.e., preemptions and migrations neglected). Moreover, we provide an exact feasibility utilization bound. Lastly, we propose a technique to limit the number of migrations and preemptions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
