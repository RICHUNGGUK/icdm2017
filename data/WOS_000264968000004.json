Focusing on a wireless base station, we model it as a single-server queueing system with a Markovian service process in which the state of the server alternates between Good and Bad states. The system has two independent input processes: one is a general renewal input process and the other is a Poisson arrival process. We analyze the packet- and block-level loss probabilities to investigate the recovery performance of FEC at block level. The analysis is validated with simulation experiments driven by real traffic traces. Numerical examples show that the block-loss probability is greatly affected by the system capacity and the mean Bad-state period, and that the recovery performance of FEC deteriorates according to the fluctuation in the packet transmission rate at a wireless base station.
