Most examples of such functions, including Factoring, Discrete Logarithm or the RSA function, however, can be inverted with the help of a quantum computer. Hence, it is very important to study the possibility of quantum one-way functions, i.e. functions which are easily computable by a classical algorithm but are hard to invert even by a quantum adversary. In this paper, we provide a set of problems that are good candidates for quantum one-way functions. These problems include Graph Non-Isomorphism, Approximate Closest Lattice Vector and Group Non-Membership. More generally, we show that any hard instance of Circuit Quantum Sampling gives rise to a quantum one-way function. By the work of Aharonov and Ta-Shma [D. Aharonov, A. Ta-Shma, Adiabatic quantum state generation and statistical zero knowledge, in: Proceedings of STOC02 - Symposium on the Theory of Computing, 2001], this implies that any language in Statistical Zero Knowledge which is hard-on-average for quantum computers leads to a quantum one-way function. Moreover, extending the result of Impagliazzo and Luby [R. Impagliazzo, M. Luby, One-way functions are essential for complexity based cryptography, in: Proceedings of FOCS89 Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1989] to the quantum setting, we prove that quantum distributionally one-way functions are equivalent to quantum one-way functions.
