This paper analyzes the instantaneous characterization of Poisson traffic at a fine time scale. The analysis shows that the irregular oscillation of the instantaneous traffic load and the occurrence of blockings in a light-loaded network are highly correlated. Specifically, most blockings occur concentratively at the peaks of the instantaneous load. In some other time, network resources may not be sufficiently utilized. To make better utilization of network resources, a novel wavelength-buffering (WB) scheme is proposed for the first time in this paper. By reserving a portion of resources in a \"wavelength buffer\" under light loading and releasing them when the load goes up, a number of blockings brought by the oscillation of the traffic load can be avoided. Simulation results show that compared with other schemes such as adaptive routing, wavelength conversion (WC), and rerouting, the novel wavelength-buffering scheme achieves significantly better performance with respect to the network utilization and overall blocking probability.", "paper_title": "A wavelength-buffering scheme for dynamic traffic in optical wavelength-division multiplexing networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256086300005"}
