This reflects the fact that optimum performance can be approached by a random code (or a random binning scheme), generated using independent and identically distributed copies of some scalar distribution. Is that the form of the solution of any (information-theoretic) problem? In fact, some counter examples are known. The most famous one is the \"two help one\" problem: Korner and Marton showed that if we want to decode the modulo-two sum of two correlated binary sources from their independent encodings, then linear coding is better than random coding. In this paper we provide another counter example, the \"doubly-dirty\" multiple-access channel (MAC). Like the Korner-Marton problem, this Is a multiterminal scenario where side information is distributed among several terminals; each transmitter knows part of the channel interference while the receiver only observes the channel output. We give an explicit solution for the capacity region of the binary doubly-dirty MAC, demonstrate how this region can be approached using a linear coding scheme, and prove that the \"best known single-letter region\" is strictly contained in it. We also state a conjecture regarding the capacity loss of single-letter characterization in the Gaussian case.", "paper_title": "On the Loss of Single-Letter Characterization: The Dirty Multiple Access Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500002"}
