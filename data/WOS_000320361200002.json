This study used self-reported and behavioral screen-capture data to investigate the impact of Don Norman's (2003) emotional design levels and metacognitive awareness on website trustworthiness during an information search learning task. The results suggest that the interaction effects of website visual appeal (visceral level) and website usability (behavioral level) can override the effects of the quality or relevance of the information (reflective level) on website evaluation. In addition, in the context of limited time to find the answers, these effects on the evaluation of website trustworthiness are not moderated by users' metacognitive awareness.", "paper_title": "A Multimethod Evaluation of Online Trust and Its Interaction with Metacognitive Awareness: An Emotional Design Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000320361200002"}
