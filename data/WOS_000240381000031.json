Existing efficient methods are restrictive in the type of remeshings they produce, while methods that are able to produce general types of remeshings are generally based on iteration, which prevents them from producing remeshes at interactive rates. In our method, the input surface is directly mapped to an arbitrary (possibly high-dimensional) range space, and uniformly remeshed in this space. Because the mesh is uniform in the range space, all the quantities encoded in the mapping are bounded, resulting in a mesh that is simultaneously adapted to all criteria encoded in the map, and thus we can obtain remeshings of arbitrary characteristics. Because the core operation is a uniform remeshing of a surface embedded in range space, and this operation is direct and local, this remeshing is efficient and can run at interactive rates.", "paper_title": "Surface remeshing in arbitrary codimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000031"}
