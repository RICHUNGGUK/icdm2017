This tool can achieve the automatic creation process from composition model to executable code, and more meaningfully makes it possible to analyze and validate composition process logically. Finally, experiment results have proven that the tool of this paper is feasible.", "paper_title": "AN EXECUTABLE SERVICE COMPOSITION CODE AUTOMATIC CREATION TOOL BASED ON PETRI NET MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000327410900004"}
