To address this situation, here we propose a web page filtering scheme for domain ontology that identifies domain-relevant web pages from the web based on the context of concepts. Testing of the proposed filtering scheme with a business domain ontology on YahooPicks web pages yielded promising filtering results that were superior to those obtained using the baseline system.", "paper_title": "Web page filtering for domain ontology with the context of concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000246818800008"}
