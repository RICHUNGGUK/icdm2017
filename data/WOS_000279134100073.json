The algorithm first performs logarithm transform on original face images under various illumination conditions, which changes multiplicative illumination model into an additive one. Then NSCT is used to decompose the logarithm transformed images. After that, adaptive NormalShrink is applied to each directional subband of NSCT for illumination invariant extraction. Experimental results on the Yale B, the extended Yale and the CMU PIE face databases show that the proposed algorithm can effectively alleviate the effect of illumination on face recognition.
