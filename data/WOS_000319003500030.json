Release of motion controller devices changed conventional ways of controlling games that have been used so far. Microsoft (R); Kinect(Microsoft Corporation, WA, USA) recognizes motions of the players as game controlling inputs. Although touchless interaction is perceived to be attractive, games mimicking real life activities may benefit from hand-held tangible objects for the player to get more involved into game. In this study, a tangible gameplay interaction method is developed using Microsoft (R); Kinectthat senses hand-held objects with their dimensions and incorporates them into gameplay. Proposed algorithm is implemented on an experimental game, and a user study is performed to measure effects of tangible interaction on Kinect gameplay experience. Results revealed that an improved gameplay with more natural and accurate motion controlling is achieved.
