Mobile video has become the dominant aggregate traffic contributor in today's cellular networks. In this work energy-efficient content forwarding strategies are devised for video streaming consumption over cellular networks utilizing mobility information. While intrinsically such services necessitate stringent real-time constraints, communicating fragments of data can deliberately be postponed (always under the real-time constraints as set by the playback time requirement) at future time instances that experience favorable transmit channel link gains. By doing so, many-fold savings in energy consumption can be achieved for both the mobile user terminals and the infrastructure nodes at no cost to the perceivable quality of experience.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Mobile Video Transmission Utilizing Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000316809400007"}
