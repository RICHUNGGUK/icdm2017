The aim of this paper is to present new extensions of the rough set model over two different universes which are rough fuzzy set model in a generalized approximation space, rough set model in a fuzzy approximation space and rough fuzzy set model in a fuzzy approximation space based over two different universes. Moreover, the properties of the approximation operators in these models are investigated. Furthermore, by employing cut set of fuzzy set and fuzzy relation, classical representations of fuzzy rough approximation operators are studied. Finally, the measures of fuzzy rough set models are presented, and the relationships among the fuzzy rough models and rough set model over two universes are investigated.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy rough set models over two universes", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204400006"}
