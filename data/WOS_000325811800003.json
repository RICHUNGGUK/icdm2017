Among the current image compression standards, JPEG2000 excels for its interactive transmission capabilities. In general, three mechanisms are employed to optimize the transmission of images when using the JPEG2000 Interactive Protocol (JPIP): 1) packet re-sequencing at the server; 2) prefetching at the client; and 3) proxy servers along the network infrastructure. To avoid the congestion of the network, prefetching mechanisms are not commonly employed when many clients within a local area network (LAN) browse images from a remote server. Aimed to maximize the responsiveness of all the clients within a LAN, this work proposes the use of prefetching strategies at the proxy server-rather than at the clients. The main insight behind the proposed prefetching strategies is a user-navigation model and a semantic map that predict the future requests of the clients. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of these strategies into a JPIP proxy server enhances the browsing experience of the end-users notably.", "paper_title": "JPIP Proxy Server With Prefetching Strategies Based on User-Navigation Model and Semantic Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800003"}
