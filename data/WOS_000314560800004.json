FuzzyMEn was calculated based on the fuzzy set theory and improved the poor statistical stability in the approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). The simulation results also demonstrated that the FuzzyMEn had better algorithm discrimination ability when compared with the recently published fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), The validity of FuzzyMEn was tested for clinical HRV analysis on 120 subjects (60 heart failure and 60 healthy control subjects). It is concluded that FuzzyMEn could be considered as a valid and reliable method for a clinical HRV application. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
