Newell and Simons' Human Information Processing model is foundational to this view. Designers use symbols and structures to express, store, off-load, recall, and manage their work. They mix general and detailed elements, organize their problem-space differently, seek ways to identify repetitive tasks, and utilize external media. An integral aspect of design-search is the comparison of alternatives, because the goal is usually to come close, if not fully satisfy, a set of requirements. Searching problem-spaces with currently available tools is challenging due to a number of issues related to creating and comparing alternative representations of one's thought process and outcome. In this paper, we present Alt.Text, a prototype that we developed to explore strategies for supporting design search. While Alt.Text only handles text-based documents, we believe that many of its features can be generalized to the domain of architectural design.", "paper_title": "Interactive Design Exploration with Alt.Text", "paper_id": "WOS:000366656200002"}
