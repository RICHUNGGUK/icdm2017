We found that regional contributions are highly skewed. The top positions measured by number of publications or citations, share of publications or citations are taken by almost the same set of regions. But this is not the case when indicators for relative citation impact are used. Comparison between regional scientific output and R&D expenditure shows that Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the two indicators is rather low among the leading publication regions.", "paper_title": "Regional analysis on Chinese scientific output", "paper_id": "WOS:000271989600018"}
