The problem is formulated as a mathematical programming model based on a set of residency constraints. An efficient bottleneck-based push-pull algorithm is presented. As a novel algorithm, it combines the push strategy with pull strategy. By using time-block sliding method, the proposed algorithm aims to find an optimal sequence of robot moves and minimise the system makespan. To validate the algorithm, extensive simulation experiments are conducted, including analysis of variance (ANOVA). Compared with normal pull algorithm and lower bound (LB), the bottleneck-based push-pull algorithm is more efficient than the benchmarks, and it is both feasible and promising for solving multi-robot cells scheduling problems.", "paper_title": "Bottleneck-based scheduling method of multi-robot cells with residency constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000361190500001"}
