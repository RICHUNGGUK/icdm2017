The implementation based on fixed precision has substantial loss of accuracy and is computationally expensive with full precision. A suboptimal version of belief propagation called the offset-min-sum algorithm is generally used in hardware implementation. This paper proposes a generic scalable architecture for minimum search during check-node operation in the offset-min-sum algorithm applicable to regular as well as irregular LDPC codes with check node of any degree d. For an LDPC code with maximum check node degree d, the proposed architecture consists of 2(d - 2) 2 x 1 multiplexers and 3(d - 2) two-input compare-and-select units (CSUs). This has latency of [2 inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(d)inverted left perpendicular - 2]t(dc) when inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(d)inverted left perpendicular - log(2)(d) < log(2)(4/3) else [2 inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(d)inverted left perpendicular - 3]t(dc), with t(dc) representing the delay of a two-input CSU. The proposed architecture has been implemented for d = 20 using a TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process.", "paper_title": "A Generic Scalable Architecture for Min-Sum/Offset-Min-Sum Unit for Irregular/Regular LDPC Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000281735900012"}
