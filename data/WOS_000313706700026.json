The boost voltage characteristic of Z-source network is utilized to improve the system voltage transfer ratio and make it immune to abnormal input voltage disturbance with shoot-through duty cycle self-adjusted. Meanwhile, nonlinear PID controller is employed to eliminate effects caused by nonminimumphase characteristic presented in Z-source network and improve system dynamic performance and robustness. Moreover, a comparison of the topology respect a standard back-to-back converter, Dual bridge matrix converter and ZSDBMC was provided. Finally the operation principles and validity of this proposed ZSDBMC topology are analyzed in details and verified by simulation and experiment results.", "paper_title": "A Study of Z-Source Dual-Bridge Matrix Converter Immune to Abnormal Input Voltage Disturbance and With High Voltage Transfer Ratio", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700026"}
