To exploit its distinctive open-loop characteristics, a feedback transimpedance amplifier comprising a feedforward current amplifier (CA-TIA) is investigated. Attributing to the small input impedance with a high-pass response of its feedforward gain element, the bandwidth of the CA-TIA is less sensitive to the TIA gain. The analysis and implementation of the CA-TIA are experimentally validated.", "paper_title": "CMOS Transimpedance Amplifier for Visible Light Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000042"}
