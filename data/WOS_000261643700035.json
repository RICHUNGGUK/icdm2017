They may be involved in the control of eye movement and visual attention. However, few studies have been devoted to modeling their behaviors. In this study, a feedforward multi-subunit spatiotemporal model is proposed for local edge detector cells in the cat retina. The model is able to describe their responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings, alternating sinusoidal gratings, flashing spots and annuli, and these model responses are qualitatively consistent with the physiological observations. The organization of the model maps the anatomical structure of the cat retina well, and the model may be useful in explaining ON-OFF retinal cells in other vertebrates. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
