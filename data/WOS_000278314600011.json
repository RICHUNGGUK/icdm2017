The model includes two non-orthogonal and non-intersecting rotation axes accounting for flexion-extension (F-E) and adduction-abduction (A-A). We evaluated the quality of the estimated model parameters in the prediction of the relative motion of the first metacarpal bone with respect to the trapezium. As a result, we obtained that: (a) the estimated location and orientation of the F-E and A-A axes were in agreement with previous in vitro studies, (b) the motion of the first metacarpal predicted by the 2 degrees of freedom (2DoF) model exhibits a maximum surface distance error in the range of about 2mm and (c) four thumb postures at the boundary of the TMC range of motion are sufficient to provide a good estimation of the 2DoF TMC kinematic model and good reproducibility (1.7mm) of the real thumb motion at TMC level.", "paper_title": "Method for the estimation of a double hinge kinematic model for the trapeziometacarpal joint using MR imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600011"}
