This new type of resource can be viewed as a generalization of renewable and non-renewable resources, and is very helpful in modelling conditions that do no fit into classical models, but which appear in real timetabling and labor scheduling problems. The Scatter Search algorithm is tested on existing test instances and obtains the best results known so far.", "paper_title": "A scatter search algorithm for project scheduling under partially renewable resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000235308100006"}
