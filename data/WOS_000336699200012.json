Many theoretical and computational results have been obtained. While the maximum triangle set problem can be viewed as the generalization of the maximum matching problem, there seems to be no parallel result to Berge's augmenting path characterization on maximum matching (C. Berge, 1957 [1]). In this paper, we describe a class of structures called triangle string, which turns out to be equivalent to the class of union of two triangle sets in a graph. Based on the concept of triangle string, a sufficient and necessary condition that a triangle set can be augmented is given. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to determine whether a graph G with maximum degree 4 is a triangle string, and if G is a triangle string, we compute a maximum triangle set of it. Finally, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a triangle string to have a triangle factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
