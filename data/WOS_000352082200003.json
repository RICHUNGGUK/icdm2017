Each is based on a new construction of a conciliator, an object that guarantees termination and validity, but that only guarantees agreement with constant probability. The first conciliator assumes unit-cost snapshots and achieves agreement among n processes with probability 1-is an element of in O(log* n +log(1/is an element of)) steps for each process. The second uses ordinary multi-writer registers, and achieves agreement with probability 1-is an element of in O(log log n+log(1/is an element of)) steps. Combining these constructions with known results gives randomized consensus for arbitrarily many possible input values using unit-cost snapshots in O(log* n) expected steps and randomized consensus for up to (log n) O(log log log n) possible input values using ordinary registers in O(log log n) expected steps.", "paper_title": "Faster randomized consensus with an oblivious adversary", "paper_id": "WOS:000352082200003"}
