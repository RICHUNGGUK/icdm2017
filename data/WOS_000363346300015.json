The framework consists of two parts: a compiler, which converts an assay, specified using the BioCoder language, into a sequence of electrode activations that execute out the assay on the DMFB; and a printed circuit board (PCB) layout tool, which includes algorithms to reduce the number of control pins and PCB layers required to drive the chip from an external source. The framework also includes a suite of visualization tools for debugging, and a collection of front-end algorithms that generate mixing/dilution trees for sample preparation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
