The relevance of correlation and distribution profiles is tested in terms of the models prediction power. A different approach to filter descriptors prior to variable selection is proposed. Additionally, a protocol for molecular interaction field descriptors selection and model validation is presented. The algorithms and protocols presented are quite simple and enable a different and powerful way to create parsimonious interaction field-based models.", "paper_title": "Digital Filters for Molecular Interaction Field Descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000299156000008"}
