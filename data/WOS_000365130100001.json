In this paper, four types of patent citation networks (direct citation, indirect citation, coupling and co-citation networks) are combined, filtered and recomposed based on relational algebra. Then, a method based on comprehensive patent citation (CPC) network for patent value evaluation is proposed, and empirical study of optical disk technology related patents has been conducted based on this method. The empirical study was carried out in two steps: observation of network characteristics over the entire process (citation time lag and topological and graphics characteristics), and measurement verification by independent proxies of patent value (patent family and patent duration). Our results show that the CPC network retains the advantages of patent direct citation, and performs better on topological structure, graphics features, centrality distribution, citation lag and sensitivity than a direct citation network; The verified results by the patent family and maintenance show that the proposed method covers more valuable patents than the traditional method.", "paper_title": "Using the comprehensive patent citation network (CPC) to evaluate patent value", "paper_id": "WOS:000365130100001"}
