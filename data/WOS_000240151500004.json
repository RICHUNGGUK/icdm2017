The improvement in voice quality, the integration between voice and data, especially the interaction with multimedia has made the 3G communication more promising. The value added services of Telephony techniques alleviate the dependence on the phone and provide a universal platform for the multimodal telephony applications. For example, the web-based application with VoiceXML has been developed to simplify the human-machine interaction because it takes the advantage of the speech-enabled services and makes the telephone-web access a reality. However, it is not cost-efficient to build voice only stand-alone web-application and is more reasonable that voice interfaces should be retrofitted to be compatible or collaborate with the existing HTML or XML-based web applications. Therefore, this paper considers that the functionality of the web service should enable multiple access modalities so that users can perceive and interact with the site in either visual or speech response simultaneously. Under this principle, our research develops a prototype system of multimodal VoIP with the integrated web-based Mandarin dialog system which adopts automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), VoiceXML browser, and VolP technologies to create user friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and voice user interface (VUI). The users can use traditional telephone, cellular phone, or even VoIP connection via personal computer to interact with the VoiceXML server. In the mean time, the users browse the web and access the same content with common HTML or XML-based browser. The proposed system shows excellent performance and can be easily incorporated into voice ordering service for a wider accessibility. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
