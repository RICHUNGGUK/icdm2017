However, these studies do not consider the impact of quality management practices on the knowledge creation process. Based on a comprehensive literature review and a field survey, this study investigates the impact of quality management practices on the knowledge creation process. A proposed model and hypotheses are presented and tested using survey data collected from aviation firms in China. The test of the structural model supports some proposed hypotheses. We find that employee training, employee involvement, product design, benchmarking, and vision statement have significant direct impacts on the knowledge creation process. We also find that some other quality management practices, such as top management support, customer focus, supplier quality management, quality information, and recognition and rewards, do not have a direct impact on knowledge creation. Suggestions for the improvement of quality management in aviation firms in China are provided. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed, and further research directions are offered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
