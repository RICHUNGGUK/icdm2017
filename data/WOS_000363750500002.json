Based on the theories of task-technology fit (TTF) and use-context fit (UCF), a research model that reflects the two fitness effects on consumers' mobile channel continuance was developed and empirically tested against data collected from 358 mobile banking consumers of a national commercial bank in China. The results confirm the usefulness of the two fitness theories in explaining the mobile channel continuance and identify the concurrence effects of TTF and UCF on consumers' mobile channel continuance. Specifically, this study found that task features and technology characteristics significantly affect TTF, which further determines mobile channel continuance. UCF was found to be an important antecedent of TTF and a significant determinant of mobile channel continuance. This study also found that perceived utilitarian and hedonic values influence mobile channel continuance directly and indirectly via UCF.", "paper_title": "Understanding consumers' mobile channel continuance: an empirical investigation of two fitness mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000363750500002"}
