The conventional (and optimum) norm that is used to conduct the tree traversal step in SD is the l(2)-norm. It was, however, recently observed that using the l(infinity)-norm instead reduces the hardware complexity of SD considerably at only a marginal performance loss. These savings result from a reduction in the length of the critical path in the circuit and the silicon area required for metric computation, but are also, as observed previously through simulation results, a consequence of a reduction in the computational (i.e., algorithmic) complexity. The aim of this paper is an analytical performance and computational complexity analysis of l(infinity)-norm SD. For independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading MIMO channels, we show that l(infinity)-norm SD achieves full diversity order with an asymptotic SNR gap, compared to l(2)-norm SD, that increases at most linearly in the number of receive antennas. Moreover, we provide a closed l(infinity)-form expression for the computational complexity of-norm SD based on which we establish that its complexity scales exponentially in the system size. Finally, we characterize the tree pruning behavior of l(infinity)-norm SD and show that it behaves fundamentally different from that of l(2)-norm SD.", "paper_title": "Performance and Complexity Analysis of Infinity-Norm Sphere-Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000014"}
