Our cube root method is inspired by the work of Muller (Des Codes Cryptogr 31:301-312, 2004) on the quadratic case. For a given cubic residue with , we show that there is an irreducible polynomial with root such that is a cube root of . Consequently we find an efficient cube root algorithm based on the third order linear recurrence sequences arising from . The complexity estimation shows that our algorithm is better than the previously proposed Cipolla-Lehmer type algorithms.", "paper_title": "New cube root algorithm based on the third order linear recurrence relations in finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000353059700008"}
