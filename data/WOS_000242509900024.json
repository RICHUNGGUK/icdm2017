The modified approach also is reliable for general optimum structural design with fuzzy resources, as concluded the most recommended method for fuzzy engineering design. The proposed approach is better than the single-cut approach and easy programming for use to instead of multiple-cuts approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
