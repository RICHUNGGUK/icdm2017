Suppose that a Boolean function f can be computed by a threshold circuit C of energy complexity e and hence at most e threshold gates in C output \"1\" for any input to C. We prove that the function f can also be computed by a threshold circuit C' of the depth 2e + 1 and hence the parallel computation time of C' is 2e + 1. If the size of C is s, that is, there are s threshold gates in C. then the size s' of C' is s' = 2es + 1. Thus, if the size s of C is polynomial in the number n of input variables, then the size s' of C' is polynomial in n, too. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
