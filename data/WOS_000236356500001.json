Similar ideas can be applied to Mobile IP to provide IP paging services. However, current proposed multi-step paging schemes are user dependent under which the partition of paging areas and the selection of paging sequence are different for each user. The performance of a user dependent paging scheme for individual users may be affected by many factors. It is often difficult to achieve perfect performance for each user. In addition, when multiple users are paged at the same time, user dependent paging schemes may consume significant system resources. This paper introduces a user independent paging scheme where the paging criterion is not based on individual user information. The goal of user independent paging is to provide satisfactory overall performance of the whole system, when personalized optimal performance for each user is hard to obtain. The user independent paging scheme is proposed for IP mobility for its easy implementation and convenient combination with paging request aggregation. The paging criterion adopted is the mobility rate of each subnet determined by the aggregated movements of all mobile users. In order to implement the proposed scheme, a concept of \"semi-idle state\" is introduced and the detailed solution for obtaining mobility rate is presented. Analytical results show that when paging one user at a time, the performance of the proposed user independent paging scheme is comparable to that of the paging schemes based on perfect knowledge of user movement statistics. When paging multiple users simultaneously and when the knowledge on individual user behavior is not perfectly accurate, the proposed scheme has remarkable advantages in terms of reducing the overall paging cost.", "paper_title": "User independent paging scheme for mobile IP", "paper_id": "WOS:000236356500001"}
