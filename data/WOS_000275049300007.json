In recent years, several identity-based authenticated key agreement protocols have been proposed and most of them broken. in this paper, we propose two three-party identity-based authenticated key agreement protocols applying bilinear pairings. We show that the proposed protocols are secure (i.e. conform to defined security attributes) while being efficient. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
