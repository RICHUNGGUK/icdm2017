Face Images clustering is enhanced face recognition performance. Face image is clustered several cluster unsupervised or statistical method and we recognize using correlation between clusters. In this paper we adopted recognition algorithm by aggregation method. In this paper we present the recognition system using the table of fitness correlations between clusters for combining the results from the individual clusters. By training the different classifiers with different clusters of training data and adopting fusion method considering fitness correlation between clusters we found out better recognition performance than combining classifiers fed with same data.", "paper_title": "Face recognition using correlation between illuminant context", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000087"}
