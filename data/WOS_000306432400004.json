In this paper, we have constructed a 124-vertex simplicial subdivision of the 64-vertex standard cellulation of (S (2))(3), such that the -action on this cellulation naturally extends to an action on . Further, the -action on is \"good\", so that the quotient simplicial complex is a 30-vertex triangulation of a\",P (3). In other words, we have constructed a simplicial realization of the branched covering (S (2))(3)-> a\",P (3).", "paper_title": "A Triangulation of CP3 as Symmetric Cube of S-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400004"}
