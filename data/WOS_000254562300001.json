Design/methodology/approach - First, a modelling process is made in order to build the velocity equation using simple constraint equations: i.e. length restriction, relative motion and rigid body constraints. Then the motion space is solved, i.e. the space that spans all feasible motions of the manipulator. Findings - The velocity equation is comprehensive, i.e. it relates all kinematic variables, not only input and output. The Jacobian related to the comprehensive velocity equation is a square dimensionless matrix. This characteristic has great importance when evaluating manipulability or closeness to singularities. Employing the motion space, any kinematic entity can be studied: i.e. velocities and accelerations of any active/passive joints, screw axis, axodes, and so on. Also a comprehensive singularity analysis can be made. Research limitations/implications - The approach presented is focused on the kinetostatic analysis of manipulators and, therefore, subjected to rigid body assumption. Practical implications - The paper presents a proposal of effective codes for engineering analysis of manipulators. Originality/value - This approach is based on a pure computational kinematic analysis that unifies all kinetostatic analysis for any manipulator topology (i.e. serial, parallel, hybrid manipulators, complex mechanisms, redundant-or non-redundant-actuated). The characteristic Jacobian matrix is dimensionless and provides the means for a complete singularity analysis and an effective use of indicators.", "paper_title": "Computational kinematics for robotic manipulators: Jacobian problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254562300001"}
