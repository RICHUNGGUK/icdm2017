In spite of the facts that above functionalities are modular wise independent, commonly they are related in terms of assisting the production audit task. 3D PAMT facilitates the verification of manufactured parts to be within a pre-defined threshold range using a calibrated stereo camera with the safety test engineer interaction in order to select the matching disparity points. The distance between datum points with or without reference to a planar reference surface model can be obtained. We describe the system flow, plus validate the technique via a number of experimental datasets. 3D PACT allows the identification of discrepancies between a computed 3D point cloud model and the corresponding digital mock-up point cloud model. Usually, the computer aided geometry model is built before an actual installation. This knowledge about the components of an installation assembly is available as semantic information in an extendable markup language (XML) format of the CATIA model. We have provided an use case study of a sample assembly with components such as cube, pyramid, rectangular prism and triangular prism. The proposed cost-effective and robust framework for 3D measurement audit and model comparison is based on the input available from a digital camera and the semantic metadata knowledge available from geometry models which can be used for verification tasks.", "paper_title": "A new cost effective 3D measurement audit and model comparison system for verification tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314691300007"}
