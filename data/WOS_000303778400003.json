The potential for the lack, or breaches, of any such property constitutes a system vulnerability that may lead to an undesirable behavior from a user's point of view. This undesirable behavior could be triggered by special events in the form of intended, or unintended, attacks emanating in the system's environment. One can view the undesirable system features as the sum of the features that are complementary to the desirable ones that must be taken into account from the start of system development to achieve a stable and robust system behavior. This work focuses on the modeling, analysis, and testing of both the desirable and the undesirable system features that form relations between the system, its environment, and its operation. The proposed approach is event based and is demonstrated and analyzed using a case study.", "paper_title": "Modeling, Analysis, and Testing of System Vulnerabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000303778400003"}
