Quality measures can help secondary data analysts to identify inaccurate conclusions resulting from the disclosure limitation procedures, as well as have confidence in accurate conclusions. We propose a framework for an interactive, web-based system that analysts can query for measures of inferential quality. As we illustrate, agencies seeking to build such systems must consider the additional disclosure risks from releasing quality measures. We suggest some avenues of research on limiting these risks.
