The model incorporates several unique domain-specific features of Chinese e-Business websites. We evaluated the proposed model using four different classification algorithms and approximately 3,000 Chinese e-Business websites. The results show that the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm performs the best. The proposed model outperforms two baseline models in detection precision, recall, and F-measure. The results of a sensitivity analysis demonstrate that domain-specific features have the most significant impact on the detection of Chinese phishing e-Business websites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
