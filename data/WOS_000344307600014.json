Although commonly considered simple applications, mashups can also be complex software artifacts depending on the number and types of Web resources (the components) they integrate. Mashup tools have undoubtedly simplified mashup development, yet the problem is still generally nontrivial and requires intimate knowledge of the components provided by the mashup tool, its underlying mashup paradigm, and of how to apply such to the integration of the components. This knowledge is generally neither intuitive nor standardized across different mashup tools and the consequent lack of modeling expertise affects both skilled programmers and end-user programmers alike. In this article, we show how to effectively assist the users of mashup tools with contextual, interactive recommendations of composition knowledge in the form of reusable mashup model patterns. We design and study three different recommendation algorithms and describe a pattern weaving approach for the one-click reuse of composition knowledge. We report on the implementation of three pattern recommender plugins for different mashup tools and demonstrate via user studies that recommending and weaving contextual mashup model patterns significantly reduces development times in all three cases.", "paper_title": "Recommendation and Weaving of Reusable Mashup Model Patterns for Assisted Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000344307600014"}
