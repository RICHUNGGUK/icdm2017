The proposed approach explores a 4-D histogram that contains information on the local velocity (speed and orientation) of each spatial position, and the comparison is made using histogram distances. The 4-D histogram also allows the comparison of specific characteristics, such as distribution of orientations only, speed only, relative spatial occupancy only, and combinations of such features. Experimental results indicate that the proposed quantitative metric correlates with visual inspection.
