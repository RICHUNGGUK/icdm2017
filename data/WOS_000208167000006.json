We present a variable precision floating-point library (VFloat) that supports general floating-point formats including IEEE standard formats. Most previously published floating-point formats for use with reconfigurable hardware are subsets of our format. Custom datapaths with optimal bitwidths for each operation can be built using the variable precision hardware modules in the VFloat library, enabling a higher level of parallelism. The VFloat library includes three types of hardware modules for format control, arithmetic operations, and conversions between fixed-point and floating-point formats. The format conversions allow for hybrid fixed- and floating-point operations in a single design. This gives the designer control over a large number of design possibilities including format as well as number range within the same application. In this article, we give an overview of the components in the VFloat library and demonstrate their use in an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images.", "paper_title": "VFloat: A Variable Precision Fixed- and Floating-Point Library for Reconfigurable Hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000208167000006"}
