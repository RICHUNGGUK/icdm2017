To understand the mechanisms of perceptual decision-making for an auditory discrimination experiment, we connected a large-scale, neurobiologically realistic auditory pattern recognition model to a three-layer decision-making model and simulated an auditory delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task. In each trial of our simulated DMS task, pairs of stimuli were compared each stimulus being a sequence of three frequency-modulated tonal-contour segments, and a \"match\" or \"nonmatch\" button was pressed. The model's simulated response times and the different patterns of neural responses (transient, sustained, increasing) are consistent with experimental data and the simulated neurophysiological activity provides insights into the neural interactions from perception to action in the auditory DMS task.", "paper_title": "Simulated neural dynamics of decision-making in an auditory delayed match-to-sample task", "paper_id": "WOS:000257395100002"}
