The MASM has been discussed based on IMS-QTI architecture for a long time, but it is not implemented yet so far. Through this architecture, it could easily integrate external functionalities without redeveloping the system. This MAMS system can record the students' response time of each item and use an integrated analyzing method of SPC (Student-Problem Chart) to analyze the students' response patterns. This study takes the exam results to analyze the students' response patterns and the items, calculates the indices for the students and the items, produces the students' diagnostic figure and the item diagnostic figure, then, integrates IRS to calculate the ordering coefficient of the items to produce the figures of the item relational structure for each group students. The results of this study show that different types of the students construct different concept structure because they have different item relational structure. The implication of this study can provide the instructor to conduct the teaching and prepare remedial materials for the students.", "paper_title": "An IMS-QTI Compliant Multimedia Assessment Management System with SPC and Student Response Time to Analyze Learning Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000352755900005"}
