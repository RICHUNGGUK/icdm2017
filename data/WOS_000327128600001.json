The problem is to pack a subset of L into B, maximizing the total profit of packed items, where the packing must satisfy the unloading constraint: while removing one item a, items with higher class values can not block a. We present a (4+epsilon)-approximation algorithm when the bin is a square. We also present (3+epsilon)-approximation algorithms for two special cases of this problem.", "paper_title": "A NOTE ON A TWO DIMENSIONAL KNAPSACK PROBLEM WITH UNLOADING CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327128600001"}
