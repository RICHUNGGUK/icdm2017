A rational exchange protocol cannot provide fairness, but it ensures that rational (i.e. self-interested) parties would have no reason to deviate from the protocol. Buttyan et al (2003) have recently pointed out how rationality in exchange protocols can be formalized and studied within the framework provided by Game Theory. In this paper, we identify some vulnerabilities in Syverson's protocol which were not detected by Buttyin et al's analysis. These motivate us to extend the model to consider new aspects, never formalized before when analyzing security protocols. These aspects are related to participants' reputation, protocol's robustness, and the impact that scenarios where the protocol is executed repeatedly have on the outcome of the protocol execution.", "paper_title": "An extended model of rational exchange based on dynamic games of imperfect information", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423100028"}
