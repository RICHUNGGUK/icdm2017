Briefly, this technique consists of rewriting the kinematic error model of the mobile robot tracking problem into a TS fuzzy representation and finding a stabilizing controller by solving LMI conditions for the tracking-error model. The state variables are estimated by nonlinear predictor observer where the outputs are delayed by a constant delay. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach a comparison between the TS fuzzy observer and the nonlinear predictor observer is shown. For this study the reference trajectory is built by taking into account the acceleration limits of the mobile robot. All experiments are implemented on simulation and the real-time platform.", "paper_title": "PDC Control Design for Non-holonomic Wheeled Mobile Robots with Delayed Outputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284160500003"}
