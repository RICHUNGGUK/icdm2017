Industrial radios offer convenience and flexibility in deployment while presenting cyber security challenges that wired communications do not. This paper presents a survey of literature related to wireless communications cyber security. The paper focuses on vulnerabilities and mitigations related to multiple industrial radio technologies deployed in control systems including IEEE 802.15.4, WirelessHART, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and IEEE 802.11. This paper also discusses how industrial radio vulnerabilities may be used as vectors for simple and complex attacks on control systems found in critical infrastructure. Finally, this paper provides a set of recommendations for securing wireless networks used in control systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
