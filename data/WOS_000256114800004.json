The motion of the system is subject to a set of constraints at any time. The controls are the only means to realize the constraints. This is the essence of the servo constraint problem, which is rarely studied in Analytical Mechanics. We propose to adopt the Maggi approach to systematically analyze the problem and synthesize the controls. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
