The first CDA model, CDA-1, divides each class into a number of clusters by means of the k-means clustering technique. In this way, a new within-cluster scatter matrix S-w(c) and a new between-cluster scatter matrix S-b(c) are defined. The second and the third CDA models, CDA-2 and CDA-3, define a nonparametric form of the between-cluster scatter matrices N - S-b(c). The nonparametric nature of the between-cluster scatter matrices inherently leads to the derived features that preserve the structure important for classification. The difference between CDA-2 and CDA-3 is that the former computes the between-cluster matrix N-S-b(c) on a local basis, whereas the latter computes the between-cluster matrix N-S-b(c) on a global basis. This paper then presents an accurate CDA-based eye detection method. Experiments on three widely used face databases show the feasibility of the proposed three CDA models and the improved eye detection performance over some state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Clustering-Based Discriminant Analysis for Eye Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000332732900001"}
