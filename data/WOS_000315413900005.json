Based on some basic properties of the new generalized cyclotomy, it is shown that all the constructed FHSs are optimal with respect to the well-known Lempel-Greenberger bound. Furthermore, these FHSs have new parameters which are not reported in the literature", "paper_title": "NEW CONSTRUCTIONS OF OPTIMAL FREQUENCY HOPPING SEQUENCES WITH NEW PARAMETERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315413900005"}
