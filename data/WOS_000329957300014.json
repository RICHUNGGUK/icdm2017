Considering the data rate requirements of the IPTV service and challenges in distribution of the service due to wireless environment, the proposed model is built on the Mesh operating mode of the standard IEEE 802.16 (a.k.a, WiMAX). Besides the high data rates provided by the WiMAX technology, the capability of relaying transmissions and the adaptability to changing environment brings the WiMAX Mesh mode as a viable alternative to the infrastructure based models. In WISDoM-SD, the standard WiMAX Mesh mode is modified in order to meet the strict delay requirements of the IPTV service and improve capacity by enabling transmission of more IPTV channels to more subscribers. Accordingly, transmissions are carried over only high data rate links and connections with up to two hops to the BS are allowed. Additionally, benefiting from space diversity information, parallel transmissions are utilized to save transmission slots, and allow serving more users. The results of the simulations show that, for the given delay constraints, the WISDoM-SD model improves capacity compared to the standard WiMAX Mesh mode at the cost of omitting a few nodes (less than 1% of total nodes) for which the experienced channel quality is too low for IPTV service anyways.
