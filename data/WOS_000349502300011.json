Through Mantis, the user is able to define the network topology, current and forecasted traffic matrices, CAPEX/OPEX parameters, set up basic configuration parameters, and use a library of algorithms to plan, operate, or run what-if scenarios for an optical network of interest. Mantis is designed to be deployed either as a cloud service or as a desktop application. Using the cloud infrastructures features Mantis can scale according to the user demands, executing fast and efficiently the scenarios requested. Mantis supports different cloud platforms either public such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and similar to okeanos or private based on OpenStack, while its modular architecture allows other cloud infrastructures to be adopted in the future with minimum effort. The included planning and operation algorithms range from routing and wavelength or spectrum allocation, to equipment (e.g. transponders and regenerators) placement, and CAPEX/OPEX/energy analysis.
