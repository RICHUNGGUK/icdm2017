The criteria considered were the Akaike information criterion, the corrected AIC, two formulations of the Bayesian information criterion, and a generalized cross-validation method. The estimated curves selected by the five methods were compared to each other in a study of rectal cancer mortality in autoworkers. In the stimulation study, we estimated the fit of the penalized spline models in six exposure-response scenarios, using the five model fit criteria. The methods were compared on the basis of a mean squared error score and the power and size of hypothesis tests for any effect and for detecting nonlinearity. All comparisons were made across a range in the total sample size and number of cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
