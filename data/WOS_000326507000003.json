In this work a novel concept for monitoring PONs for fiber to the home (FTTH) access, which is based on concatenated wavelength-selective mirrors, has been investigated in a field trial. At each subscriber a unique mirror combination is installed. Binomial coefficients guarantee that each mirror combination in a given PON is used only once. The field trial has been performed successfully with a PON consisting of 37 km deployed standard single-mode fiber and up to 1:32 passive optical power splitting causing a total one-way attenuation of at least 30.7 dB. Different subscribers located at equal distances from the optical time domain reflectometry could be distinguished and identified individually. For the measurement setup only low-cost components were used.", "paper_title": "Field Trial With a FTTH/PON Monitoring Technique Based on Unique Wavelength-Selective Mirror Combinations", "paper_id": "WOS:000326507000003"}
