Using the intrinsic characteristics of the resonators and feed lines, nine transmission zeros near the passband edges and in the stopband can be generated to achieve high selectivity. An experimental tri-band BPF located at 2.4/5.7 GHz [wireless local area networks (WLAN) application] and 3.5 GHz [worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) application] has been simulated and fabricated. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results validates the design approach. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
