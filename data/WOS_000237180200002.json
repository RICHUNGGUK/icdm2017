Typically, these visualization applications are modeled and solved using nonlinear optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a discretization of the data visualization problem that allows us to formulate it as a quadratic assignment problem. However, this formulation is computationally difficult to solve optimally using an exact approach. Consequently, we investigate the use of a local search technique for the data visualization problem. The space in which the data points are to be embedded can be discretized using an n x n lattice. Conducting a local search on this n x n lattice is computationally ineffective. Instead, we propose a divide-and-conquer local search approach that refines the lattice at each step. We show that this approach is much faster than conducting local search on the entire n x n lattice and, in general, it generates higher quality solutions. We envision two uses of our divide-and-conquer local search heuristic: (1) as a stand-alone approach for data visualization, and (2) to provide a good approximate starting solution for a nonlinear algorithm.
