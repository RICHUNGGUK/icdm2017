Consider the graph TS where two members T and T' of T-S are adjacent if T intersects T' only in points of S or in common edges. We prove that the diameter of T-S is O(logk), where k denotes the number of convex layers of S. Based on this result, we show that the flip graph P-S of pseudo-triangulations of S (where two pseudo-triangulations are adjacent if they differ in exactly one edge-either by replacement or by removal) has a diameter of O(n log k). This sharpens a known o(n log k) bound. Let PS be the induced subgraph of pointed pseudo-triangulations of Ps. We present an example showing that the distance between two nodes in PS is strictly larger than the distance between the corresponding nodes in Ps. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
