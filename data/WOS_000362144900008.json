The first two apply to invariants of a finite group acting on a finitely generated algebra over a Euclidean ring. This may be viewed as a first step in \"computational arithmetic invariant theory.\" As a special case, the algorithms can compute multiplicative invariant rings. The third algorithm computes the invariant ring of a reductive group acting on a vector space, and often performs better than the algorithms known to date. The main tool upon which two of the algorithms are built is a generalized version of an ideal that was already used by Derksen in his algorithm for computing invariants of linearly reductive groups. As a further application, these so-called extended Derksen ideals give rise to invariantization maps, which turn an arbitrary ring element into an invariant. For the Most part, the algorithms of this paper have been implemented.
