We use a method to link regions identified as suspicious in both projections and add a two-view classifier to an existing CAD scheme. The input of this two-view classifier was a feature vector containing the likelihood of malignancy of the region, the likelihood of malignancy of the corresponding region in the other view, and a number of features that describe the resemblance between the both regions. Using FROC analysis we show that detection results improve when using two-view information.", "paper_title": "Exploitation of correspondence between CC and MLO views in computer aided mass detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900033"}
