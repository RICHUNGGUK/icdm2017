More specifically, the spatially varying defocus point-spread-functions (PSFs) over an image reveal geometric information of the scene, and their estimate can also be used to recover an all-in-focus image. A PSF for a defocus blur can be specified by a single parameter indicating its scale. Most existing algorithms can only select an optimal blur from a finite set of candidate PSFs for each pixel. Some of those methods require a coded aperture filter inserted in the camera. In this paper, we present an algorithm estimating a defocus scale map from a single image, which is applicable to conventional cameras. This method is capable of measuring the probability of local defocus scale in the continuous domain. It also takes smoothness and color edge information into consideration to generate a coherent blur map indicating the amount of blur at each pixel. Simulated and real data experiments illustrate excellent performance and its successful applications in foreground/background segmentation.", "paper_title": "Estimating Spatially Varying Defocus Blur From A Single Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300025"}
