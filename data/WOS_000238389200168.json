In this paper, we propose a new resource management system, which manages software resources effectively, and its prototype implementation. This system uses an existing on-demand software streaming technology to manage software resources. This system greatly reduces traditional software deployment costs and associated installation problems. In this system, an added node can also execute a requested job without installation of applications.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a resource management system using on-demand software streaming on distributed computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200168"}
