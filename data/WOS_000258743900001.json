The program provides several options of horizontal radiation mode and tilted surface radiation mode to estimate the radiation at any time intervals as well as to find the position of the sun, using the graphical programming language Simulink. The model can conveniently connect with pre-existing models built with Simulink and its results are of importance for improving the simulation accuracy of solar energy system and/or air-conditioning system. The program is an open source and available at the web site http://nht.xjtu.edu.cn/qtxx/cxdm.htm. Any user can utilize, expand and develop the contents of the program.
