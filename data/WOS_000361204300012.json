Our study takes into account reliable, fast, and default packets that have different requirements of quality-of-service performance criteria. We show, by simulations, that with only a few electronic ports to the buffer, the hybrid switch significantly improves the packet loss rates and the sustainable system load compared to an all-optical bufferless switch and meets the different packet classes' requirements. In addition, we quantified the considerable decrease of O-E-O conversions as well as the switching latency achieved by the hybrid switch compared to an electronic switch.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of a Hybrid Optical-Electronic Packet Switch Supporting Different Service Classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361204300012"}
