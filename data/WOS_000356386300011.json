In this paper, an ideal memory system can be extended to generate 15 different kinds of quasi-ideal memory systems, which are included in memory systems as its special cases and are different from ideal memory system. For a system to be a quasi-ideal memory system, it should show three unique fingerprints: 1) the pinched hysteretic loop of a quasi-ideal memory system must be odd symmetrical in the plane; 2) the pinched hysteretic loop of a quasi-ideal memory system must be \" self-crossing\"; and 3) the slope of tangent line for the pinched hysteresis loop must be strictly monotone in a given period.", "paper_title": "Quasi-Ideal Memory System", "paper_id": "WOS:000356386300011"}
