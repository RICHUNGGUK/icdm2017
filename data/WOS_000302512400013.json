Transformation functions are put forward to convert normalized interval weights into consistent interval fuzzy preference relations. By analyzing the relationship between interval weights and consistent interval fuzzy preference relations, goal-programming-based models are developed for deriving interval weights from interval fuzzy preference relations for both individual and group decision-making situations. The proposed models are illustrated by a numerical example and an international exchange doctoral student selection problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
