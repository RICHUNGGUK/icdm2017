Rare earth element ytterbium (Yb) has been taken in the dry film method as the internal standard to compensate for the thickness variation of the dry films. This technique circumvents the interference from water absorption and requires only 50 mu l of sample. Support vector regression (SVR) as a multivariate calibration method has been combined with boosting for the development of a boosting support vector regression (BSVR) method for the dry film measurement modeling. The introduction of boosting drastically enhances the performance of individual SVR model. The results show that the glucose in plasma can be determined over the 0.4-20 mmol/L concentration range with satisfactory accuracy using the dry film technique coupled with the BSVR method. Moreover, the performance of BSVR was compared favorably with that of the conventional SVR and PLS.
