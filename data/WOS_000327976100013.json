Contrary to the well-known laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), LSCI has the advantage of giving a full-field image of surface blood flow using simple instrumentation. However, laser speckle contrast images are not fully understood yet and their link with LDF signals still has to be studied. To quantify the similarity between LSCI and LDF symbolic sequences, we propose to use, for the first time, the index adapted from linguistic analysis and information theory proposed by Yang et al. For this purpose, LSCI and LDF data were recorded simultaneously on the forearm of healthy subjects, at rest and during a vascular occlusion (biological zero). We show that there are different dynamical patterns for LSCI and LDF data, and the distances between these patterns differ through the space scales explored. Moreover, our results suggest that these different dynamical patterns could be linked to blood flow. The quantitative metric used herein therefore provides new information on LSCI and brings knowledge on links between LSCI and LDF.", "paper_title": "Linguistic Analysis of Laser Speckle Contrast Images Recorded at Rest and During Biological Zero: Comparison With Laser Doppler Flowmetry Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000327976100013"}
