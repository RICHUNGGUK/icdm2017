Using Institution Agents, we define a dialectic process to manage contradiction. This allows autoepistemic Institution Agents to learn from a supervised teaching process. We present an industrial application in the field of Drug Discovery, applying our system in the prediction of pharmaco-kinetic properties (ADME-T) and adverse side effects of therapeutic drug molecules.", "paper_title": "A pragmatic logic of scientific discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200024"}
