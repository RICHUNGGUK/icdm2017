The proposed hybridization utilizes the Baldwin-Lomax model with the Degani-Schiff modification as the RANS model in the near-wall region and a MILES far from the wall. Although the hybridizationis assumed to be a MILES with wall modeling, the transition line between the RANS and the MILES modes is determined by the turbulent intensity that is dominated by the large eddies in the grid-scale. This hybrid model is applied to the flows past three different types of airfoils (NACA63(3)-018, NACA63(1)-012 and NACA64A-006) near stall, at a chord Reynolds number of Re = 5.8 x 10(6). These airfoils are classified as trailing-edge-stall, leading-edge-stall and thin-airfoil-stall airfoils, respectively. The computed results are compared with wind tunnel experiments. The hybrid model successfully demonstrates accurate stall angle and surface pressure distribution predictions near the stall for each type of airfoil. The airfoil simulation results confirmed that the hybrid model provides a better prediction than the RANS model for unsteady turbulent flows with separation and vortex shedding simulations.
