A pair (g(1), h(1)) of marked morphisms {a, b}* -> {a, b}* is called a successor of (g, h) if g omicron g(1)(a) = h omicron h(1)(a) and g omicron g(1) (b) = h omicron h(1) (b) and the images of g(1) and h(1) are shortest possible. Successors play an important role in studying the Post Correspondence Problem. Typically, they are simpler than the original morphisms, measured by the number of suffixes of their images (called the suffix complexity). In some cases, however, the suffix complexity is stable - it does not decrease. In this paper we give a full characterization of binary morphisms with stable suffix complexity.", "paper_title": "BINARY MORPHISMS WITH STABLE SUFFIX COMPLEXITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000289639700011"}
