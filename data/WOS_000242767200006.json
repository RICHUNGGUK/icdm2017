Then several elementary properties of Fourier spectrums of credibility distributions for fuzzy variables are studied. Furthermore some relations between credibility distributions and Fourier spectrums such as inversion formula and uniqueness theorem are established.", "paper_title": "Fourier spectrum of credibility distribution for fuzzy variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000242767200006"}
