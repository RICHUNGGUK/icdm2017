The tool path generation includes two core steps. First is the forward-step function that determines the maximum distance, called forward step, between two cutter contact (CC) points with a given tolerance. The second component is the side step function which determines the maximum distance, called side step, between two adjacent tool paths with a given scallop height. Using the Bezier curves and surfaces, we generate cutter contact (CC) points for free-form surfaces and cutter location (CL) data files for post processing. Several parts are machined using a multi-axis milling machine. As part of the validation process, the tool paths generated from Bezier curves and surfaces are analyzed to compare the machined part and the desired part. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
