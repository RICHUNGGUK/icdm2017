The Hilbert in finite word H is obtained as the limit of these words. It gives a description of the Hilbert (infinite) curve. We give a uniform tag-system to generate automatically H and, by showing that it is almost cube-free, we prove that it cannot be obtained by simply iterating a morphism.", "paper_title": "Tag-systems for the Hilbert curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000253284200015"}
