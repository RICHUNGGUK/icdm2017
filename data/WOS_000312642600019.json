After describing the operational framework and the system architecture, we present in some detail the computer-supported design of a Mission Plan. The main focus of the article is on the flight experience made; in particular, we discuss the capabilities of the system to supply clear situation comprehension to the operators, the operation coordination issues and the operational results achieved during the mission. Finally, future extensions of mission planning support capabilities are discussed.", "paper_title": "A Multi-UAS Cooperative Mission Over Non-Segregated Civil Areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000312642600019"}
