It is often used in secure cloud storage and biometric matching. In this manuscript, we first propose a variant of symmetric predicate encryption, which provides controllable privacy preserving search functionalities, including revocable delegated search and un-decryptable delegated search. Due to these functionalities, the owner of a cloud storage can easily control the lifetimes and search privileges of cloud data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
