In this paper, an approach is proposed based on the syntactic features after classification. Using the difference in type and position of quantifiers between Chinese and Japanese, quantifier translation rules were acquired. Evaluation was conducted using the acquired translation rules. Finally, the adaptability of the experimental data was verified and the methods achieved the accuracy of 90.75%, which showed that they were effective in processing quantifiers and numerals.", "paper_title": "Treatment of quantifiers in Chinese-Japanese machine translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300117"}
