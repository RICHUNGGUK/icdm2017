Furthermore, we propose a visual query language for expressing policy queries in a visual form. Our framework provides an intuitive cognitive sense about the policy, policy queries and policy violations. We also describe our implementation of a visualization-based policy analysis tool that supports the functionalities discussed in our framework. In addition, we discuss our study on usability of our tool with evaluation criteria and experimental results.", "paper_title": "Visualization-based policy analysis for SELinux: framework and user study", "paper_id": "WOS:000318876800001"}
