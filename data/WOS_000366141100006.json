The proposed control schemes rely on local measurements as communication-free control approach. Therefore, the distributed controllers of the MG components have been deployed based on their slow, medium, and fast dynamic responses to maintain the voltage and frequency in adherence to IEEE Standards 1547 and 929. The various voltage and frequency control responses associated with reactive power management scheme are efficiently utilized based on well-defined states of operation and transient management scheme. In each state, the roles of each device for voltage and frequency regulations are defined with its regulation capability, and response time based on its local measurements. Consequently, the fast reactive power compensation and rapid frequency regulation are ensured based on the inverter-based devices at challenging operating conditions. As a result, the proposed control strategy improves the voltage and frequency regulation, transient response, and MG stability. A comprehensive simulation study has verified the superior performance of the communication-free approach during steady state and in response to severe disturbances.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Roles of Islanded Microgrid Components for Voltage and Frequency Transient Responses Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100006"}
