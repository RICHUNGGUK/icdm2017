For VANET technologies to be widely available, security issues concerning several essential requirements should be addressed. The existing security architectures and mechanisms have been studied separately in V2V and V2I networks, which results in duplicated efforts, security modules, and more complex security architectures. In this paper, we propose a unified security architecture and its corresponding security protocols that achieve essential security requirements such as authentication, conditional privacy, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study that deals with the security protocol in V2V as well as the handover authentication in V2I communications. Our proposal is characterized by a low-complexity security framework, owing to the design and unification of the security architectures and modules. Furthermore, the evaluation of the proposed protocols proves them to be more secure and efficient than existing schemes.
