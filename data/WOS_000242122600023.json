A multi-camera system is used for automatically detect, track and classify the objects. Data fusion from multiple sensors allows to get a more precise estimation of the position of detected moving objects and to solve occlusions problem. These data are then used to automatically place and animate objects avatars in a 3D virtual model of the scene, thus allowing users connected to this system to receive a 3D guide into the monitored environment.", "paper_title": "Dynamic scene reconstruction for 3D virtual guidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600023"}
