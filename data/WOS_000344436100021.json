At present, quantitative research on this topic is rare in China and even elsewhere. To assist in rational planning as well as in the scientific layout of the spatial distribution of livestock and poultry farms, this study establishes an evaluation index system for the spatial distribution suitability of the livestock and poultry sector and adopts Delphi method and analytic hierarchy process (AMP) to standardize each evaluation factor that affects the suitable spatial layout of livestock and poultry farming and consequently, to assign weights. The system is based on theory of land suitability; the organic combination of social, economic, and environmental factors; and geographic information system technology. GIS software is employed to generate the thematic maps of a single evaluation factor. The score of each block of livestock farming land suitability evaluation is then generated based on the results of the suitability analysis for a single factor along with the weighted calculation result of the weight of each evaluation factor and the application of the GIS overlay function. Results show that regardless of the size or proportion of areas suitable for livestock and poultry farming, Xianyou County and Hanjiang District remain suitable for livestock and poultry breeding layout; quantity distribution should give priority to these two areas as well. Recommendations to adjust spatial layout planning for livestock and poultry farming in Putian, Xianyou County, must be improved. The north and northwest areas should be considered in the layout for livestock and poultry farming. Planning for Hanjiang District should be readjusted, and priority should be given to Zhuangbian Town, Dayang Village, Xinxian Town, and Jiangkou Town. Chengxiang and Licheng Districts are relatively ideal and require only appropriate fine tuning. Planning for Xiuyu District should be readjusted, and priority should be given to suitable villages and towns, such as Dongqiao Town, Hushi Town, and Dongzhuang Town. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
