The key idea is to incorporate the regime switching effect in a discrete-time binomial model for an asset's prices via the \"self-exciting\" threshold principle. The proposed model provides a simple structure for pricing options in a changing economic environment. Numerical examples for the proposed threshold binomial model as well as their trinomial extension are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
