In order to minimize corrosion related electro-magnetic field, we must know how the electrode position and output current influence the strength of corrosion related electro-magnetic field. In this paper, the corrosion related electro-magnetic field was simulated by boundary element method (BEASY software) with different electrode position and output current, and then the influence of electrode position and output current on corrosion related electro-magnetic field was analyzed, last the optimized electrode position was ascertained.
