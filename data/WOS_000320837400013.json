Initially, AHP is applied to respondents to form a basis of market segmentation. Thereafter, with respect to identified segments, AHP and KM are employed to extract customer preference for design attributes (DAs) and customer perception of marketing requirements (MRs), respectively. Finally, by means of DEMATEL, the causal relationships between MRs and DAs are systematically recognized to uncover new ideas of next-generation products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
