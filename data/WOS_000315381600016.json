We consider several parameters to separate decidable problems from undecidable ones. Not only are we able to provide precise borders and a systematic analysis, but we also demonstrate the robustness of our proof techniques.", "paper_title": "PETRI NET REACHABILITY GRAPHS: DECIDABILITY STATUS OF FIRST-ORDER PROPERTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000315381600016"}
