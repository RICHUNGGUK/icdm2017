More specifically, it enhances reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity with eligibility trace when used in spiking neural networks, as shown by the results when tested in the simple benchmark problem of XOR, as well as in a complex multiagent setting task.", "paper_title": "Does High Firing Irregularity Enhance Learning?", "paper_id": "WOS:000287008500003"}
