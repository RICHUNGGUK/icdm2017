In this work we develop a fully automatic computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for high-dimensional pattern classification of baseline F-18-FDG PET scans from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) participants. Image projection as feature space dimension reduction technique is combined with an eigenimage based decomposition for feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM) is used to manage the classification task. A two folded objective is achieved by reaching relevant classification performance complemented with an image analysis support for final decision making. A 88.24% accuracy in identifying mild AD, with 88.64% specificity, and 87.70% sensitivity is obtained. This method also allows the identification of characteristic AD patterns in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
