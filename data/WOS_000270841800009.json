The findings show that the USA was the top contributing country, accounting for approximately one-third of the total number of articles. The 80/20 rule and the entropy measure consistently identify Issues in Science and Technology (IST), Industrial Engineer (IE), and R&D Magazine (RDM) as journals of high country concentration, or journals of low internationality. Conversely, Journal of Materials Processing Technology (JMPT), Production Planning & Control (PPC), and Technovation (TNV) have the highest degree of country diversity, or internationality. The quality of a journal, as expressed by impact factors, its internationality, and its number of articles published, are found to be independent of each other.", "paper_title": "The authorship and internationality of Industrial Engineering journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000270841800009"}
