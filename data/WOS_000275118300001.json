This article surveys various approaches to the formal modeling and analysis of the temporal features of computer-based systems, with a level of detail that is also suitable for nonspecialists. In doing so, it provides a unifying framework, rather than just a comprehensive list of formalisms. The article first lays out some key dimensions along which the various formalisms can be evaluated and compared. Then, a significant sample of formalisms for time modeling in computing are presented and discussed according to these dimensions. The adopted perspective is, to some extent, historical, going from \"traditional\" models and formalisms to more modern ones.", "paper_title": "Modeling Time in Computing: A Taxonomy and a Comparative Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000275118300001"}
