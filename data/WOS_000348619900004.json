At the same time, new car model design decisions may have a substantial effect on the cost and revenue drivers. For example, although a new car model configuration with component commonality may lower manufacturing cost, it also hinders increased revenues that could have been achieved through product differentiation. This paper develops and illustrates a state of the art, nature-inspired approach, to design car lines that optimize the degree of differentiation vs commonality among models in the line. More specifically, we apply a swarm intelligence mechanism to stated preference data derived from a large-scale conjoint experiment that measures consumer preferences for passenger cars in a sample of 1164 individuals. The proposed two-step methodology is also incorporated into a prototype system, which has been developed in an attempt to facilitate managerial decision making. Our approach provides interesting insights into how new and existing car models can be combined in a product line and identifies the desired balance between differentiation and commonality levels among models within a product line, which elevates customer satisfaction.
