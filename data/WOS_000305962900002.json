This necessitates considering nontraditional emission objectives in transportation systems modeling. In this research, we integrate emission-based objective into the traditional travel time based dynamic assignment framework. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from vehicles are computed as functions of space mean speed (determined from an embedded mesoscopic traffic flow model). Different performance metrics (CO emission, system wide travel time, and speed profiles) from the integrated model are compared with traditional dynamic assignment model (with travel time minimization objective). In addition, results indicate changes in route choice behavior of the road users when emission objective is integrated to dynamic assignment framework.", "paper_title": "Integration of Environmental Objectives in a System Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000305962900002"}
