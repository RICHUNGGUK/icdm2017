In this paper, we propose a home-network service system that can support home services appropriate to user's situation information in ubiquitous computing environments. The suggested system uses a uWDL work-flow service scenario [2] describing user's situation information as service execution constraints and supports a context-aware home service through comparing contexts described in the service scenario with user's situation information generated from ubiquitous computing environments. To do that, the suggested system represents contexts described in a uWDL document as a context subtree, which expresses not only context data but also relation information among services into the fields of its node. The suggested system uses a algorithm for context comparison between context subtrees and user's situation information. The algorithm selects a context that has all together values and types entirely equal to those of user's contexts. Therefore, the suggested system will be useful in the development of a context-aware home-network workflow service application based on uWDL in the ubiquitous computing environment.", "paper_title": "A context-aware smart home service system based on uWDL", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600077"}
