The cover image is divided into non-overlapping sub-blocks, and the basis pixel is calculated by the index function. Difference values with other pixel-pairs are referenced to decide the number of embedding secret bits with the range table. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could embed 2.45 bpp on average without distortion to the human visual system. We showed that the embedding capacity of the proposed method is 214,227 bits, 213,879 bits, 9,445 bits, 12,240 bits, and 109,253 bits larger than previous works on average for 12 test images.", "paper_title": "High-capacity index based data hiding method", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500023"}
