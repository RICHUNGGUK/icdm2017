In this paper we consider the problem of maintaining, in an online fashion, a collection of k checkpoints as an approximately uniformly spaced sample in the history of a continuous-time process. We present deterministic algorithms tailored for small values of k and a general one for arbitrary k. The algorithms are proven to be close to optimum for several different measures.", "paper_title": "Approximately Uniform Online Checkpointing with Bounded Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000321908000007"}
