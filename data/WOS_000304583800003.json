Irving and Leather (1986) [14] proved that counting the number of stable matchings in the general case is #P-complete. Counting the number of stable matchings is reducible to counting the number of downsets in a (related) partial order [14] and is interreducible, in an approximation-preserving sense, to a class of problems that includes counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph (#BIS) (Dyer et al. (2004) [6]). It is conjectured that no FPRAS exists for this class of problems. We show this approximation-preserving interreducibility remains even in the restricted k-attribute setting when k >= 3 (dot products) or k >= 2 (Euclidean distances). Finally, we show it is easy to count the number of stable matchings in the 1-attribute dot-product setting. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
