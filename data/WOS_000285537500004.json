The modularization approach makes use of the function-behavior-state (FBS) model of the system to derive the entity relations. The design structure matrix (DSM) is automatically constructed based on the FBS model. In this way, the tedious work of filling the DSM entries based on expert knowledge is avoided. The approach makes use of k-means clustering algorithm to allow the user to try different number of clusters in a fast way. The k-means clustering is adopted for DSM based modularization by defining a proper entity representation, relation measure and objective function. Two modularization schemes are performed, one based on the immediate relations and one on the deeper behavioral relations between the components. Considering the application on the shifting system of the Delft University of Technology (DUT) Formula Student car, the latter modularization resulted in more mechatronic behavior based modules, while the former resulted in modules based on mere disciplinary and spatial closeness.
