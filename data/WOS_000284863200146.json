These factors are known as emotions and morality. These factors must be taken into account in intelligent agents to have human-like behavior. In this article, we concentrate on emotional aspects of decision making. In this research, a new computational model is introduced to map the environmental events and agent actions to emotional states. The main characteristics of this model are adaptable to different domains and can be implemented as an individual module in software agents, and it has been implemented as a library with JAVA and C# programming languages.
