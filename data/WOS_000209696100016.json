In the random connection model, the channel powers between different nodes are drawn from a common distribution in an i.i.d. manner. In a wireless network with n nodes, a simple one-hop scheme achieving the throughput scaling of order n(1/3-delta), for any arbitrarily small delta > 0, is proposed. This scheme is based on maximizing the number of successful concurrent transmissions. Such achievable throughput, along with the order n(1/3) upper bound derived by Cui et al., characterizes the throughput of one-hop schemes for the class of connection models with distribution having finite mean and variance.", "paper_title": "One-Hop Throughput of Wireless Networks with Random Connections", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100016"}
