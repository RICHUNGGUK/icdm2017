Most recent research has extensively focused on the construction of I-Connected I-Dominating Set (1-CDS) in homogeneous networks. However, the nodes in the CDS need to carry other node's traffic and nodes in wireless networks are subject to failure. Therefore, it is desirable to construct a fault tolerant CDS. In this paper, we study a general fault tolerant CDS problem, called k-Connected m-Dominating Set (k-m-CDS), in heterogeneous networks. We first present two approximation algorithms for 1-m-CDS and k-k-CDS problems. Using disk graphs to model heterogeneous networks, we show that our algorithms have a constant approximation ratio. Based on these two algorithms, we further develop a general algorithm for k-m-CDS. We also provide an interesting analysis for a special case of k-m-CDS, where k = m + 1. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
