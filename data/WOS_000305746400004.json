This paper presents a personalized news consuming system, including the system architecture, consumption steps and key techniques. Then, focused on the core technique, i.e., video temporal segmentation, the automatic video temporal segmentation method is proposed, evaluated and compared with existing ones. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is computational efficient and gets higher correct detection rate. These properties make it a suitable choice for the personalized news consuming system.", "paper_title": "Automatic and fast temporal segmentation for personalized news consuming", "paper_id": "WOS:000305746400004"}
