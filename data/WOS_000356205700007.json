The aim of this paper is to obtain new inequalities involving the geometric-arithmetic index GA(1) and characterize graphs extremal with respect to them. In particular, we improve some known inequalities and we relate GA(1) to other well known topological indices.", "paper_title": "On the Geometric-Arithmetic Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000356205700007"}
