But in most cases, images are processed subject to blur degradations. The traditional blur invariant sets were constructed using geometric moments, central moments or complex moments. However, these non-orthogonal moments are generally considered as a disadvantage over orthogonal moments, such as Zernike, pseudo-Zemike, and Legendre moments, in decreasing information redundancy and sensitivity to noises. To solve this problem, this paper addresses a method for recognizing objects in an image in a way that is invariant to images' blur and rotation transformations to improve the robustness to noises. The proposed method is based on Zernike descriptors which are orthogonal over a unit circle, and is invariant to a central symmetric blur, such as linear motion or out-of-focus blur. We present a mathematical framework of obtaining the Zernike moments of blurred images, and a framework of deriving the combined blur and rotation invariants. The classification experimental results are presented to confirm the proposed method outperforms other similar ones in the presence of various blur-degraded and rotation-transformed images.", "paper_title": "Combined invariants to blur and rotation using Zernike moment descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000280711200006"}
