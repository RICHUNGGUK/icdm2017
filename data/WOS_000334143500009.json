Second, examine age-group differences in relation to the influence of intuitive, convenience and perceived usefulness on users' behavioural intention to use NFC SFS. Design/methodology/approach - Using design science research, NFC SES is developed and a survey of 52 users is conducted to evaluate NFC SES. Findings - There are age differences in individual behavioural intention to use NFC technology. Convenience appears to be the primary factor for the youths. The adult cohort, in contrast emphasizes intuitive and perceived usefulness as two significant determinants of their behavioural intention to use NFC SES. Practical implications - This study offers a fresh insight for mobile device manufacturer and application developers to focus their design efforts around three aspects (intuitive, convenience and usefulness) that are desired by different age-group users. Social implications - The development of NFC SES bridges the gap of cyber-physical spaces by enabling users to automate multiple heterogeneous digital appliances without imposing undue technological effort and inconvenience. NFC SES, operating through a touch-driven interaction between NFC smartphone and photo interface, is likely to be useful for many home users, especially for people with disabilities. Originality/value - NFC SES contributes in itself as a novel innovation. Additionally, studies on mobile technology largely focus on students as users, and often neglect the adult segment. This study entails a new model for evaluation of NFC technology, by uncovering age differences impacts on new technology adoption.", "paper_title": "Age-group differences in Near Field Communication smartphone", "paper_id": "WOS:000334143500009"}
