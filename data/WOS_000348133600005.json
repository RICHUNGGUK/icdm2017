On the one hand, the path computation element (PCE) is evolving toward the stateful architecture to effectively perform reoptimization on existing LSPs. On the other hand, superchannels are emerging as an innovative technology to aggregate optical signals achieving high data rates and improved spectral efficiency. In this paper, we show the first implementation of an active stateful PCE enabling elastic operations and hitless defragmentation of already provisioned LSPs. An online reoptimization algorithm is employed to possibly move existing connections to allow elastic operations. The algorithm effectiveness is assessed in terms of overall network utilization through simulations. The experimental assessment includes both data and control plane evaluation. To demonstrate the hitless defragmentation, a tunable 400 Gbps superchannel of 4 PM-DQPSK sub-carriers controlled by a single tunable laser is proposed.", "paper_title": "Active PCE demonstration performing elastic operations and hitless defragmentation in flexible grid optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348133600005"}
