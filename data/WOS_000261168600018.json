Sequence census functions facilitate a variety of functional genomics applications, including transcriptome mapping and pro. ling, as well as ChIP-Seq.", "paper_title": "Efficient mapping of Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequence data to a reference genome for functional genomic applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168600018"}
