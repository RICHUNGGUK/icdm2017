Of particular interest have been the so-called nested sums, where the harmonic sums and their generalizations appear as building blocks, originating for example, from the expansion of generalized hypergeometric functions around integer values of the parameters. In this paper we discuss the implementation of several algorithms to solve these sums by algebraic means, using the computer algebra system FORM.", "paper_title": "XSUMMER - Transcendental functions and symbolic summation in FORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000237186700004"}
