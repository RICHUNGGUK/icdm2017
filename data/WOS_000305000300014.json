Understanding how these evolve over time poses a challenge for existing visualization techniques originally developed for fixed network structures. We describe a method of incorporating the concept of aging into evolving networks, where nodes and edges store information related to the amount of local evolutionary change they have experienced. This property is used to generate visualizations that ensure stable substructures maintain relatively fixed spatial positions, allowing them to act as visual markers and providing context for evolutionary change elsewhere. By further supplementing these visualizations with color cues, the resultant animations enable a clearer portrayal of the underlying evolutionary process.", "paper_title": "Using Aging to Visually Uncover Evolutionary Processes on Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305000300014"}
