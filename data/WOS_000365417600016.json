Here a set A is called pdominant if there is a partial A-recursive function psi such that for every partial recursive function phi and almost every x in the domain of phi there is a y in the domain of psi with y <= x and psi(y) > phi(x). While there is a full Pi(0)(1)-class of nonrecursive sets where no set is pdominant, there is no Pi(0)(1) class containing only pdominant sets. No weakly 2-generic set is pdowinant while there are pdominant 1-generic sets below K. The halves of Chaitin's Omega are pdorninant. No set which is low for Martin-Lof random is pdominant. There is a low re. set which is pdominant and a high r.e. set which is not pdominant.", "paper_title": "PARTIAL FUNCTIONS AND DOMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600016"}
