While acquisition issues are outlined only briefly, this study focuses on the optimal organization of city models and efficient rendering techniques. We also address data optimization for real-time delivery. The methods under discussion are illustrated by examples taken from several existing web presentations developed by our students, especially from the Virtual Old Prague project. Although the principles are general, specific attention is paid to the use of standards developed by the Web3D Consortium.", "paper_title": "Web-based historical city walks: Advances and bottlenecks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238189100003"}
