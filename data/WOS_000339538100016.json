This representation enables us to use K - 1 binary functions to partition any images into K phases. Both continuous and discretized formulations will be treated. For the discrete model, we propose a new graph cut algorithm which is faster than the existing graph cut methods to obtain the exact global solution. In the continuous case, we further improve the segmentation accuracy using a number of techniques that are unique to the continuous segmentation models. With the convex relaxation and the dual method, the related continuous dual model is convex and we can mathematically show that the global minimization can be achieved. The corresponding continuous max-flow algorithms are easy and stable. Experimental results show that our model is very competitive to some existing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
