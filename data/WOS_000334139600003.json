It helps to reinforce the soil with passive inclusions that increase the overall shear strength of the soil slope and also restrains its displacements. The limit equilibrium method is usually employed to estimate factor of safety (FOS) of nailed slopes through either finite element or finite difference methods. Alternatively, soft computing methods such as multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) can also be used to predict the FOS for different soil properties. Among these methods, MGGP possesses the ability to evolve the model structure and its coefficients automatically. Although widely used, the MGGP method has the limitation of producing models that perform poorly on testing data. Therefore, in this study, an integrated structural risk minimisation-multigene genetic programming (SRM-MGGP) method is proposed to formulate the mathematical relationship between FOS and the six input variables of cohesion, frictional angle, nail inclination angle, nail length, slope height and slope angle of 3-D nailed slope. The results indicate that the SRM-MGGP model outperforms the other three models (MGGP, SVR and ANN) and is able to generalise the FOS satisfactorily for any given input variables conditions. This would be useful for engineers in their design calculations of slopes with different soil, slope and nail conditions based on certain limitations such as ignorance of effect of pore water pressure or overburden pressure.
