Effective multimedia retrieval systems are thus critical to access these datasets from the end-user perspective and in a scalable way. We are interested in repositories of image/text multimedia objects and we study multimodal information fusion techniques in the context of content-based multimedia information retrieval. We focus on graph-based methods, which have proven to provide state-of-the-art performances. We particularly examine two such methods: cross-media similarities and random-walk-based scores. From a theoretical viewpoint, we propose a unifying graph-based framework, which encompasses the two aforementioned approaches. Our proposal allows us to highlight the core features one should consider when using a graph-based technique for the combination of visual and textual information. We compare cross-media and random-walk-based results using three different real-world datasets. From a practical standpoint, our extended empirical analyses allow us to provide insights and guidelines about the use of graph-based methods for multimodal information fusion in content-based multimedia information retrieval.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Visual and Textual Information Fusion in CBMIR Using Graph-Based Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000351440200005"}
