A deterministic bit-fixing source extractor is a function E : {0, 1} n. {0, 1} m which on an arbitrary ( n, k)- bit-fixing source outputs m bits that are statistically close to uniform. Recently, Kamp and Zuckerman [ Proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2003, pp. 92 - 101] gave a construction of a deterministic bit fixing source extractor that extracts Omega(k(2)/n) bits and requires k > root n. In this paper we give constructions of deterministic bit-fixing source extractors that extract ( 1 - o( 1)) k bits whenever k > ( log n)(c) for some universal constant c > 0. Thus, our constructions extract almost all the randomness from bit-fixing sources and work even when k is small. For k >> root n the extracted bits have statistical distance 2(-n Omega(1)) from uniform, and for k <= root n the extracted bits have statistical distance k(-Omega(1)) from uniform. Our technique gives a general method to transform deterministic bit-fixing source extractors that extract few bits into extractors which extract almost all the bits.", "paper_title": "Deterministic extractors for bit-fixing sources by obtaining an independent seed", "paper_id": "WOS:000243279900006"}
