We consider here the problem of scheduling the rigs over a time horizon in order to minimize the total oil loss due to the idle production states. Three mixed integer linear models are proposed. The first one improves an existing scheduling-based formulation. The second one uses an open vehicle routing approach and the third one is an extended model for which a column generation strategy is developed. Several improvements are presented as well as two heuristics coupled with column generation. To our knowledge, the first optimal values for medium-size instances of the problem are presented in this paper. The results show the potential of the column generation and its interest in a practical context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
