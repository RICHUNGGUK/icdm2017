Previously, we had designed a mixed analog-digital integrated vision system for collision detection inspired by a locust neuronal circuit model. The response of the system was, however, susceptible to the luminance of approaching objects and the vibratory self-motion of a car when it was installed on a miniature mobile car. In the present study, we developed a new collision detection algorithm to overcome these problems based on robust image-motion detection and applied the algorithm to control a miniature mobile car.
