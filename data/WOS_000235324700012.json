The influence of collapse time to of local failure of a panel is presented. Integrity analyses of a twelve-storey, three-bay precast panel shear wall in different conditions with respect to earthquakes and progressive collapse are performed focusing on the shear ductility demands of the mechanical connectors in the vertical joints. The whole progressive collapse processes of the panel wall in various conditions are also simulated. Results indicate that if the design of this precast panel shear wall satisfies the seismic requirements, it will automatically meet the demands of shear ductility of connectors in vertical joints and shear slip in horizontal joints with respect to progressive collapse without earthquakes.
