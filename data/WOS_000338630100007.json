The motivation for this work is to obtain a truly optimal higher-order finite element mesh that can be used to compare the quality of automatic adaptive algorithms. Minimized is the approximation error in a global norm. Optimization variables include the number of elements, positions of nodes, and polynomial degrees of elements. Optimization methods and software that we use are described, and numerical results are presented.", "paper_title": "On optimal node and polynomial degree distribution in one-dimensional hp-FEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100007"}
