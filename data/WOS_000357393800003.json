It proposes a model of KI as a mediator between two leadership styles (the transformational and transactional leadership styles). The study also aims to expose the most relevant leadership styles to be practiced by leaders when managing the ES post-implementation stage. Design/methodology/approach - Valid data were collected from 263 survey respondents in Malaysian companies. The authors employed structural equation modelling and used the path modelling approach to investigate the underlying relationships between the variables. The authors then tested the mediating effects of KI by using the bootstrapping procedures proposed by Preacher and Hayes, which suits the path analysis method. Findings - The results provide empirical evidence on the relationships between the variables and on the role of KI mechanisms as a mediator between leadership styles and ES success, especially in the ES post-implementation phase. Both leadership styles have to be practiced by leaders while managing an ES. Research limitations/implications - Future research can investigate the role of KI mechanisms as moderators between both leadership styles. The study can also be expanded by looking in-depth at other leadership styles. Practical implications - This paper is useful for management researchers and as a guide to management practice for business managers. Originality/value - This paper proposes a model that examines the vitality of KI effect in ES post-implementation stage by different leadership styles. The results expose the importance of leaders' adoption of KI mechanisms and call for manager attention to the importance of using the right leadership styles when managing ES.", "paper_title": "The mediating role of knowledge integration in effect of leadership styles on enterprise systems success The post-implementation stage", "paper_id": "WOS:000357393800003"}
