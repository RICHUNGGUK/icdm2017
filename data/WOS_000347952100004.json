A global solution is guaranteed if the data term satisfies a certain condition. We give a theoretical analysis of the condition for type of data terms, such as in the Chan-Vese model and Mumford Shah model for . We show experimentally that the condition tends to hold in practice for and also holds in many cases for more advanced data terms. If the condition is violated, convex and submodular relaxations are proposed which are not guaranteed to produce exact solutions, but tend to do so in practice. We also build up simple convex relaxations for some other four region segmentation models, including Potts' model. Algorithms are proposed which are very efficient compared to related work due to the simple and compact formulations.", "paper_title": "Efficient Global Minimization Methods for Image Segmentation Models with Four Regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000347952100004"}
