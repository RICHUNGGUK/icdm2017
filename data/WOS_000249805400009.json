This paper develops new quantitative techniques for achieving the same results using only end-host measures. We develop new methods of computing bottleneck link characteristics, a new technique for sharing bandwidth fairly with Reno flows, and a new approach for rapidly converging to bandwidth share. A new transport protocol, TCP-Madison, that employs the new bandwidth sharing techniques is also defined in the paper. Experiments comparing TCP-Madison with FAST TCP, BIC-TCP and TCP-Reno over hundreds of PlanetLab and other live Internet paths show that the new protocol achieves the stated bandwidth sharing properties, is easily configured for near-optimal performance over all paths, and significantly outperforms the previous protocols.
