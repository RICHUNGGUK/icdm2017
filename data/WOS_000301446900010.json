A potential problem of the widely used lattice-based confidence estimation, however, is that the confidence scores are treated uniformly for all search terms, regardless of how much they may differ in terms of phonetic or linguistic properties. This problem is particularly evident for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms which tend to exhibit high intra-term diversity. To address the impact of term diversity on confidence measures, we propose in this work a term-dependent normalisation technique which compensates for term diversity in confidence estimation. We first derive an evaluation-metric-oriented normalisation that optimises the evaluation metric by compensating for the diverse occurrence rates among terms, and then propose a linear bias compensation and a discriminative compensation to deal with the bias problem that is inherent in lattice-based confidence measurement and from which the Term Specific Threshold (TST) approach suffers. We tested the proposed technique on speech data from the multi-party meeting domain with two state-of-the-art STD systems based on phonemes and words respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the confidence normalisation approach leads to a significant performance improvement in STD, particularly for OOV terms with phoneme-based systems.", "paper_title": "Term-Dependent Confidence Normalisation for Out-of-Vocabulary Spoken Term Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000301446900010"}
