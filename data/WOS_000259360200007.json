In this paper, we present several software and hardware techniques in order to reduce the computational cost of the generation of random single lines by using bundles of parallel lines. The bundle of parallel lines is simulated with a general purpose polygon filling algorithm, like the painter's algorithm. We also present two graphics hardware implementations. The first approach uses two depth buffers in order to represent stochastically a bundle of parallel global lines. The second one uses multiple depth buffers and the aim is to exploit coherence between projection planes for each iteration. All algorithms were implemented with the multipath method.", "paper_title": "Improving multipath radiosity with bundles of parallel lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000259360200007"}
