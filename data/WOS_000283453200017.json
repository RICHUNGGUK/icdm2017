However, the reduced testability caused by core-based design strategy also aggravates the difficulty in applying on-chip at-speed testing. Although previous works were able to successfully increase the quality of the at-speed testing, the diversity of on-chip clock control schemes from different components may complicate the test integration, increasing the test costs. Therefore, to accelerate the time-to-market and the time-to-volume, the development of a plug-and-play at-speed testing based on a well-defined test interface has become increasingly urgent. In this paper, a fast test integration approach for multi-clock-domain at-speed testing based on IEEE Standard 1500 is proposed. The proposed framework has been successfully integrated into an IEEE 1500-wrapped ultrawide-band design and a simple SoC design. Experiment results also confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fast Test Integration: Toward Plug-and-Play at-Speed Testing of Multiple Clock Domains Based on IEEE Standard 1500", "paper_id": "WOS:000283453200017"}
