Karyotyping is a procedure to study an individual's chromosome make-up. It is time consuming to train students and clinical technologists to recognize patterns of G-banded chromosomes because of the dynamic nature of G-band resolutions in different metaphase spreads. High resolution G-bands are desirable because they provide detailed information for structural analysis. However, it is challenging to identify chromosomes at higher resolution levels even for many cytogenetics technologists. In response to the need for training students to identify human chromosomes at variable G-band resolutions, we present in this paper an advanced version of virtual reality (VR)-based interactive karyotyping program capable of manipulating G-band resolutions for human cytogenetics education. The program can generate different metaphase spreads ranging from short and well separate chromosomes at low G-band resolutions to long, curved, and overlapped chromosomes at high G-band resolutions. Other features include a scoring system, helping strategies, and the progress reports. The traditional \"cut and paste\" karyotyping method for chromosome separation is incorporated in the software. This method is compared with the \"simple clicking\" method which is based on an edge detection technique for outlining each chromosome. The comprehensive program is suitable for in-depth training of advanced students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
