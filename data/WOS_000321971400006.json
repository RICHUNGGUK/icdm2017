Feature structure units from the example model are extracted, along with their constraints, through structure analysis, to create a new model using an inference method based on Petri net. Our method has two main advantages: first, 3D model pieces are delineated as the feature structure units and Petri net is used to record their shape features and their constraints in order to outline the model, including extending and deforming operations; second, a construction space generating algorithm is presented to convert the curve drawn by the user into local shape controlling parameters, and the free form deformation (FFD) algorithm is used in the inference process to deform the feature structure units. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can create large-scale complex scenes or models and allow users to effectively control the model result.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of 3D models by Petri net", "paper_id": "WOS:000321971400006"}
