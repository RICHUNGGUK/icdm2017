While the underling communication and interaction systems facilitate knowledge workers to carry out the enterprise mission and furnish service to the society, there are many other aspects that rather have adverse effects on the productivity of an enterprise and interruption of knowledge workers, which pose a serious scientific challenge. In this paper, we briefly discuss certain challenging aspects of knowledge work and communication processes in networked enterprises that require more profound scientific attention in networked enterprises. This paper introduces the problem, identifies some specific research challenges, and then briefly discusses emerging research that addresses some of these challenges.", "paper_title": "Knowledge work and communication challenges in networked enterprises", "paper_id": "WOS:000297198700001"}
