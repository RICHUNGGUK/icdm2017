Dynamic speed scaling is one of the major techniques to manage power so as to maintain safe temperature levels. As example, we adopt a reactive speed control technique in our work. We design an extended busy-period analysis methodology to perform schedulability analysis for general task arrivals under reactive speed control with First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Static-Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) scheduling. As a special case, we obtain a closed-form formula for the worst-case response time of jobs under the leaky-bucket task arrival model. Our data show how reactive speed control can decrease the worst-case response time of tasks in comparison with any constant-speed scheme.", "paper_title": "Schedulability analysis in hard real-time systems under thermal constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000281902000002"}
