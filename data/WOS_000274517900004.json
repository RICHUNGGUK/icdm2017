Design/methodology/approach - The elaborated \"unaided\" software consists of two main parts: optimization solver and numerical model of the actuator. Genetic algorithm has been used for optimization. The coupled field-circuit-mechanical model for the simulation of the system dynamics has been applied. Different optimization problems have been considered, The shape of the steady-state force-displacement actuator characteristic has been imposed and its deviation has been minimised. Next, the total operation time of the actuator without feedback, and the setup time of the actuator with feedback are minimised. Finally, required trajectory of movement has been imposed and trajectory error is minimised. Findings - The elaborated algorithm and the computer code can be an effective tool for field-circuit simulation of the dynamics of an electromagnetic linear actuator that operates in an automatic control system. It enables optimal design of the electromechanical system in respect to its dynamic properties. Originality/value - The elaborated algorithm and the computer code presented in this paper can be an effective tool for the field-circuit simulation of the dynamics of an electromagnetic linear actuator that operates in an automation control system.", "paper_title": "Optimization of the electromechanical systems on the basis of coupled field-circuit approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900004"}
