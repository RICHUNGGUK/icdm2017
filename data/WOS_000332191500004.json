It is the size of the smallest window such that, wherever its position on w, all length n subwords of w will appear at least once inside that window. The recurrence quotient rho(w) of w, defined as lim sup Rw(n)/n, is useful for studying the growth rate of R-w(n). It is known that if w is periodic, then rho(w) = 1, while if w is not, then rho(w) >= 3. A long standing conjecture from Rauzy states that the latter can be improved to rho(w) >= 5+root 5/2 similar to 3.618, this bound being true for each Sturmian word and being reached by the Fibonacci word. In this paper, we study in particular the spectrum of values taken by the recurrence quotients of infinite partial words, which are sequences that may have some undefined positions. In this case, we determine exactly the spectrum of values, which turns out to be 1, every real number greater than or equal to 2, and infinity. More precisely, if an infinite partial word w is \"ultimately factor periodic\", then rho(w)= 1, while if w is not, then rho(w) >= 2, and we give constructions of infinite partial words achieving each value.
