There has been a recent renewal of interest on this topic, due to the emergence of new structures (hexagonal and cubic) extending the square. They apply to a large variety of representation frameworks, all based on the notions of sets and relations. After a reminder about the structures of opposition, and an introduction to their gradual extensions (exemplified on fuzzy sets), the paper more particularly studies fuzzy rough sets and rough fuzzy sets in the setting of gradual structures of opposition.", "paper_title": "Structures of Opposition in Fuzzy Rough Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000367316400002"}
