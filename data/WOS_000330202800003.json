To this end, hierarchical architectures provide a solution to this scalability problem. In this paper, we address the problem of design and optimization of a tiered wireless access network that exploits free space optical (FSO) communications. The lower tier consists of mesh routers that are clustered based on traffic demands and delay requirements. The cluster heads are equipped with wireless optical transceivers and form the upper tier FSO network. For topology design and optimization, we first presents plane sweeping and clustering (PSC) algorithm aiming to minimize the total number of clusters. PSC sweeps the network area and captures cluster members under delay and traffic load constraints. For the upper tier FSO network, we present an algebraic connectivity-based formulation for topology optimization. We then develop a greedy edge-appending (GEA) algorithm, as well as its distributed version, that iteratively inserts edges to maximize algebraic connectivity. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and evaluated via simulations, and are shown to be highly effective as compared to the performance bounds derived in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
