Currently, due to limited resources, not all COPD patients can be trained by an expert supervisor. Objectives: The objective of our research is to construct a decision support system (DSS) which observes and controls physical ergometer training sessions of COPD patients. Methods: A systematic literature review and expert interviews were carried out to build up the knowledge base for the DSS. Results: Nine production rules were established and standardized by Drools and Arden Syntax. The developed software autonomously controls training sessions on a bicycle ergometer on the basis of vital signs data. Thus it offers a new way for the rehabilitation of COPD patients. Conclusion: Evaluation with nine healthy subjects in a laboratory environment has confirmed its correct function, but the effects of its use for COPD patients' rehabilitation an their quality of life have to be investigated in a further study.", "paper_title": "Decision Support for Teletraining of COPD Patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000274131600013"}
