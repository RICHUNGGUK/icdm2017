Our experiment was conducted by means of a 3D virtual environment to test the effect of two properties of visibility conditions: the overlapping between the visual fields of two landmarks and the topological depth (length of visual chain) between these visual fields. The results show that a high degree of overlapping between the visual fields of an origin and a target landmark helps people perform wayfinding tasks, particularly in cases where the length of the visual chain is short (one-step topological depth).
