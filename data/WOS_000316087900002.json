If each point's uncertainty is described as a probability distribution over a discrete set of locations, we improve the best known exact solution. We also suggest why we believe our solution might be optimal. Next, we describe simple, near-linear time approximation algorithms for computing the probability of each point lying on the skyline. In addition, some of our methods can be adapted to construct data structures that can efficiently determine the probability of a query point lying on the skyline.", "paper_title": "(Approximate) Uncertain Skylines", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087900002"}
