However, most structures are conical to some degree. Due to the lack of software capable of accurately estimating the best fit cone from a set of oriented data, we developed a Mathematica application capable of (1) plotting oriented data (lines and planes) on an equal area stereonet, (2) calculating the orientation matrix, the distribution shape and intensity parameters, (3) plotting the eigenvectors and (4) estimating and plotting the best fit cone, a small circle. We present both synthetic and natural data demonstrating its robustness and accuracy calculating the best fit cone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
