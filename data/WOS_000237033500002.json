However, a misbehaving receiver can ignore the group subscription rules and inflate its subscription to acquire unfairly high throughput. In this paper, we present the first solution for the problem of inflated subscription. Our design guards access to multicast groups with dynamic keys and consists of two independent components: DELTA (Distribution of ELigibility To Access)-a novel method for in-band distribution of group keys to receivers that are eligible to access the groups according to the congestion control protocol, and SIGMA (Secure Internet Group Management Architecture)-a generic architecture for key-based group access at edge routers. We apply DELTA and SIGMA to derive robust versions of prominent RLM and FLID-DL protocols.", "paper_title": "Design of multicast protocols robust against inflated subscription", "paper_id": "WOS:000237033500002"}
