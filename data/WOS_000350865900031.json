The duality of these F and G systems is obtained, and the proofs are given. The generalized reliability formulae for the systems are obtained by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach for statistically independent and Markov-dependent cases. Some miscellaneous results on the reliability of these systems and numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results obtained in the paper.", "paper_title": "m-Consecutive-k, l-Out-of-n Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350865900031"}
