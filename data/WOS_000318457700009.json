Local stability for the trivial equilibrium is analyzed for various system parameters. Stability switches and fold-Hopf bifurcations are found to occur in this model as progressive increasing of coupling delay values. Fold-Hopf bifurcations are completely analyzed in the parameter space of the coupling delay and the connection weight by employing the extended perturbation-incremental scheme. Various dynamical behaviors are qualitatively classified in the neighbor of fold-Hopf bifurcation point and bifurcating periodic solutions are expressed analytically in an approximate form. The validity of the results is shown by their consistency with the numerical simulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
