More recently, research works focused on the use of variable sampling intervals (VSIs), where the lengths of the sampling intervals are varied according to the process quality. A short sampling interval is considered when the process quality indicates a possible out-of-control situation while a long sampling interval is considered, otherwise. In this paper, the VSI run sum (RS) (X) over bar chart is proposed with its optimal scores and parameters determined using an optimization technique to minimize the out-of-control average time to signal (ATS) or the adjusted average time to signal (AATS). A Markov-chain method is used to evaluate both the ATS and AATS of the proposed chart, for the zero and steady state cases, respectively. Results show that the VSI RS (X) over bar chart is considerably more efficient than the basic RS (X) over bar chart. The VSI RS (X) over bar chart performs generally well compared with other competing charts, such as the standard (X) over bar, synthetic (X) over bar, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) (X) over bar, VSI (X) over bar and VSI EWMA (X) over bar charts. The sensitivity of the VSI RS (X) over bar chart can be enhanced further by adding more scoring regions or a head-start feature. An illustrative example is presented to explain the implementation of the proposed VSI RS (X) over bar chart. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
