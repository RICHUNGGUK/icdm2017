This method uses the maximum electron densities at the critical points of two N-O bonds of nitro groups (rho(max)), and it is more simple and faster than the existing methods and applicable to bigger systems. The correlations between the rho(max) and total energy (E), bond lengths (RC-NO2, RN-NO2 and RO-NO2), bond dissociation energy (BDE), and impact sensitivity (h(50)) reveal that the molecular stability, which can be reflected by E, R, BDE and h(50), generally decreases with the increasing rho(max). The compound with the larger rho(max) is less stable. For the nitrating reaction, the smaller rho(max) of the product generally implies the easier and faster reaction and the higher occurrence ratio of the product. Therefore, rho(max) can be applied to predict the stability of nitro compounds and the easiness of the nitrating reaction.", "paper_title": "A simple, fast and convenient new method for predicting the stability of nitro compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000352821800007"}
