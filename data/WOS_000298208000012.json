These sensors are placed in close proximity to the DUT on the same substrate without being electrically connected to it. Instead, they monitor it by virtue of being subjected to the same process variations. The authors also describe other types of sensors they have studied, including DC probes, an envelope detector, and a current sensor.", "paper_title": "RF Front-End Test Using Built-in Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000298208000012"}
