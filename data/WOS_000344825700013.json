The Bond Graph model, the structural approach, is first deduced from the physical system, which in turn produces a direct correspondence between the system and its model. The control structure is then easily deduced from the Energetic Macroscopic Representation, the functional approach, of the vehicle using a systematic procedure. Simulation results are provided in order to analyze the performance of the closed-loop system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
