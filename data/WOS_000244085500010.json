Next-generation sensor nodes will likely operate without batteries, harvesting energy instead from ambient sources. To provide cryptographic functions for ubiquitous computing devices, designers must make power consumption their first priority. The challenge of future research is to find an algorithm that has at its core a simple, scalable primitive that could serve as a common element for secret and public-key functions.", "paper_title": "Cryptography on a speck of dust", "paper_id": "WOS:000244085500010"}
