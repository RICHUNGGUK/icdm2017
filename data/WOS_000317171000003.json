A program was developed to calculate the three-stage response mode and fire resistance of such slabs. Unlike tests and past studies, this program verified the developed constitutive model of concrete and the necessity of including transient strain in the model. The parametric study included in this research further specified the influence of concrete's thermal strain and steel's creep strain on the behavior of the slab during fires. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
