The proposed watermark is engraved on the refinement bits of SPIHT. By jointly considering watermarking and compression, the proposed quantization-based watermark suffers less degradation from the host interference and lossy compression. Watermark verification can be realized through a low-complexity hard-decision detector without host information. We further present a repetition-code scheme to enhance the robustness performance of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more resilient to non-geometric attacks than the transform-domain spread-spectrum methods.", "paper_title": "A Compressed-Domain Image Watermarking Scheme with the SPIHT Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000282396700012"}
