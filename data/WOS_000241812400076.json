In this paper we propose a basic learning scenario according to the TL paradigm. With this scenario as gnomon, we elaborate the technical issues that are raised for supporting it and we propose a flexible novel method for defining various aspects of the group knowledge.", "paper_title": "Trialogical E-learning and emergent knowledge artifacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400076"}
