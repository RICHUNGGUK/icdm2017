In both cases, the average degree is c. The case r, k = 2 was analyzed in Botelho et al. (2007) [4] but the general case r >= 3, k >= 2 is still open. Besides the proof for the general case, we have also provided a simpler proof for the case r, k = 2. This problem was provided without a proof (but with strong experimental evidence) in the analysis of the algorithm presented in Botelho et al. (2007) pi. This algorithm constructs a family of minimal perfect hash functions based on random r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs with an empty k-core subgraph, for k >= 2. For an input key set S with m keys, the family of minimal perfect hash functions generated by the algorithm can be stored in O(m) bits, where the hidden constant is within a factor of two from the information theoretical lower bound.
