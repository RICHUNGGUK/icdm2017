HTN planning has been adopted to handle the OWL-S Web service composition problem. However, existing composition methods based on HTN planning have not considered the choice of decompositions available to a problem, which can lead to a variety of valid solutions. In this paper, the authors propose a model of combining a Markov decision process model and HTN planning to address Web services composition. In the model, HTN planning is enhanced to decompose a task in multiple ways and find more than one plan, taking into account both functional and non-functional properties. Furthermore, an evaluation method to choose the optimal plan and experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach works effectively. The paper extends previous work by refining a number of aspects of the approach and applying it to a realistic case study.", "paper_title": "Using Markov Decision Process Model with Logic Scoring of Preference Model to Optimize HTN Web Services Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797500003"}
