Let denote the feasible region for the linear constraints. We first show that replacing the quadratic objective and constraint functions with their convex lower envelopes on is dominated by an alternative methodology based on convexifying the range of the quadratic form for . We next show that the use of \"BB\" underestimators as computable estimates of convex lower envelopes is dominated by a relaxation of the convex hull of the quadratic form that imposes semidefiniteness and linear constraints on diagonal terms.
