In this paper, we consider decentralized optimal protection strategies when a virus is propagating over a network through an SIS epidemic process. We assume that each node in the network can fully protect itself from infection at a constant cost, or the node can use recovery software, once it is infected. We model our system using a game-theoretic framework and find pure, mixed equilibria, and the Price of Anarchy in several network topologies. Further, we propose a decentralized algorithm and an iterative procedure to compute a pure equilibrium in the general case of a multiple communities network. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and give numerical illustrations of all our results.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Protection Strategies Against SIS Epidemics in Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367145800008"}
