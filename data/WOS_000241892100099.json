Combined with static and dynamic flame features, a flame detection algorithm based on multi-feature fusion is designed to quickly recognize fire flame using the theory of the degree of belief. The experiments show that the processing rate of the algorithm is as high as 25 frames/s without any manual adjustments. In complex situations, the algorithm remains with stronger anti-jamming ability and higher accuracy, for example, the suspected probability of street lamps and automotive lamps is lower than 10%. From comparing results, the video-based detection algorithm has the good capabilities.", "paper_title": "A flame detection algorithm based on video multi-feature fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100099"}
