Our method is robust to noisy outlier data and the number of clusters can be easily determined. The unsupervised method extracts clusters sequentially in the order of the majority of clusters. We derive from the unsupervised algorithm a semi-supervised one which can extract any cluster irrespective of its majority. The performance of those methods is exemplified with synthetic toy data and real image data.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised and semi-supervised extraction of clusters from hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900043"}
