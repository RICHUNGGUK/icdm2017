The key point of this method is to construct multiple-parameter homotopy equation. By adjusting the parameters, we obtain an optimal approximate solution. The method is applied to solve the Benny equation and the Ito equation. An error estimate between exact solution and approximate analytical solution of equations is given and the efficiency of the EHPM is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
