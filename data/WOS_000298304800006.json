In this paper, we propose a novel low-power FPGA architecture based on coarse-grained power gating to reduce power consumption. The new placement algorithm and routing resource graph for sleep regions is also presented. After enhancing the CAD framework, a detailed discussion is given under different region size supported by the new FPGA architecture. As a result, our proposed FPGA architecture combined with the new placement and routing algorithm can reduce 19.4% in the total power consumption compared with the traditional FPGA. By using our proposed method, FPGA is promising to be widely applied to portable devices.", "paper_title": "Low Power Placement and Routing for the Coarse-Grained Power Gating FPGA Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800006"}
