As fixed measuring stations are inflexible, cost-intensive, and limited to monitoring a specific spot, we developed a distributed environmental monitoring network called Environmental Monitoring in Metropolitan Areas (EMMA). This architecture is based on the delay tolerant networking approach and can be integrated into existing Public Transportation Networks (PTNs). Buses or other vehicles can be equipped with sensor nodes that gather data and forward messages. In order to evaluate the basic ideas of this project we performed a series of real-world experiments. Besides analyzing the behavior of 802.11-based Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) between moving vehicles in a controlled environment, we also evaluated the communication performance in urban environments. Moreover, we examined the qualification of a Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) implementation for spreading measurement results throughout the network. The suitability of EMMA's architecture has been successfully demonstrated by these experiments.
