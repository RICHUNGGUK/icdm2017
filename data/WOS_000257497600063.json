Model-based control of bioprocesses is a difficult task due to the challenges associated with bioprocess modelling and the lack of on-line measurements. This paper aimes designing some feeding control approaches in fed-batch cultivation of high cell density E.coli producing recombinant proteins. For this purpose first a neural network self-tuning PI controller is designed and some advantages and disadvantages of this controller are denoted. Then an optimal controller is suggested for the process and a feedback linearizing controller is used afterwards in order to make optimal controller robust against disturbances and uncertainties. The introduced controller is capable of maintaining the proper specific growth rate for attaining the maximum amount of biomass and recombinant protein production efficiency.", "paper_title": "Designing appropriate schemes for the control of fed-batch cultivation of recombinant E.coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600063"}
