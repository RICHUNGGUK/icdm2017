SI circuits are well suited for these applications since the dilation constant across different scales of the transform can be implemented, and controlled by both the aspect-ratio of the transistors and the clock frequency. The quality of such implementation depends on the accuracy of the corresponding wavelet approximation. First, an optimized procedure based on differential evolution algorithm (DE) is applied to approximate the transfer function of a linear steady-state system whose impulse response is the required wavelet. The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of approximation wavelets. Next, the approximation of time-domain wavelet function is implemented by the SI analog filters. Finally, the design of the complete SI filter based on first-order and biquad section as main building block is detailed. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach to analog WT implementation.", "paper_title": "Analog VLSI implementation of wavelet transform using switched-current circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400014"}
