We use the special characteristics of these works in order to both restrict the strategies and benefit from those properties. We propose an algorithm which presents good results in the pieces we have worked. Due to the diversity of the period and the amount of artists who made it possible, the algorithms are too general even in this context. This is a first approach to the problem, in which we have assumed very common and shared features for the works of art. The flexibility of the algorithm, and the freedom to choose some parameters make it possible to adapt the problem to the knowledge that restorators in charge may have about a particular work.", "paper_title": "Mathematical models for restoration of baroque paintings", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100003"}
