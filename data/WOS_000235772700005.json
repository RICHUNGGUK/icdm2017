This paper presents the idea and implementation of the object-oriented programming approach for the boundary clement method in two-dimensional heat transfer analysis. The advantages of the object-oriented programming for developing the complicated boundary element analysis program are demonstrated by examples for two different types of partial differential equations: the Laplace equation and the diffusion equation. Based on the object-oriented programming approach together with the efficient coding in C+ +. computer programs for the above problems are systematic, brief and readable. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
