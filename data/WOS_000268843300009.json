Such motifs, called irredundant motifs, are able to succinctly represent all of the other motifs occurring in the same array within reasonable time and space bounds. In previous work irredundant motifs were extracted from 2D arrays in O(N-2 log(2) nlog logn) and O(N-3) time, where N is the size of the 2D input array and n is its largest dimension. In this paper, we present an algorithm to extract irredundant motifs from 2D arrays that is quadratic in the size of the input. The input is defined on a binary alphabet. It is shown that the algorithm is optimal and practically faster than the previous ones. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
