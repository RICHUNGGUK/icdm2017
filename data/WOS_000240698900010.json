In such systems, a response is sent along the same path that carried the incoming query message. To guarantee the anonymity of the requestor, no requestor information is included in the response message, and each node in the query's incoming path only knows its direct neighbors who sent the query request to it. This mechanism introduces response loss when any one node or connection in the path fails, which is a common occurrence in the P2P system due to its dynamic feature. In this paper, we address the response loss problem and show that peers' oscillation can cause up to a 35 percent response loss in an unstructured P2P system. We also present three techniques to alleviate this problem: the redundant response delivery (RRD) scheme as a proactive approach, the adaptive response delivery (ARD) scheme as a reactive approach, and the extended adaptive response delivery scheme to render ARD to function in an unstructured P2P system with limited or no flooding-based search mechanism. We have evaluated our techniques in a large-scale network simulation. With limited traffic overhead, all three techniques reduce response loss rate by more than 65 percent and are fully distributed. We have designed our techniques to be simple to develop and implement in existing P2P systems.", "paper_title": "Improving query response delivery quality in peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240698900010"}
