We have designed a hierarchical simulation platform for coking production in coke ovens for experiments and the validation of the methods used. To handle problems in processing and obtain the comprehensive production targets, the simulation platform provides reliable, easy-to-use conditions for coking production research, which has the functions of simulating processes, examining methods for experiments, monitoring production status and coordinating optimization. To implement these functions, the platform has a three-layer structure and flexible communication interfaces. Results of experiments have demonstrated the simulation platform's effectiveness and feasibility.", "paper_title": "A Hierarchical Experimental Simulation Platform of Coking Production", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200009"}
