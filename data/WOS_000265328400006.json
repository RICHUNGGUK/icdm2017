It enables its users to specify their needs and then select from suitable product providers, who in turn benefit from potential customers with refined needs. This article makes both a theoretical and applied contribution to the Information Systems literature. It develops an amended version of the Porter value chain, which it terms the click chain, as a theoretical framework which is then used to analyse Moneynet. This framework analyses how Moneynet creates value and in doing so identifies key implications for comparison websites and product providers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
