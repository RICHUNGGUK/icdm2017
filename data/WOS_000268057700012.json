The control of these prostheses can be made using myoelectric signals taken from surface electrodes. Finger motions discrimination is the key problem in this study. Thus the emphasis, in the proposed work, is put on myoelectric signal processing approaches. The EMG signals classification system was established using the linear neural network. The experimental results show a promising performance in classification of motions based on biosignal patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
