It is shown that, for an unbounded embedding of the specified class, the wavefield is, in any 3-rectangular computational solution domain, reproduced exactly. The spurious reflection caused by a (computationally necessary) truncation of the embedding is analyzed as a function of layer thicknesses and their coordinate stretching relaxation functions. A time-domain uniqueness proof for the solution to the truncated embedding problem is provided and a numerical illustration is given for a test case with known analytical solution. For such cases, the pure space-time discretization errors can be separated from the disturbance caused by the spurious reflection. For the second-order coordinate stretched wave equation an equivalent system of first-order equations is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
