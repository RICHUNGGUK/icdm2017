We propose new update rules for the aforementioned divergence that are based on multiplicative update rules. The proposed algorithms are built on solid theoretical foundations that guarantee that the limit point of the iterative algorithm corresponds to a stationary solution of the optimization procedure. Moreover, we study the convergence properties of the optimization procedure and we present generalized pythagorean rules. Furthermore, we provide clear probabilistic interpretations of these algorithms. Finally, we discuss the connections between generalized Probabilistic Tensor Latent Variable Models (PTLVM) and NTF, proposing in that way algorithms for PTLVM for arbitrary multivariate probabilistic mass functions.", "paper_title": "Nonnegative tensor factorization as an alternative Csiszar-Tusnady procedure: algorithms, convergence, probabilistic interpretations and novel probabilistic tensor latent variable analysis algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000288556900005"}
