In particular, the presence of cracks is a cardinal aspect to be considered. This article presents a solution based on an instrumented vehicle equipped with an imaging system, two Inertial Profilers, a Differential Global Positioning System, and a webcam. Information about the state of the road is acquired at normal road speed. A method based on the use of Gabor filters is used to detect the longitudinal and transverse cracks. The methodologies used to create Gabor filter banks and the use of the filtered images as descriptors for subsequent classifiers are discussed in detail. Three different methodologies for setting the threshold of the classifiers are also evaluated. Finally, an AdaBoost algorithm is used for selecting and combining the classifiers, thus improving the results provided by a single classifier. A large database has been acquired and used to train and test the proposed system and methods, and suitable results have been obtained in comparison with other reference works.", "paper_title": "Road Crack Detection Using Visual Features Extracted by Gabor Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000334157400003"}
