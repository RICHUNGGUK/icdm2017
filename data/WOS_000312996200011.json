A complete overview is presented, describing the ontologies designed to share models in a common repository, the workflow template used to integrate simulators, and the tools and strategies used to exploit computing and storage resources. Simulation results obtained in four image modalities and with different models show that VIP is versatile and robust enough to support large simulations. The platform currently has 200 registered users who consumed 33 years of CPU time in 2011.", "paper_title": "A Virtual Imaging Platform for Multi-Modality Medical Image Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000312996200011"}
