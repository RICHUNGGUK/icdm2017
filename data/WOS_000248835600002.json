We present an approach to it that uses attention feedback to an occluded object to obtain its correct recognition. Various simulations are performed using a hierarchical visual attention feedback system, based on contrast gain (which we discuss as to its relation to possible hallucinations that could be caused by feedback). We then discuss implications of our results for object representations per se.", "paper_title": "Occlusion, attention and object representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000248835600002"}
