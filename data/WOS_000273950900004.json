The present study enhances our understanding of the determinants of a firm's technological scope strategy. After reviewing the related literatures, we proposed and empirically tested a conceptual model from the perspective of the firm's environment, strategic orientation, and resources. The results suggest that the coherence between technological scope decisions and proposed model is significantly related to performance.", "paper_title": "Technological scope: diversified or specialized", "paper_id": "WOS:000273950900004"}
