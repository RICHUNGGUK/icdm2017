Financial market participants have shown an increasing interest in prediction intervals as measures Of uncertainty. Furthermore, accurate predictions of volatilities are critical for many financial models. The advantages of the proposed method are that it allows incorporation of parameter uncertainty and does not rely on distributional assumptions. The finite sample properties are analyzed by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the technique is applied to the Madrid Stock Market index, IBEX-35. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
