Clustering is an important research problem for MANETs because it enables efficient utilization of resources, and must strike a delicate balance between battery energy, mobility, node degree, etc. In this paper, we consider the typical communication workload of every mobile node as well as the additional communication workload of clusterheads in MANET clustering. We propose an algorithm that optimizes communication workload, power consumption, clusterhead lifetime, and node degree. Experiment results show that our clustering approach produces effectively balanced clusters over a diverse set of random scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
