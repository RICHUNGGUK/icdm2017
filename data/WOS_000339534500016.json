This theoretical approach was applied to predict many kinds of reactions of metal ions and organic compounds in aqueous solutions - such as, hydration, diffusion, deprotonation, precipitation, redox reaction, and complexation; onto solid surfaces - such as, adsorption, ion exchange reaction, and sorption by organoclay; and for biological activity - such as, median effective concentrations measured from Photobacterium phosphoreum and Chlorella vulgaris. Results of analysis revealed that the quantum four-element model - which is constructed on the basis of 1) electronic chemical potential -mu(+) and mu(-) (electron flow), 2) condensed local softness s(max)(+) and s(max)(-) (polarization), 3) atomic partial charge rho(+)(max(H)) and -rho(-)(max) (electrostatic interaction), and 4) the inverse of apolar surface area 1/APSA (hydrophilic interaction) - provides a general meaning for chemical reactivity and has great potential to probe mechanism of action.
