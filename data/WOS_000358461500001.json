However, low cost implementation is still a difficulty due to huge computation of detection algorithm, especially when the detection is required to be applied in embedded systems. In this paper, a new architecture is proposed based on an efficient face detection algorithm. The architecture has three contributions. The first is a specially designed frame buffer which improves the data access efficiency and provides a big data throughput. The second is a new integral image refresh method, which can renew the integral image in one clock cycle to provide feature values for classification timely. The third contribution is a 4-stage pipeline structure for feature calculation, which improves the classification speed by 3 times almost without any increase in hardware area. The experiment results show that the architecture consumes less hardware and power resources while retaining a high-level of detection capability in processing 1024 x 1024 images.
