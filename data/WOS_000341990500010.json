In order to predict and control wheel/rail rolling noise radiation due to roughness of wheel and rail running surface on slab track, a model is developed to calculate wheel/rail rolling noise of the slab track and analyze the influences of railway slab structure parameters on wheel/rail rolling noise. The results show that the rail noise occurs mainly in the middle and high frequency ranges of 500-2000Hz. The wheel noise is chiefly in the high frequency ranges of 1600-4000Hz, and the track slab noise radiates in the frequency ranges of 125-500Hz. Instantaneous noise pressure of the rail is first, the slab is second, the wheel is in between. The weights of the slab have more influence on emissions of the slab, but have little impact on noise emission of the wheel and rail. Below 500Hz, the greater weight of the slab is, the greater noise emission of the slab is, but above 500Hz, the result is the opposite. The CA mortar elastic modulus under the slab has little impact on noise emission of the wheel and rail, whereas has more influence on noise emissions of the slab. The greater elastic modulus of CA mortar under the slab is, the less noise emission of the slab is. The rubber pads installed under the slab have more influence on noise emissions of the slab than that of wheel and rail. All in all, the rubber pad under the slab is beneficial to wheel-rail noise reduction.", "paper_title": "THE EFFECT OF SLAB TRACK ON WHEEL/RAIL ROLLING NOISE IN HIGH SPEED RAILWAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000341990500010"}
