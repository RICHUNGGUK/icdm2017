[5, 7] proposed an adsorbate-induced phase transition model. For this model, Takei et al. [10] found several stationary and evolutionary patterns by numerical simulations. Due to bistability of the system, there appears a phase separation phenomenon and an interface separating these phases. In this paper, we introduce the equation describing the motion of two interfaces in R(2) and discuss an application. Moreover, we prove the existence of the traveling front solution which approximates the shape of the solution in the neighborhood of the interface.", "paper_title": "THE DYNAMICS OF WEAKLY INTERACTING FRONTS IN AN ADSORBATE-INDUCED PHASE TRANSITION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000271525000007"}
