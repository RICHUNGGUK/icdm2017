In this method, the magnetic field equation is coupled with the electric circuit equation and the motion equation with the mesh modification method using the Laplace equation applied to the rotation of the spherical actuator. Design/methodology/approach - The static torque characteristics and dynamic characteristics of the spherical resonant actuator using the proposed method are clarified. The calculated results are compared with the measured ones. Findings - The calculated static torque agrees well with the measured one. The validity of the computation using the proposed method is quantitatively clarified through the comparison with the measurement. Originality/value - The paper proposes the dynamic analysis method of the complicated spherical resonant actuator using the mesh modification method by the Laplace equation.", "paper_title": "Dynamic analysis method of spherical resonant actuator using 3D finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400006"}
