When defining the designs, we have used two different abstraction levels: a register transfer level and a higher algorithmic-like level. The implementations have been developed and tested into reconfigurable hardware (FPGA) for embedded systems. We also present a comparative study of the costs for the two considered approaches with regards to the silicon area, speed and required computational resources. The research is completed with the study of different implementation versions with diverse degrees of parallelism. The final aim is the comparison of the methodologies applied in the two abstraction levels for designing hardware MLP's or similar computational structures. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
