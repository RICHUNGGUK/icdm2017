Currently, the machine learning methods achieve the-state-of-the-art performance with different features. A key step to improve the performance of these methods is to find a suitable representation of proteins. In this study, we proposed a feature vector composed of three kinds of sequence-based features, including overall amino acid composition, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) proposed by Chou and physicochemical distance transformation. These features not only consider the sequence composition of proteins, but also incorporate the sequence-order information of amino acids in proteins. The feature vectors were fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) for DNA-binding protein identification. The proposed method is called PseDNA-Pro. Experiments on stringent benchmark datasets and independent test datasets by using the Jackknife test showed that PseDNA-Pro can achieve an accuracy of higher than 80%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods, including DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, and iDNA-Prot. These results indicate that the combination of various features for DNA-binding protein prediction is a suitable approach, and the sequence-order information among residues in proteins is relative for discrimination. For practical applications, a webserver of PseDNA-Pro was established, which is available from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/PseDNA-Pro/.", "paper_title": "PseDNA-Pro: DNA-Binding Protein Identification by Combining Chou's PseAAC and Physicochemical Distance Transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347839900002"}
