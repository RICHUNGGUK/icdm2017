For this reason, both concepts should be treated in a different way. In addition, the view presented in this paper will allow a more general perspective of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, which will allow representing concepts that could not be presented by interval-valued fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets are Generalization of Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets: Toward a Wider View on Their Relationship", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800037"}
