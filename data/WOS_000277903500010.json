In this paper, as an example of 8 mitochondrial DNA sequences, by means of a 3D graphical representation and the graph radius of the four characteristic curves to construct the similarity matrix, we proposed a vertical and horizontal method for constructing phylogenetic tree. Using our proposed method, a phylogenetic tree can be constructed easily.", "paper_title": "A Vertical and Horizontal Method for Constructing Phylogenetic Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500010"}
