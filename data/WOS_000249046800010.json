Geometrically nonlinear structures are taken into account using the nonlinear corotational structural kinematics. Stable and accurate nonlinear solutions are obtained applying the corotational description and an implicit energy conserving algorithm. The coupling between these theories and solving the Euler fluid flow problem using multiple moving frames allow to overcome restrictions associated with large deformations. Solutions with no fluid mesh deformation or regeneration are obtained. This yields an important time saving in computations and errors associated with mesh regeneration are reduced. Two-dimensional numerical results illustrate these theories application. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
