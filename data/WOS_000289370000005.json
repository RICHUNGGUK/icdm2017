Using enrichment functions that represent the exponential character of the exact solution, smooth numerical solutions are obtained for problems with steep gradients and high Peclet numbers in one-and two-dimensions. In contrast with traditional stabilized methods that require the construction of stability parameters and stabilization terms, the present work avoids numerical instabilities by improving the classical Galerkin solution with enrichment functions (that need not be polynomials) using GFEM, which is an instance of the partition of unity framework. This work also presents a strategy for constructing enrichment functions for problems involving complex geometries by employing a global-local-type approach. Representative numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
