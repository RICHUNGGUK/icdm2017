This paper, based on pre-research for a group of typical enterprises and item, factor and reliability analysis of acquired samples, presents a comprehensive evaluation index system which includes three key first-level indicator sets (consisting of the current status of enterprise informatization, the production management characteristics and the system functional requirements), 16 second-level indicators and 80 third-level indicators. According to the characteristics of the designed objectives in the evaluation index system, we propose to use the grey relative correlation analysis method to evaluate the influencing factors of the enterprise informatization, employ the grey comprehensive correlation analysis method to determine the production management characteristics of the enterprise and adopt the grey clustering assessment technology to assess the information system functional requirements based on Grey System Theory. Moreover, case studies for enterprise informatization that mainly focus on the process enterprises in southwest China were illustrated. The research results show that the proposed evaluation system and evaluation method is reliable, practical, and able to better reflect the level of enterprise information and demand characteristics.
