The influence of the Hartree-Fock exchange on excited state energies and Q(x) and Q(y) bands splitting were studied using GGA BP86 and hybrid B3LYP and PBE1PBE exchange-correlation functionals. Solvent effects were estimated using the polarized continuum model (PCM) approach and cyclohexane, toluene, or DMSO as solvents. It was found that general trends in the Q(x) and Q(y) band energies and splitting correlate very well with the available experimental data on pyridinoporphyrazines and follow the trends in HOMO-LUMO and HOMO-LUMO + 1 energy gaps as well as LUMO-LUMO + 1 splitting. TDDFT trends allow estimation of the Q(x) and Q(y) band energies and splitting in unknown tripyridinoporphyrazines and in individual positional isomers of tetrapyridinoporphyrazines.
