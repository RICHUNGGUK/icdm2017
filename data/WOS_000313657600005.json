First, we prove that the algorithm is convergent as the iteration step increases. Then, a theorem is presented to demonstrate that the limit of the iteration performance index function satisfies discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (DTHJB) equation, and the finite-horizon iteration algorithm is presented with satisfactory accuracy error. At last, two neural networks are used to approximate the iteration performance index function and the corresponding control policy. In simulation part, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iteration algorithm.", "paper_title": "The finite-horizon optimal control for a class of time-delay affine nonlinear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600005"}
