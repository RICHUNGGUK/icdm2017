We show that our theorem generalises another similar general theorem about termination of such systems. We apply our theorem to give interesting proofs of termination for typed combinatory logic. Thus, our method can handle most path-orderings in the literature as well as the reducibility method typically used for typed combinators. Finally we show how our theorem can be used to prove termination for incrementally defined rewrite systems, including an incremental general path ordering. All proofs have been formally machine-checked in Isabelle/HOL.", "paper_title": "TERMINATION OF ABSTRACT REDUCTION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263627000005"}
