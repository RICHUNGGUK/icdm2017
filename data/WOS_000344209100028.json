Inter-cluster separation which is widely used in classification algorithms, however, is rarely considered in a clustering process. In this paper, We present a new discriminative subspace kmeans-type clustering algorithm (DSKmeans), which integrates the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separation simultaneously. Different to traditional weighting kmeans-type algorithms, a 3-order tensor is constructed to evaluate the importance of different features in order to integrate the aforementioned two types of information. First, a new objective function for clustering is designed. To optimize the objective function, the corresponding updating rules for the algorithm are then derived analytically. The properties and performance of DSKmeans are investigated on several numerical and categorical data sets. Experimental results corroborate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art kmeans-type clustering algorithms with respects to four metrics: Accuracy, RandIndex, Fscore and Normal Mutual Information(NMI).
