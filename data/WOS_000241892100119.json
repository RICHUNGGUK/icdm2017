In the model, the solution is presented by two subpaths instead of the closed path which is usually applied in many path search methods to keep balance between computation cost and accuracy. A hybrid technique of genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO), GAPSO is designed to solve the problem. Simulation experiments with different sizes and distributions of nodes show the effectiveness of the new model and GAPSO algorithm.", "paper_title": "Mobile agent routing based on a two-stage optimization model and a hybrid evolutionary algorithm in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100119"}
