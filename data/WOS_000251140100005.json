This pressure mode can be suppressed by a pressure-weighted interpolation formula for the mass flux over a cell-face. In this paper, a similar cure is presented in the framework of pressure-correction methods in variable density flow. Special attention is given to the solvability condition for the resulting Poisson-like equation for the pressure. It consists of two remedies: a correction term for the cell-face velocity is introduced and the stencil for the discrete Laplacian is compacted. We finally show the applicability of the method on general curvilinear coordinate systems in three dimensions. (C)2007 Elsevier Inc.
