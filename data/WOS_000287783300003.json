These techniques are useful for detecting similarities between the knowledge profiles of the subjects and can also be used for assessing the acquisition of capabilities after a course. In this paper, we propose to extend some graphical exploratory analysis techniques to the case where there are missing or conflicting answers in the tests. We will also consider that either a missing or unknown answer, or a set of conflictive answers to a survey, is aptly represented by an interval or a fuzzy set. This representation causes that each individual in the map is no longer a point but a figure whose shape and size determine the coherence of the answers and whose position with respect to its neighbors determines the similarities and differences between the individuals.", "paper_title": "ASSESSING THE EVOLUTION OF LEARNING CAPABILITIES AND DISORDERS WITH A GRAPHICAL EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF SURVEYS CONTAINING MISSING AND CONFLICTING ANSWERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287783300003"}
