More and more concurrency control protocols for XML database systems were proposed in the past few years. Being an important language for addressing data in XML documents, Xpath expressions are the basis of several query languages, such as XQurey and XSLT. In this paper, we propose a lock-based concurrency control protocol, called XLP, for transactions accessing XML data by the XPath model. XLP is based on the XPath model and has the features of rich lock modes, low lock conflict and lock conversion. XLP is also proved to ensure conflict serializability. In sum, there are three major contributions in this paper. The proposed XLP supports most XPath axes, rather than simple path expressions only. Conflict conditions and rules in the XPath model are analyzed and derived. Moreover, a lightweighted lock mode, P-lock, is invented and integrated into XLP for better concurrency.
