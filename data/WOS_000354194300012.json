It is the keystone to enable a system to possess the perception capacity and adapt its functionality properly for different situations. However, a context model focusing on the characteristics of work-based learning is not well studied by pioneering researchers. For addressing this issue, in this work we firstly analyze several existing context models to identify the essentials of context modelling, whereby a hierarchical ontology context model is proposed to characterize work-based learning. Subsequently, we present the application of the proposed model in work-based learning scenario to provide adapted learning supports to professionals. Hence, this work has significance in both theory and practice.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical ontology context model for work-based learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000354194300012"}
