The methodology relies on an assumption that the generalization error of a model learned from the data decreases if a label of some mislabeled sample is changed to its correct class. A general classification model used in the paper is OP-ELM; it also provides a fast way to estimate the generalization error by PRESS Leave-One-Out. It is tested on two toy datasets, as well as on real life datasets for one of which expert knowledge about the identified potential mislabels has been sought. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
