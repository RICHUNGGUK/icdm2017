In practice, however, multiple decisions have often to be made simultaneously which are not independent and the best global solution is often not the combination of the best individual solutions. This problem can be addressed by searching for the overall best solution by using optimization methods based on the predictions made by the DM models. We describe one case study were this approach was used to optimize the layout of a retail store in order to maximize predicted sales. A metaheuristic is used to search different hypothesis of space allocations for multiple product categories, guided by the predictions made by regression models that estimate the sales for each category based on the assigned space. We test three metaheuristics and three regression algorithms on this task. Results show that the Particle Swam Optimization method guided by the models obtained with Random Forests and Support Vector Machines models obtain good results. We also provide insights about the relationship between the correctness of the regression models and the metaheuristics performance.", "paper_title": "Combining regression models and metaheuristics to optimize space allocation in the retail industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000362966800010"}
