This paper develops the concepts of practical stability to descriptor systems and by using Lyapunov functions and comparison principle, presents some techniques to specify admissible control sets, such that the motion of the closed-loop descriptor systems is practically stable and impulsive-free. Finally, as an application, this paper discusses linear time-invariant descriptor systems and derives a sufficient condition. To illustrate our approach, a simple circuit network and a numerical example are analysed.", "paper_title": "Practical stability of closed-loop descriptor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241698200006"}
