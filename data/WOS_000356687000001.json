After analyzing laws of energy consumption of WSNs, a heterogeneous node deployment model based on area topology control is proposed in this paper. It utilizes predetermined heterogeneous node deployment to balance area energy consumption ratio and the topology control algorithm based on area energy consumption ratio to maintain dynamic equilibrium energy consumption. Simulation results show that our model takes a superior performance on maintaining network coverage, balancing energy consumption, and maximizing network lifetime. Compared with similar WSNs deployment models, our model can be more efficient to prolong network lifetime and has advantages in reducing dependence on deployment accuracy, balancing dynamic energy consumption, and improving lifetime in poor network environment.", "paper_title": "Heterogeneous Node Deployment Model Based on Area Topology Control in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000356687000001"}
