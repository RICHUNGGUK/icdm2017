In fact, the optimal solution is not pursued overwhelmingly in actual projects, but it needs to meet certain optimization efficiency. This paper reduces the problem's complexity based on the idea of \"divide and rule\". We use the method of K-Means cluster to divide the nearest neighbor quickly. Then, we employ parallel computing method to all divided areas by using combination of genetic algorithm and ant algorithm (GAAA). Finally, we globally link all the subsets using the method of K centers connect. The results of simulations show that its complexity has been greatly reduced and we can quickly obtain a satisfactory solution to the large-scale problem. It is one effective way to solve the large-scale complex problems.", "paper_title": "Parallel combination of genetic algorithm and ant algorithm based on dynamic K-means cluster", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300103"}
