We numerically compare the performance of the proposed approach with several tests, recently developed such as the generalized F-test by Weerahandi (1995a), the trimmed mean-based test by Lix and Keselman (1998), and the parametric bootstrap test by Krishnamoorthy et al. (2007). The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a reasonable p-value via a few straightforward simulation steps. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to an analysis of two real data sets for illustration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
