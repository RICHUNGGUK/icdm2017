However, this scaling has huge negative impact on the circuit reliability, as it increases the undesired effect of aging degradation on ultradeep submicrometer technologies. Nowadays, Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) aging process has a major negative impact on VLSI circuits reliability. This paper presents a comprehensive framework that assists in designing the fortified VLSI circuits against BTI aging degradation. The framework contains: 1) the novel circuit level techniques that eliminate the effect of BTI (these techniques successfully decrease the power dissipation by 36% and enhance the reliability of VLSI circuits); 2) the evaluation of the reliability of all circuit level techniques used to eliminate BTI aging degradation for 16 nm CMOS technology; and 3) the comparison between the efficiency of all circuit level techniques in terms of power consumption and area.", "paper_title": "Design Framework to Overcome Aging Degradation of the 16 nm VLSI Technology Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135600004"}
