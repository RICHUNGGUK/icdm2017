Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking algorithm is strongly robust against several kinds of attacks such as noise addition, re-sampling, re-quantization, MP3 compression, replace and so on. Additionally, the proposed algorithm achieves signal-to-noise radio (SNR) values ranging from 21dB to 48dB for different watermarked sounds and embedded strengths. These results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking method is a suitable candidate for audio copyright protection.", "paper_title": "A Robust Blind Audio Watermarking Scheme Based on Singular Value Decomposition and Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343408700004"}
