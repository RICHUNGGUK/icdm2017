The VANET is a kind of network that can be built randomly, quickly and temporarily without any infrastructure. The routing of data in a VANET is a challenging task due to the high dynamics, unstable connection environments and transfer direction limit (real road planning) involved. However, it has been discussed that radio obstacles, as found in urban areas, have a significant negative impact on the performance of location based routing. Therefore, the design of a suitable routing protocol for VANETs is an important issue, especially in regard to inter-vehicle communication applications. This paper proposes a energy-efficient geographic routing algorithm that uses the direction, density and distance between nodes in the crossroad routing strategy, to improve the link stability. We compare the novel scheme, ad hoc on-demand distance vector, and dynamic source routing (DSR) for packet loss rate and average end-to-end delay in VANETs to reduce the power consumptions. The simulation results are obtained which demonstrate the power effectiveness of our proposed routing strategy.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient geographic routing protocol design in vehicular ad-hoc network", "paper_id": "WOS:000330730900003"}
