Two physical property datasets are applied as case studies of the inverse QSPR workflow (IQW): mean molecular polarizability and aqueous solubility. The case studies demonstrate the optimization of molecular structures to within a property range of interest; the optimized structures are then validated against QSPR models that are generated from sets of alternative descriptors to those used in the IQW. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results from the case studies.", "paper_title": "A novel workflow for the inverse QSPR problem using multiobjective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241554400006"}
