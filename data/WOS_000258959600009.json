There are several existing methods in the literature for performing this kind of analysis for case-control studies, but less work has been done for prospective cohort studies. We present a Bayesian method for linking markers to censored survival outcome by clustering haplotypes using gene trees. Coalescent-based approaches are promising for LD mapping, as the coalescent offers a good approximation to the evolutionary history of mutations. Results: We compare the performance of the proposed method in simulation studies to the univariate Cox regression and to dimension reduction methods, and we observe that it performs similarly in localizing the causal site, while offering a clear advantage in terms of false positive associations. Moreover, it offers computational advantages. Applying our method to a real prospective study, we observe potential association between candidate ABC transporter genes and epilepsy treatment outcomes.", "paper_title": "Bayesian survival analysis in genetic association studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000258959600009"}
