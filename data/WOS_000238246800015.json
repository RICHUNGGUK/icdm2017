These are the only Eulerian methods whereby simulations of these layers remain very thin and persist long distances without significant dissipation. Initially developed by Steinhoff and co-workers for incompressible flow, these methods have been used successfully to predict complex flows, particularly involving helicopter rotors. Recently, the method has been extended to a compressible finite-volume form, which will enable the methods to be used for a much broader class of problems. In this paper, we examine the ability of the compressible vortex confinement methodology to handle an important class of vortex-dominated flows involving massive separation from bluff bodies. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method by comparisons with experimental data and available state-of-the-art computations. An important conclusion of the present work is that vortex confinement applied to massively separated flows, without modeling the viscous terms and on an essentially inviscid grid, can result in a reasonable approximation to turbulent separated flows. The computed flow structures and velocity profiles were in good agreement with time-averaged values of the data and with LES simulations even though the confinement approach utilized more than a factor of 50 fewer cells in the computation (20,000 compare to more the 1 million). The success of the method for these classes of flows may be attributed to the accurate calculation of the rotational inviscid flow which dominates the convection of the large-scale flow structures.
