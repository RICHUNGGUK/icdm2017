However, few existing systems are able to select the right replication rate that balances replication cost and durability, e.g., minimizing replication cost without threatening the durability target. In this paper, we propose a method called AutoProc to automate the replication process in P2P storage systems. AutoProc employs two key techniques to enable cost-effective replication: correctly adapting replication rate with a reliability model, and replicating objects at the right order with a reliability indicator. Extensive simulations based on the real system failure trace show that AutoProc achieves the near-optimal performance.", "paper_title": "AutoProc: An automatic proactive replication scheme for P2P storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000006"}
