The empirical log-likelihood ratio statistics are proposed and the nonparametric versions of the Wilk's theorem are obtained. Furthermore, when the order of the model is 1, we also derive a test statistic to test the stationary-ergodicity based on the conditional least-squares method. Numerical results from simulation studies suggest that the empirical likelihood method is more accurate than the normal approximation-based method of Hwang and Basawa (1998) [1]. Some simulation studies are also conducted to investigate the finite sample performances of the proposed test. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
