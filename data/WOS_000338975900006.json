As most digital image/video capture devices do not have modules for embedding watermark or signature, passive forgery detection which aims to detect the traces of tampering without embedded information has become the major focus of recent research. However, most of current passive approaches either work only for frame-level detection and cannot localize region-level forgery, or suffer from high false detection rates for localization of tampered regions. In this paper, we investigate two common region-level inpainting methods for object removal, temporal copy-and-paste and exemplar-based texture synthesis, and propose a new approach based on spatio-temporal coherence analysis for detection and localization of tampered regions. Our approach can handle camera motion and multiple object removal Experiments show that our approach outperforms previous approaches, and can effectively detect and localize regions tampered by temporal copy-and-paste and texture synthesis.
