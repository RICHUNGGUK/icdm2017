In recent years, there has been a growing interest to develop nonionizing imaging alternatives to guide these procedures. Ultrasound guidance has emerged as a leading alternative. However, a challenging problem is automatic identification of the spinal anatomy in ultrasound data. In this paper, we propose a local phase-based bone feature enhancement technique that can robustly identify the spine surface in ultrasound images. The local phase information is obtained using a gradient energy tensor filter. This information is used to construct local phase tensors in ultrasound images, which highlight the spine surface. We show that our proposed approach results in a more distinct enhancement of the bone surfaces compared to recently proposed techniques based on monogenic scale-space filters and logarithmic Gabor filters. We also demonstrate that registration accuracy of a statistical shape+pose model of the spine to 3-D ultrasound images can be significantly improved, using the proposed method, compared to those obtained using monogenic scale-space filters and logarithmic Gabor filters.", "paper_title": "Local Phase Tensor Features for 3-D Ultrasound to Statistical Shape plus Pose Spine Model Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000344589200009"}
