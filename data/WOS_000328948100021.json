This problem is very challenging due to the large diversity of fashion items and the absence of pixel-level tags, which make the traditional fully supervised algorithms inapplicable. To solve the problem, we propose to combine the human pose estimation module, the MRF-based color and category inference module and the (super) pixel-level category classifier learning module to generate multiple well-performing category classifiers, which can be directly applied to parse the fashion items in the images. Besides, all the training images are parsed with color-category labels and the human poses of the images are estimated during the model learning phase in this work. We also construct a new fashion image dataset called Colorful-Fashion, in which all 2,682 images are labeled with pixel-level color-category labels. Extensive experiments on this dataset clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed method for the weakly supervised fashion parsing task.", "paper_title": "Fashion Parsing With Weak Color-Category Labels", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100021"}
