This paper investigates update scheduling algorithms to make efficient use of network capacity and improve consistency in DVEs. Our approach is to schedule state updates according to their potential impacts on consistency. In DVEs, the perceptions of participants are affected by both the spatial magnitude and temporal duration of inconsistency in the virtual world. Using the metric of time-space inconsistency, we analytically derive the optimal update schedules for minimizing the impact of inconsistency. Based on the analysis, we propose a number of scheduling algorithms that integrate spatial and temporal factors. These algorithms also take into consideration the effect of network delays. The algorithms can be used on top of many existing mechanisms such as dead reckoning. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the intuitive algorithms that are based on spatial or temporal factors only.", "paper_title": "Update Scheduling for Improving Consistency in Distributed Virtual Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000276899800003"}
