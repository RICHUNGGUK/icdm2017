The number of devices with similar chips could grow very significantly if the U. S. Congress decides to make their inclusion mandatory in any portable device as suggested by organizations such as the RIAA. While the main goal of embedding these chips is to provide access to traditional FM radio stations, a side effect is the availability of a data channel, the FM Radio Data System (RDS), which connects all these devices. Different from other existing IP-based data channels among portable devices, this new one is open, broadcast in nature, and so far completely ignored by security providers. This paper illustrates for the first time how to exploit the FM RDS protocol as an attack vector to deploy malware that, when executed, gains full control of the victim's device. We show how this attack vector allows the adversary to deploy malware on different platforms. Furthermore, we have shown the infection is undetected on devices running the Android OS, since malware detection solutions are limited in their ability due to some features of the Android security model. We support our claims by implementing an attack using RDS on different devices available on the market (smartphones, car radios, and tablets) running three different versions of Android OS. We also provide suggestions on how to limit the threat posed by this new attack vector and explain what are the design choices that make Android vulnerable. However, there are no straightforward solutions. Therefore, we also wish to draw the attention of the security community towards these attacks and initiate more research into countermeasures.", "paper_title": "FM 99.9, Radio Virus: Exploiting FM Radio Broadcasts for Malware Deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000319724100017"}
