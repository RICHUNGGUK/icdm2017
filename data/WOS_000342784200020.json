Since time duration or powerfulness of turbo mode depends on peak temperature of a processor chip, reducing the peak temperature can reinforce turbo mode. This paper presents that adding small amount of hardware allows microprocessors to reduce the peak temperature drastically and then to reinforce turbo mode successfully. Our approach is to find out a few small units that become heat sources in a processor and to appropriately duplicate them for reduction of their power density. By duplicating the limited units and using the copies evenly, the processor can show significant performance improvement while achieving area-efficiency. The experimental result shows that the proposed method achieves up to 14.5% of performance improvement in exchange for 2.8% of area increase.", "paper_title": "Area-Efficient Microarchitecture for Reinforcement of Turbo Mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200020"}
