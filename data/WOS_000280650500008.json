We improve the MLS deformation by defining a new weight function based on skeleton. Being different from the weight function based on control points, our weight function has benefited from the shape information of undeformed object and keeps deformation local, therefore our method can achieve a realistic effect. In cartoon video, we propose a new method to track the skeleton in the video, to build new origin skeleton and new target skeleton on each frame, and to apply our image deformation method to each frame and maintain spatiotemporal consistency. Results demonstrate that our method is able to decrease the effect of squeeze and use less control points.", "paper_title": "An MLS-based cartoon deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000280650500008"}
