This result is valid for strings, ranked trees, and in general for families of graphs having a fixed automaton that can be used to traverse the nodes of each of the graphs in the family. Other examples of such families are grids, toruses, and rectangular mazes.", "paper_title": "Nested pebbles and transitive closure", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100039"}
