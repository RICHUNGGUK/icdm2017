How to conduct service composition and recovery among mobile devices quickly and efficiently is one of the important research areas of MSNS. This paper puts forward a comprehensive strategy applied to MSNS during natural disasters. When communication facilities are limited, several devices can work cooperatively to provide users with reliable composite service, also known as the service composition process. In addition, when some of the devices fail and the composite service interrupts, the presented recovery process reconstructs a service path quickly. Composition and recovery cost functions are used in the two processes separately. The goal is to find the service path or the recovery path with minimal cost function value in each process that satisfies the quality-of-service requirement. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces the interrupt number and recovery time but also improves the success rate of the service request, making the performance of this strategy better than that of the other similar strategies.", "paper_title": "A Composition and Recovery Strategy for Mobile Social Network Service in Disaster", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500014"}
