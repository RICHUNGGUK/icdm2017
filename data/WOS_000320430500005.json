It is a self-report instrument designed to measure students' perceptions of the degree to which they are digital natives. Using three phases, the Digital Natives Assessment Scale (DNAS) was developed and validated with a total sample of 1018 students from three secondary schools. Results of the principal component and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 21-item, four-factor scale for use by students between 13 and 16 years of age. The four factors are: Grow up with technology, Comfortable with multitasking, Reliant on graphics for communication, Thrive on instant gratifications and rewards. Potential uses and applications of the DNAS by researchers and teachers are discussed. Suggestions for further research are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
