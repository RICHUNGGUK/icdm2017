The geometric structures, electronic structures, and the one-photon (OPA) and two-photon (TPA) absorption properties of 3,6-bis(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridinium) carbazole (BMVC) derivatives, as well as their dications and diiodized derivatives, were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO) method. The results showed that the TPA spectra of the diiodized BMVC derivatives and their dications are all found in the near-infrared region (NIR). At the same time, the diiodized BMVC derivatives presented larger TPA cross-sections than the neutral BMVC derivatives and the dications. These theoretically derived values were also in good agreement with their corresponding experimentally observed values, and they indicated that the diiodized BMVC may be the form of this TFP that combines with DNA. The diiodized BMVC derivatives and the dications have the potential to be excellent TPA materials, especially when used as TFPs in nucleic acid imaging applications.", "paper_title": "Theoretical investigation of the two-photon absorption properties of 3,6-bis(4-vinylpyridinium) carbazole derivatives-new biological fluorescent probes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304621400009"}
