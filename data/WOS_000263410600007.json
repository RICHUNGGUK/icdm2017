The two protocols arc able to maintain connectivity where the standard IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol coupled with either AODV or OLSR routing protocols may loose connectivity. A comparative study shows that AsyMAC improves on two previously proposed protocols' accuracy in determining the nodes to be silenced to prevent collisions.
