To the soft-permanent connection (SPC) defined in ASON networks, a user-management interface is added to allow direct negotiation between the users and the management system. Moreover, the management system combines SOAP/XML and simple network management protocol ( SNMP) to communicate with a GMPLS control plane that is responsible for rapid connection establishment, including routing and resource management. The management system is distributed and integrates a communication interface ( the internal management interface, I-MI) based on SOAP and on the peering strategy Chord to perform provisioning related actions. Experimentation results with an ASON/GMPLS testbed assess potential suitability of the overall approach for service provisioning due to its low delays and high flexibility.
