Design/methodology/approach - A general review and survey of selected research and development topics. Findings - Illustrates the multi- and trans-disciplinary interests of cybernetics and systems and aims to further research and development activity. Practical finplications - The choice of reviews provides an awareness of the current initiatives and trends in these areas of research and endeavour. Originality/value - The reviews are selected from a global database and give a studied assessment of current research and development initiatives.", "paper_title": "Cybernetics and the trends in robotics developments 2004-2008", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900015"}
