The frictional contact at the soil-pile interface is formulated using the theory of hardening/softening plasticity, so that advanced models for the interface can be dealt with. A smooth discretisation of the pile surface is proposed using BeZIER polynomials. An automatic load stepping scheme is proposed, which features an error control algorithm and automatic subincrementation of the load increments. The numerical algorithms are then used to analyse the installation process of pushed-in axial piles. It is shown that the smooth discretisation of the pile surface is effective in reducing the oscillation in the predicted pile resistances and the automatic load stepping scheme outperforms the classical Newton-Raphson scheme for this type of problem.
