Both bisection and electromagnetic analysis algorithms are based on a set of heuristic and physical rules obtained from the study of the electromagnetic behavior of these planar devices. With this procedure, the benefits are two fold: (i) the number of iterations is kept moderately low in the synthesis loop, and (ii) the analysis at each iteration step is speed up without compromising accuracy. The algorithm is applied to the development of an inductor library for a low temperature co-fired ceramic process technology.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of planar inductors in low temperature co-fired ceramic technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700010"}
