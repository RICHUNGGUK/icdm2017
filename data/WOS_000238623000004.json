In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for transforming a minimum dominating set in a bipartite permutation graph into a minimum acyclic dominating set. Chao et al. gave a linear time algorithm to find a minimum dominating set of a permutation graph. Thus, we show that the acyclic domination problem is linear time solvable for bipartite permutation graphs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
