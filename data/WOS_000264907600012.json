Under such methods, the unknown group membership is usually treated as missing data. When the \"complete data\" (log-)likelihood function does not have an explicit solution, the simplicity of the EM algorithm breaks down. Authors, including Rai and Matthews [Rai, S.N., Matthews, D.E., 1993. Improving the em algorithm. Biometrics 49, 587-591], Lange [Lange, K., 1995a. A gradient algorithm locally equivalent to the em algorithm. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 57(2) 425-437], and Titterington [Titterington, D.M., 1984. Recursive parameter estimation using incomplete data. journal of the Royal Statistical Society B. 46, 257-267] developed modified algorithms therefore. As motivated by research in a large neurobiological project, we propose in this paper a new variant of such modifications and show that it is self-consistent. Moreover, simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the new variant converges faster than its predecessors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
