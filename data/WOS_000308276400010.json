We consider that information has a certain quality level that fades over time. Mobile context-aware applications receive and process disseminated information given that the corresponding quality is above the lowest level. The necessity for optimally scheduling information delivery arises from the dynamic nature of the network, e.g., probabilistic spreading, caching, deferred delivery, and mobility of nodes. We propose two policies for optimal scheduling information delivery consumption based on the Optimal Stopping Theory. The mobile nodes delay the reporting of information to mobile context-aware applications in search for better quality. The proposed policies efficiently deal with the delivery of quality information in mobile ad-hoc networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
