Orthogonality and second-order orthogonality are crucial in identifying important inputs. Besides orthogonality, good space-filling properties are also necessary for Latin hypercube designs. In this paper, a construction method for second-order orthogonal sliced Latin hypercube designs is proposed. The constructed designs are further optimized to achieve better space-filling properties. Furthermore, the method is extended to construct nearly orthogonal sliced Latin hypercube designs. The numbers of slices and columns as well as the levels of the resulting designs are more flexible than those obtained by existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
