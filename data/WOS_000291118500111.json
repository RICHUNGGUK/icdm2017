Further statistics about distance distributions between the acquired operating rules and training or testing samples are made to indirectly illuminate the impacts on the performances or behaviors of AIRS from three aspects of different affinity functions, training (testing) sample spatial distribution and supplementary samples in high nonlinear space of operation decision. The results indicate that AIRS can effectively extract water-supply operating rules and enrich the reservoir operation researches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
