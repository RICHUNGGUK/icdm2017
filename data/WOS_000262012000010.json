A gap-coupled NRD guide filter is designed based on the order-reduced volume integral equation method. The two identical high-quality microstrip-line-to-NRD guide transitions are designed by means of the generalized surface-volume integral equation approach. Finally, the optimized length of the NRD guide feed-line is determined and a compact microstrip-line-coupled NRD filter is obtained. Simulated results are in good agreement with measured results.
