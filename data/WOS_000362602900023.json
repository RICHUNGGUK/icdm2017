The algorithm makes use of the Delaunay space tessellation. The present python software is based on platform-independent tools, leading to a portable program. Its successful execution provides information concerning the accessible volume fraction of the system, the size and shape of the cavities and the group of atoms forming each of them. The program can be easily incorporated into the LAMMPS software. An advantage of the present algorithm is that no a priori assumption on the cavity shape has to be made. As an example, the cavity size and shape distributions in a polyethylene melt system are presented for three spherical probe particles. This paper serves also as an introductory manual to the script. It summarizes the algorithm, its implementation, the required user-defined parameters as well as the format of the input and output files. Additionally, we demonstrate possible applications of our approach and compare its capability with the ones of well documented cavity size estimators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
