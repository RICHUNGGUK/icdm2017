The basic idea is to search for a counterexample in executions whose length is bounded by some integer k. In fact, for some properties some bounded paths are equivalent. In the original Bounded Model Checking equivalent bounded paths may be searched repeatedly. Therefore some searches are redundant. In this paper with respect to some properties we exploit new encoding for Bounded Model Checking such that we can avoid searching for redundant bounded paths.", "paper_title": "Improved SAT based bounded model checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800058"}
