This improved fifth-order dispersion-relation-preserving combined compact difference scheme (DRPCCD5) has been rigorously analyzed through the dispersion, phase speed anisotropy and stability analyses. We then couple the DRPCCD5 scheme with the previous fifth-order compact-reconstruction weighted essentially non-oscillatory (CRWENO5) scheme using a hybrid strategy based on the monotonicity-maintenance criteria. To verify the resulting \"optimized\" hybrid scheme (ODRPCCD5), several benchmark problems with available exact solution are investigated. The comparison to the previous fifth-order WENO (WENO5) scheme shows that the ODRPCCD5 avoids numerical oscillation around discontinuities, handles large gradients well, and is much faster at the same accuracy because a coarser mesh can be used.
