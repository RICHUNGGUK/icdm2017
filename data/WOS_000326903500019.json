We construct several datasets for both accelerometer and gyroscope of three inertial measurement units and a smartphone around the waist of a subject, which include at most 744 subjects (389 males and 355 females) with ages ranging from 2 to 78 years. The database has several advantages: a large number of subjects with a balanced gender ratio, variations of sensor types, sensor locations, and ground slope conditions. Therefore, we can reliably analyze the dependence of gait authentication performance on a number of factors such as gender, age group, sensor type, ground condition, and sensor location. The results with the latest existing authentication methods provide several insights for these factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
