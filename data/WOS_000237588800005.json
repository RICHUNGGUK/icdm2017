The main idea is to consider the cluster cores as domains characterized by their specific textures in the data space. The distribution of the data points is first described as a multidimensional histogram defined on a multidimensional regular array of sampling points. In order to evaluate locally a multidimensional texture, a co-occurrence matrix is introduced, which characterizes the local distribution of the data points in the multidimensional data space. Several local texture features can be computed from this co-occurrence matrix, which accumulates spatial and statistical information on the data distribution in the neighborhoods of the sampling points. Texture features are selected according to their ability to discriminate different distributions of data points. The sampling points where the local underlying texture is evaluated are categorized into different texture classes. The points assigned to these classes tend to form connected components in the data space, which are considered as the cores of the clusters. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
