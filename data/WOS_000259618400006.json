Its hierarchical architecture and the introducing of area border router (ABR) had been proved to be an effective solution to the scalability problem. However, manual selection of ABR may fail to accommodate the dynamic change in the network load and therefore lead to sub-optimal solution. In the article, a new scheme is proposed for the dynamic appointment of ABR for OSPF. Based on observed traffic demands and knowledge on link capacities, the proposed scheme will dynamically switch to a new ABR from an old one to avoid incipient link congestion and accompanying performance degradation. In response to traffic change, the proposed approach will locate an adequate AN for the new traffic pattern and then direct traffics to the new ABR. System performance, in terms of link utilization, throughput, and delay, is expected to benefit from the proposed scheme, as demonstrated in the simulation results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
