In this paper, we show that among all unicyclic graphs with n vertices, S-n(+) has the maximum general R(a)ndic index for 0 < alpha < 1, where S-n(+) denotes the unicyclic graph obtained from the star S-n on n vertices by joining its two vertices of degree one; T-[n+1/2],T-[n+1/2] has the maximum general Randic index for alpha > 2 and n >= 7, where T-[n+1/2],T-[n+1/2] is a triangle with two balanced leaf branches. For 1 < alpha < 2, we also give the structure description for the graphs with maximum general Randic index. The case for alpha < 0 is much more complicated and left for further study.", "paper_title": "Unicyclic Graphs with Maximum General Randic Index for alpha > 0", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500014"}
