The method is based on inference axioms that combine two semantic relations yielding another relation that otherwise is not expressed. An experimental study conducted on PropBank, WordNet, and eXtended WordNet shows that inferences have high accuracy. The method is applicable to combining other semantic relations and it is beneficial to many semantically intense applications.", "paper_title": "Semantic composition of AT-LOCATION relation with other relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000307467600004"}
