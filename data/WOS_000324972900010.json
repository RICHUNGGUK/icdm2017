Recently it has been shown that sums of Kronecker products can be used to represent the nonzero blocks of the transition rate matrix underlying an LDQBD process for models from stochastic chemical kinetics. This paper extends the form of the transition rates used recently so that a larger class of models including those of call centers can be analyzed for their steady-state. The challenge in the matrix analytic solution then is to compute conditional expected sojourn time matrices of the LDQBD model under low memory and time requirements after truncating its countably infinite state space judiciously. Results of numerical experiments are presented using a Kronecker-based matrix-analytic solution on models with two or more countably infinite dimensions and rules of thumb regarding better implementations are derived. In doing this, a more recent approach that reduces memory requirements further by enabling the computation of steady-state expectations without having to obtain the steady-state distribution is also considered.
