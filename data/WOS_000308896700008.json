Design/methodology/approach - Structural and electrical analysis have been applied, on copper nanometric films produced by a magnetron sputtering device. Findings - Data are provided for copper films realized by magnetron sputtering deposition on glass, in different operating conditions. Practical implications - A multidisciplinary comprehension of shielding effectiveness of nanostructured thin films can be important in many applications where there are electromagnetic compatibility problems. Originality/value - The paper gives a valuable set of information for the characterization of nanometric copper thin films.", "paper_title": "Characterization of nanostructured copper films for electromagnetic shield", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700008"}
