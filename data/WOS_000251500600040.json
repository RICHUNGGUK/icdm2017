The parameter uncertainties are described to be of linear fractional form, which include the norm bounded uncertainties as a special case. By introducing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and considering the additional useful terms when estimating the upper bound of the derivative of Lyapunov functional, new delay-dependent stability criteria are established in term of linear matrix inequality (LMI). It is shown that the obtained criteria can provide less conservative results than some existing ones. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.
