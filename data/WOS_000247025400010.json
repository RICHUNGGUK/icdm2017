This paper focuses on dynamic strategic vendor selection. Existing approaches supporting vendor selection neglect the interdependencies in time arising from investment costs of selecting a new vendor and costs of switching from an existing vendor to a new one. These shortcomings of current approaches motivate the research presented in this paper. A dynamic decision making approach for strategic vendor selection based on the principles of hierarchical planning will be proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
