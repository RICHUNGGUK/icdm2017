In the filter banks, the analysis filters are generated by interlaced exponential modulating two different analysis prototype filters, and the synthesis filters are generated by two different synthesis prototype filters via the same manner. The filter banks have a simple polyphase structure similar to DFT modulated. lter banks (DFT- FBs). More importantly, the proposed Interleaved DFT- FBs can achieve critically sampled PR complex. lter bank with FIR analysis and synthesis filters, which is impossible for DFT-FBs. We give and prove the PR condition for 2M- band Interleaved DFT-FBs. Utilizing the result, the design procedure of the prototype filters is presented. In addition, by the theoretic analysis and numerical examples, it is shown that the analysis and synthesis filters cannot simultaneously provide good stopband attenuation for the critically sampled PR Interleaved DFT-FBs. Although the limitation always exits, the. lter banks can find applications in some subband coding systems of high bit rate.", "paper_title": "2M-band interleaved DFT modulated filter banks with perfect reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300001"}
