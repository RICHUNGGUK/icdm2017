The approach does not require experiments over the structural lifetime and solves the problems of limited data and limited mechanical and physical insight in initial stages of investigation. Specifically, a combination of accelerated life testing with a neural network solution for function approximation over the time scale is proposed. The capabilities of the concept are demonstrated by a numerical example for verification purposes and a practical application for predicting the lifetime of textile reinforced concrete specimens at service load.
