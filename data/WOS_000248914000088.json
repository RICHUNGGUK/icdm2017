We combine the procedural modeling pipeline of shape grammars with image analysis to derive a meaningful hierarchical facade subdivision. Our system gives rise to three exciting applications: urban reconstruction based on low resolution oblique aerial imagery, reconstruction of facades based on higher resolution ground-based imagery, and the automatic derivation of shape grammar rules from facade images to build a rule base for procedural modeling technology.", "paper_title": "Image-based procedural modeling of facades", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000088"}
