The scheme is based on a recent DRM scheme, which we formally specify in the mu CRL process algebraic language. The original scheme stated the following security requirements: effectiveness, secrecy and resistance of content masquerading. We formalise these security requirements as well as strong fairness and formally check the original scheme against these requirements. This verification step uncovered several security weaknesses, which are addressed by Nuovo DRM. In addition to that, Nuovo DRM introduces several procedural practices to enhance the practical security of the scheme. A finite model of Nuovo DRM is subsequently model-checked and shown to satisfy its design requirements, including secrecy, fairness and resistance to content masquerading.", "paper_title": "Nuovo DRM Paradiso: Designing a Secure, Verified, Fair Exchange DRM Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000262454000003"}
