In this paper, we present a texture based segmentation approach for the detection of tear film breakup regions on interferometry images. First, the textural information was extracted from the studied images using a bank of Gabor filters. A novel classifier, EM-MDA, which integrates traditional Expectation-Maximization with Multiple Discriminant Analysis, was then trained for the recognition of breakup regions of the PLTF. Experimental results provided a correct classification rate of 91.0% which proved significantly higher compared to traditional EM or well known Linear Discriminant Analysis.", "paper_title": "Texture based prelens tear film segmentation in interferometry images", "paper_id": "WOS:000276149200004"}
