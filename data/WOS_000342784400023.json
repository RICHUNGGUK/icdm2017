However, many wireless devices are limited by size or hardware complexity. Cooperative diversity techniques were proposed to overcome this limitation. Cooperative communication has been widely investigated to improve the performance of wireless communication. Unfortunately, most existing cooperative schemes have the common fault of decreased transmission rate because the destination should receive the decodable compositions of symbols from the source and the relay. In this letter, we propose a new cooperative model that uses spatial phase coding (SPC) for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). This technique is free from the rate-loss and allows seamless cooperative communication while its diversity gain matches that of the conventional multiple antenna technique. The proposed technique is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) and simulation results show that the proposed cooperative scheme approaches the performance of conventional multiple antenna system when the link between users is guaranteed.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Diversity Technique Using Spatial Phase Coding Based on OFDMA System", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400023"}
