The information communication and reconstruction on grid transitions is of crucial importance from the accuracy and numerical stability point of view. While a decimation is performed when going from the fine to the coarse grid, a reconstruction must performed to pass form the coarse to the fine grid. In this context, we introduce a decimation technique for the copy from the fine to the coarse grid based on a filtering operation. We show this operation to be extremely important, because a simple copy of the information is not sufficient to guarantee the stability of the numerical scheme at high Reynolds numbers. Then we demonstrate that to reconstruct the information, a local cubic interpolation scheme is mandatory in order to get a precision compatible with the order of accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann method. These two fundamental extra-steps are validated on two classical 2D benchmarks, the 2D circular cylinder and the 2D dipole-wall collision. The latter is especially challenging from the numerical point of view since we allow strong gradients to cross the refinement interfaces at a relatively high Reynolds number of 5000. A very good agreement is found between the single grid and the refined grid cases. The proposed grid refinement strategy has been implemented in the parallel open-source library Palabos.
