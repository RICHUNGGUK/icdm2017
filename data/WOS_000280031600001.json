The argillite is modeled as a three phase material composed of a clay matrix and inclusions of quartz and calcite. It is shown that, unlike the dilute scheme and the self-consistent scheme, the Mori-Tanaka model describes the in situ experimental data well. The determined properties are finally used in a finite element computation. The aim is to evaluate the effect of mineral composition on the elastic response of the excavation of a vertical shaft in the context of the underground laboratory of Meuse/Haute Marne.
