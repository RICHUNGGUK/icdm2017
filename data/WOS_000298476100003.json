The proposed approach is equipped by the orthogonal Sinc functions that have perfect properties. This method solves the problem on the semi-infinite domain without truncating it to a finite domain and transforming domain of the problem to a finite domain. In addition, the governing partial differential equations are transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations using similarity variables, and then they are solved numerically by the Sinc-collocation method. It is shown that the Sinc-collocation method converges to the solution at an exponential rate.
