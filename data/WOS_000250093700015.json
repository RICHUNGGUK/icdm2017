Therefore it is the unique f-divergence which serves as a metric. This point is interpreted as a fundamental confliction of the convexity for f(x) with the metric properties for its associated f-divergence. Therefore, we relax the convexity of f(x) and replace it with other constraints to create new metrics.", "paper_title": "Confliction of the convexity and metric properties in f-divergences", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700015"}
