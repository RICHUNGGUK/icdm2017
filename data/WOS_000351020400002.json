Relying on consumer switching behavior to provide more comprehensive competitive discipline was insufficient for a variety of reasons, including the presence of switching costs. The process of correcting errors in the technology used for application-specific management revealed that such management creates costs for application developers and innovators, regardless of whether their products are targeted for traffic management.", "paper_title": "Net Neutrality: Discrimination, Competition, and Innovation in the UK and US", "paper_id": "WOS:000351020400002"}
