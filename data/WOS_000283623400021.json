Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the separation of the saturation signal, the slotting signal, and the inter-modulation signal components in squirrel cage induction machines operating at low and zero frequency using ANNs has been experimentally implemented and measurement results are given. Findings - The measurement results show the advantages of the application of the proposed technique at low and zero speed sensorless control even at high load levels. Originality/value - The paper describes an effective method of eliminating or reducing modulation harmonics in induction motor drives.", "paper_title": "Separation of saliency information for speed sensorless detection of induction machines flux and rotor position", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400021"}
