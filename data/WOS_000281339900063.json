In the meantime, its potential benefits for business adopters have been debated extensively over the past several years. We consider the challenges associated with developing an integrated system tailored for RFID-enabled supply chain management including inaccuracies in reading rate, sampling problem and security issue. We then develop enhanced coordination mechanisms through fine-grained RFID item-level information both inter- and intra-organizations to appropriately address some of these challenges. We propose and illustrate a knowledge-based Web Service architecture by developing a working prototype based on the idiosyncrasies of RFID applications. Through simulation and analysis, we find that a knowledge-based Web service system for RFID applications is able to sustain a more coherent and productive service than traditional integrated systems for supply chain management.
