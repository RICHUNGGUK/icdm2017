Contrary to the traditional alignment approach, genome rearrangements are based on comparison of gene orders and the evolution of gene families. Genome rearrangement has become an important area in computational biology and bioinformatics. There are three basic operations, reversal, translocation, and transposition. Here we study the translocation operations. Multi-chromosomal genomes frequently evolve by translocation events that exchange genetic material between two chromosomes. We will discuss both signed and unsigned cases.", "paper_title": "Translocation distance: Algorithms and complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000243217700003"}
