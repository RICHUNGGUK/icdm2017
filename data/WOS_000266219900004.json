The method is based on a lookup technique that makes use of inversion and shift registers, which leads to a smaller size of lookup for the S-box than its corresponding implementations. The reduction in the lookup size is based on grouping sets of inverses into conjugate sets which in turn leads to a reduction in the number of lookup values. The above technique is implemented in a regular AES architecture using register files, which requires less interconnect and area and is suitable for security applications. The results of the implementation are competitive in throughput and area compared with the corresponding solutions in a polynomial basis.", "paper_title": "Efficient advanced encryption standard implementation using lookup and normal basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000266219900004"}
