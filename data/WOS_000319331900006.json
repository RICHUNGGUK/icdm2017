In questioned document examination, text-line rotation and alignment can be important clues for detecting tampered documents. Measuring and detecting such mis-rotations and mis-alignments are a cumbersome task. Therefore, an automated approach for verification of documents based on these two text-line features is proposed in this paper. An in-depth evaluation of the proposed methods shows its usefulness in the context of document security with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) score of AUC=0.89. The automatic nature of the approach allows the presented methods to be used in high-volume environments.", "paper_title": "Text-line examination for document forgery detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000319331900006"}
