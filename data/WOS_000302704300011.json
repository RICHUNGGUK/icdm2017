First, an improved method is proposed for estimating the mixing matrix, where the negative value of the auto WVD of the sources is fully considered. Then after extracting all the auto-term TF points, the auto WVD value of the sources at every auto-term TF point can be found out exactly with the proposed approach no matter how many active sources there are as long as N <= 2M - 1. Further discussion about the extraction of auto-term TF points is made and finally the numerical simulation results are presented to show the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Time-Frequency Approach to Underdetermined Blind Source Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302704300011"}
