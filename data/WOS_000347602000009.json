In this paper, we first propose an efficient and secure outsourcing algorithm for bilinear pairings in the two untrusted program model. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm, a distinguishing property of our proposed algorithm is that the (resource-constrained) outsourcer is not required to perform any expensive operations, such as point multiplications or exponentiations. Furthermore, we utilize this algorithm as a subroutine to achieve outsource-secure identity-based encryptions and signatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
