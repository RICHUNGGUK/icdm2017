We present three different minimal-bracketing algorithms for computing minimum-sized exposure sets bracketing of HDR scenes. Each algorithm is applicable to a different HDR-imaging scenario depending on the amount of target-scene-irradiance information and real-time image processing available at the time of image acquisition. We prove the optimality of each algorithm with respect to its ability to obtain a theoretically minimum-size bracketing set of exposures. We also provide closed-form expressions for computing minimal-bracketing exposure sets for two common types of HDR-imaging systems, those with geometrically varying and arithmetically varying exposure settings. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods by capturing and processing multiple HDR scenes using minimal-bracketing and I-stop bracketing methods. The results show that minimal-bracketing can be used to produce high-quality HDR images, while requiring only one third as many LDR images be acquired compared to I-stop bracketing. We also perform a detailed SNR analysis that quantifies the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio and image-bracketing-set size.", "paper_title": "Minimal-bracketing sets for high-dynamic-range image capture", "paper_id": "WOS:000259372100011"}
