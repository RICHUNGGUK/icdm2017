This paper considers the pattern formation problem in such a system, and shows that oblivious robots can form any pattern that non-oblivious robots can form, except that two oblivious robots cannot form a point while two non-oblivious robots can. Therefore, memory does not help in forming a pattern, except for the case in which two robots attempt to form a point. Related results on the pattern convergence problem are also presented.
