The Internet of things, mobile Internet, cloud computing and big data technologies build a sensing environment for all kinds of businesses. Inter enterprise collaboration is also meeting the new challenges of omni-channel marketing, closed-loop supply chain and enterprise networks integration. A data convergence oriented enterprise networks integration architecture with relative enabling technologies is developed in the paper. In order to collect, transfer and fuse data from different data sources, Data Portal (DP) and Collaboration Agent (CA) concepts are introduced, which present a lightweight and loosely coupled infrastructure for enterprise networks integration. How to use the developed technologies to solve problems of product lifecycle management and omni-channel marketing management are discussed in detailed cases studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
