A major challenge in traffic engineering is how to cope with dynamic and unpredictable changes in traffic demand. In this paper, we propose COPE, a class of traffic engineering algorithms that optimize for the expected scenarios while providing a worst-case guarantee for unexpected scenarios. Using extensive evaluations based on real topologies and traffic traces, we show that COPE can achieve efficient resource utilization and avoid network congestion in a wide variety of scenarios.", "paper_title": "COPE: Traffic engineering in dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241393000012"}
