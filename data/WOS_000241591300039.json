Underlying both of these performance challenges is the inefficient use of computational power and server CPU cycles to process the network protocols. Today's modern high-end Network Interface Cards (NICs) are equipped with an onboard CPU. In most cases, these CPU's are only used by the vendor and are operated by a proprietary OS, which makes them inaccessible to the HPC application developer. In this paper we present a design and implementation of a framework for building high-performance networking applications. The framework consists of an embedded NIC Operating System with a specialized scheduler. The main challenge in developing such a scheduler is the lack of a preemption mechanism in most high-end NICs. Our scheduler provides finer-grained schedules than the alternatives. We have implemented several network applications, and were able to increase their throughput while decreasing the host's CPU utilization.", "paper_title": "On a NIC's operating system, schedulers and high-performance networking applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300039"}
