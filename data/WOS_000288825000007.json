Springer, 2006). We design a deterministic algorithm with a competitive ratio of 7/4 for the one-dimensional case. This is the first deterministic algorithm that beats the bound of 2. It also has a better competitive ratio than the previous randomized algorithms. Moreover, we provide the first non-trivial deterministic lower bound, improve the randomized lower bound, and prove the first lower bounds for higher dimensions.", "paper_title": "On the Online Unit Clustering Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000288825000007"}
