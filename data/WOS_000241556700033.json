In this work we attempt to generalize this approach by calculating 2 or 3 or up to k diffusion tensors for each voxel. We show that our procedure can more accurately describe the diffusion particularly when crossing fibers or fiber-bundles are present in the datasets.", "paper_title": "Diffusion k-tensor estimation from Q-ball imaging using discretized principal axes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700033"}
