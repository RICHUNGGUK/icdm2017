We will show that chaotic bursts appear in the modified model though there exhibit quasi-periodic bursts in the original one. Moreover, we will show that such chaotic bursts appear by breaking down a pair of invariant closed curves, which is generated by a Hopf bifurcation for a pair of two-periodic points.", "paper_title": "A chaotic burst in a modified discrete-time neuron model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400007"}
