This intra-tumor heterogeneity complicates the analysis of somatic aberrations in DNA sequencing data from tumor samples. Results: We describe an algorithm called THetA2 that infers the composition of a tumor sample-including not only tumor purity but also the number and content of tumor subpopulations-directly from both whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WXS) high-throughput DNA sequencing data. This algorithm builds on our earlier Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis (THetA) algorithm in several important directions. These include improved ability to analyze highly rearranged genomes using a variety of data types: both WGS sequencing (including low similar to 7 x coverage) and WXS sequencing. We apply our improved THetA2 algorithm to WGS (including low-pass) and WXS sequence data from 18 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find that the improved algorithm is substantially faster and identifies numerous tumor samples containing subclonal populations in the TCGA data, including in one highly rearranged sample for which other tumor purity estimation algorithms were unable to estimate tumor purity.", "paper_title": "Quantifying tumor heterogeneity in whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000346051000012"}
