Due to the form of our model, it is natural to compute via a difference of convex algorithm (DCA). We draw its connection to the Bregman iteration for convex problems and prove that the iteration generated from our algorithm converges to a stationary point with the objective function values decreasing monotonically. A stopping strategy based on the stable oscillatory pattern of the iteration error from the ground truth is introduced. In numerical experiments on image denoising, image deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction, our method improves on the classical TV model consistently and is on par with representative state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "A Weighted Difference of Anisotropic and Isotropic Total Variation Model for Image Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500015"}
