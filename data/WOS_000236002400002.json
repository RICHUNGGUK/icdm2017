Unlike conventional approaches which produce a single metamodel for each scalar response independently, the present method uses the correlation among different simulation responses in the construction of the metamodel. These dependent metamodels are solved as a system of equations to estimate all individual responses simultaneously. Since several responses contribute to the construction of each individual metamodel, more information from the computed responses is used, thus improving the accuracy of the obtained metamodels. Examples are used to explore the relative performance of the proposed approach and show that the new approach outperforms conventional metamodeling approaches in terms of approximation accuracy. The new method should be particularly useful in problems that require very computationally intensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Approximation of multiresponse deterministic engineering simulations: a dependent metamodeling approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000236002400002"}
