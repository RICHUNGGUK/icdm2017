The integrated wide-band dipole-patch antenna is a combination of two type of radiators, patch and dipole, to exploit both advantages of the two antenna types. The 395-mu m x 625-mu m dipole-patch antenna in the top metal layer of the 65-nm CMOS process has a wide 30.2-GHz bandwidth from 73.9 to 104.1 GHz with minimum reflection coefficient of -29 dB at 101.6 GHz and resistance from 27.3 to 47.5 Omega by simulation in Momentum, ADS 2009. We proposed a resistor-less mm-wave damping PG whose peak-to-peak pulse output is 1.66-V with 9.1-ps duration in HSPICE simulation at the antenna input terminals. Radiation measurements by using a horn antenna and a Schottky diode placed at a 39-mm distance from the chip's surface show the main beam's peak at theta (max) = 17 degrees with a half-power beam-width (HPBW) of 9 degrees and the second beam's peak at theta (sec) = -23 degrees. Maximum radiated powers in horizontal and vertical planes are respectively 2.4 and 0.5 mu W.", "paper_title": "A millimeter-wave resistor-less pulse generator with a new dipole-patch antenna in 65-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400014"}
