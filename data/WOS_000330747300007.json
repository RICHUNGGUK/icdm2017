It exhibits the result of a period-doubling cascade to chaos from a Hopf bifurcation point. The theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the rich dynamics of the system.", "paper_title": "DEGENERATE HOPF BIFURCATIONS AND THE FORMATION MECHANISM OF CHAOS IN THE QI 3-D FOUR-WING CHAOTIC SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000330747300007"}
