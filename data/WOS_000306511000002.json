The high popularity of MMOGs created a rapidly growing market and this highly dynamic market has forced game developers to step up competitively. However, MMOG development is a challenging and expensive process. In this study, we present a high-level network simulation environment, which can be used to model and simulate typical MMOGs that have client-server architectures. The main objective is to provide a simulation environment to MMOG developers that can be used to test, analyze and verify various aspects of the MMOG network architecture. We have also implemented a graphical user interface that allows one to construct the simulation model visually. We have demonstrated the use of the simulation environment by experimental simulations.", "paper_title": "Network modeling and simulation of massively multiplayer online games", "paper_id": "WOS:000306511000002"}
