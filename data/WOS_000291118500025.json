Specifically, for some indicators we only have information on the interval within which the true value is believed to lie. The proposed approach is based on the Data Envelopment Analysis literature. Given the setting of evaluating countries, this paper discerns a 'strong country in weak environment' and 'weak country in strong environment' scenario resulting in respectively an upper and lower bound on countries' performance. Accordingly, we derive a classification of 'benchmark countries', 'potential benchmark countries', and 'countries open to improvement'. We illustrate our method with ata on the knowledge economy.
