Design/methodology/approach - A high-reliability hybrid-excitation DC motor, initially designed basing on theoretical considerations, is then analyzed using purposely developed 2D and 3D finite element method (FEM) electromagnetic models under static, dynamic, healthy, and faulty conditions. Findings - The simulation results confirm that properly designed drives employing hybrid-excitation DC motors may constitute an effective solution for applications requiring a very high reliability under DC supply with limited speed regulation capability. Research limitations/implications - The methodology employed exhibits the usual limits concerning the accuracy of FEM analysis: hysteresis is neglected, 2D simulations neglect axial component of fields, in 2D dynamic analysis the electrically discontinuous laminated cores are modeled as orthotropic continuous parts, commutator operation is approximated by means of a position-dependent resistors network, and the excitation current provided by choppers is approximately considered as constant. Practical implications - Hybrid excitation DC motors, which may be easily manufactured using existing facilities and mature technologies, might provide an interesting solution for emergency drives requiring minimal regulation capabilities and very high reliability under direct DC supply. Originality/value - Hybrid excitation is not much investigated in the literature especially for DC motors, although such solution may result potentially interesting especially when a limited flux adjustment capability is required.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a fault-tolerant hybrid-excitation DC motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400020"}
