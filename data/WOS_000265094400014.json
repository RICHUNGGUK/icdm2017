Hence, we propose to use the full spectra as input to a classifier, but to select small groups - or blocks - of adjacent m/z values, instead of single m/z values only. For that purpose we modify the LogitBoost to obtain a version of the so-called blockwise boosting procedure for classification. It is shown that blockwise boosting has high potential in predictive proteomics.", "paper_title": "Supervised feature selection in mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling by blockwise boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000265094400014"}
