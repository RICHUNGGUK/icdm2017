The test is an extension of the likelihood ratio type test with trend adjustment prior to testing to the panel data framework. Under the null hypothesis, the standardized statistic has a limiting normal distribution as the number of time periods and the number of cross-sections tend to infinity sequentially. Additionally, an approximation involving the moments based on a vector autoregressive process of order one is introduced. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates that the test has reasonable size and high power in finite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
