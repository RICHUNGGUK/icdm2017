(Comput Geosci 6(3-4):315-332, 2002), is analyzed and extended to the problem of modeling slightly compressible flow coupled to the transport of chemical species through porous media, on non-matching multiblock grids. Applications include modeling bio-remediation of heavy oil spills and many other subsurface hazardous wastes, angiogenesis in transition of tumors from dormant to malignant states, transport of contaminants in ground water flow, and acid injection from well bores to increase permeability of surrounding rock. The analysis and numerical examples presented here demonstrate convergence and computational efficiency of this method.", "paper_title": "Enhanced velocity mixed finite element methods for modeling coupled flow and transport on non-matching multiblock grids Analysis and applications to transport of reactive species in multiphase flow through porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000295166900002"}
