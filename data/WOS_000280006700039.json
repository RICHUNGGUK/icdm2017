Here, we propose a novel fusion approach based on semantic information, and embodied on many levels. Sensor fusion is based on spatial relationship of parts-based classifiers, being performed via a Markov logic network. The proposed system deals with partial segments, it is able to recover depth information even if the laser fails, and the integration is modeled through contextual information characteristics not found on previous approaches. Experiments in pedestrian detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over data sets gathered in urban scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
