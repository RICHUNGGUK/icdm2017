A fuzzy scheduling method using provenance information is proposed. In this method, resource dispatch probability is dynamically adjusted according to user feedback information, which is user appreciation information represented by fuzzy variables. To minimize the influence of cheating, collusive and decrying of user appreciations, provenance information is used to estimate trust factor of each user appreciation during resource dispatch probability adjustment process. Simulation results confirm capability of the proposed method to effectively reduce impacts of malicious user appreciations and increase user satisfactions.", "paper_title": "A reliable scheduling method in equipment grid using provenance information", "paper_id": "WOS:000322901700006"}
