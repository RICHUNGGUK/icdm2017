The increase in performance is due to the buried oxide layer, which provides a dramatic decrease in the source and drain junction capacitance, as well as a reduction in the traditional back biasing resulting from the body effect. The reported performance increases have been between 20% and 35%. However, this increase in performance comes at a cost of complexity from a performance measurement and delay testing perspective. Where the SOI transistor is faster than the bulk transistor, there exists a variation in delay caused by threshold voltage shifts that must be accounted for during manufacturing test. This paper explores these issues and proposes new test techniques for this promising technology.", "paper_title": "Delay testing of partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (PD-SOI) circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239405100003"}
