By approximating the aggregate interference with that caused by the nearest CR interferer, the exact analytical moment generating function for the nearest interferer is derived for cases of no power control and distance based power control. The outage probability based on the approximation is derived, which is a tight lower bound under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "On Approximating the Cognitive Radio Aggregate Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500016"}
