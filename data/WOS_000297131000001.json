An important characteristic of this task is the combination of predictive and descriptive induction. An overview related to the task of subgroup discovery is presented. This review focuses on the foundations, algorithms, and advanced studies together with the applications of subgroup discovery presented throughout the specialised bibliography.", "paper_title": "An overview on subgroup discovery: foundations and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000297131000001"}
