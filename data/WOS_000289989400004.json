Most of them are static in the sense that they detect pattern in stable data structures, i.e. the data structure remains unchanged over time. However, many real-life situations are characterized by changing data environments that require an adaptation of the respective algorithms. The retail industry, for example, is frequently faced with changes in its customers' buying behavior. Segments of customers that are buying certain goods may vary within one year or even within one single day. Detecting these changes could provide business opportunities for the respective retailer. For such changing data structures, dynamic clustering algorithms have been developed that adapt to changing environments. This paper discusses a class of rough partitive algorithms and introduces their possible dynamic extensions.
