They provide multiple interactive functions for users to create and use large social networks. To determine why people exhibit 'stickiness' to SNSs, this study uses the uses and gratifications theory as an underlying structure and builds the research model with factors of motivational needs and interactivity. Our results showed that social needs, information needs, human-message interaction, and human-human interaction are crucial factors that affect the 'stickiness' of users to SNSs. The implications of these findings are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Understanding the intentions of users to 'stick' to social networking sites: a case study in Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000347533500005"}
