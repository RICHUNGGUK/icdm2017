The method is based on an explicit drop out of the inertial terms in the normal SPH equations, and solves the coupled system to find the velocities of the particles using the conjugate gradient method. The method will be called NSPH which refers to the non-inertial character of the equations. Whereas the time-step in standard SPH formulations for low Reynolds numbers is linearly restricted by the inverse of the viscosity and quadratically by the particle resolution, the stability of the NSPH solution benefits from a higher viscosity and is independent of the particle resolution. Since this method allows for a much higher time-step, it solves creeping flow problems with a high resolution and a long timescale up to three orders of magnitude faster than SPH. In this paper, we compare the accuracy and capabilities of the new NSPH method to canonical SPH solutions considering a number of standard problems in fluid dynamics. In addition, we show that NSPH is capable of modeling more complex physical phenomena such as the motion of a red blood cell in plasma. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
