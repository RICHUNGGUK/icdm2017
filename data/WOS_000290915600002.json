We study the proposed methods on a wide set of problems including theoretically hand-tailored benchmarks and complex real-life applications from the field of drug discovery, with a particular focus on the generalization ability of the obtained solutions. We show that the proposed repulsive multi-swarm system has a better optimization ability than all the other presented methods on all the studied problems. Interestingly, the proposed repulsive multi-swarm system is also the one that returns the most general solutions.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Study of Four Parallel and Distributed PSO Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000290915600002"}
