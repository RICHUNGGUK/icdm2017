A mobility simulator was implemented in order to represent a hypothetical city, which was populated with different groups of users, whose mobility behavior and demand for different kinds of services was generated in order to simulate a typical 24-h day behavior. Given the generated demand at a certain period of time, a server allocation is made in order to attend it. This is done by modeling the system as an integer-programming problem and by, afterwards, running an optimization algorithm on it. The output from the optimization process was used to reconfigure the system by activating the selected servers and deactivating the others. The problem turned out to be NP-hard, so a heuristic method was necessary in order to solve it. We chose the Lagrangean relaxation technique to do the task, and obtained good results in terms of the solution proximity to the optimum. The per-formed experiments demonstrated the model's sensitivity to different kinds of parameters, such as user mobility, demand distribution over time and space, time of day, type of area where events occur, and the relation between fixed and variable costs of the system. A significant system cost reduction was also achieved. The proposed approach allows a personalized and demand driven resource distribution.
