Based on RSA encryption algorithm, we design a dynamic password encryption and codec algorithm, and propose a mechanism on computer access permission management which is capable of dealing with situations both online and offline. In the offline mode, administrators can authenticate users by matching their contact information to that registered in administrators' mobile terminal. Generated by the co-work of a personal computer and a mobile terminal, the dynamic password makes cracking the password a trickier task. Permission control information is also added into the dynamic password, and file filter system will be loaded once the screen is successfully unlocked, so as to protect private directories or files from being accessed without authorization. In online mode, the system provides real-time video for identity verification, which makes the system more secure and convenient. Experiment results show that this dynamic password based mechanism on computer access permission management is efficient in dealing with existing problems in personal privacy and access permission management.", "paper_title": "Mechanism on Computer Access Permission Management Based on the Proposed Dynamic Password Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600037"}
