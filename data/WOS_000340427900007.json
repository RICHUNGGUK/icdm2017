In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.", "paper_title": "An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point-Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems With Box Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000340427900007"}
