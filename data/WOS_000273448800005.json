Conditional value-at-risk is considered as a risk measure. Results of a computational study are presented and indicate that the approach is capable of producing high-quality approximations to the efficient sets with a modest computational effort. The best results are achieved with a new hybrid approach, combining Tabu Search and Variable Neighbourhood Search.", "paper_title": "A multiobjective metaheuristic for a mean-risk multistage capacity investment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000273448800005"}
