The frog vision perception model is used in this algorithm. First the suspect regions are detected, and then the static and the dynamic features of the regions are chosen for the smoke ROF detection. Experimental results show that the algorithm is efficient and significant for improving the operational rate of the detection.", "paper_title": "AN ALGORITHM FOR SMOKE ROF DETECTION BASED ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO", "paper_id": "WOS:000316911700010"}
