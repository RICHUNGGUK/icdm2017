In the research filed of wireless sensor network, more attention has been paid to design energy efficient clustering schemes to save every possible bit of energy. This paper proposes an energy efficient clustering algorithm for dynamic wireless sensor network. The proposed algorithm elects the nodes that have more energy and less mobility as cluster heads and constantly monitors cluster head's residual energy. If the energy fell lower than the Off-duty Threshold, the reclustering operation will be triggered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Weight Clustering Algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Novel Energy Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Dynamic Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600012"}
