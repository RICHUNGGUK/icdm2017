To solve the problem induced by some complicated expectation evaluations, we proposed two approximations based on Monte Carlo method and Laplace approximation respectively. With high accuracy, the algorithm we derived is much more computationally efficient than the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The simulation examples are used to demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm versus MCMC. The proposed approach is further illustrated on a real dataset. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
