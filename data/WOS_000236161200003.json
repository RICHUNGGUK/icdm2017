These methods were originally described in Glover and Laguna [Tabu search. Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers; 1997] but have been largely ignored in the tabu search literature. For the purpose of testing, we employ a single-attribute implementation of a short-term memory procedure for the solution of a single machine scheduling problem. Computational experiments that employ instances with up to 200 jobs reveal the usefulness of the tabu cycle and the conditional probability methods as viable alternatives for managing the short-term memory in a tabu search implementation.
