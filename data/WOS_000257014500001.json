Furthermore, we compare this workload distribution with an M/G/1 queue and get insights on the better-than-Poisson property of regulated flows. We conclude that the superposition of independent regulated flows generates an asymptotically smaller workload than a marked Poisson process whose service times and intensity depend on the parameters of regulated sources.
