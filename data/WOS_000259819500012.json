A numerically tractable procedure for computing a stabilising feedback matrix is developed via linear matrix inequality techniques. This is subsequently applied to solve, for the first time, various 2-D disturbance decoupling problems subject to a closed-loop stability constraint.", "paper_title": "A geometric theory for 2-D systems including notions of stabilisability", "paper_id": "WOS:000259819500012"}
