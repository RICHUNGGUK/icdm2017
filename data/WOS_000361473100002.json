We show how to obtain an extended formulation for this polytope from any sorting network. By using the optimal Ajtai-Komls-Szemer,di sorting network, this extended formulation has variables and inequalities. Furthermore, from basic polyhedral arguments, we show that this is best possible (up to a multiplicative constant) since any extended formulation has at least inequalities. The results easily extend to the generalized permutahedron.", "paper_title": "Smallest compact formulation for the permutahedron", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100002"}
