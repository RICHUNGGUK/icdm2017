Involutive negators are of particular interest. Every monotone [0,1] -> [0,1] bijection is a composition of at most four involutive negators. Involutive negators are geometrically recognized by the symmetry of their graph w.r.t. the first bisector. If the graph of an automorphism has an alternating behavior, we can generate the automorphism by a pair of involutive negators.", "paper_title": "Negation and affirmation: the role of involutive negators", "paper_id": "WOS:000244305200006"}
