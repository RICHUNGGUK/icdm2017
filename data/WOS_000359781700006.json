We say that w is (m) over tilde -embeddable in v, if there exists an increasing sequence (n(i) : i >= 0) of integers with n(0) = 0, such that 1 <= n(i) - n(i-1) <= (m) over tilde, w(i) = v(n(i)) for all i >= 1. Let X and Y be coin-tossing sequences. We will show that there is an (m) over tilde with the property that Y is (m) over tilde -embeddable into X with positive probability. This answers a question that was open for a while. The proof generalizes somewhat the hierarchical method of an earlier paper of the author on dependent percolation.
