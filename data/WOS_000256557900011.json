We show that this gathering problem is no harder than its special case for k = 2, called the rendezvous problem, and design deterministic protocols solving the rendezvous problem with arbitrary startups in rings and in general networks. The measure of performance is the number of steps since the startup of the last agent until the rendezvous is achieved. For rings we design an oblivious protocol with cost O(n log l), where n is the size of the network and l is the minimum label of participating agents. This result is asymptotically optimal due to the lower bound showed by [A. Dessmark, P. Fraigniaud, D. Kowalski, A. Pelc, Deterministic rendezvous in graphs, Algorithmica 46 (2006) 69-96]. For general networks we show a protocol with cost polynomial in n and log l, independent of the maximum difference tau of startup times, which answers in the affirmative the open question by [A. Dessmark, P. Fraigniaud, D. Kowalski, A. Pelc, Deterministic rendezvous in graphs, Algorithmica 46 (2006) 69-96]. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
