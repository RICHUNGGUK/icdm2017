Standard results in continuous DC theory are exported to the discrete DC theory with the use of discrete convex analysis. A discrete DC algorithm, which is a discrete analogue of the continuous DC algorithm (Concave-Convex procedure in machine learning) is proposed. The algorithm contains the submodular-supermodular procedure as a special case. Exploiting the polyhedral structure of discrete convex functions, the algorithms tailored to specific types of discrete DC functions are proposed.", "paper_title": "A framework of discrete DC programming by discrete convex analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000358292600014"}
