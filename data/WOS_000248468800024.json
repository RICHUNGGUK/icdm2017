The features are extracted from a single high-resolution gray-scale image of the palmar surface of the hand using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) appearance-based feature-extraction approach. The information contained in the extracted features is combined at the matching-score level. The resolutions of the palmprint, digitprint and fingerprint sub-images, the similarity/dissimilarity measures, the matching-score normalization technique, and the fusion rule at the matching-score level, which optimize the system performance, were determined experimentally. The biometric system, when using a system configuration with optimum parameters, showed an average equal error rate (EER) of 0.0005%, which makes it sufficiently accurate for use in high-security biometric systems.
