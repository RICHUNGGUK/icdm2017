The plant model is considered as a possibility distribution on a plant space and closed loop specifications are given as a fuzzy set of interval gain or phase margins. A set of PI and PD controllers is found that meets the desired specification for each plant of fuzzy set of models. The solution is graphical in nature and uses frequency domain properties of interval control systems.", "paper_title": "PI AND PD CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR FUZZY GAIN AND PHASE MARGIN SPECIFICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100028"}
