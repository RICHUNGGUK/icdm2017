We develop a mathematical framework to explain learnability of empirical relations. Then we classify the degree of learnability according to the degree of predictability by means of timescales. We also use the same mathematical framework to make formal the claim that learnability evolves according not only with the number of observations done, but also with the precision of measurements.", "paper_title": "Incomputability at the foundations of physics (A study in the philosophy of science)", "paper_id": "WOS:000327796100006"}
