The distributed nature of knowledge in groups, teams and other departments of organization and complexity of this tacit knowledge lead us to use community of practice as an environment to share knowledge. In this paper we propose an agent mediated community of a practice system using MAS-CommonKADS methodology. We support the principle of autonomy since every single agent, even those in the same community, needs its own autonomy in order to model an organization and its individuals correctly, using this approach, the natural model for an agent based on knowledge sharing system has been resulted. We presented all models of MAS-CommonKADS methodology required for developing the multi-agent system. We found MAS-CommonKADS useful to design Knowledge Management applications. Because of detailed description of agents, a resulted design model could be simply implemented. We modeled our system using Rebeca and verified it to show that by use of our system, knowledge sharing can be satisfied.", "paper_title": "A multi agent community of practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000249076100011"}
