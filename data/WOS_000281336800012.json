In general, researchers agree on the use of EAP as an authentication framework independent of the underlying technology. To date, efforts have focused on optimizing the authentication process itself, leaving out other relevant but sometimes important aspects like privacy. In this paper we present a solution that provides a lightweight authentication process while preserving user anonymity at the same time. The goal is to define a multi-layered pseudonym architecture that does not affect the fast re-authentication procedure and that allows a user to be untraceable. Taking as reference our previous work in fast re-authentication, we describe the extensions required to support identity privacy. Moreover, results collected from an implemented prototype, reveal that the proposed privacy-enhanced fast re-authentication scheme is attainable without significant cost in terms of performance in 4G foreseeable environments.
