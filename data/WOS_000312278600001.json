The interconnection complexity between two adjacent cells is reduced by using a quaternary inter-cell data transfer scheme. In a cell, the quaternary data is converted into binary dual-rail voltage signals, and hi nary-controlled current steering technique is introduced utilizing a programmable three-level differential-pair circuit to implement an arbitrary two-variable binary logic function and a full-adder sum/carry. In the cell output circuit, switched current sources are used to reduce power dissipation. Moreover, the CMOS logic is used to make driving capability of a ID flip-flop high. As a result, the maximum throughput of the proposed digit-serial reconfigurable VLSI using quaternary cells is twice that of the bit-serial reconfigurable VLSI, while the power-delay product is reduced to 74%. Dramatic improvement of the recontigurable VLSI can be achieved.", "paper_title": "A Digit-Serial Reconfigurable VLSI Based on Quaternary Inter-Cell Data Transfer Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000312278600001"}
