This lifting procedure uses information from multiple constraints of the problem formulation and can be used to strengthen formulations and cuts for mixed-integer programs. In particular, we demonstrate how it can be applied to improve Gomory's fractional cut, which is central to Glover's primal cutting-plane algorithm. We show that the resulting algorithm is finitely convergent. We also present numerical results that illustrate the computational benefits of the proposed lifting procedure.", "paper_title": "Linear-Programming-Based Lifting and Its Application to Primal Cutting-Plane Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000263846400011"}
