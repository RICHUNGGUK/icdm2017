The main difference between the classical ALE and the ReALE method is the rezoning step where we allow change in the topology. This leads for ReALE to a polygonal mesh, which follows more efficiently the flow. We present here a new displacement of generators in order to keep the Lagrangian features, which are usually lost using ALE with fixed topology. The reconnection capability allows to deal with complex geometries and high-vorticity problems contrary to ALE method. The main difficulty of ReALE is the remapping step where we have to remap physical variables on a mesh with a different topology. For this step, a new remapping method based on a swept intersection algorithm has been developed in the case of planar geometries. We present here the extension of the swept intersection-based remapping method to cylindrical geometries. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to several numerical examples up to problem representative of hydrodynamic experiments.
