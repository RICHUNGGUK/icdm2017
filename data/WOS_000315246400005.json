A test E-q separates a pair v(i), v(j) of vertices if vertical bar{v(i), v(j)} boolean AND E-q vertical bar= 1. A subcollection T subset of epsilon is a test cover if each pair v(i), v(j) of distinct vertices is separated by a test in T. The objective is to find a test cover of minimum cardinality, if one exists. This problem is NP-hard. We consider two parameterizations of the Test Cover problem with parameter k: (a) decide whether there is a test cover with at most k tests, (b) decide whether there is a test cover with at most vertical bar V vertical bar - k tests. Both parameterizations are known to be fixed-parameter tractable. We prove that none have a polynomial size kernel unless NP subset of coNP/poly. Our proofs use the cross-composition method recently introduced by Bodlaender et al. (2011) and parametric duality introduced by Chen et al. (2005). The result for the parameterization (a) was an open problem (private communications with Henning Fernau and Jiong Guo, Jan.-Feb. 2012). We also show that the parameterization (a) admits a polynomial size kernel if the size of each test is upper-bounded by a constant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
