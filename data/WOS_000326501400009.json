From both economic and applicable concerns, designers always would like to provide guaranteed QoS of coverage of WSNs. In this paper, we address two path-coverage problems in WSNs, maximum k-support path coverage (a.k.a. best case coverage) and minimum k-breach path coverage (a.k.a. worst case coverage), in which every point on the desired resultant path is covered by at least k sensors simultaneously while optimizing certain objectives. We present two polynomial-time approaches to find optimal solutions for both maximum k-support coverage problem and minimum k-breach coverage problem. The time complexity of both algorithms are O(k(2)n log n), where n is the number of deployed sensor nodes and k is the coverage degree. In addition, a number of properties of kth-nearest point Voronoi diagram are presented, which is new to the literature.", "paper_title": "Finding Best and Worst k-Coverage Paths in Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400009"}
