The RBC and plasma were discretized by particles that have the characteristics of an elastic membrane and a viscous fluid, respectively. The membrane particles were connected to their neighboring membrane particles by springs, and the motion of the particles was determined on the basis of the minimum energy principle. The incompressible flow of plasma that was expressed by the motion of the fluid particles was determined by the moving-particle semi-implicit (MPS) method. The RBC motion and plasma flow were weakly coupled. The two-dimensional simulation of blood flow between parallel plates demonstrated the capability of the proposed method to express the blood flow phenomena observed in experiments, such as the downstream motion of the RBC and the deformation of the RBC into a parachute shape.
