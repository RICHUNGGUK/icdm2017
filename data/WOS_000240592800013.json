The main idea is to replace the building blocks used in block ciphers by equivalent stream cipher components. In order to illustrate this approach, we construct a very simple synchronous stream cipher which provides a lot of flexibility for hardware implementations, and seems to have a number of desirable cryptographic properties.", "paper_title": "A stream cipher construction inspired by block cipher design principles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800013"}
