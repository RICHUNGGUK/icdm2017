This paper presents a novel method to reject omnidirectional disturbances by optimizing the accelerations of the floating base of the robot. The optimized accelerations keep the desired external forces within their constraints and generate coordinated whole-body motion to reject disturbances from all directions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations with disturbance-rejection scenarios.", "paper_title": "OMNIDIRECTIONAL DISTURBANCE REJECTION FOR A BIPED ROBOT BY ACCELERATION OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000341990500002"}
