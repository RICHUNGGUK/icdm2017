Image analysis techniques are used to compute two set of shape features describing the shape of the most common foraminifera shells. A k-nearest neighbor and a multiplayer perceptron classifiers are compared for automated classification of the chambers arrangement. Experimental results show 87.1 and 97.1% of accuracy using, respectively, k-nearest neighbor and multiplayer perceptron.", "paper_title": "A neural network for classification of chambers arrangement in foraminifera", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835400033"}
