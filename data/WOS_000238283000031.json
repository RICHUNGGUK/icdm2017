One drawback of this scheme is that the number of elements in the public parameter is rather large. Here we propose a generalisation of Waters scheme. In particular, we show that there is an interesting trade-off between the tightness of the security reduction and smallness of the public parameter. For a given security level, this implies that if one reduces the number of elements in public parameter then there is a corresponding increase in the computational cost due to the increase in group size. This introduces a flexibility in choosing the public parameter size without compromising in security. In concrete terms, to achieve 80-bit security for 160-bit identities we show that compared to Waters protocol the public parameter size can be reduced by almost 90% while increasing the computation cost by 30%. Our construction is proven secure in the standard model without random oracles. Additionally, we show that CCA security can also be achieved through the reduction to oracle decision bilinear Dife-Hellman problem (OBDH).", "paper_title": "Trading time for space: Towards an efficient IBE scheme with short(er) public parameters in the standard model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283000031"}
