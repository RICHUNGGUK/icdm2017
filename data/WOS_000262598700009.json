These distinctive facial features are called self-features. Compared with traditional Mean Face Model (MFM) that is unable to quantify these self-features well, a Self-Reference Model (SRM) is presented in this paper. Firstly, based on the physiology structure of a front face, a self-reference is found, and this reference is used to measure the self-features. According to the self-reference, some standard facial parameters are worked out by collecting statistic data of many facial images. Then, in an input face image, by evaluating some differences between the input face and the standard facial parameters, the self-features are properly estimated and quantified. Finally, by analyzing some caricatures produced by caricaturists, the SRM can prove the validity of the proposed Algorithm.", "paper_title": "A NEW METHOD FOR FACIAL FEATURES QUANTIFICATION OF CARICATURE BASED ON SELF-REFERENCE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598700009"}
