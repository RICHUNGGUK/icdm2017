Based on differential inclusion theory and nonsmooth analysis, some sufficient conditions are presented by means of the generalized Lyapunov method. The results are established in form of linear matrix inequality. In addition, Some numerical examples are proposed to show the effectiveness of the developed results.", "paper_title": "Passivity analysis for delayed discontinuous neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822900006"}
