The authors describe three approaches to the role of author self-citations and possible conflicts arising from the different perspectives. From the bibliometric viewpoint we can conclude that that there is no reason for condemning self-citations in general or for removing them from macro or meso statistics; supplementary indicators based on self-citations are, nonetheless, useful to understand communication patterns.", "paper_title": "A concise review on the role of author self-citations in information science, bibliometrics and science policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237888500008"}
