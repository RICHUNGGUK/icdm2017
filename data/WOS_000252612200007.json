Motion is modeled as a discrete-time Markov process, and minimization of the discounted, infinite-horizon average cost is addressed. The structure of jointly optimal paging and registration policies is investigated through the use of dynamic programming for partially observed Markov processes. It is shown that there exist policies with a certain simple form that are jointly optimal. An iterative algorithm for policies with the simple form is proposed and investigated. The algorithm alternates between paging policy optimization, and registration policy optimization. It finds a pair of individually optimal policies. Majorization theory and Riesz's rearrangement inequality are used to show that jointly optimal paging and registration policies are given for symmetric or Gaussian random walk models by the nearest-location-first paging policy and distance threshold registration policies.", "paper_title": "Paging and registration in cellular networks: Jointly optimal policies and an iterative algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000252612200007"}
