Over the past decades, a number of computable models of visual inpainting have been developed, but most of these models are based on the pixel domain. Little theoretical and computational work of visual inpainting is based on the compressed domain. In this paper, a visual inpainting model in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain is proposed. DCT coefficients of the non-inpainting blocks are utilized to get block features, and those block features are propagated to the inpainting region iteratively. The experimental results with I frames of MPEG4 are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A visual inpainting method based on the compressed domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800030"}
