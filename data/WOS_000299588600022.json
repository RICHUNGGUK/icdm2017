In the proposed architecture, only one AES encryption core is used and the operation of the CTR and the CBC-MAC is processed concurrently within one round. With this design approach, we can design sequential AES CCM architecture having 570Mbps@102.4 MHz throughput and 1,397 slices at a Spartan3 3s5000 device.", "paper_title": "Efficient Sequential Architecture of AES CCM for the IEEE 802.16e", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588600022"}
