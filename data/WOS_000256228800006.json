However the expressive power of S5 is too weak and, for instance, we cannot express that the space S has exactly n equivalence classes ( we say that S is roughly-finite and n is the rough cardinality of S). For this reason we extend the modal logic S5 with a new box modality [ S] A, where S is the complement of R i.e. the discernibility relation of W. We propose a complete axiomatization, in this new language, of the logic ROUGH(n) corresponding to the class of approximation spaces with rough cardinality n. We prove that the satisfiability problem for ROUGH(n) is NP-complete.", "paper_title": "A modal logic for Pawlak's approximation spaces with rough cardinality n", "paper_id": "WOS:000256228800006"}
