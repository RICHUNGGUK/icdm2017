Our optimization goal is to maximize the crossing angle resolution (i.e., the minimum angle formed by any two crossing edges) and/or the vertex angle resolution (i.e., the minimum angle formed by two edges incident to the same vertex) of the drawing. We provide tight and almost tight worst case bounds for the crossing angle resolution and for the total angle resolution (i.e., the minimum of crossing and vertex angle resolution), respectively.
