At present, various methods have introduced to optimize such problems. One of the optimization methods is the Compromise Programming (CP) method. Considering increasing importance of investment in financial portfolios, we propose a new method, called Nadir Compromising Programming (NCP) by expanding a CP-based method for optimization of multi-objective problems. In order to illustrate NCP performance and operational capability, we implement a case study by selecting a portfolio with 35 stock indices of Iran stock market. Results of comparing the CP method and proposed method under the same conditions indicate that NCP method results are more consistent with DM purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
