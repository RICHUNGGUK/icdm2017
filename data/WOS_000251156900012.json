We add the fourth derivatives to our previous P-stable six-step method to increase the accuracy. We apply two classes of well-known problems to our new method and compare it with the previous methods. The numerical results show that the new method is much more stable, accurate and efficient than the previous methods.", "paper_title": "A P-stable eighteenth-order six-step method for periodic initial value problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251156900012"}
