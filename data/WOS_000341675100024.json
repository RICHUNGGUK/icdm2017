Among the 3018 articles retrieved from 5 academic databases by a comprehensive search, 59 articles were identified manually and then analyzed. The distribution and trends analyzed were research methods, study disciplines, learning content, technology used, and intended settings of the gesture-based learning systems. Furthermore, instructional interventions were also analyzed based on the learning context or the sub-education domain to which they belonged to ascertain if any instructional intervention was applied in these systems. It was found that experimental design research is the most commonly used method (72.9%) followed by design-based research (203%). The findings indicate that Nintendo Wii is the gesture-based device that is the most often used (40%), while the domain in which the technology is most frequently used is special education (42.4%). The same trend was also found in a further analysis which identified that the domain which uses Wii the most is special education (70%). Among all the identified learning topics, motor skills learning has the highest percentage (44%). When grouping these topics into three domains of knowledge (procedural, conceptual, and both), the result demonstrates that both procedural and conceptual type of knowledge are equally distributed in the gesture-based learning studies. Finally, a comparison of instructional intervention of gesture-based learning systems in different sub-education domains is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
