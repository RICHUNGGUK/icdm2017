For that purpose, standard methods such as continued fractions and power/asymptotic series are combined with direct integrations of the Schrodinger equation in order to provide very stable calculations, even for large values of vertical bar eta vertical bar or vertical bar J(l)vertical bar Moreover, a simple analytic continuation for R(z) < 0 is introduced, so that this zone of the complex z-plane does not pose any problem. This code is particularly well suited for low-energy calculations and the calculation of resonances with extremely small widths. Numerical instabilities appear, however, when both vertical bar eta vertical bar and vertical bar J(l)vertical bar are large and vertical bar R(l)vertical bar comparable or smaller than vertical bar J(l)vertical bar.", "paper_title": "Precise Coulomb wave functions for a wide range of complex l, eta and z", "paper_id": "WOS:000244339700007"}
