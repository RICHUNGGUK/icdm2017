This, in turn, is leading to a compelling need for new methods for compression and fast retrieval of SNP data. Results: We present a novel algorithm and file format for compressing and retrieving SNP data, specifically designed for large-scale association studies. Our algorithm is based on two main ideas: (i) compress linkage disequilibrium blocks in terms of differences with a reference SNP and (ii) compress reference SNPs exploiting information on their call rate and minor allele frequency. Tested on two SNP datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art software tools, our compression algorithm is shown to be competitive in terms of compression rate and to outperform all tools in terms of time to load compressed data.", "paper_title": "Compression and fast retrieval of SNP data", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600012"}
