Recently, 3-D palmprint recognition was proposed to further improve the performance of palmprint systems. This paper presents a simple yet efficient scheme for 3-D palmprint recognition. After calculating and enhancing the mean-curvature image of the 3-D palmprint data, we extract both line and orientation features from it. The two types of features are then fused at either score level or feature level for the final 3-D palmprint recognition. The experiments on The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 3-D palmprint database, which contains 8000 samples from 400 palms show that the proposed feature extraction and fusion methods lead to promising performance.", "paper_title": "3-D Palmprint Recognition With Joint Line and Orientation Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000287652800012"}
