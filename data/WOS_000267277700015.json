Design/methodology/approach - The PM motors exhibit inherent cogging torque, which creates torque ripple and prevents smooth rotation of the rotor resulting in undesirable vibration and noise. While cogging torque minimization is necessary to improve PM motor performance, several FEM models have been developed to study and present data demonstrating sensitivity of the cogging torque to the applied interlocks. A procedure that would predict and evaluate cogging torque components relative to chosen number and positions of interlocks was proposed. Findings - On the basis of theoretical considerations, which were verified by numerous performed simulations using different FEM models, it was found out and proved that interlocks in the stator back-iron cause the phenomenon of additional cogging torque harmonic components (AHC). Taking into account presented theoretical aspects motor designers can predict, which AHC will comprise the cogging torque. Each motor design has its own optimal value of interlocks, therefore a precise study should be performed during the design process. Practical implications - By utilizing presented method and considering recommendations, advanced designers of PM motors will have a reliable tool for predicting the order and the level of ABC in total cogging torque due to the stator lamination stacking methods. Originality/value - The paper presents theoretical aspects and analytical equations of AHC of PM motors. So far, the authors dealing with the cogging torque of the PM motors did not take into account the influence of the stator lamination stacking method on the level of torque oscillations. The new contribution is also the study of the sensitivity of different motor designs to the number and position of interlocks, which enables the minimization of the AHC in order to fulfil stringent market demands for low-cogging torque level.", "paper_title": "Phenomena of additional cogging torque components influenced by stator lamination stacking methods in PM motors", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700015"}
