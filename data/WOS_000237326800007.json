In that case, mixed hardware/software implementations are to be investigated. This paper presents the design of a HW/SW G.729 voice decoder dedicated to embedded systems. The decoder has been built around, on the one hand a reconfigurable digital circuit (FPGA) to achieve the so called IP hardware part-the autocorrelation computation-using a linear systolic array, and on the other hand a digital signal processor (DSP) for the remainder of the algorithm. Apart such an implementation is typically driven by the use of reusable component (IP) it is of great interest for new G729-based applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) for example. It results in an overall reduction of the execution time per frame. Another interesting point is the design of a parameterizable autocorrelation block which can be useful for a wide range of applications such as GSM 13 Kbit/s, APC 9.6 Kbit/s and G723 6.3 Kbit/s and 5.3 Kbit/s. In the G729 context and using a V50 Virtex FPGA, the execution time of this function is 10 times faster than a TMS320C6201 DSP implementation.", "paper_title": "G729 voice decoder design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237326800007"}
