In order to deal with this problem, we developed the Distributed Cooperative Modeling System (DCMS) by integrating our achievements [1]-[5]. The paper introduces how to analyze a complex problem using DCMS, with distributed templates from multiple experts, historical templates based on statistical data, and trend templates deduced from historical data, with the example of analyzing \"diversification of Macao industries\"", "paper_title": "Problem Analyzing by Distributed, History and Trend Templates with Integrated Supporting of DCMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553700016"}
