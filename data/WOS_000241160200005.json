Although this tradition does not represent a coherent set of principles and methods for system development, they share some common ideas and goals related to user involvement, participatory design and democracy at the work place. Even if some of the most basic ideas are inherent in our understanding of the IS field to day, many of the lessons from the past may have been forgotten. Some do also claim that the dominant understanding of eGovernment is primarily based on efficiency, customer orientation and competition. I will argue that advanced development and use of ICT also can support ideals and goals similar to those of the Scandinavian approaches to IS; we should not least have a greater focus on studying the consequences of various approaches to system design, implementation and use.", "paper_title": "What role has Scandinavian IS tradition in eGovernment implementations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241160200005"}
