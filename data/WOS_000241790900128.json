In order to mention dynamic population and appropriate diversity, we introduce a bi-shape-space coding mechanism into a discrete immune network. To evaluate the efficiency of IDIN, we implemented three benchmark functions with various dimensions, and compared our results with other algorithms based on immune algorithm or the developed version of Genetic Algorithms. We have obtained similar or better results than those of others.", "paper_title": "An improved discrete immune network for multimodal optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900128"}
