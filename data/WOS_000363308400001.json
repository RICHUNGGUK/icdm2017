A common interest among researchers of different disciplines, practising artists and art institutes is the interaction between audience and artwork. This paper introduces the term 'audience-artwork interaction' to facilitate research in this field and raises the question: how can we describe the interaction between audience and artwork? We discuss relevant research such as definitions and taxonomies of interaction, classifications of interactive systems and audience behaviour studies. A working definition of audience-artwork interaction is established. Furthermore, a model which describes interaction as a dialogue between the audience and a dynamic work is presented. We identify possible future directions and point out the need for models which describe the audience and artwork's actions and reactions as well as the relationships among them.", "paper_title": "Audience-artwork interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000363308400001"}
