Deterministic models are usually simpler, more easily understood, and less data intensive. However, stochastic models tend to be more realistic, but require significant data to develop a realistic model. We illustrate that when queueing is a defining property of the problem semantics then we need suitable data and a model that allows us to describe and characterise the relationship between the queueing process, its parameters and delay. By comparing an analytic deterministic model with a stochastic simulation of an orthopaedic Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Service, we show that when uncertainty is ignored in the planning stages then there will be a deficiency in the number of staff allocated. This causes queues to build up and it follows that patients will receive a diminished quality of care.", "paper_title": "Do we need stochastic models for healthcare?
