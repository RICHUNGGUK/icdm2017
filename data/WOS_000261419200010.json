In this paper, we introduce a new definition of inclusion measure: hybrid monotonic inclusion measure (S inclusion measure for short). Some inclusion measures defined by other authors and us are proved to be S inclusion measures. Ill addition, as the rational generalization of crisp inclusion relation, we prove most of the S inclusion measures possess some kind of J-transitivity and some properties postulated by Sinha and Dougherty for a reasonable inclusion measure. Similarity measure and distance between two fuzzy sets derived from S inclusion measure possess properties of normal similarity measure and distance. Furthermore, some similarity measures possess J-transitivity and distributivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
