In this research, a two-stage framework for solving dynamic vehicle routing problem is proposed. In the first stage, the sweep method is adopted in vehicle assignment. In the second stage, a tabu search algorithm is implemented to improve routes under real-time information. The framework is implemented in an object-oriented approach and possible benefit from real-time information is illustrated through numerical simulation. The simulation-assignment model, DynaTAIWAN is applied in numerical simulation to evaluate real-time routing strategies in a traffic network. Numerical experiments are conducted in a 50 Nodes Network and a Taichung City. The results show that positive benefits could be achieved through utilization of real-time information with careful design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
