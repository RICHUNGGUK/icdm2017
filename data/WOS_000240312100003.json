Based on the assumption that guidelines are similar to software, we try to carry over techniques from software engineering to guideline development. In this paper, we show how to apply formal methods, namely interactive verification to improve the quality of guidelines. As an example, we have worked on a guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the management of jaundice in newborns. Contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) a formalized model of a nontrivial example guideline, (11) an approach to verify properties of medical guidelines interactively, and (111) verification of a first example property.(1)", "paper_title": "Interactive verification of medical guidelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312100003"}
