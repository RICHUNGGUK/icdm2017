They can be used to identify patients with a specified disease or condition (phenotyping) and to investigate patterns of diagnosis and symptoms. Currently, extracting such information manually is time-consuming and requires considerable expertise. In order to exploit more fully the potential of these large and complex databases, our interdisciplinary team developed generic methods allowing access to different types of user. Materials and methods Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, we have developed an online user-focused system (TrialViz), which enables users interactively to select suitable medical general practices based on two criteria: suitability of the patient base for the intended study (phenotyping) and measures of data quality. Results An end-to-end system, underpinned by an innovative search algorithm, allows the user to extract information in near real-time via an intuitive query interface and to explore this information using interactive visualization tools. A usability evaluation of this system produced positive results. Discussion We present the challenges and results in the development of TrialViz and our plans for its extension for wider applications of clinical research. Conclusions Our fast search algorithms and simple query algorithms represent a significant advance for users of clinical research databases.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the potential of large databases of electronic health records for research using rapid search algorithms and an intuitive query interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000331263600016"}
