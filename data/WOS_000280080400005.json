This method is based on multiscale entropy of recorded surface electromyograms (sEMGs) and support vector classification. The method was evaluated on a single-channel experimental sEMGs recorded from biceps brachii muscle of nine healthy subjects, nine subjects with muscular and nine subjects with neuronal disorders, at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% of maximal voluntary contraction force. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed, deploying binary (healthy/patient) and three-class classification (healthy/myopathic/neuropathic). In the case of binary classification, subjects were distinguished with 81.5% accuracy (77.8% sensitivity at 83.3% specificity). At three-class classification, the accuracy decreased to 70.4% (myopathies were recognized with a sensitivity of 55.6% at specificity 88.9%, neuropathies with a sensitivity of 66.7% at specificity 83.3%). The proposed method is suitable for fast and non-invasive discrimination of healthy and neuromuscular patient groups, but it fails to recognize the type of pathology.", "paper_title": "Multiscale entropy-based approach to automated surface EMG classification of neuromuscular disorders", "paper_id": "WOS:000280080400005"}
