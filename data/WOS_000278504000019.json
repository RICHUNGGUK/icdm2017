In particular we apply these reductions to the well known Adams and Johnson 121 integer linear programming formulation of the QAP. We analyze two cases: In the first case, we study the effect of constraint reduction. In the second case, we study the effect of variable reduction in the case of a sparse cost matrix. Computational experiments with a set of 30 QAPLIB instances, which range from 12 to 32 locations, are presented. The proposed reductions turned out to be very effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
