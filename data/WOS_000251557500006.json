For example, in the case of one binary operation, the free iterative algebra is the algebra of all rational binary trees; if only the left-hand variable is allowed to be iterated, then the free iterative algebra is the algebra of all right-well-founded rational binary trees. In order to express such parametrized iterativity, we work with parametrized endofunctors of Set, i.e. finitary endofunctors H: Set x Set -> Set, and introduce the concept of iterativity for algebras for the endofunctor X -> H(X, X). We then describe free iterative H-algebras. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Algebras with parametrized iterativity", "paper_id": "WOS:000251557500006"}
