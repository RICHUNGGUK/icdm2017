Many existing assessment methods are available, but these are often subjective and unrepeatable. Repeatability, objectivity, and increased fidelity are desired. An architecture assessment methodology capable of achieving these objectives is possible by drawing on the strengths of existing approaches while addressing their collective weaknesses. The proposed methodology is the Canonical Decomposition Fuzzy Comparative approach. The theoretical foundations of this methodology are developed herein and tested through the assessment of three physical architectures for a peer-to-peer wireless network. An extensible modeling framework is established to decompose high-level system attributes into technical performance measures suitable for analysis via computational modeling. Canonical design primitives are used to assess antenna performance in the form of a comparative analysis between the baseline free space gain patterns and the installed gain patterns. Finally, a fuzzy inference system is used to interpret the comparative feature set and offer a numerical assessment. The results of this experiment support the assertion that the proposed methodology is well suited for exposing integration sensitivity and assessing coupled performance in physical architecture concepts.", "paper_title": "The Canonical Decomposition Fuzzy Comparative Methodology for Assessing Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000290991900010"}
