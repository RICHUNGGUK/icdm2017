To provide an expression of the electromagnetic power flow that is alternative to the Poynting's theorem expression, overcomes its postulate feature, and is particularly suitable for electric circuit elements. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proceeds from fundamental electromagnetic laws and, independently of Poynting's formulation, follows an approach that generalize established double formulations of the electrostatic and magnetostatic energies. Findings - The paper proposes a compact and straightforward expression of the electromagnetic power flow based on the fundamental electromagnetic field sources, i.e. charge and current densities. Practical implications - The achieved expression confirms Poynting's expression in the case of electric elements, overcoming its arbitrariness, generalizes previous partial results by other authors, deduced via the Poynting's power balance. Originality/value - Is promising in the computation of power flow electromagnetic devices connected in electrical circuits, i.e. for coupled problems where the analysis of electromagnetic system interfaced to electric circuits is required. Due to its simple structure and straightforward deduction it has educational value to demonstrate the expressions of the electric power in circuit elements.", "paper_title": "A straightforward deduction of the electric circuit power", "paper_id": "WOS:000295345200012"}
