The proposed protocol features the utilization of azimuth angle of the nodes involved and opportunistic selection of the relaying node via contention among neighbors. First, the protocol with precise angle information is discussed and its multi-hop performance is evaluated by means of both simulation and analysis in terms of average number of hops to the sink node. Simulation results show that it performs well especially in network connectivity. As a complement, node mobility is also introduced to evaluate multi-hop performance in real environments. Then, a simple MAC scheme to ensure that the node with the highest angular advantage will be selected as a relay is proposed, and subsequently energy and latency performances based on it are evaluated. It is shown that our protocol can effectively deliver data with half number of active neighbors required in geographical random forwarding, (GeRaF). Finally, a practical method is presented to estimate azimuth angle, combined with which, our forwarding protocol is shown to achieve the performance very close to the case with precise angle information.
