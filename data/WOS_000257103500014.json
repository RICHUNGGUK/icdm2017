To this end, 30 first year students of the foreign language education (FLE) department followed a four-week component of an ICTs-integrated reading skills course. To examine the students' attitudes towards the course and the new learning environment at the end of the teaching period, an attitude questionnaire was administered and interviews were conducted. The findings indicate that despite the difficulties they faced, the students were satisfied overall with the application of ICTs in their reading course and developed positive attitudes towards online courses.
