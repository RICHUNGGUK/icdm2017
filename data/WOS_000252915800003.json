In this paper, an efficient methodology for the design of high-speed two-stage operational amplifiers based on settling time is proposed. Concerning the application of the operational amplifier, it specifies proper open-loop circuit parameters to obtain the desired settling time and closed-loop stability. As the effect of transfer function zeros has been taken into account, the proposed methodology becomes more accurate in achieving the desired specifications. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the methodology. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
