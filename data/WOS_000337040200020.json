StochHMM provides a command-line program and C++ library that can implement a traditional HMM from a simple text file. StochHMM provides researchers the flexibility to create higher-order emissions, integrate additional data sources and/or user-defined functions into multiple points within the HMM framework. Additional features include user-defined alphabets, ability to handle ambiguous characters in an emission-dependent manner, user-defined weighting of state paths and ability to tie transition probabilities to sequence.", "paper_title": "StochHMM: a flexible hidden Markov model tool and C plus plus library", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040200020"}
