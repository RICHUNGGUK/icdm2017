We prove the effectiveness of Pyicos to select for significant signals and show that its accuracy is comparable and sometimes superior to that of methods specifically designed for each particular type of experiment. Pyicos facilitates the analysis of a variety of HTS datatypes through its flexibility and memory efficiency, providing a useful framework for data integration into models of regulatory genomics.", "paper_title": "Pyicos: a versatile toolkit for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000297860000002"}
