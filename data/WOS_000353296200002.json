However, storing and transferring sensitive data into the cloud raises legitimate security concerns. In this paper, the authors' propose a new multi-secret sharing approach for deploying data warehouses in the cloud and allowing on-line analysis processing, while enforcing data privacy, integrity and availability. The authors' first validate the relevance of their approach theoretically and then experimentally with both a simple random dataset and the Star Schema Benchmark. The authors also demonstrate its superiority to related methods.", "paper_title": "A Novel Multi-Secret Sharing Approach for Secure Data Warehousing and On-Line Analysis Processing in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000353296200002"}
