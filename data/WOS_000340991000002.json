In safety-critical applications with hard real-time constraints, this is clearly not sufficient because there is an expectation that the application should be schedulable on that platform in all possible scenarios. This paper presents a particular NoC-based multiprocessor architecture, as well as a number of analytical methods that can be derived from that architecture, aiming to allow designers to check, for a given platform configuration, whether all application tasks and communication messages always meet their hard real-time constraints in every possible scenario. Experiments are presented, showing the use of the proposed methods when evaluating different task mapping and platform topologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
