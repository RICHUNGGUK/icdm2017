First, the variation interval of the time-varying delay is divided into several subintervals with equal length. By checking the variation of derivative of the Lyapunov functional in every subinterval, some new criteria on H-infinity performance analysis of the systems are derived in terms of the convexity properties of a matrix inequality and some other new analysis techniques. Then, criteria for the H-infinity control design are presented, which are concluded from the H-infinity performance analysis results. As applications of the derived results, H-infinity performance analysis and H-infinity control design are carried out for some systems, including two numerical systems, linearised truck trailer system and traffic network system. Discussions show that, the proposed method is effective for these systems and much less conservativeness appears than those given in the existing references.", "paper_title": "Delay-fractioning-dependent robust H-infinity control for linear systems with delay in state or input and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300854500003"}
