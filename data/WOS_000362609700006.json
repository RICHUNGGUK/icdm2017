By discretizing the domain with two-node elements, however, ordinary lattice models cannot simulate the Poisson effect in a local (intra-element) sense, which is problematic for some types of analyses. Furthermore, such methods are limited in the range of Poisson ratio values that can be simulated. We present a new approach to remedy such known, yet underappreciated, shortcomings of lattice models. In this approach, the Poisson effect is modeled through the introduction of fictitious stresses into a regular lattice. Capabilities of the new approach are demonstrated through compressive test simulations of homogeneous and heterogeneous materials. The simulation results are compared with theory and those of continuum finite element models. The comparisons show good agreement for arbitrary Poisson ratios (including nu >= 1/3) with respect to nodal displacement, intra-element stress, and nodal stress. This form of discrete method, supplemented by the proposed fictitious measures of stress, retains the simplicity of collections of two-node elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
