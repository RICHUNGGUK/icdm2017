As such, it provides a schematic analysis of many naturally occurring situations. We look at ways in which computability-theoretic structure plays a hierarchical role in natural contexts. We will look at how structure does not just emerge mathematically from information, but how that structure can model the emergence of very basic aspects of the real world of a non-local character. This will be applied to identifying precise hyper-causal content in various real contexts.", "paper_title": "The Computational Roots of Hyper-Causality", "paper_id": "WOS:000287425700007"}
