Members of CSDMS are largely from academic institutions (similar to 75%), followed by federal agencies (similar to 17%), and oil and gas companies (similar to 5%). As an organization that relies on volunteer participation, CSDMS faces unique challenges to scientific collaboration. Encouraging volunteerism among its members to provide and adapt metadata and model code to be sufficiently standardized for coupling is crucial to building an integrated community modeling system. CSDMS must provide the appropriate technical tools and cyberinfrastructure to support a variety of user types, ranging from advanced to novice modelers. In addition, application of these advances in science is key, both into the educational realm and for managers and decision-makers. We here present data on community contributions and novice user engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of CSDMS' strategies toward these two challenges over the first 5 years based on member and user data, surveys, computing logs and web log analysis. Analysis shows that sponsored member participation in annual meetings (similar to 30%) is relatively high. Direct CSDMS governance relies on similar to 4% of members. About 15% of members contributed code and metadata, and a similar 15% use the common supercomputing resources. Technological development and documentation lie predominantly in hands of the funded members, and a small number of others (similar to 3% together). Potential new users are trained in clinics and courses, with positive effects on self-efficacy and recruitment of new advanced developers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
