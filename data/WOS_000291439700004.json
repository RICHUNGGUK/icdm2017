We also consider quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals and phase-shift keying signals with dyne-type detections. We show the quantitative gap between these detection strategies in terms of the capacity, particularly in the quantum-limited region where the quantum noise seriously limits the transmission rate. In particular, we find that for an extremely weak signal input power, use of a multilevel PPM system is a good strategy, whereas for an extremely strong signal, use of a multilevel QAM system is recommended.", "paper_title": "Numerical Evaluation of PPM for Deep-Space Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439700004"}
