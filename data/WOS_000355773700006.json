We adapted the Kolmogorov K41 scaling model into the k-epsilon equations to calculate the turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses of the SWE model. The presented model was also numerically improved by a recently proposed surface gradient upwind method (SGUM) to allow better accuracy in simulating the combined source terms from both the SWE and k-epsilon equations as proven in the recent studies. The proposed model was first tested using the flows induced by multiple obstructions to investigate the utilised k-epsilon and SGUM approaches in the model. The laboratory experiments were also conducted under the non-uniform flow conditions, where the simulated velocities, total kinetic energies (TKE) and turbulence intensities by the proposed model were used to compare with the measurements under different flow non-uniformity conditions. Lastly, the proposed numerical simulation was compared with a standard Boussinesq model to investigate its capability to simulate the measured Reynolds stress. The comparison outcomes showed that the proposed Kolmogorov k-epsilon SWE model can capture the flow turbulence characteristics reasonably well in all the investigated flows. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
