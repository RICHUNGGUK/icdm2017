We prove that the infinitely many synthesized shapes in the deformation sequence share finitely many common Voronoi complexes. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm to compute the common Voronoi complexes efficiently for the deformations, and use these common complexes to compute the synthesized shapes in real time. This makes generating, visualizing, and customizing shape deformations feasible.", "paper_title": "Superimposing Voronoi complexes for shape deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237575800005"}
