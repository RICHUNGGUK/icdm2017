On the other hand, fast marching methods (FMM) are SfS algorithms that use the mechanism of wave propagation to reconstruct the surface. In this paper, the estimation of illumination direction is addressed and we model it as an optimization problem. The idea is to minimize the inconsistency of wave propagation of FMM during the reconstruction. As the consistency of wave propagation is a multi-modal function of illumination direction, genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized. The proposed algorithm is examined on four synthetic models and a real world object. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to benchmark methods. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
