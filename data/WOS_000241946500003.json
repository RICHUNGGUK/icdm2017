The scheme is simple and fast and can provide 1: 1 protection and automatic traffic restoration against the fiber link failure between a remote node ( RN) and any optical network unit (ONU). Simulation results show that fiber failure does not degrade the transmission performance, and the restoration time depends mainly on the switch time of the physical layer. Our protection scheme saves many long fibers, does not influence other normal ONUs, and requires no active device in the RN.
