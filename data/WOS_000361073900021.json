This work aims to study the mechanical behavior of the cavities affected by presence of joints and fractures in the chalk layers. First, an oriented yield criterion based on the theory of multi-mechanisms is developed to account for the presence of double joint sets. Then, a shear strength reduction approach is integrated in this joint model and implemented to study the mechanical stability state of these quarries. This provides some provisions about the effect of joint characterization on strain profiles and failure mechanisms in chalk quarries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
