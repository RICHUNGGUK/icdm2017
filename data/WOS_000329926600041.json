In the present decade, with increases in the number of commuters and vehicles and also with the limitations on today's roads connectivity, implementing new technology in the field of traffic intelligence management has become mandatory. This paper attempts to solve the traffic congestion problem by presenting a mathematical model for controlling the time steps of traffic lights on crossings one of the major characteristics of this method is its universality. The proposed model describes a four-way intersection which uses eight traffic lights (the maximum number possible on such an intersection); these lights can be removed based on the intersection type to create a simpler or special-case model from the original one. Next with respect to the limitations of giving precise and constant values to parameters such as the arrival and departure ratio in the intersection, the maximum and minimum period the light stays green, the congestion on the roads and..., fuzzy models are used because of their tolerance of divergence from the expected constraints and using them our model more closely resembles real life situations and therefore is more practical.", "paper_title": "Presenting a fuzzy model to control and schedule traffic lights", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600041"}
