So developing context-aware applications is still complex and time-consuming. We introduce a workflow embedded middleware called FollowMe. It supports pluggable context-aware applications. FollowMe includes a workflow engine and sustains applications described with pvPDL, which is a workflow definition language proposed specially for context-awareness. The employment of workflow makes the development of applications simplified and the maintenance much easier. We testify the improvement by realizing an example and the related evaluation.", "paper_title": "Toward context-awareness: A workflow embedded middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600078"}
