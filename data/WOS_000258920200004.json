The motivation for our work is the belief that standardized communication models as represented by the numerous Web services related specifications will enrich the semantic content of service intercommunication and are likely to achieve widespread adoption. These two features will help to facilitate the kind of dynamic binding of services advocated by Service Oriented Architectures. Furthermore we maintain that exposing the capabilities offered by these specifications to the end user in a simple and intuitive manner is essential if they are to be used intelligently and flexibly, particularly when the specifications do not address the functional semantics of a service as is the case with WS-RF. We examine the possibilities that WS-RF offers to workflow creation and execution, particularly how it enables a number of optimizations which are useful in scientific workflows to be performed in a standardized manner, and describe the visual interpretation of WS-RF, the underlying technologies that enable this interpretation as well as issues arising from the integration of WS-RF into Triana.", "paper_title": "WS-RF workflow in Triana", "paper_id": "WOS:000258920200004"}
