Continuously and comprehensively reviewing and assessing the entire technical literature to find the most relevant ideas and solutions is cumbersome as engineering innovations are constantly being proposed. In particular, high performance analog circuit design has been at the forefront of technological innovations given their importance in applications, like telecommunications, mobile applications, and health care. This paper proposes a model and mining techniques for representing analog circuit design metaknowledge. The metaknowledge representation includes three components: an associative component presenting the conceptual hierarchy of the considered circuits, a component expressing the performance capabilities (e.g., trade-offs and bottlenecks) of the circuits, and a causal modeling part describing the more likely starting ideas and design plans used to create a circuit. Knowledge structures can be used to tackle new applications, identify opportunities to improve existing circuits, and validate design correctness. A case study illustrates the proposed knowledge structure for a set of 30 modern, high-frequency analog circuits.", "paper_title": "Analog Circuit Design Knowledge Mining: Discovering Topological Similarities and Uncovering Design Reasoning Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100001"}
