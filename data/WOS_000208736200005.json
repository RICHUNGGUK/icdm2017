This popularity has motivated the interest of the scientific community and a lot of research has been carried out in order to improve and study these services. The goal of this paper is to develop a model of an Internet radio service in order to help service managers to predict future situations, avoiding problems in advance. This model has been developed and validated using the information gathered from a real service; thus, it reflects the real behaviour of the users, and the devices and the protocols involved in the service. Also, the model of the service has been integrated in a model of a cable network configured to work under real load conditions. The results of the simulations allow us to draw conclusions about the performance of the service in a real scenario.", "paper_title": "Modelling and simulation of a real Internet radio service", "paper_id": "WOS:000208736200005"}
