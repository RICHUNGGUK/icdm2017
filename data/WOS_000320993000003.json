This promising storage, however, greatly suffers from performance loss because of frequent \"erase-before-write\" and \"garbage collection\" operations. Thus. novel circuit-level, architectural, and algorithmic techniques are currently explored to address these limitations. In parallel with others, current study investigates replacing shared buses in multi-channel architecture of SSDs with an interconnection network to achieve scalable, high throughput, and reliable SSD storage systems. Roughly speaking, such a communication scheme provides superior parallelism that allows us to compensate the main part of the performance loss related to the aforementioned limitations through increasing data storage and retrieval processing throughput.", "paper_title": "Network-on-SSD: A Scalable and High-Performance Communication Design Paradigm for SSDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000320993000003"}
