Using a large administrative data set we test the impact of introducing a blended learning format within the first year of a business education curriculum on course persistence and performance. Our difference-in-difference research design minimizes the potential bias resulting from the selectivity of learners enrolled in blended programmes. We find out that blended learning improves exam results. Although we observe a negative effect on the course persistence of adult learners (increased drop-out due to blended learning), the overall effect on course pass rates remains positive. Implications for practice and follow-up studies are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
