The target error probability is managed according to the time varying error tolerance attributes of the application using the memory at a certain instant in time. This approach enables system designers to abstract the concepts of power awareness, yield and reliability as design tradeoffs-that incorporate application knowledge-early in the design cycle. The paper develops a formal theoretical and practical foundation based on the underlying device statistics upon which both system and circuit designers can investigate error aware design.", "paper_title": "Embedded Memories Fault-Tolerant Pre- and Post-Silicon Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900019"}
