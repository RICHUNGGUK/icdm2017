The size of I is the number of its subspaces. Let sigma (q) (n, t) denote the minimum size of a subspace partition of V in which the largest subspace has dimension t, and let rho (q) (n, t) denote the maximum size of a subspace partition of V in which the smallest subspace has dimension t. In this article, we determine the values of sigma (q) (n, t) and rho (q) (n, t) for all positive integers n and t. Furthermore, we prove that if n a parts per thousand yen 2t, then the minimum size of a maximal partial t-spread in V(n + t -1, q) is sigma (q) (n, t).", "paper_title": "Extremal sizes of subspace partitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000305520100004"}
