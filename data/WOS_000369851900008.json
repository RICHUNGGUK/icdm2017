This has led to an explosive growth of product reviews and customer feedback, which presents the problem of how to handle the abundant volume of data. It is an expensive and time-consuming task to analyze this huge content of opinions. Therefore, the need for automated sentiment analysis systems is vital. However, these systems encounter many challenges; assessing the content quality of the posted opinions is an important area of study that is related to sentiment analysis. Currently, review helpfulness is assessed manually; however the task of automatically assessing it has gained more attention in recent years.
