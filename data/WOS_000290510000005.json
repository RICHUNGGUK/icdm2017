Then by applying the existence result of an equilibrium point and constructing a Lyapunov functional, we discuss global exponential stability for above neural networks. In the last section, we also give an example to demonstrate the validity of our global exponential stability result for above neural network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
