The results showed that the Gibbs free energy difference (C-T - G(S)) values at 298.15K and 1 atm between the skew (S) and trans (T) conformations (Delta G(T-S)) increase from compound 1 to compound 2 but decrease from compound 2 to compound 3. The C conformations of compounds 1-3 are less stable than their S and T conformations. Based on these results, the racemization processes of the axial symmetrical (C-2 symmetry) conformations of compounds 1-3 take place via their T conformations. Based on the optimized ground state geometries using the MP2/6-311+G** level of theory, the NBO analysis of donor-acceptor (bond-antibond) interactions revealed that the stabilization (resonance) energy associated with LP(2)M2 -> sigma*(M3-H4) electronic delocalization for the S conformations of compounds 1-3 are 1.35, 5.94 and 4.68 kcal mol(-1), respectively. There is excellent agreement between the variations of the calculated Delta G(T-S) and stabilization (resonance) energies associated with LP(2)M2 -> sigma*(M3-H4) electronic delocalization for the S conformations of compounds 1-3. The correlations between resonance energies, orbital integrals, dipole moments, bond orders, structural parameters and conformational behaviors of compounds 1-3 have been investigated. Test were made of complete basis set methods (CBS-QB3, CBS-4 and CBS-Q), the first two gave results essentially indistinguishable from those we used, but the CBS-Q results were in disagreement with experimental and other theoretical results.
