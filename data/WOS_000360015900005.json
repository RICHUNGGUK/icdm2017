A complete characterization is provided for the minimum reconstruction distortion under a transmitter power constraint, and it is shown that a simple analog scheme with power control is optimal. More precisely, if the power available to the encoder is below certain threshold, the analog scheme using full power is optimal, however, when the power available to the encoder is above that threshold, analog transmission using only a fixed amount of the available power is optimal. Furthermore, the problem of simultaneous message transmission and Gaussian state amplification with noisy observations is studied, for which an inner bound and two nontrivial outer bounds to the optimal tradeoff between the transmission rate and the state reconstruction distortion are provided. The coding scheme underlying the inner bound combines analog signaling and Gelfand-Pinsker coding, where the latter deviates from the operating point of Costa's dirty paper coding. The first outer bound is obtained by extending the channel decomposition technique, while the second outer bound requires a strategic analysis of the covariance matrix of the relevant random variables.", "paper_title": "Gaussian State Amplification with Noisy Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900005"}
