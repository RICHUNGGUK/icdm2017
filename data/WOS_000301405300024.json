First, a 2D model is established that describes the control action within a repetition period and the learning process between periods. Next, the problem of designing a repetitive controller is formulated as an optimization problem for the 2D model. Then, one-dimensional optimal control theory is used to find an optimal controller. Unlike other methods, this one allows the control and learning actions to be preferentially adjusted. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the validity of this approach.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL REPETITIVE CONTROL BASED ON TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300024"}
