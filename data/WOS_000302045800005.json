The parallelization strategy is based on domain decomposition and message passing paradigms. The algorithmic and implementation aspects are discussed in detail. Paper also describes components of a complete adaptive strategy, i.e., the error estimator/indicator, projection operator and remeshing. The capabilities and performance of the developed framework are demonstrated on advanced engineering problems, showing the scalability of the implemented algorithm and advantages of dynamic load balancing when used in dedicated and nondedicated environments.
