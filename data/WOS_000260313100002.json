The model takes into account low-frequency dispersion due to self-heating and charge-trapping phenomena and provides accurate predictions at frequencies where non-quasi-static effects are important. The model is based on the application of a recently proposed equivalent-voltage approach and is identified by using pulsed measurements of drain current characteristics and pulsed S-parameter sets. Full experimental validation on a GaN on SiC PHEMT is provided at both small- and large-signal operating conditions. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
