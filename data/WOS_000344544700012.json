The possessing and needed velocity increments Delta v and Delta v (n e e d) were taken as the measurement of maneuvering capability of the studied satellite, which were then combined with total mass of the satellite to form the optimization objective in the systematic level of the MDO problem. The design variables and constraints of the MDO problem dealt with disciplines or subsystems as guidance, navigation and control (GNC), power, and structure, and corresponding engineering analysis models were also built. A program system to solve the MDO problem wasdeveloped by integrating a non-nested CO method, the commercial and user-supplied codes on framework software iSIGHT. The result showed that the satellite performance could be obviously improved, which also indicates MDO technique is feasible and effective for the spacecraft design problem. The modeling and optimization procedure of the work can be referred for further research and engineering design.", "paper_title": "Multidisciplinary design modeling and optimizationfor satellite with maneuver capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000344544700012"}
