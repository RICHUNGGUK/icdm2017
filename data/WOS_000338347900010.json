Based on state error information, the weight matrix of the adaptive neural network can be updated on line by using lyapunov function. Therefore, no prior training data is needed for the training of the adaptive neural network. Combined with feedback control, the adaptive neural network can construct the map between the state error information and disturbances to compensate for system disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a series of simulations and flight tests. Compared with feedback control method, the adaptive neural network control method can estimate and eliminate disturbances quickly to yield a good tracking performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Network Control of Small Unmanned Aerial Rotorcraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000338347900010"}
