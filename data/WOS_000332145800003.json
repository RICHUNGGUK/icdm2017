An upper event ontology is first presented as an example of how the ontology is built and how real-life event assertions and their relations are modeled into its hierarchies of type. Three different types are distinguished: an event type as a basic classification of events of similar nature, an event relation type as a predicate on event types, and an event meta-relation type as a predicate of predicates on event types, with formal relationships between them and their properties elicited. The proposed formalization could be leveraged by search engines on the Semantic Web and query-answering systems in specific domains of discourse.", "paper_title": "EVENT INFERENCE WITH RELATION AND META-RELATION TYPE HIERARCHIES IN CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000332145800003"}
