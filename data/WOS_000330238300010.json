However, we have found that based on vector representation of face images, it is not easy to improve the performance of LDA-based methods by incorporating the kernel trick. Actually, in the case that the dimensionality of face images in vector form is far greater than the number of samples, linear classifiers are adequate and it is illogical to increase dimensions of vectors using kernel methods. In order to give full play to the strong point of the kernel technique for manipulating the nonlinearity of pattern distribution, we propose a new image feature extraction method for face recognition, called kernel-based two-dimensional Fisher discriminant analysis (K2DFDA), which deals with a face image directly as a matrix, instead of a stacked vector from rows or columns of the image. Moreover, we present a kernel parameter optimization scheme for K2DFDA, based on the maximum margin criterion and the damped Newton's method. Experimental results show the effectiveness of K2DFDA and its parameter optimization scheme.", "paper_title": "KERNEL-BASED 2D FISHER DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS WITH PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION FOR FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000330238300010"}
