We compare the present work with some well-known results and show that the new method is efficient and applicable COD (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "An approximation algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear Lane-Emden type equations arising in astrophysics using Hermite functions collocation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000277954400014"}
