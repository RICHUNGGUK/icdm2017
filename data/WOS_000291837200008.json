Network flow control and video encoding bit rate are jointly optimized, aiming to maximize the network lifetime at a given power budget and video quality requirement. We develop a generalized power consumption model for video sensors, in which video encoding, data communication and error-control behavior are completely considered. To combat packet loss over wireless channels, a hybrid error-control scheme integrating network coding and ARQ protocol is introduced. It adaptively adjusts the number of redundant coded packets according to ARQ feedbacks with a fixed code structure and decoding algorithm. Through the Lagrange dual and subgradient approach, a fully decentralized algorithm is proposed to solve the target convex problem. Finally, simulation results validate the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm in a large-scale random topology as well as in a small static network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
