Unfortunately, LCA studies require large amounts of data that are difficult to collect in practice, which makes them expensive and time consuming. This work introduces a method that simplifies standard LCA studies by using proxy metrics that are identified following a systematic approach. Our method, which combines multi-linear regression and mixed-integer linear programming, builds in an automatic manner simplified multi-linear regression models of impact that predict (with high accuracy) the damage in different environmental categories from a reduced number of proxy metrics. Our approach was applied to data retrieved from ecoinvent. Numerical results show that few indicators suffice to describe the environmental performance of a process with high accuracy. Our findings will help develop general guidelines for simplified LCA studies that will focus on quantifying a reduced number of key indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
