In this paper, we design two bidding protocols to guide the movement of mobile sensors in such sensor networks to increase the coverage to a desirable level. In the protocols, static sensors detect coverage holes locally by using Voronoi diagrams and bid mobile sensors to move. Mobile sensors accept the highest bids and heal the largest holes. Simulation results show that our protocols achieve suitable trade-off between coverage and sensor cost.", "paper_title": "Bidding protocols for deploying mobile sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000244894900007"}
