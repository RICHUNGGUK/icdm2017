Modeling accurately the pathways of hydrocarbon migration is of important significance in determining the location of favorable petroleum exploration targets. In this paper, GIS-based modeling algorithms are presented for searching the pathways of secondary hydrocarbon migration by considering the geologic mechanisms. These algorithms are constructed on a raster digital elevation model (DEM) of the top boundary of a carrier bed, in which secondary migration occurred. On the DEM, a 3 x 3 pixel sized window is used for searching. The center of the search window is initially assumed at a point on the boundary of a hydrocarbon source area, from which the secondary hydrocarbon migration starts. The altitude values in the eight adjoining pixels enclosing the central pixel of the search window are compared, and the pixel with an altitude value not only larger than the central pixel but also the largest of the eight surrounding pixels is the next target pixel where the search window will move to. Each searched path will terminate at either a convex point, which indicates the existence of a trap for hydrocarbon accumulation, or a point on the boundary of the DEM, which suggests that the pathway of hydrocarbon migration extends outside the DEM. In addition, a concourse point of two paths is also considered as a termination point of either path. The algorithms were successfully applied in the modeling of the secondary migration pathways in the northern Songliao Basin, northeast China. The modeled results matched well with drilling data, suggesting the robustness of the algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
