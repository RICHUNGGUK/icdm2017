This classifier considers, to classify a test pattern, the subspaces created by each combination of three training patterns. The main problem is that in dataset of high cardinality this method is unfeasible. A genetic algorithm is here used for dividing the training patterns in several clusters which centroids are used to build the feature planes used to classify the test set. The performance improvement with respect to other nearest neighbor based classifiers is validated through experiments with several benchmark datasets. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
