Although MATLAB is very suitable for rapid prototyping and development, MATLAB users often want to convert their final MATLAB programs to a static language such as FORTRAN. This paper presents an extensible object-oriented toolkit for supporting the generation of static programs from dynamic MATLAB programs. Our open source toolkit, called the MATLAB Tamer, identifies a large tame subset of MATLAB, supports the generation of a specialized Tame IR for that subset, provides a principled approach to handling the large number of builtin MATLAB functions, and supports an extensible interprocedural value analysis for estimating MATLAB types and call graphs.", "paper_title": "Taming MATLAB", "paper_id": "WOS:000311296200029"}
