High quality software systems typically apply expert design experience which has been captured as design patterns. As demonstrated solutions to recurring problems, design patterns help to reuse expert experience in software system design. They have been extensively applied in the industry. Mining the instances of design patterns from the source code of software systems can assist in the understanding of the systems and the process of re-engineering them. More importantly, it also helps to trace back to the original design decisions, which are typically missing in legacy systems. This paper presents a review on current techniques and tools for mining design patterns from source code or design of software systems. We classify different approaches and analyze their results in a comparative study. We also examine the disparity of the discovery results of different approaches and analyze possible reasons with some insight.", "paper_title": "A REVIEW OF DESIGN PATTERN MINING TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271352500004"}
