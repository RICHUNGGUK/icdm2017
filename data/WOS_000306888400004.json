We present our progress over the past five years in the development and porting of the DTI analysis pipeline to a grid infrastructure. Starting with simple jobs submitted from the command-line, we moved towards a workflow-based implementation and finally into the e-BioInfra Gateway, which offers a web interface for the execution of selected biomedical data analysis software on the Dutch Grid. This gateway is currently being actively used by neuroscientists and for educational purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
