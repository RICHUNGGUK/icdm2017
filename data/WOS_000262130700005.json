A holistic approach is proposed, where the combined efforts of compiler, operating system, and hardware architecture achieve a significant system power reductions. The application information extracted and analyzed by the compiler is utilized dynamically by the microarchitecture and the operating system to perform energy-efficient and, for many memory references, time-deterministic address translations. We demonstrate that by using application information regarding virtual memory layout, an efficient and conflict-free translation process can be implemented through the utilization of a small hardware direct translation table (DTT) accessed in an application-specific manner. The set of virtual pages is partitioned into groups, such that for each group only a few of the least significant bits are used as an index to obtain the physical page number. We outline an efficient compile-time algorithm for identifying these groups and allocate their translation entries optimally into the DTT. The introduced hardware is minimal in terms of area, performance, and power overhead, while offering the flexibility of software programmability. This is achieved through a small set of registers and tables, which are made software accessible. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed methodology on a number of embedded applications, including voice, image, and video processing.", "paper_title": "Direct Address Translation for Virtual Memory in Energy-Efficient Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262130700005"}
