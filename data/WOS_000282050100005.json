Jobs are to be scheduled in batches for processing. All jobs in a batch start and complete together, and a constant setup is prior to each batch. The objective is to minimize the total completion time of all jobs. We primarily consider the special cases of these problems with identical processing times, for which efficient on-line heuristics are proposed and their competitive performance is evaluated.", "paper_title": "On-line machine scheduling with batch setups", "paper_id": "WOS:000282050100005"}
