Previous research examining different aspects of technology-assisted learning has found equivocal results concerning its effectiveness and outcomes. We extend prior studies by conducting a longitudinal field experiment to compare technology-assisted with face-to-face learning for students' learning of English. Our comparative investigation focuses on learning effectiveness, perceived course learnability, learning-community support, and learning satisfaction. In addition, we analyze the effects of different learning styles in moderating the effectiveness of and satisfaction with technology-assisted learning. Overall, our results show significantly greater learning effectiveness with technology-assisted learning than with conventional face-to-face learning. Learning style has noticeable influences on the effectiveness and outcomes of technology-assisted learning. We also observe an apparently important interaction effect with the medium for delivery, which may partially explain the equivocal results of previous research.", "paper_title": "Technology-assisted learning and learning style: A longitudinal field experiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000250590400021"}
