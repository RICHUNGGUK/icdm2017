In 2005, Tzeng et al. proposed a secure on-line software transaction scheme. However, we find that their scheme has the deadlock problem and is inefficient. We propose an efficient novel on-line transaction method that can solve the deadlock problem. The security of the novel method is based on several cryptographic techniques, including the secure one-way hash function and RSA cryptosystems. Our method also has lower computational cost than that of Tzeng et al.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT INTERNET ON-LINE TRANSACTION MECHANISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800031"}
