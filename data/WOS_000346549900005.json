In contrast to the conventional Lagrangian approach, the mesh becomes practically fixed in space, which yields significant benefits for the performance of the contact algorithms and the overall computational efficiency. The needed Lagrangian-Eulerian kinematic relations are derived, special attention is given to the convective transport term for the constitutive variables and an implicit update scheme for the elasto-plastic bending model is formulated. The proposed formulation is shown to predict responses with the same accuracy as offered by the conventional Lagrangian formulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
