The presumed PDF approach is adopted for the closure of the time-averaged temperature relevant quantity. It is integrated with the algebraic expression for the second-order-moment of concentration fluctuations. The obtained ACM-PDF model is employed in the simulation of swirling turbulent diffusion combustion in the TECFLAM combustor. The calculated gas axial, radial and tangential velocities, turbulent kinetic energy, species mass fractions, temperature, and fluctuating temperature are compared with the measured test data. Agreement between the calculation and the measurement is achieved. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
