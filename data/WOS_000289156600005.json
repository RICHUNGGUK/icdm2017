However, improving and generalizing lane detection solutions proved to be a challenging task until recently. A (physical) lane is defined by road boundaries or various kinds of lane marks, and this is only partially applicable for modeling the space an ego-vehicle is able to drive in. This paper proposes a concept of (virtual) corridor for modeling this space. A corridor depends on information available about the motion of the ego-vehicle, as well as about the (physical) lane. This paper also suggests a modified version of Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), named Row Orientation Distance Transform (RODT), to facilitate the detection of corridor boundary points. Then, boundary selection and road patch extension are applied as post-processing. Moreover, this paper also informs about the possible application of corridor for driver assistance. Finally, experiments using images from highways and urban roads with some challenging road situations are presented, illustrating the er effectiveness of the proposed corridor detection algorithm. Comparison of lane and corridor on a public dataset is also provided.", "paper_title": "CORRIDOR DETECTION AND TRACKING FOR VISION-BASED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000289156600005"}
