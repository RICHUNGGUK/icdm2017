Firstly, the original DNA inicroarray gene expression data are selected using t-statistics. Secondly, the selected genes are modeled by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the modeling data. To show the validity of the proposed method, we apply it to classify two DNA microarray data sets involving various human normal and tumor tissue samples. The experimental results show that the method is efficient and feasible.", "paper_title": "Tumor classification based on independent component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237140000014"}
