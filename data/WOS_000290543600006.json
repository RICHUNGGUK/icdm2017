The first one, Selkow (DT) is pixel-based and a Selkow's algorithm combined with the decision tree optimization technique. The second one called light speed labeling is segment-based line-relative labeling and was especially thought for commodity RISC architectures. An extensive benchmark on both structured and unstructured images substantiates that these two algorithms, the way they were designed, run faster than Wu's algorithm claimed to be the world fastest in 2007. Also they both show greater data independency hence runtime predictability.", "paper_title": "Light speed labeling: efficient connected component labeling on RISC architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000290543600006"}
