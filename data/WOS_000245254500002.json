The Hopfield network gives warm start for the primal-dual interior point methods, which can be way ahead in the path to optimality. The approaches were applied to a set of real world linear programming problems. The integrated approaches provide promising results, indicating that there may be a place for neural networks in the \"real game\" of optimization. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
