As quantified by Zheng and Tse, given a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel, both gains can, in fact, be simultaneously obtained, but there is a fundamental tradeoff (called the Diversity-Multiplexing Gain (DM-G) tradeoff) between how much of each type of gain, any coding scheme can extract. Space-time codes (STCs) can be employed to make use of these advantages offered by multiple antennas. Space-Time T)rellis Codes (STTCs) are known to have better bit error rate performance than Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs), but with a penalty in decoding complexity. Also, for STTCs, the frame length is assumed to be finite and hence zeros are forced towards the end of the frame (called the trailing zeros), inducing rate loss. In this correspondence, we derive an upper bound on the DM-G tradeoff of full-rate STTCs with nonvanishing determinant (NVD). Also, we show that the full-rate STTCs with NVD.are optimal under the DM-G tradeoff for any number of transmit and receive antennas, neglecting the rate loss due to trailing zeros. Next, we give an explicit generalized full-rate STTC construction for any number of states of the trellis, which achieves the optimal DM-G tradeoff for any number of transmit and receive antennas, neglecting the rate loss due to trailing zeros.", "paper_title": "On space-time trellis codes achieving optimal diversity multiplexing tradeoff", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700020"}
