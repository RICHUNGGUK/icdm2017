In the proposed approach, the phase information (called FusionCode or PhaseCode) of a palmprint is extracted by using four 2D Gabor filters with different orientations, and at the same time the orientation information (called OrientationCode) of the palmprint is also extracted. The PhaseCode and the OrientationCode are fused to make a new feature, called the Palmprint Phase and Orientation Code (PPOC). At the matching stage, a modified Hamming distance is defined to measure the similarity of two PPOCs. This approach is tested on a palmprint database containing 7,605 samples and the experimental results show that the accuracy and speed of the PPOC approach can satisfy the requirements of a real time biometric system.", "paper_title": "Fusion of phase and orientation information for palmprint authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000240830900001"}
