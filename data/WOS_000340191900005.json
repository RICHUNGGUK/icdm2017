First, we extract local features (e. g., SIFT) from the query image and retrieve a number of nearest neighbors for each query feature from the reference data set. Next, we apply our GMCP-based feature matching to select a single nearest neighbor for each query feature such that all matches are globally consistent. Our approach to feature matching is based on the proposition that the first nearest neighbors are not necessarily the best choices for finding correspondences in image matching. Therefore, the proposed method considers multiple reference nearest neighbors as potential matches and selects the correct ones by enforcing consistency among their global features (e.g., GIST) using GMCP. In this context, we argue that using a robust distance function for finding the similarity between the global features is essential for the cases where the query matches multiple reference images with dissimilar global features. Towards this end, we propose a robust distance function based on the Gaussian Radial Basis Function (G-RBF). We evaluated the proposed framework on a new data set of 102k street view images; the experiments show it outperforms the state of the art by 10 percent.", "paper_title": "Image Geo-Localization Based on Multiple Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching Using Generalized Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000340191900005"}
