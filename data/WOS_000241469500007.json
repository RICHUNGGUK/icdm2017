This paper describes a methodology to migrate a parallel application from a single-cluster to a collection of clusters, guaranteeing a minimum level of efficiency. This methodology is applied to a parallel scientific application to use three geographically scattered clusters located in Argentina, Brazil and Spain. Experimental results prove that the speedup and efficiency estimations provided by this methodology are more than 90% precision. Without the tuning process of the application a 45% of the maximum speedup is obtained whereas a 94% of that maximum speedup is attained when a tuning process is applied. In both cases efficiency is over 90%.", "paper_title": "Tuning application in a multi-cluster environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500007"}
