In the proposed method. wavelet trees are classified into two clusters using the distance vector to denote binary watermark bits. The two smallest wavelet coefficients in a wavelet tree are used to reduce distortion of a watermarked image. The distance vector. which is obtained from the two smallest coefficients of a wavelet tree, is quantized to decrease image distortion. The trees are classified into two clusters so that they exhibit a sufficiently large statistical difference based on the distance vector, which difference is then used for subsequent watermark extraction. We compare the statistical difference and the distance vector of a wavelet tree to decide which watermark bit is embedded in the embedding process. The experimental results show that the watermarked image looks Visually identical to the original and the watermark can be effectively extracted upon image processing attacks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
