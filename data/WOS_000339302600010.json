The better-than-worst-case design can both address the variability problem and achieve higher performance/energy efficiency than the worst-case design. This paper surveys the progress to date, provides a snapshot of the most representative methods in this field, and discusses the future research directions of the better-than-worst-case design.", "paper_title": "Better-Than-Worst-Case Design: Progress and Opportunities", "paper_id": "WOS:000339302600010"}
