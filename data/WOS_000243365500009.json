Uintah utilizes an abstract representation of parallel computation and communication to express data dependencies between multiple physics components. These features allow parallelism to be integrated between multiple components while maintaining overall scalability. Uintah provides mechanisms for load-balancing, data communication, data I/O, and checkpoint/restart. The underlying infrastructure is designed to accommodate a range of PDE solution methods. The primary techniques described here, are the material point method (MPM) for structural mechanics and a multi-material fluid mechanics capability. MPM employs a particle-based representation of solid materials that interact through a semi-structured background grid. We describe a scalable infrastructure for problems with large deformation, high strain rates, and complex material behavior. Uintah is a product of the University of Utah Center for Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE), a DOE-funded Center of Excellence. This approach has been used to simulate numerous complex problems, including the response of energetic devices subject to harsh environments such as hydrocarbon pool fires. This scenario involves a wide range of length and time scales including a relatively slow heating phase punctuated by pressurization and rupture of the device.", "paper_title": "A component-based parallel infrastructure for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000243365500009"}
