Because of the excellent properties of the genuinely maximally entangled six-qubit states, the presented protocol allows three participants to compute the summation of their inputs without the help of a trusted third party and preserve the privacy of their inputs, respectively. The participants do not need any unitary operations. In addition, the proposed protocol utilizes the one-step quantum transmission and therefore is congenitally free from Trojan horse attacks. We have also shown that our protocol is secure against other well-known attacks over lossy and noisy quantum channels.", "paper_title": "Three-party quantum summation without a trusted third party", "paper_id": "WOS:000354325800005"}
