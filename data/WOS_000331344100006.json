Although most existing randomized protocols for Byzantine agreement exploit a modular approach, that is, a combination of agreement on a bit value and a reduction of request set values to the bit values, our protocol directly solves the multi-valued agreement problem for request sets. We introduce a novel coin tossing scheme to select a candidate of an agreed request set randomly. This coin toss allows our protocol to reduce resource consumption and to attain faster response time than the existing representative protocols.", "paper_title": "Efficient Randomized Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Replication Based on Special Valued Coin Tossing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100006"}
