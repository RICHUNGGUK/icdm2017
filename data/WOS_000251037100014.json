We introduce three new local search operators for this problem, which are then embedded within a variable neighborhood search heuristic. We evaluate the performance of the heuristic on data adapted from TSPLIB instances.", "paper_title": "Variable neighborhood search for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with LIFO loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000251037100014"}
