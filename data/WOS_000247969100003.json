The objective of the paper is to describe strategies for addressing the computational modelling of joint mechanics using the finite element (FE) method, differentiating between geometry, constitutive modelling of the components, computational aspects and applications. The structure and function of the main components of the joints are reviewed, with emphasis on the relationship of tissue microstructure with its continuum mechanical behavior. Applications to two diarthrodial joints (human knee and temporomandibular joint) in physiological, pathological andpos-surgery situations are presented and discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions.", "paper_title": "Computational modelling of diarthrodial joints.
