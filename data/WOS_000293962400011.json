The algorithm has running time O(|H|(2.5)) and can be used to find an explicit 4-regular planar graph GaS integral H if such a graph exists. It shall not matter whether we specify that H and G must be simple graphs or allow them to be multigraphs.", "paper_title": "Subgraphs of 4-Regular Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293962400011"}
