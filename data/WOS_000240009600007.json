We use a two-dimensional histogram that allows us to relate the signals of intensity and saturation of a color image, and to identify the specularities in an area of the histogram. This is known as the Intensity-Saturation (MS) diagram, and it is constructed from the Intensity-Saturation-Hue (MSH) generalized color space. An experimental and detailed study of the presence of specularities in the M diagram for different types of materials in real scenes is carried out. To eliminate the specularities detected, we use a new connected vectorial filter based on the extension of mathematical morphology to color images, employing a lexicographical order. This new filter operates only in the bright areas previously detected, avoiding the high cost of processing the connected filters and the related oversimplification. The proposed method achieves results similar to current methods, but without the need for costly multiple-view systems or stereo images.", "paper_title": "Automatic detection and elimination of specular reflectance in color images by means of MS diagram and vector connected filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000240009600007"}
