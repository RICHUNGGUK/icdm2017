Here, we study to which degree variable order models can improve the recognition of eukaryotic cis-regulatory elements. We find that variable order models can improve the recognition of binding sites of all the studied transcription factors. To ease a systematic evaluation of different model combinations based on problem-specific data sets and allow genomic scans of cis-regulatory elements based on fixed and variable order Markov models and Bayesian trees, we provide the VOMBATserver to the public community.", "paper_title": "RECOGNITION OF CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS WITH VOMBAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000208908100010"}
