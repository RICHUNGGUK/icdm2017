The computational results show that with increasing pressure, the NTO lattice parameters and hydrogen bonds lengths rapidly decrease and the geometries change very little. The total energy increases by approximately 27.543 eV from 0 to 10 GPa. NTO becomes increasingly conductive or metallic with increasing pressure, while the XRD peaks are shifted to greater angles and the absorption coefficient alpha(omega) increases.
