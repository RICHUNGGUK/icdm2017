RC-triggered and MOSFET-based power supply ESD clamp circuits have been widely used to obtain the desired ESD protection ability. In this paper, a MOSFET-based ESD power clamp circuit with only 10 ns RC time constant for 0.18-mu m process is presented. A double pull-down path is proposed to avoid false triggering, reject power supply noise and reduce energy consumption. The performance of the novel clamp circuit is excellent, consuming very small layout area. The simulation results show that this clamp circuit can be used in industry.", "paper_title": "A novel ESD power supply clamp circuit with double pull-down paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500016"}
