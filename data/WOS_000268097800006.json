With the increasing availability of high-throughput and high-resolution instruments, the integrative biomedical research imposes many challenging requirements on software middleware systems. In this paper, we look at some of these requirements using example research pattern templates. We then discuss how middleware systems, which incorporate Grid and high-performance computing, could be employed to address the requirements.", "paper_title": "HPC AND GRID COMPUTING FOR INTEGRATIVE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000268097800006"}
