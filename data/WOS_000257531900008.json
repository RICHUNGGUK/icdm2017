These generalizations of classical probabilities can have some interesting properties; for example: k-monotonicity, avoiding sure loss, coherence, permutation invariance. The sets formed by all the lower probabilities satisfying zero or more of these properties are convex. We show how the extreme points and rays of these sets-the extreme lower probabilities-can be calculated and we give an illustration of our results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
