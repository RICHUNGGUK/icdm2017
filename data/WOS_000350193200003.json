In recent years, clustering-based data collection protocols are very attractive due to their low energy consumption and simplicity. Existing clustering-based data collection protocols usually suffer from unbalanced energy consumption among different nodes, as they generally choose cluster heads in a random manner, or simply use the node with the highest remaining energy as cluster heads. We propose EBDSC, a distributed Energy-Balanced Dominating Set-based Clustering scheme that effectively prolongs the network lifetime by balancing energy consumption among different nodes. In EBDSC, each node calculates its lifetime if it is selected as the cluster head. If a node has the longest lifetime among its neighbors, it becomes a candidate cluster head. A candidate cluster head becomes a final cluster head with a probability determined by its uncovered neighbors. Simulation results show that EBDSC balances energy consumption among different nodes well. Compared with another dominating set-based clustering algorithm ECDS, in EBDSC the energy consumption in the clustering phase is reduced by 26 percent, and consequently the network lifetime is prolonged by more than 25 percent.", "paper_title": "Energy Balanced Clustering Data Collection Based on Dominating Set in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350193200003"}
