We propose an algorithm which utilizes a geometric visibility graph of a building to traverse all possible bounded radio paths. These paths are needed for the computation of signal strength captured at a given receiver location. We have implemented the suggested algorithm and conducted a set of experiments to evaluate its performance in complex environments. The main conclusion is that the new algorithm is both (i) Accurate: predicts the signal strength inside complex buildings. (ii) Runtime efficient: requires only few seconds to compute all relevant radio paths, even when operating on complex structures containing thousands of walls. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
