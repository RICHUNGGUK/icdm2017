It has been found that the random error plays as important a role as the systematic error does in the phase inversion operations. Both systematic and random errors are important in the Hadamard transformation. This is quite different from the Grover algorithm and the Shor algorithm.", "paper_title": "Influences of gate operation errors in the quantum counting algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242640200008"}
