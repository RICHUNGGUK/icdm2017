Building optical buffers for routers is daunting: Today's electronic routers often hold millions of packets, which is well beyond the capabilities of optical technology. In this paper, we argue that two new results offer a solution. First, we show that the size of buffers in backbone routers can be made very small-just about 20 packets per linecard-at the expense of a small loss in throughput. Second, we show that integrated delay line optical buffers can store a few dozen packets on a photonic chip. With the combination of these two results, we conclude that future Internet routers could use optical buffers.", "paper_title": "Optical Packet Buffers for Backbone Internet Routers", "paper_id": "WOS:000283446200020"}
