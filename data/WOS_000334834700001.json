Based on the deficiencies of existing fire detection on real-time and monitoring accuracy, the wireless sensor network technique for fire detection was introduced and needed. In this paper, we proposed the fire detection algorithm in video sequences on wireless sensor network. The proposed fire detection algorithm processes visual information acquired through static camera that lets us incorporate the algorithm to CCTV surveillance system, and therefore does not require an additional expanses on conventional fire sensors. Fire detection method based on motion information, any input image, is compared to background in order to identify foreground. Background is statistically modeled by mixture of Gaussians. To detect the foreground of video sequences, the proposed color detection algorithm was performed in RGB space. The procedure of algorithm eliminates all objects that do not fulfill color requirements without fire-like objects. And the change map and blob's area are computed, change map shows temporal variation of pixel between two consecutive binary frames, and percentage area increase or decrease characterizes a fire property for swinging.", "paper_title": "RGB Color Model Based the Fire Detection Algorithm in Video Sequences on Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000334834700001"}
