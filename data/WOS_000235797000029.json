Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the area under their receiver operating characteristic curve. The fusion of machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best results previously published in the literature. In particular, the best performance is achieved combining support vector machine and support vector data description. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
