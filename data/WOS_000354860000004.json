We commence with a brief review of the family of MIMO systems, which is followed by the design of STSK systems in the context of MC modulation-based transmissions over dispersive wireless channels. Specifically, the STSK scheme is amalgamated with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, MC code-division multiple access, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), and single-carrier frequency-division multiple access. We also provide a rudimentary introduction to MC differential STSK employing both conventional differential detection and multiple-symbol differential sphere decoding for the sake of dispensing with channel estimation. We conclude with the design recipes of coherent versus noncoherent MC STSK schemes, complemented by a range of future research ideas.", "paper_title": "Unified MIMO-Multicarrier Designs: A Space-Time Shift Keying Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000354860000004"}
