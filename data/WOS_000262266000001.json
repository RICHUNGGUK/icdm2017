The algorithm estimates on-line the Image Jacobian, a matrix which linearly relates joint velocity and image feature velocity. In our experiments we prove that by using the fundamental matrix, robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise is significantly increased with respect to already existing algorithms in specialized literature.
