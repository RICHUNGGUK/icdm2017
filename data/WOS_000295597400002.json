The technologies adopted in terms of architecture and installation were very effective in creating a mobile laboratory open to further extension by online interoperation with other simulators and with biomedical devices for assessing human capabilities within this framework. This approach allows us to face the existing challenges in extending the capabilities of a logistics node over their current capabilities limited by technological and human factors.", "paper_title": "Logistics node simulator as an enabler for supply chain development: innovative portainer simulator as the assessment tool for human factors in port cranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295597400002"}
