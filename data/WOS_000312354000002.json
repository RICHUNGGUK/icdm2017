Network on Chip (NoC) is now considered as a promising paradigm of inter-core connection for future many-core processors. In this paper, we examined how the regional cache organizations drastically reduce the average network latency, and proposed a regional cache architecture with Delegate Memory Management Units (D-MMUs) for NoC based processors. Experiments showed that the L2 cache access latency is largely determined by its organization and interconnection paradigm with PEs in the NoC, and that the regional organization is essentially important for better NoC cache performance.
