Moreover, the algorithm can make full use of bit strings to sort vertices in constant time as well as to compute graph transitions and bounds efficiently, exploiting the ability of CPUs to process bitwise operations in blocks of size the ALU register word. As a result it significantly outperforms a current leading algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
