In contrast to algorithms which allocate bandwidth based on fixed weighted factors, DySGAB continuously adapts the bandwidth assignation to fulfill the requirements of all profiles, leading to an outstanding performance. This auto-adjustment, which has not been implemented in any of today's algorithms, allows the network to evolve automatically to the stipulated values even if they change in real time. As a result, not only does DySGAB ensure the guaranteed bandwidth for every subscriber, but also is independent of the initial bandwidth restrictions, which is an advantageous characteristic for service providers.", "paper_title": "Self-adapted algorithm to provide multi-profile bandwidth guarantees in PONs with symmetric and asymmetric traffic load", "paper_id": "WOS:000305533300007"}
