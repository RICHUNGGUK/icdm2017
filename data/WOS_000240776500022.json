The problem of coding for transmission of a source through a channel without error when the receiver has side information about the source is analyzed. Using properties of the Lovasz theta function, it is shown that separate source and channel coding is asymptotically suboptimal in general. By contrast, in the case of vanishingly small probability of error, separate source and channel coding is known to be asymptotically optimal. For the zero-error case, it is further shown that the joint coding gain can in fact be unbounded. Since separate coding simplifies code design and use, conditions on sources and channels for the optimality of separate coding are also derived.", "paper_title": "Zero-error source- Channel coding with side information", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500022"}
