This analysis leads us to a numerical algorithm that provides one with a Riemann solver. Next, we introduce a Godunov-type scheme based on this Riemann solver, which is well-balanced and of quasi-conservative form. Finally, we present numerical experiments which demonstrate the convergence of the proposed scheme even in the resonance regime, except in the limiting situation when Riemann data precisely belong to the resonance hypersurface.
