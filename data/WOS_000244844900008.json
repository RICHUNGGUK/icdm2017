In addition, we assume that (1) the retailer's selling price per unit is necessarily higher than its unit cost, and (2) the interest rate charged by a supplier or a bank is not necessarily higher than the retailer's investment return rate. We then establish an appropriate EOQ model with trade credit Financing, and provide an easy-to-use closed-form solution to the problem. Furthermore, we find it is possible that a well-established buyer may order a lower quantity and take the benefit of the permissible delay more frequently, which contradicts to the result by the previous researchers. Finally, we perform some sensitivity analyses to illustrate the theoretical results and obtain some managerial results.", "paper_title": "Retailer's optimal ordering policies with trade credit financing", "paper_id": "WOS:000244844900008"}
