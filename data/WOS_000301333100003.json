Extra network resources are needed to increase network survivability level. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to augment the network topology with adding new links and allocate spare capacity to maximize the service restorability against node failures in SDH/SONET mesh networks. A scheme called maximal node-disjoint backup paths provisioning with topology augmentation is proposed to tackle the problem, and another scheme called globally optimized path provisioning with topology augmentation, which allows adjusting the existing working paths of network flows, is investigated to optimize the augmented network globally. Both schemes are formulated as mixed integer linear programming models. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms are investigated to be implemented in software. Three algorithms, i.e., added links searching method, successive maximal survivable routing method, and random sequence routing convergence method, are designed and compared. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Incremental survivable network design against node failure in SDH/SONET mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301333100003"}
