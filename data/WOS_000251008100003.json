We refer to the resulting architecture as GFAM. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that GFAM exhibits good generalization and is of small size (creates few ART categories), while consuming reasonable computational effort. In a number of classification problems, GFAM produces the optimal classifier. Furthermore, we compare the performance of GFAM with other competitive ARTMAP classifiers that have appeared in the literature and addressed the category proliferation problem in ART. We illustrate that GFAM produces improved results over these architectures, as well as other competitive classifiers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
