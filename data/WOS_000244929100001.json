Retransmission of erroneous packet is not considered. In particular, we present an analytical framework for the performance evaluation of a simple wireless system in terms of receiver and transmitter structure. The system requires no knowledge of the channel and relies on a binary feedback. Slow and fast Rayleigh fading channel conditions are considered. The paper includes the derivation of the closed-form expressions of the spectral efficiency. In some cases, closed-form expression for packet error rate (PER) are derived. Our results show relatively high PER but some applications can still operate in a satisfactory fashion in these conditions, such as voice communication. Using coded modulation with high coding gain and increasing the number of blocks per time slot decrease the PER even more. An advantage of this system is that it uses a low complexity receiver, which sends binary feedback.
