The generalized distance approach, initially developed for the simultaneous optimization of several linear response surface models, is adapted to this multivariate GLM situation. An application of the proposed methodology is presented in the special case of a bivariate binary distribution resulting from a drug testing experiment concerning two responses, namely, the efficacy and toxicity of a particular drug combination. One of the objectives of this application is to find the dose levels of two drugs that simultaneously maximize their therapeutic effect and minimize any possible toxic effects. A second application is presented in the case of a multivariate gamma distribution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
