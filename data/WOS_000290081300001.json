They are all based on the idea of placing an approximated expected behaviour of the process at hand (simulated realisations) outside the study region which interacts with the data during the estimation. These methods are applied to the so-called growth-interaction model. The specific choices of growth function and interaction function made are purely motivated by the forestry applications considered. The parameters of the growth and interaction functions, i.e. the parameters related to the development of the marks, are estimated using the least-squares approach together with the proposed edge corrections. Finally, the edge corrected estimation methods are applied to a data set of Swedish Scots pine. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
