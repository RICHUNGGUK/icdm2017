We present a new approach to this problem and a methodology that implements it for motor behaviors encapsulated in rest-to-rest motions. As well as common methods, we assume the availability of kinematic information about the solution to the task, but reference is not made to the workspace, allowing the workspace to be free of restrictions. Our control framework, based on local control policies at the joint acceleration level, attracts actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) to the desired final configuration; meanwhile, the resulting final states of the unactuated DOFs are viewed as an indirect consequence of the profile of the policies. Dynamical systems are used as acceleration policies, providing the actuated system with convenient attractor properties. The control policies, parameterized around imposed simple primitives, are deformed by means of changes in the parameters. This modulation is optimized, by means of a stochastic algorithm, in order to control the unactuated DOFs and thus carry out the desired motor behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
