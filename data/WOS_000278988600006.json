This new approach in the chemical sensor field consists of the use of an array of non-specific sensors coupled with a multivariate calibration tool which may form a node of a sensor network. In our work, the proposed arrays were made up of potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membranes, and the subsequent cross-response processing was based on a multilayer artificial neural network model. Two cases are described: the environmental monitoring of ammonium pollutant plus alkaline ions at different measuring sites in the states of Mexico and Hidalgo (Mexico), and the monitoring of heavy metals (Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+) and Cd(2+)) in open air waste streams and rivers heading down the Gulf of Mexico.
