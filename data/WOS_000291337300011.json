In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify and validate features from sectional views. First, features are classified as explicit features (EPFs) and implicit features (IPFs), which are then identified in an order of priority using heuristic hints. We show that the problem of constructing EPFs can be formulated as a 0-1 integer linear program (ILP), and the IPFs are generated based on the understanding of semantic information of omitted projections in sectional views. Then, the Loop-Relation Graph (LRG) is introduced as a multi-connected-subgraph representation for describing the relations between loops and features. According to the LRG, a reasoning technique based on confidence is implemented to interactively validate features. This method can recover features without complete projections, and the level of understanding sectional views is improved. Full sections, partial sections, offset sections as well as revolved sections can be handled by our method. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the practicability of our approach.
