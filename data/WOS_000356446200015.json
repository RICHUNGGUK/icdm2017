The solar charge controller is the key of its active system for the signal processing circuits involved. In this paper, a fully integrated solar charge controller is presented. The charger has wide input voltage range about 10-28V for the solar-powered panel. The input loop regulation is used here as the maximum power point tracking protection. This charger also provides different kinds of battery voltages about 4-12 V. The controller system uses just one error amplifier (EA) and no external compensation components is needed. Besides, this controller has 600-kHz pulse-width modulation (PWM) and offers the over-current/over-voltage protection. Other components like bandgap, reference generator, saw-tooth generator, register controller and driver circuits are all implemented in this circuit. This chip is fabricated in a 0.4-mu m 5 V/40V 2P4M process. The power consumption of this full-integrated solar charge controller IC is about 10 mA.", "paper_title": "A Wide-Range Charge Controller for Solar Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000356446200015"}
