Although having those applications mobile is quite appealing, high data rate transmission also poses huge demand for power. It has been revealed that the tail effect in 3G radio operation results in significant energy drain on smartphones. Recent fast dormancy technique can be utilized to remove tails but, without care, can degrade user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme SmartCut, which effectively mitigates the tail effect of radio usage in 3G networks with little side-effect on user experience. The core idea of SmartCut is to utilize the temporal correlation of packet arrivals to predict upcoming packets, based on which unnecessary high-power-state tails of radio are cut out leveraging the Fast Dormancy mechanism. Both prototype experiment and extensive trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of SmartCut design. On average, SmartCut can save up to 43 percent network energy while having little side-effect to user experience.", "paper_title": "SmartCut: Mitigating 3G Radio Tail Effect on Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000345990600013"}
