Starting from the nt mu f theta/nt mu x theta, we obtain restricted formats that guarantee that three coarser bisimulation equivalences are congruences. We focus on (i) Segala's variant of bisimulation that considers combined transitions, which we call here convex bisimulation; (ii) the bisimulation equivalence resulting from considering Park & Milner's bisimulation on the usual stripped probabilistic transition system (translated into a labelled transition system), which we call here probability obliterated bisimulation; and (iii) a probability abstracted bisimulation, which, like bisimulation, preserves the structure of the distributions but instead, it ignores the probability values. In addition, we compare these bisimulation equivalences and provide a logic characterization for each of them.", "paper_title": "SOS rule formats for convex and abstract probabilistic bisimulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000367340100004"}
