Whether one is learning a programming language by implementing a computer program, or learning calculus by solving problems, context-sensitive feedback and guidance are crucial to keeping problem-solving efforts fruitful and efficient. This article reviews AI-based algorithms that can diagnose student difficulties during active problem solving and serve as the basis for providing context-sensitive and individualized guidance. The article also describes the crucial role sensor-based estimates of cognitive resources such as working memory capacity and attention can play in enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of intelligent instructional systems boxed times", "paper_title": "Extending the Diagnostic Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence-Based Instructional Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367211800007"}
