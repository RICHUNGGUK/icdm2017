The proposed approach consists of two processes: knowledge representation and knowledge assimilation. The knowledge of process parameter setting is encoded as a string with a fuzzy rule set and the associated membership functions. The historical process data forming a combined string is used as the initial knowledge population, which is then ready for knowledge assimilation. A genetic algorithm is used to generate an optimal or nearly optimal fuzzy set and membership functions for the process parameters. The originality of this research is that the proposed system is equipped with the ability to take advantage of assessing the loss which is caused by discrepancy with a process target, thereby enabling the identification of the best set of process parameters. The approach is demonstrated by the use of an experimental example drawn from a semiconductor manufacturer and the results show us that the suggested approach is able to achieve an optimal solution for a process parameter setting problem.
