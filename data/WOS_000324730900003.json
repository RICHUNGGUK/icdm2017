The foci of this paper are to pursue a Bayesian probabilistic approach to quantitative model validation with non-normality data, considering data uncertainty and to investigate the impact of normality assumption on validation accuracy. The Box-Cox transformation method is employed to convert the non-normality data, with the purpose of facilitating the overall validation assessment of computational models with higher accuracy. Explicit expressions for the interval hypothesis testing-based Bayes factor are derived for the transformed data in the context of univariate and multivariate cases. Bayesian confidence measure is presented based on the Bayes factor metric. A generalized procedure is proposed to implement the proposed probabilistic methodology for model validation of complicated systems. Classic hypothesis testing method is employed to conduct a comparison study. The impact of data normality assumption and decision threshold variation on model assessment accuracy is investigated by using both classical and Bayesian approaches. The proposed methodology and procedure are demonstrated with a univariate stochastic damage accumulation model, a multivariate heat conduction problem and a multivariate dynamic system.", "paper_title": "An investigation of Bayesian inference approach to model validation with non-normal data", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900003"}
