While, the majority of current methods used in DSR are surface-based, our overarching goal is to obtain direct parameterization of 3D meshes, by avoiding the actual segmentation of the mesh into different surfaces. As a first step towards reverse modeling physical parts, we extract (1) locally prominent cross-sections (PCS) from triangular meshes, and (2) organize and cluster them into sweep components, which form the basic building blocks of the re-created CAD model. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms derived from Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) (Roweis and Sauk, 2000 [3]) and Affinity Propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007 [4]) for organizing and clustering PCS. The LLE algorithm analyzes the cross-sections (PCS) using their geometric properties to build a global manifold in an embedded space. The AP algorithm, then clusters the local cross sections by propagating affinities among them in the embedded space to form different sweep components. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the algorithms through many examples including actual laser-scanned (point cloud) mechanical parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
