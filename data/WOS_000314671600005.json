For the coupling with static objects, we specially design a main wave splitting algorithm, making the simulation results more natural. By deformation of elliptic cylindrical surfaces, we introduce a novel 3D splashed water model for the coupling with dynamic objects. Finally, the boundary curves around objects are automatically extracted for the combination of waves and objects, which reduces user interventions to as few as possible. Various experiment results demonstrate the validity of our method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
