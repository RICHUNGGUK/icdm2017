Trivially, agreement problems such as consensus, that cannot be solved in non-anonymous asynchronous systems prone to process failures, cannot be solved either if the system is anonymous. The paper investigates failure detectors that allow processes to circumvent this impossibility. It has several contributions. It first presents four failure detectors (denoted AP, , A Omega, and AI ) pound and show that they are the \"identity-free\" counterparts of perfect failure detectors, eventual leader failure detectors, and quorum failure detectors, respectively. AI pound is new and showing that AI pound and I pound have the same computability power in a non-anonymous system is not trivial. The paper also shows that the notion of failure detector reduction is related to the computation model. Then, the paper presents and proves correct a uniform anonymous consensus algorithm based on the failure detector pair (A Omega, AI ) pound (\"uniform\" means here that not only processes have no identity, but no process is aware of the total number of processes). This new algorithm is not a simple \"straightforward extension\" of an algorithm designed for non-anonymous systems. To benefit from AI pound, it uses a novel broadcast facility which encapsulates an AI -based pound message exchange pattern that provides the processes with an interesting intersection property on the set of messages they have exchanged. Finally, the paper discusses the notions of failure detector hierarchy, weakest failure detector for anonymous consensus, and the implementation of identity-free failure detectors in anonymous systems.", "paper_title": "Anonymous asynchronous systems: the case of failure detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000320061500002"}
