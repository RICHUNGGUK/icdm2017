The method of system reduction used is linearization of a rational positive system at a steady state, balancing of the local linear system, and truncation of the balanced linear system. For a model of glycolysis in yeast with glucose as input and pyruvate as output, it is shown that a third order linear system locally approximates well the original thirteenth order nonlinear system.", "paper_title": "System reduction of nonlinear positive systems by linearization and truncation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400055"}
