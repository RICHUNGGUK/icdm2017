In traditional CS, comprehensive data collection is a prerequisite for sensing environments fully. However, it is difficult to obtain well-round information due to the lack of monitoring infrastructures and realize precise structures of variable signals in real situations. In this paper, two effective hybrid compressive matrices HCMs based on distributed compressed sensing(DCS) is proposed for the exponential distribution and the Passion distribution. Actual experiments show that signals could be obtained stably when sampling in a certain space and time, and reconstructed accurately.", "paper_title": "Distributed Compressed Sensing in Vehicular Ad-hoc Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000352333200005"}
