Compared with DRAM, PRAM draws a lot of attention recently, since it provides higher density and has no need to refresh the capacitor charge periodically. The non-volatile nature of PRAM can even reduce compulsory miss, which cannot be avoided by DRAM cache. However, PRAM cache cannot replace DRAM cache due to its endurance issue. Thus DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache becomes a good alternative for traditional DRAM cache. Least recently used (LRU) replacement algorithm and CLOCK-Pro algorithm work well for traditional DRAM cache. But these algorithms shall not be directly applied to DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache since the characteristics of PRAM are not considered. This paper proposed a double circular caching scheme (DCCS) to manage DRAM/PRAM hybrid cache. In our scheme, cached data migrate between DRAM cache and PRAM cache adaptively to achieve good hit ratio while frequent writes to PRAM cache are avoided for endurance concern. The experimental results showed that our scheme can reduce up to 87.10 percent PRAM write accesses for read-intensive access pattern and up to 44.90 percent energy consumption for write-intensive access pattern, compared with other caching schemes.", "paper_title": "DCCS: Double Circular Caching Scheme for DRAM/PRAM Hybrid Cache", "paper_id": "WOS:000362743300008"}
