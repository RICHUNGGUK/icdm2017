It is also shown that various generalizations of the Holevo capacity, defined in terms of the alpha-relative entropies, coincide for the parameter range alpha is an element of (0, 2], and an upper bound on the one-shot epsilon-capacity of a classical- quantum channel in terms of these capacities is given.", "paper_title": "On the Quantum Renyi Relative Entropies and Related Capacity Formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100047"}
