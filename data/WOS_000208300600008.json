Our experiments indicate that the resulting text index offers state-of-the-art compression. In particular, we require roughly 20% of the original text size-without requiring a separate instance of the text. We can additionally use a simple notion to encode and decode block-sorting transforms (such as the Burrows-Wheeler transform), achieving a compression ratio comparable to that of bzip2. We also provide a compressed representation of suffix trees (and their associated text) in a total space that is comparable to that of the text alone compressed with gzip.", "paper_title": "When Indexing Equals Compression: Experiments with Compressing Suffix Arrays and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000208300600008"}
