However, little published information is available on viewer use or experience. In this study, 120 people from 29 households were given a new TV (active or passive stereoscopic 3D, or conventional 20) and reported on their television viewing and other screen use on a near-daily basis over 8 weeks. People reported enjoying S3D TV and cinema more than TV and cinema in general, but enjoying S3D video games less than video games in general. S3D TV and video games were both associated with an increased, though still low (similar to 10%) level of adverse effects, such as headache and eyestrain. I speculate that this may be because video games present a particularly strong conflict between vergence and accommodative demand. (C) 2014 The Author.
