The method addresses the influences of dimensions and characteristics of drive-trains in the design optimization. Constraints are formulated on the basis of kinematic performance and dynamic requirements, whereas the main objective is to minimize the total mass. Case studies are included to demonstrate the application of the optimization method in the design of assistive robots. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
