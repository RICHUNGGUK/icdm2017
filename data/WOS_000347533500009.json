The research model was tested with a survey of university students in Singapore in the Facebook context. It is found that while general CSE affects continuance intention through both cognition and affection, specific CSE mainly affects continuance intention through cognition. It is also found that general computer experience affects general CSE only and specific computer experience affects specific CSE only.", "paper_title": "Understanding the continuance use of social network sites: a computer self-efficacy perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000347533500009"}
