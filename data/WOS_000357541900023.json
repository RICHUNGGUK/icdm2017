In the case we solve, the square of the wavenumber (refractive index) varies linearly in one coordinate, i.e. (Delta + E+ x(2))u(x(1), x(2)) = 0 where E is a constant; this models quantum particles of fixed energy in a uniform gravitational field, and has broader applications to stratified media in acoustics, optics and seismology. We evaluate the fundamental solution efficiently with exponential accuracy via numerical saddle-point integration, using the truncated trapezoid rule with typically 10(2) nodes, with an effort that is independent of the frequency parameter E. By combining with a high-order Nystrom quadrature, we are able to solve the scattering from obstacles 50 wavelengths across to 11 digits of accuracy in under a minute on a desktop or laptop.
