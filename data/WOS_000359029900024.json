However, current methods with traditional classifiers are usually based on one-to-one view matching and fail to capture the structure information of multiple views. Some multi-view based methods take different views into consideration, but they still treat views separately. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D object recognizing method based on multi-view data fusion, called Multi-view Ensemble Manifold Regularization (MEMR). In this method, we model image features with a regularization term for SVM. To train this modified SVM, multi-view learning is achieved with alternating optimization. Hypergraph construction is used to better capture the connectivity among views. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate has been improved by 20-25%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
