The notion of generating function is introduced as a simple and straightforward way to derive various affine invariants. By this notion, we can get the explicit construction of much more affine moment invariants. Based on this conclusion, a large set of invariant polynomials can be generated automatically and immediately by the algorithm we have designed. These new affine moment invariants can be applied to recognize the image. Approaches in this paper will improve the practicability of affine invariants in object recognition applications.
