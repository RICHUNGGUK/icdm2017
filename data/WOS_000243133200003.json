This problem is undecidable in general, but it is known to be decidable for binary and marked instances. A morphism is binary if the domain alphabet is of size 2, and marked if each image of a letter begins with a different letter. We prove that the solutions of a marked instance form a set E-omega boolean OR E*(P boolean OR F), where P is a finite set of ultimately periodic words, E is a finite set of solutions of the PCP, and F is a finite set of morphic images of fixed points of DOL systems. We also establish the structure of infinite solutions of the binary PCP.", "paper_title": "The structure of infinite solutions of marked and binary post correspondence problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243133200003"}
