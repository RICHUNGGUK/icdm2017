By constructing a novel Lyapunov functional, new sufficient criteria for the existence of a unique equilibrium and global exponential stability of the network are derived. Those results are shown to generalize the previous global exponential stability results derived in the literature.", "paper_title": "Global stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100065"}
