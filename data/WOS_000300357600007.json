The proposed comparator uses one phase clock signal for its operation and can drive a larger capacitive load with complementary version of the regenerative output latch stage. As it provides a larger voltage gain up to 22 V/V to the regenerative latch, the input-referred offset voltage of the latch is reduced and metastability is improved. The proposed comparator is designed using 90 nm PTM technology and 1 V power supply voltage. It demonstrates up to 24.6% less offset voltage and 30.0% less sensitivity of delay to decreasing input voltage difference (17 ps/decade) than the conventional double-tail latched comparator at approximately the same area and power consumption. In addition, with a digitally controlled capacitive offset calibration technique, the offset voltage of the proposed comparator is further reduced from 6.03 to 1.10 mV at 1-sigma at the operating clock frequency of 3 GHz, and it consumes 54 mu W/GHz after calibration.", "paper_title": "A novel low-power, low-offset, and high-speed CMOS dynamic latched comparator", "paper_id": "WOS:000300357600007"}
