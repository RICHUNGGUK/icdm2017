But in a structured peer-to-peer network, frequent joining and leaving may cause huge maintenance overhead. To deal with this churn problem, we proposed a two-tier architecture called adaptive sector-based routing model (ASBRM). In ASBRM the key space is divided into several sectors and each one has a super peer who plays the role of the relay proxy of the sector. When the number of peer members in a sector exceeds a predefined threshold, it will split into two sectors so that the traffic and computational overhead of the super peer can be kept within an acceptable range. For the convenience of explanation, we combine ASBRM with Chord and perform a series of simulations. Both analysis and simulation results show that ASBRM achieves lower communication cost of members' joining and leaving while at the same time the message routing path length is also shortened.
