However, privacy is a strategic issue and has been identified as a key hindrance to u-services. As a proactive approach and drawing upon integrative social contracts theory, this study presents a proactive privacy practices framework to examine how the interplays within electronic service, providers' proactive approaches influence customer disclosure willingness for future u-services, adoption. The results and implications of this study are discussed and expected to shed light on privacy practices.
