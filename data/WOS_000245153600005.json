As they are encoded in the global coordinate system, they need to be transformed locally to reflect the changed local features of the deformed surface. We present a novel implicit Laplacian editing framework which is linear and effectively captures local rotation information during editing. Directly representing rotation with respect to vertex positions in 3D space leads to a nonlinear system. Instead, we first compute the affine transformations implicitly defined for all the Laplacian coordinates by solving a large sparse linear system, and then extract the rotation and uniform scaling information from each solved affine transformation. Unlike existing differential-based mesh editing techniques, our method produces visually pleasing deformation results under large angle rotations or big-scale translations of handles. Additionally, to demonstrate the advantage of our editing framework, we introduce a new intuitive editing technique, called configuration-independent merging, which produces the same merging result independent of the relative position, orientation, scale of input meshes.", "paper_title": "Effective derivation of similarity transformations for implicit Laplacian mesh editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000245153600005"}
