In Part I, so-called 'optimal plastic design' of multi-load trusses is reviewed, which is based on ultimate (limit or collapse) load principles and requires only statical admissibility of the solution. However, its connections to 'optimal elastic design' will be explained, and these will be used in Part II for the full extension of Michell's theory to elastic multi-load problems, which will fill a significant gap in our knowledge.", "paper_title": "Fundamentals of exact multi-load topology optimization - stress-based least-volume trusses (generalized Michell structures) - Part I: Plastic design", "paper_id": "WOS:000349395800010"}
