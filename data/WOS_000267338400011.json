This paper introduces DANTE, a self-adapting P2P system that changes its peer links to form topologies where resources are located in an efficient manner via random walks. Additionally, this same self-adaptation capacity makes DANTE capable of reacting to events like changes in the system load or attacks on well-connected nodes by adjusting the topology to the new scenario. This adaptive behavior emerges as the global result of the individual work of nodes, without the intervention of any central entity or the need for global knowledge. Simulations show that this adaptation process makes the system scalable, resilient to attacks, and tolerant to a high transitivity of peers. Simulations are also used to compare this solution with other well-known self-adapting P2P system. From these results it can be concluded that the topologies achieved by DANTE offer better performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
