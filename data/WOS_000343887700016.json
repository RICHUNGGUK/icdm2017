In our previous work, we have proposed a divide-and-cover node placement for complete coverage of a long belt, but the subarea localization has not been considered in the design of such a placement. This paper studies the subarea localization performance for the divide-and-cover deployment. We first obtain a formula to compute the mean subarea localization error of the whole belt and then analyze the optimal placement parameter to minimize the subarea localization error. Theoretical analysis show that compared with other node placement including the well-known regular triangular-lattice placement, the proposed scheme can achieve a lower mean localization error. Field experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Subarea Localization Performance of the Divide-and-Cover Node Deployment in a Long-Bounded Belt Scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000343887700016"}
