However, their further applications have been severely hindered due to their computational challenge in practice. In this paper, we derive a simple form of the projection depth function, when (mu, sigma) = (Med, MAD). This simple form enables us to extend the existing result of point-wise exact computation of projection depth (PD) of Zuo and Lai (2011) to depth contours and median for bivariate data.
