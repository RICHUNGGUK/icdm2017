However, it suffers from the large amount of computing time required to obtain a near-optimal solution. To overcome this problem, a parallel version of the algorithm is worthy of evaluation. This report presents a Parallel Adaptive Simulated Annealing (PASA) algorithm for computer-aided measurement in locating the activation area of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI). The parallel paradigm is based on a coarse-grained (or island) model performed on a cluster of PCs by using a message-passing interface (MPI) for the information interchange. Performance of this approach is evaluated by computing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area and Jaccard similarity. Experimental results show that the coarse-grained PASA outperforms other approaches and can also efficiently and consistently extract activities with different contrast-to-noise ratios and activation-area sizes.
