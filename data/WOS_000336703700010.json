The process is implemented using an actual set of experimental results in the form of multi-phase cyclic-monotonic load histories. With the result of a multi-objective approach being a set of solutions (a set of calibrated models), the characteristics of these solutions are examined individually and within the framework of the entire set. Two elements of parameter determination are considered to address the characteristics of the calibrated models in a multi-objective space: the number of material constants, and the load history used to calibrate the models.
