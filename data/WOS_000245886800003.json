First, a linear QSAR model was developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Analysis, while the Elimination Selection-Stepwise Regression (ES-SWR) method was adopted for selecting the most suitable input variables. The predictive activity of the model was evaluated using an external validation set and the Y-randomization technique. Based on the selected descriptors, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification technique was utilized to classify data into two categories: \"actives\" or \"non-actives\". Several attempts were made to optimize the scaffold of most potent compounds by inducing various structural modifications. Potential derivatives with improved activities were identified, as they were classified \"actives\" by the SVM classifier. Their activities were estimated using the produced MLR model. A detailed analysis on the model applicability domain defined the compounds, whose estimations can be accepted with confidence.", "paper_title": "Optimization of biaryl piperidine and 4-amino-2-biarylurea MCH1 receptor antagonists using QSAR modeling, classification techniques and virtual screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000245886800003"}
