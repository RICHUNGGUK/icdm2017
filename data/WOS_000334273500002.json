The main functions of this system include house design, house decoration, and data management. For the house design, an automatic joint method of the walls is proposed, in order to design various house. For the house decoration, we introduce the wall decoration principle corresponding to the algorithm of discretization on the walls, which contains doors or windows, and triangularization on the irregular floors. To variety of different textures and collage regulations, we provide a new texture collage mapping method. Technology of rendering to texture is used to generate a small geometry texture, which will be mapped into a large target object on the basis of the texture's structural properties. As a result, the whole texture continuity is also maintained. In data management aspect, we embed a browser into this system so that users can conveniently obtain decoration models on the basis of web interaction. After these models have been downloaded, they can be shown in virtual scene according to guide information. In addition, some quotation lists can be generated automatically. Experimental results show that an authentic house can be easily presented in our system.
