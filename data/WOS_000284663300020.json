In this paper, we address the issue of load shuffling on a new type of AS/RS (i.e., the split-platform AS/RS), which have separate and independent mechanisms for horizontal and vertical movements. We present the shuffling algorithms for such AS/RS, and analyze the required shuffling time and retrieval time. Results from these analysis and numerical experiments show that the shuffling algorithms presented are indeed quite efficient. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
