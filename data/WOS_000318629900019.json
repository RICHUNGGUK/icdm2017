As the first step towards a verification tool using full separation logic, we develop a nested sequent calculus for Boolean BI (Bunched Implications), the underlying theory of separation logic, as well as a theorem prover based on it. A salient feature of our nested sequent calculus is that its sequent may have not only smaller child sequents but also multiple parent sequents, thus producing a graph structure of sequents instead of a tree structure. Our theorem prover is based on backward search in a refinement of the nested sequent calculus in which weakening and contraction are built into all the inference rules. We explain the details of designing our theorem prover and provide empirical evidence of its practicality.", "paper_title": "A Theorem Prover for Boolean BI", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629900019"}
