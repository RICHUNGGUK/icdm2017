By using QEMU as the instruction-accurate instruction set simulator (IA-ISS) and its capability to run a full-fledged operating system such as Linux, the virtual platform with the proposed interface can be used to facilitate the co-design of hardware models and device drivers at the early stage of Electronic System Level (ESL) design flow. In other words, by using such a virtual platform, the hardware models and associated device drivers can be cross verified while they are being developed so that malfunctions in the hardware models or the device drivers can be easily detected. Moreover, the virtual platform with the proposed interface is capable of providing statistics of instructions executed, memory accessed, and I/O performed at the instruction-accurate level thus not only making it easy to evaluate the performance of the hardware models but also making it possible for design space exploration.
