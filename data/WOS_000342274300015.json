The flow remains steady at Re = 100. At Re = 250 and 300, the flow can be classified into 2 flow regimes at these rotation rates. Flow at lower rotation rates is dominated by the well known Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability vortex formation mechanism which produces regular, coherent vortices. As rotation is increased above Omega* = 1.50, the frequency of vortex formation decreases by an approximate factor of two. Linear stability analysis shows that this change in frequency can be attributed to significant changes in the geometry of free shear layers near the surface of the sphere. As rotation rate is increased further (Omega* > 2.00), the flow enters the 'separatrix' regime. The separatrix divides the free stream flow and the surface-driven boundary layer that engulfs the sphere surface as a result of the rapid sphere rotation. The surface-driven boundary layer leads to better surface pressure recovery and lowers the time-averaged C-D. On the other hand, time-averaged C-L increases with Omega* in the 'separatrix' regime.
