The digital product data are enriched with virtual prototype (VP) model information and the designed exchange process is discussed. Additionally, an algorithm enabling the ontology-based data exchange method among missile guide systems is proposed and analyzed. Design/methodology/approach - Semantic sevice-oriented architecture (SSOA) is an innovative integration architecture for digital product information integration and process integration. In digital product ontology layer of SSOA, a new method of ontology-based product data exchange is proposed. Compared with traditional information exchange, the method adds the VP's information to general digital products' information. The VP's information is described by building VP static structure ontology and dynamic behavior ontology. The exchange process of the novel method is discussed in detail. Finally, an example illustrating the data exchange among missile guide systems is given and the merits of the proposed method is analyzed. Findings - Simulation information, especially VP information, is not always well defined and taken into account by product data exchange systems such as product data management or product lifecycle management. A formal description of VP information is often required in efficient and effective product data exchange. The goal is to define VP structure and behavior ontologies to enable ontology-based digital product data exchange. Originality/value - Using VP information including structure information and behavior information, the paper provides a new method of digital product data exchange.", "paper_title": "Digital product data exchange in semantic service-oriented architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000273285900015"}
