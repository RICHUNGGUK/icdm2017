However, we found out that their protocols are still susceptible to off-line password guessing attacks and do not secure against stolen-verifier attacks. Accordingly, this paper shows the vulnerability of Holbl et al.'s improved protocols to off-line password guessing attacks and stolen-verifier attacks and then proposes new robust protocols for remote user authentication and password change to resolve such problems.", "paper_title": "NEW ROBUST PROTOCOLS FOR REMOTE USER AUTHENTICATION AND PASSWORD CHANGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500034"}
