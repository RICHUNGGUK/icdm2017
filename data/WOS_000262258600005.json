This problem is the simplest variant of interpolation between parallel slices, which may contain multiple polygons with unrestricted geometries and/or topologies. Its solution has important applications to medical imaging, digitization of objects, geographical information systems, and more. Practically all currently-known methods for surface reconstruction from parallel slices assume a priori the existence of a non-self-intersecting triangulated surface defined over the vertices of the two polygons, which connects them. Gitlin et al. were the first to specify a nonmatable pair of polygons. In this paper we provide proof of the nonmatability of a \"simpler\" pair of polygons, which is less complex than the example given by Gitlin et al. Furthermore, we provide a family of polygon pairs with unbounded complexity, which we believe to be nonmatable. We also give a few sufficient conditions for polygon matability.", "paper_title": "ON THE MATABILITY OF POLYGONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262258600005"}
