In this paper, we focus on the design of orthopaedic implants that fit a maximum percentage of the target population, both in terms of geometry and biomechanical stability. CT scans of the bone under consideration are registered non-rigidly to obtain correspondences in position and intensity between them. A statistical model of shape and intensity (bone density) is computed by means of principal component analysis. Afterwards, finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to analyse the biomechanical performance of the bones. Realistic forces are applied on the bones and the resulting displacement and bone stress distribution are calculated. The mechanical behaviour of different PCA bone instances is compared.", "paper_title": "Statistical finite element model for bone shape and biomechanical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300050"}
