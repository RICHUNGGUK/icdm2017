This processor - the Reduceron - exploits parallel memories and dynamic analyses to increase evaluation speed, and is implemented using reconfigurable hardware. Compared to a more conventional functional language implementation targeting a standard RISC processor running on the same reconfigurable hardware, the Reduceron offers a significant improvement in run-time performance.", "paper_title": "The Reduceron reconfigured and re-evaluated", "paper_id": "WOS:000308672600006"}
