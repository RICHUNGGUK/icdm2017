Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) is a widely used tool for evaluating and ranking problems containing multiple, usually conflicting criteria. In line with the multi-dimensional characteristics of website quality, MCDM provides an effective framework for an inter-websites comparison involving the evaluation of multiple attributes. It thus ranks different websites compared in terms of their overall performance. This paper models the inter-website comparison problem as an MCDM problem, and presents a practical and selective approach to deal with it. In addition, fuzzy logic is applied to the subjectivity and vagueness in the assessment process. The proposed framework is effectively illustrated to rate Turkish government websites.", "paper_title": "Evaluating government websites based on a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175800004"}
