We apply subband coding (SBC) with lapped transform (LT) and zero pruning set partitioning in hierarchical trees (zpSPIHT) to encode the difference picture. Effective coding using zpSPIHT was achieved by quantizing and pruning the quantized zeros. The blocking distortion caused by block motion compensated prediction is reduced by an edge adaptive deblocking filter. Since the original edges can be detected precisely at the reference picture, an edge adaptive deblocking filter on the predicted picture is very effective. Experimental results show that blocking distortion has been visually reduced at very low bit rate coding and better PSNRs of about 1.0 dB was achieved.", "paper_title": "Moving Picture Coding by Lapped Transform and Edge Adaptive Deblocking Filter with Zero Pruning SPIHT", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600030"}
