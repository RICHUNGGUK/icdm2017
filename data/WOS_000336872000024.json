The actual aerodynamic equations for flight are used as motion model, and automatic target classification is made possible by the inclusion of radar cross section in the measurement vector. Thus, tracking and classification are closely coupled, giving full play to the advantages of joint tracking and classification. The proposed methodologies show good performance according to simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
