However, substantial challenges such as high peak temperatures, power densities and area footprints of vertical interconnects in each layer cannot be ignored. In this paper, a power and area efficient 3D NoC architecture based on power-aware Bidirectional Bisynchronous Vertical Channels (BBVC) is proposed as a solution to mitigate these challenges. Instead of using a pair of unidirectional channels for inter-layer communication, utilizing a dynamically self-configurable BBVC enables a system to benefit from low-latency nature of the vertical interconnects. In addition, based on the GALS implementation approach of the proposed channels, a forecasting-based dynamic frequency scaling technique for reducing the power consumption of the inter-layer communication is introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce up to 47% through-silicon via (TSV) area footprint and up to 18% NoC power consumption with a slight performance degradation compared to a typical Symmetric 3D NoC.
