It is therefore important for auditors to assure that the IS is well-controlled and secure. Auditors generally use Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques and Tools (CAATTs) to assist them in auditing the IS. though given the growing complexity of these systems, it is hard to completely perform a control test of the systems. This research aims to develop a mechanism, namely the Business Process Gap Detecting Mechanism (BPGAP-Detecting Mechanism), to automatically detect the business process gap between IS processes and internal control flows. This study also justifies the feasibility of BPGAP-Detecting Mechanism by providing a real case study. The result indicates that the BPGAP-Detecting Mechanism can assist the case company in resolving data quality problems that have occurred in its ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system and can also provide additional information for the company.
