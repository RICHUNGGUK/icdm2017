Many existing distributed frequent itemset mining algorithms do not allow users to express the itemsets to be mined according to their intention via the use of constraints. Consequently, these unconstrained mining algorithms can yield numerous itemsets that are not interesting to users. Moreover, due to inherited measurement inaccuracies and/or network latencies, the data are often riddled with uncertainty. These call for both constrained mining and uncertain data mining. In this journal article, we propose a data-intensive computer system for tree-based mining of frequent itemsets that satisfy user-defined constraints from a distributed environment such as a wireless sensor network of uncertain data.
