This paper describes how STEP-NC AP-238 is being tested for deployment in the United States of America. The tests focused on showing that STEP-NC AP-238 allows multiple CAM systems to send five-axis tool path data to multiple CNC machines without any post-processing. The paper also describes the results of previous work performed on a feature-based implementation of STEP-NC, and explains why US industry has had difficulty in adopting a feature-based implementation as its initial deployment method.", "paper_title": "Lessons learned implementing STEP-NC AP-238", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093300005"}
