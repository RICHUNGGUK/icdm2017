The program implements novel algorithms that efficiently infer most likely scenarios of gene duplication and loss events. Our comparative studies suggest that the general maximum likelihood model provides more credible estimates than standard parsimony reconciliation, especially when speciation times differ significantly. DrML is an open source project written in Python, and along with an on-line manual and sample data sets publicly available.", "paper_title": "DrML: Probabilistic Modeling of Gene Duplications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329163100006"}
