The network manager should make decisions related to effective utilization and fair allocation of limited resources, and appropriate guarantee of service quality. In this paper, we introduce a comparative method to help the network manager using resource allocation and pricing mechanisms for wireless multimedia services by considering user qualities of service and service provider profits. To that end, two well-known models of game theory: auction and bargaining are adapted. In particular, progressive second price auction and Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution are analyzed with regard to user cost and utility and service provider profit. While the network manager utilize the result of comparisons, it may be possible to make rational decision of selecting resource allocation and pricing mechanism by considering the status of network.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation and Pricing Mechanisms for Wireless Multimedia Service: Auction and Bargaining Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000329336200009"}
