In this context, it is difficult to develop optimal strategies to improve the design without first knowing how user cognitive load fluctuates during interaction. In this study, we investigate how cognitive load measurement is affected by different task types from the perspective of the load theory of attention, using pupil diameter and blink measures. We induced five levels of cognitive load during low and high perceptual load tasks and found that although pupil diameter showed significant effects on cognitive load when the perceptual load was low, neither blink rate nor pupil diameter showed significant effects on cognitive load when the perceptual load was high. The results indicate that pupil diameter can index cognitive load only in the situation of low perceptual load and are the first to provide empirical support for the cognitive control aspect of the load theory of attention, in the context of cognitive load measurement. Meanwhile, blink is a better indicator of perceptual load than cognitive load. This study also implies that perceptual load should be considered in cognitive load measurement using pupil diameter and blink measures. Automatic detection of the type and level of load in this manner helps pave the way for better reasoning about user internal processes for human-centered interface design.", "paper_title": "Using Task-Induced Pupil Diameter and Blink Rate to Infer Cognitive Load", "paper_id": "WOS:000335116500003"}
