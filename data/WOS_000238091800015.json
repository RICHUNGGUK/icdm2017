The sum of the weights of the vertices from U that are assigned (semi-matched) to some vertex v G V is referred to as the load of vertex v. In this paper, we consider the problem to finding a semi-matching that minimizes the maximum load among all vertices in V. This problem has been shown to be solvable in polynomial time by Harvey et. al.[3] and Fakcharoenphol et. al.[5] for unweighted graphs. However, the computational complexity for the weighted version of the problem was left as an open problem. In this paper, we prove that the problem of finding a semi-matching that minimizes the maximum load among all vertices in a weighted bipartite graph is NP-complete. A 3/2-approximation algorithm is proposed for this problem.", "paper_title": "On load-balanced semi-matchings for weighted bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800015"}
