In this framework, two hazard analysis techniques, hazard and operability analysis and fault tree analysis, are combined in a hybrid scheme. This is further enhanced using the Bayesian network model along with sensitivity analysis in order to answer complex probability queries and to estimate the impact of residual mishap risks, unknown events, or events that cannot easily be modeled. The SoS emergent behavior is further revealed using exploratory modeling. The proposed SoS framework is applied in the case of a fiber-to-the-curb VDSL telecommunication network.", "paper_title": "A System of Systems Framework for the Reliability Assessment of Telecommunications Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315640400012"}
