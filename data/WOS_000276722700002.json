The architecture is fully re-configurable among multiple standards like HSPA Evolution, DVB-SH, 3GPP-LTE and WiMAX. Turbo codes being widely used for error correction in today's consumer electronics are prone to introduce higher latency due to bigger block sizes and multiple iterations. Many parallel turbo decoding architectures have recently been proposed to enhance the channel throughput but the interleaving algorithms used in different standards do not freely allow using them due to higher percentage of memory conflicts. The architecture presented in this paper provides a re-configurable platform for implementing the parallel interleavers for different standards by managing the conflicts involved in each. The memory conflicts are managed by applying different approaches like stream misalignment, memory division and use of small FIFO buffer. The proposed flexible architecture is low cost and consumes 0.085 mm(2) area in 65 nm CMOS process. It can implement up to 8 parallel interleavers and can operate at a frequency of 200 MHz, thus providing significant support to higher throughput systems based on parallel SISO processors.", "paper_title": "Memory Conflict Analysis and Implementation of a Re-configurable Interleaver Architecture Supporting Unified Parallel Turbo Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000276722700002"}
