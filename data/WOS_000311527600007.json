The coherent detection method involving channel estimation is based on the correlation characteristics of the preamble signal. A coherent receiver uses novel iterated selective-rake (IT-SRAKE) to detect 2-bit data in a non-line-of-sight channel. The non-coherent detection method that does not involve channel estimation employs a 2-bit data detection scheme using modified transmitted reference pulse cluster (M-TRPC) methods. To compare the two schemes, we have designed an IT-SRAKE receiver and a M-TRPC receiver using an IEEE 802.15.4a physical layer. Simulation results show the performance of IT-SRAKE is better than that of the M-TRPC by 3-9 dB.", "paper_title": "Performance Comparison of Coherent and Non-Coherent Detection Schemes in LR-UWB System", "paper_id": "WOS:000311527600007"}
