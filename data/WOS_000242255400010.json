Furthermore, it presents two approaches to obtain the coefficient matrix of the second order term of the quadratic approximations in the form of Hessian matrix. The proposed approximations are based on the explicit partial differential equations which are shown to be satisfied by respective stable and unstable manifolds. Examples involving linear and nonlinear systems are solved showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Polynomial approximations for the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic equilibrium points using semi-tensor product", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255400010"}
