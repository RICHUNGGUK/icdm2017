We extend the problem examined by Chiu et al. [Chiu, Y.-S. P. Chiu, S. W., Li, C.-Y., & Ting, C.-K. (2009). Incorporating multi-delivery policy and quality assurance into economic production lot size problem. Journal of Scientific and industrial Research, 68(6), 505-512] by considering an n + 1 delivery policy in lieu of n multidelivery plan for the specific EPQ model with partial rework. Under such a policy, an initial delivery of perfect (finished) items is distributed to customer for satisfying product demand during manufacturer's regular production time and rework time. At the end of rework, fixed quantity n installments of the finished products are delivered to customer at a fixed interval of time. As a result, a closed-form optimal replenishment batch size solution to the problem is obtained. A numerical example with analysis and comparison is provided to show practical usage of the proposed model and demonstrate its significant savings in stock holding cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
