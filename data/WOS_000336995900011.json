In this paper, we propose interactive service recommendation based on ad concept hierarchy and contextual search. Instead of traditional ODP (Open Directory Project) based approach, we built a ad domain based concept hierarchy to make the most of the product details over the e-commerce sites. Firstly, we capture the summarization images related to the advertising product in the video content and search visually similar product images from the built product image database. Then, we aggregate the visual tags and textual tags with K-line clustering. Finally, we map them to the product concept space and make keywords suggestion, and users can interactively select keyframes or keywords to personalize their intentions by textual re-search. Experiments and comparison show that the system can accurately provide effective advertising suggestions.", "paper_title": "Interactive ads recommendation with contextual search on product topic space", "paper_id": "WOS:000336995900011"}
