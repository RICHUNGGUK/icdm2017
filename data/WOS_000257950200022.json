At each step, we solve a lower-dimensional system of linear equations by conjugate gradient method. The method terminates at the exact solution of the problem after a finite number of iterations. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed method is no more than the computational complexity of a conjugate gradient method for solving a system of linear equations. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the method is efficient. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
