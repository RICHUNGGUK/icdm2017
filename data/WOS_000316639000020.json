We choose a specific solution from the solution set of the linear complementarity constraints to define a locally Lipschitz continuous right-hand-side function in the differential equation. Moreover, we present a simple formula to compute an element in the Clarke generalized Jacobian of the solution function. We show that the implicit or semi-implicit time-stepping scheme using the generalized Newton method can be applied to a class of DLCS including the nondegenerate matrix DLCS and hidden Z-matrix DLCS, and has a superlinear convergence rate. To illustrate our approach, we show that choosing the least-element solution from the solution set of the Z-matrix linear complementarity constraints can define a Lipschitz continuous right-hand-side function with a computable Lipschitz constant. The Lipschitz constant helps us to choose the step size of the time-stepping scheme and guarantee the convergence.", "paper_title": "Newton iterations in implicit time-stepping scheme for differential linear complementarity systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316639000020"}
