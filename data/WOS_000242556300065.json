There has been little proposed work on this topic recently. In the present paper, two ACO algorithms (ACO I and ACO 11) for linear functions with Boolean input are indicated, and their time complexity is estimated based on drift analysis which is a mathematical tool for analyzing evolutionary algorithms. It is proved that the algorithm ACO 11 can find the optimal solution with a polynomial time complexity. It is a preliminary work about estimating the time complexity of ACO, which should be improved in the future study.", "paper_title": "A time complexity analysis of ACO for linear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300065"}
