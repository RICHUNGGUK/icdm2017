First, the channel state information (CSI) is approximated by using a subspace matrix, then, the approximated CSI is compressed using a compressive matrix. At the base station, the approximated CSI can be robust recovered with simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm by using forgone CSIs. Simulation results show our proposed DCS-CF method can improve the reliability of system without creating a large performance loss.", "paper_title": "A New Compressive Feedback Scheme Based on Distributed Compressed Sensing for Time-Correlated MIMO Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000306129700008"}
