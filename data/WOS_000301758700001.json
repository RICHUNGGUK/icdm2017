By extending the technique of Sambin and Vaccaro we show that (1) for each Sahlqvist fixed point formula phi there exists an LFP-formula chi(phi), with no free first-order variable or predicate symbol, such that a descriptive mu-frame (an order-topological structure that admits topological interpretations of least fixed point operators as intersections of clopen pre-fixed points) validates phi iff chi (phi) is true in this structure, and (2) every modal fixed point logic axiomatized by a set Phi of Sahlqvist fixed point formulas is sound and complete with respect to the class of descriptive mu-frames satisfying {chi (phi) : phi is an element of Phi}. We also give some concrete examples of Sahlqvist fixed point logics and classes of descriptive mu-frames for which these logics are sound and complete. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
