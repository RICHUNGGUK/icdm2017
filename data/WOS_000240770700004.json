In this paper, we present a new approach to reachablility analysis called blocking-based simultaneous reachability analysis (or BSRA). A central notion in BSRA is that of a global blocking point. Instead of exploring every global state, BSRA only explores a set of global blocking points, which usually account for a small portion of the state space. We show how to use BSRA to detect several commonly found logical errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that BSRA can significantly reduce the number of states explored during protocol validation.", "paper_title": "A blocking-based approach to protocol validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240770700004"}
