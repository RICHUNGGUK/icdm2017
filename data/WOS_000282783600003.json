In this paper, a biomimetic approach is proposed for solving the problem of redundancy resolution. First, the kinematics of the human upper limb while performing random arm motion are investigated and modeled. The dependencies among the human joint angles are described using a Bayesian network. Then, an objective function, built using this model, is used in a closed-loop inverse kinematic algorithm for a redundant robot arm. Using this algorithm, the robot arm end-effector can be positioned in the three dimensional (3D) space using human-like joint configurations. Through real experiments using an anthropomorphic robot arm, it is proved that the proposed algorithm is computationally fast, while it results to human-like configurations compared to previously proposed inverse kinematics algorithms. The latter makes the proposed algorithm a strong candidate for applications where anthropomorphism is required, e.g. in humanoids or generally in cases where robotic arms interact with humans.", "paper_title": "A biomimetic approach to inverse kinematics for a redundant robot arm", "paper_id": "WOS:000282783600003"}
