Based on a reparametrization of the covariance matrix of random effects in terms of modified Cholesky decomposition, we propose to add a shrinkage penalty term to the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) function of the variance components for selecting effective random effects. The shrinkage penalty term is taken as a function of the variance of random effects, initiated by the fact that if the variance is zero then the corresponding variable is no longer random (with probability one). The proposed method takes the advantage of a convenient computation for the PQL estimation and appealing properties for certain shrinkage penalty functions such as LASSO and SCAD. We propose to use a backfitting algorithm to estimate the fixed effects and variance components in GLMMs, which also selects effective random effects simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach performs quite well in selecting effective random effects in GLMMs. Real data analysis is made using the proposed approach, too.", "paper_title": "Random effects selection in generalized linear mixed models via shrinkage penalty function", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380000004"}
