In this paper we describe and analyze a general framework for the detection, evaluation, incorporation and removal of structure constraints into a feature-based graph formulation of SLAM. We specifically show how including different kinds and levels of features in a hierarchical manner allows the system to easily discover new structure and why it makes more sense than other possible representations. The main algorithm in this framework follows an expectation maximization approach to iteratively infer the most probable structure and the most probable map. Experimental results show how this approach is suitable for the integration of a large variety of constraints and how our method can produce nice and consistent maps in regular environments.", "paper_title": "Feature based graph-SLAM in structured environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000340409000002"}
