Recently, the problem has been abstracted as the challenge planted (l,d)-motif problem. Previous studies have developed numerous methods to solve the problem. But most of them need to specify the length l of a planted motif in advance and use depth first search strategy. In this study, we present an exact and efficient algorithm, called Apriori-Motif, without given the length l of a planted motif a priori. And a breadth first search strategy is used to prune search space quickly by the downward closure property utilized in Apriori, which is a classical algorithm for frequent pattern mining. Empirical study shows that Apriori-Motif is better than some existing methods.", "paper_title": "A Frequent Pattern Mining Method for Finding Planted Motifs of Unknown Length in DNA Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300026"}
