The key challenge of next-generation media applications is to federate cooperative devices to provide multi-device experiences overcoming current second screen solutions within the connected TV industry. There is a gap on the experience of users, since they perceive devices as isolated pieces of applications when they would prefer to have a single experience through multiple devices at the same time. This paper proposes a unified methodology and a common specification over Web Components for the adaptation of a single application, seamlessly running different instances on one or more devices simultaneously, according to the multi-device context of the user and the specific features of the devices. The solution presented in this paper extends current Web standards towards an interoperable architecture and offers broadcasters and media application developers the possibility to easily design applications that will automatically provide a unique consistent experience across the connected devices. The architectural design is targeted to be included in the roadmap of the standards.", "paper_title": "A Web-based distributed architecture for multi-device adaptation in media applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000359809000005"}
