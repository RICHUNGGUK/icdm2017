The transient performance of the system under variable wind gust and other disturbance conditions has been studied. It has been observed that a stand alone generator is very vulnerable to transient disturbances in the system. A variable susceptance excitation control system, installed at the generator terminal, has been shown to improve the dynamic performance of the system following transient disturbances. Additional pole-placement based PI and PID controllers in the excitation control circuit are shown to control the violently oscillating and even growing transients very effectively. The robustness of the proposed controller has been tested for various disturbances and also for a range of operation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
