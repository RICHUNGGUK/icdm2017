Activities are said to be overlapping if two activities that are normally executed in sequence are performed in parallel, the successor starting before the end of the predecessor. This article presents a novel method that identifies an optimal overlap rate between critical activities to provide a time-cost trade-off analysis, hence reducing completion time and cost without allocating additional resources. This method is then coded into Concurrent Construction Scheduling Simulation System ((CS2)-S-2) that makes use of schedule data exported from Primavera Project Planner (P6), integrates the activities' concurrency attributes, calculates the rework probability/amount, and computes the variability in project completion time and cost by adjusting the overlap between activities. This study is of value to practitioners because (CS2)-S-2 allows establishing a compressed schedule that satisfies a limited budget within a specified contract duration. The study is also of relevance to researchers because it identifies the optimal overlaps between activities expeditiously. Two test cases verify the usability and validity of the computational methods implemented in the system.", "paper_title": "Concurrent Construction Scheduling Simulation Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000337689500004"}
