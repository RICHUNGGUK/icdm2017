The wavelet kernel which is admissible support vector kernel is characterized by its local analysis and approximate orthogonality, and we can well obtain estimates for regression by applying a least squares wavelet support vector machines (LS-WSVM). To test the validity of the proposed method, this paper demonstrates that LS-WSVM can be used effectively for the identification and adaptive control of nonlinear dynamical systems. Simulation results reveal that the identification and adaptive control schemes suggested based on LS-WSVM gives considerably better performance and show faster and stable learning in comparison to neural networks or fuzzy logic systems. LS-WSVM provides an attractive approach to study the properties of complex nonlinear system modeling and adaptive control.", "paper_title": "Identification and control of dynamic systems based on least squares wavelet vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000138"}
