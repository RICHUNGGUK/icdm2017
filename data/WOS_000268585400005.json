The main result is that every infinite sequence S with constructive Hausdorff dimension dim (H)(S) and constructive packing dimension dim (P)(S) is Turing equivalent to a sequence R with dim (H)(R)a parts per thousand yen(dim (H)(S)/dim (P)(S))-epsilon, for arbitrary epsilon > 0. Furthermore, if dim (P)(S)> 0, then dim (P)(R)a parts per thousand yen1-epsilon. The reduction thus serves as a randomness extractor that increases the algorithmic randomness of S, as measured by constructive dimension. A number of applications of this result shed new light on the constructive dimensions of Turing degrees. A lower bound of dim (H)(S)/dim (P)(S) is shown to hold for the Turing degree of any sequence S. A new proof is given of a previously-known zero-one law for the constructive packing dimension of Turing degrees. It is also shown that, for any regular sequence S (that is, dim (H)(S)=dim (P)(S)) such that dim (H)(S)> 0, the Turing degree of S has constructive Hausdorff and packing dimension equal to 1. Finally, it is shown that no single Turing reduction can be a universal constructive Hausdorff dimension extractor, and that bounded Turing reductions cannot extract constructive Hausdorff dimension. We also exhibit sequences on which weak truth-table and bounded Turing reductions differ in their ability to extract dimension.", "paper_title": "Constructive Dimension and Turing Degrees", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585400005"}
