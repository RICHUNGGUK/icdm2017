Cloud computing not only brings multitude of opportunities, but it also bears some challenges. One of the key challenges it faces is recovery of computing nodes, when an Information Technology (IT) failure occurs. Since cloud computing mainly depends upon its nodes, physical servers, that makes it very crucial to recover a failed node in time and seamlessly, so that the customer gets an expected level of service. Work has already been done in this regard, but it has still proved to be trivial. In this study, we present a Cost- Time aware Genetic scheduling algorithm, referred to as CTaG, not only to globally optimize the performance of the cloud system, but also perform recovery of failed nodes efficiently. While modeling our work, we have particularly taken into account the factors of network bandwidth and customer's monetary cost. We have implemented our algorithm and justify it through extensive simulations and comparison with similar existing studies. The results show performance gain of our work over the others, in some particular scenarios.", "paper_title": "CTaG: An Innovative Approach for Optimizing Recovery Time in Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000354983500001"}
