Poor health among caregivers is not only detrimental to their own well-being but may also result in harm to those for whom they care. For this reason, caregivers need access to information and activities about caring for themselves in addition to the information about managing home care they are already likely to seek. The HPN Family Caregivers Web site was developed to guide caregivers through the process of caring for themselves by establishing a caregiving routine, self-monitoring their mental and physical health, and practicing good sleep hygiene, while also managing the complexities of home care. While Web site information, activities, and algorithms for managing chronic illnesses need to be specific to each population, the content guiding caregivers to care for their own health is universal.", "paper_title": "Creating Patient and Family Education Web Sites Design and Content of the Home Parenteral Nutrition Family Caregivers Web Site", "paper_id": "WOS:000296913000004"}
