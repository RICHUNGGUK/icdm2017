Sleep scheduling algorithms are introduced in these networks to reduce the energy consumption of the nodes in order to enhance the network lifetime. In this paper, a novel fuzzy method called Fuzzy Active Sleep (FAS) is proposed to activate the appropriate nodes of WSNs. It uses the selection probability of nodes based on their remaining energy and number of previous active state. The proposed method focuses on a balanced sleep scheduling in order to belong the network lifetime. Simulation results show that the proposed method is more efficient and effective than the compared methods in terms of average network remaining energy, number of nodes still alive, number of active state, and network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Determining the State of the Sensor Nodes Based on Fuzzy Theory in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000337771000004"}
