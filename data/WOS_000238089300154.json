User's immersion is achieved using a large rear-projected stereoscopic screen, a 5.1 audio system, and fan-based olfactory displays. An educational Virtual Reality application that allows students to experiment the electron bound state in the Bohr atom model and the quantification of the energy levels through the haptic channel, is presented. This application can be run in both immersive and desktop configurations including haptic interaction, ranging from pseudo-haptic illusion to human-scale haptic immersion.", "paper_title": "Multi-modal virtual environments for education: From illusion to immersion", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300154"}
