An important part of these architectural decisions is often formalized using constraint languages which differ from one stage to another in the development process. In this paper, we present a family of architectural constraint languages, called ACL. Each member of this family, called a profile, can be used to formalize architectural decisions at a given stage of the development process. An ACL profile is composed of a core constraint language, which is shared with the other profiles, and a MOF architecture metamodel. In addition to this family of languages, this paper introduces a transformation-based interpretation method of profiles and its associated tool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
