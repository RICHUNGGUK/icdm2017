A graph G has g-width k if there are k independent sets N(1),...,N(k) in G such that G can be embedded into a graph H is an element of g, such that for every edge e in H which is not an edge in G, there exists an i such that both endvertices of e are in N(i). For the class B of block graphs we show that graphs with B-width at most 4 are perfect. We also show that B-width is NP-complete and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable. For the class C. of complete graphs, similar results are also obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Block-graph width", "paper_id": "WOS:000290598900005"}
