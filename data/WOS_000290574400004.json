How to calculate the cycle time based on demand of different models also making problem more difficult. According to different work experiences and skill level, the processing time of a given task and the operating costs such as wages differ among workers. Appointing the proper worker to the proper station and assigning the suitable task to the suitable station in order to decrease the cycle time, increase the line efficiency, and reduce the total cost make the problem more complex. This paper proposes a new concept for calculating the cycle time based on demand ratio of each model and another one for calculating the human resource cost. A generalized Pareto-based scale-independent fitness function genetic algorithm (gp-siffGA) is described for solving mixed-model assembly lines balancing (mALB) problems to minimize the cycle time, the variation of workload and the total cost under the constraint of precedence relationships at the same time. The gp-siffGA uses Pareto dominance relationship to solve the problems without using relative preferences of multiple objectives. Comparisons with existing multiobjective genetic algorithms demonstrate that our approach efficiently solves mALB problems.", "paper_title": "An efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm for mixed-model assembly line balancing problem considering demand ratio-based cycle time", "paper_id": "WOS:000290574400004"}
