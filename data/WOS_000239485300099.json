Predictions were based on intuition, biochemical properties, statistics, sequence homology and other aspects of predicted protein structure. In this paper a promising method for detecting the domain structure of a protein from sequence information alone was presented. The method is based on analyzing multiple sequence alignments that are derived from a database search. Multiple measures are defined to quantify the domain information content of each position along the sequence and are combined into a single predictor using support vector machines. The overall accuracy of the method for a single protein chains dataset, is about 85%. The result demonstrates that the utility of the method can help not only in predicting the complete 3D structure of a protein but also in the study of proteins' building blocks and for functional analysis.", "paper_title": "Prediction of protein domains from sequence information using support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300099"}
