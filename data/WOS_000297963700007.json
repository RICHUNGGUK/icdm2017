A possibilistic formalization of the problem and solution concepts in this setting, which lead to compute robust solutions under fuzzy weights, are given. Some algorithms for finding a solution according to the introduced concepts and evaluating optimality of solutions and elements are provided. These algorithms are polynomial for bottleneck combinatorial optimization problems with uncertain element weights, if their deterministic counterparts are polynomially solvable.
