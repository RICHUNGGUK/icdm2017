The image-space reconstruction offers an advantageous time complexity compared to surface splatting techniques and, in fact, our improved GPU implementation performs significantly better than splatting implementations for large point-based models. We discuss the integration of elliptical Gaussian weights for enhanced image quality and generalize the image-space reconstruction to line segments. Furthermore, we present solutions for the efficient combination of points, lines, and polygons in a single image. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
