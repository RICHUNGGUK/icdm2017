Topology control techniques of UASNs are significantly different from those of terrestrial wireless sensor networks, due to the properties of underwater environments and acoustic communications. This research begins with a scale-free network model for calculating edge probability, which is used to generate initial topology randomly. Subsequently, a topology control strategy based on complex network theory (TCSCN) is put forward to construct a double clustering structure, where there are two kinds of cluster-heads to ensure connectivity and coverage, respectively. The performance of TCSCN is analyzed through simulation experiments that indicate a well-constructed topology, where (1,xi)-Coverage and (1,zeta)-Connectivity can be achieved while optimizing energy consumption and propagation delay as much as possible.", "paper_title": "A Complex Network Approach to Topology Control Problem in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800001"}
