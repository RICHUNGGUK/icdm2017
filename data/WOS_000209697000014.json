The proposed scheme exploits the FD operation at the relay node and forms the Alamouti codewords in three block periods. We characterize the outage probability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the investigated FD scheme. Our analysis demonstrates that as the strength of the LI decreases and the spectral efficiency increases, the FD Alamouti scheme significantly outperforms conventional half-duplex designs.", "paper_title": "Full-Duplex Cooperative Diversity with Alamouti Space-Time Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000014"}
