The problems of counting the number of solutions of systems of polynomial inequalities over R, or of systems of polynomial equalities over C, respectively, turn out to be natural complete problems in these classes. We investigate to what extent the new counting classes capture the complexity of computing basic topological invariants of semialgebraic sets (over R) and algebraic sets (over C). We prove that the problem of computing the Euler-Yao characteristic of semialgebraic sets is FP#(PR)-complete, and that the problem of computing the geometric degree of complex algebraic sets is FP#(RPC)(C) -complete. We also define new counting complexity classes in the classical Turing model via taking FPC complete. We, Boolean parts of the classes above, and show that the problems to compute the Euler characteristic and the geometric degree of (semi)algebraic sets given by integer polynomials are complete in these classes. We complement the results in the Turing model by proving, for all k is an element of N, the FPSPAGE-hardness of the problem of computing the kth Betti number ofthe set of real zeros of a given integer polynomial. This holds with respect to the singular homology as well as for the Borel-Moore homology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
