It is able to compute arbitrary-length convolutions more efficiently via transforming the convolution into a first-order moment. Although many additions are required, the proposed algorithm has some advantages such as the avoidance of multiplications, simple computation structure, and only integer additions. These advantages contribute to this algorithm being so easy that it can compute convolutions rapidly. Based on the proposed algorithm a very simple and scalable systolic array without multipliers and ROM has been developed leading to more efficient VLSI implementation of convolutions.", "paper_title": "Novel Convolutions Using First-Order Moments", "paper_id": "WOS:000304448100011"}
