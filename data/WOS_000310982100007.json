Our goal is to minimize the transmission power of mobile terminals (MTs). Consider a cellular system, where multiple MTs exchange information with their common base station, firstly, we propose an efficient bandwidth allocation method and then give a transmission strategy for each MT to determine whether to use relay stations (RSs) for its two-way transmission with the BS or not. To further improve the system performance, the optimal positions of RSs are also jointly discussed. A GA-based algorithm is presented to obtain the optimum positions for RSs. Besides, the impacts of frequency reuse on MT's transmission power and system spectral efficiency (SE) under different number of relays are also discussed in our work. Numerical results show that the proposed NC aware scheme can extend MTs' battery life at least 6% more than traditional method.", "paper_title": "Transmission Power Minimization with Network Coding for Mobile Terminals in Cellular Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310982100007"}
