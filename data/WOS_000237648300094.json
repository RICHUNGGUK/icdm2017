Until now there are a lot of approaches using Self-Organizing Feature Maps(SOFMs). But they have problems with a small output-layer nodes and initial weight. This paper suggests one-dimensional output-layer nodes in SOFMs. The number of output-layer nodes is more than those of clusters intended to find and the order of output-layer nodes is ascending in the sum of the output-layer node's weight. We can find input data in SOFMs output node and classify input data in output nodes using the Euclidean Distance. The suggested algorithm was tested on well-known IRIS data and machine-part incidence matrix. The results of this computational study demonstrate the superiority of the suggested algorithm.", "paper_title": "A clustering algorithm using the ordered weight sum of self-organizing feature maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300094"}
