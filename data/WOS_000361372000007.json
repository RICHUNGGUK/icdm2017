In this system, Android application has to capture face, and verify the face by Web services. It is introduced how to implement an Android Client of this system in details. Using MB-LBP features, AdaBoost and CamShift algorithm, get face images by camera on mobile device. Then, rotate, crop the face images and convert them to grayscale in order to reduce the amount of face data. At last, post data and get validation results using sub-thread to realize real-time face verification.", "paper_title": "Implementation: Mobile Face Identity Authentication System on Android Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000007"}
