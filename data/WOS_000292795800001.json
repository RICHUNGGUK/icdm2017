The points are inserted one at a time. The objective is to distribute the points as uniformly as possible. More specifically, after each insertion, the gap ratio should be as small as possible. We give an insertion strategy with a maximal gap ratio no more than 2 root 2 approximate to 2.828, which is the first result in uniformly inserting points in a grid. Moreover, we show that no online algorithm can achieve the maximal gap ratio strictly less than 2.5 for a 3 x 3 grid. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
