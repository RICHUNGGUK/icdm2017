This paper proposes an analytical approach for evaluating the impact of carrier sense setting on the throughput efficiency of wireless access networks. A time continuous Markov chain is used to describe the system, and to further gathering performance measures in terms of throughput and collision probability. Numerical results obtained through the model and further validated against simulations are used to derive qualitative dimensioning criteria for the carrier sense under different network conditions.
