The model of a doubly fed induction generator, along with the corresponding converter, crow bar protection and electrical grid is described. The different level control strategies both in normal operation and under voltage dig conditions are discussed, including speed control, torque and reactive power control for the rotor-side converter, reactive and DC voltage control for the grid-side converter and the corresponding current loops control. The results obtained with simulations are compared to experimental data obtained from voltage sags provoked to real wind turbines. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
