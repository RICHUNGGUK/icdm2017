Computing the optimal solution is very time consuming, and existing methods can only provide sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a non-linear objective function that better utilizes a camera network to track multiple targets. We also show that, by expanding the unknown parameters and imposing new constraints, the non-linear objective function can be converted into a linear production game (LPG) problem. Since an LPG yields an optimal solution that can be evaluated in polynomial time, the proposed method is efficient and accurate. The results of simulations and a real-world experiment demonstrate the proposed method's potential.", "paper_title": "Linear Production Game Solution to a PTZ Camera Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000319531800008"}
