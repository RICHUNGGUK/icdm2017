The telemedicine system provides connectivity to three participant sites: the general practitioner or nurse at the point of care in the dialysis unit, the remote information and processing server and the cardiologist. At the clinical point of care, the nurse acquires the electrocardiogram (ECG) by using a tailored mobile telecardiology system as well as other relevant physiological information during the clinical procedure, and sends it to the information server. The received information is stored in a secure file server, linked to the patient database and the ECG signal is automatically analyzed by using advanced signal processing tools in the processing server, where a complete clinical results report is generated. The cardiologist can then be linked by means of a web browser to the information server to analyze these results for further clinical diagnosis support. The system has been applied to study HRV in patients undergoing haemodialysis. The clinical report consisted of trends for time- and frequency-domain HRV indexes and other supplementary information automatically calculated, which show the response of the electrical activity of the heart to the dialysis process and that can be helpful for the follow-up of these patients. The telecardiology framework has been successfully evaluated both by the patients and the hospital personnel showing a high compliance with the system. The design and implementation of the telecardiology system have followed the most recent advances in web technologies, biomedical information and storage standards and signal processing techniques. The presented system can be used as a telemedicine tool for clinical diagnosis support and could also be used in other clinical settings. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
