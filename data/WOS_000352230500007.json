The scope of this work is to consider situations in which the whole domain does not demand the use of a kinetic model everywhere. This is the case of many realistic applications: some regions of the computational domain require a microscopic description, given by a kinetic model while the rest of the domain can be described by a coarser model of fluid type. Our aim is to show how the kinetic scheme developed in the pre-cited articles is perfectly suited for building domain decomposition strategies which make the method more attractive with respect to classical numerical techniques for kinetic equations and multi-scale realistic problems. Several numerical evidences are provided in this work in the two dimensional and three dimensional settings to assess the efficiency of the domain decomposition scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
