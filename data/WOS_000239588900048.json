This system is designed for people to facilitate the detection of signs of risks from a variety of documents that are scattered in the WWW. This system comprises two parts-clearinghouse and the Risk Path Finder. The former is a database of documents related to food safety risks, which are retrieved from the WWW by using Google Web APIs. The latter visualizes the relationship between terms and documents and enables users to find the paths from sources to risk events. For this function, the system utilizes GETA, the generic engine for transposable association, and DualNAVI, a user interface for text retrieval by using GETA.", "paper_title": "An early warning support system for food safety risks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900048"}
