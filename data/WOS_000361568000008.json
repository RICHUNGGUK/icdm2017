The states are bound entanglement for the bipartite split (AB) - C. The states are non-positive partial transpose (NPT) entanglement and 1-copy undistillable for the bipartite splits A - (BC) and B - (AC). Moreover, we generalize the results of 2 circle times 2 circle times 2 systems to the case of 2n circle times 2n circle times 2n systems.", "paper_title": "Bound entanglement and distillability of multipartite quantum systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361568000008"}
