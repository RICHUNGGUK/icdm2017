Suppose that if a particle clashes with (contacts) any of the absorption points, it is absorbed (trapped) with probability p and non absorbed with probability q = 1 - p. Let X-n be the number of absorbed particles from a queue of n particles and T-k the number of particles required to cross the field until the absorption of k particles. Assuming that the number Y of absorption points in the field obeys a q-Poisson distribution (Heine or Euler distribution), the distributions of X-n and T-k are obtained as q-binomial and q-Pascal distributions, respectively. Inversely, assuming that X-n obeys a q-binomial distribution (or, equivalently, assuming that T-k obeys a q-Pascal distribution), the distribution of Y is obtained as a q-Poisson distribution (Heine or Euler distribution).", "paper_title": "On the Distributions of Absorbed Particles in Crossing a Field Containing Absorption Points", "paper_id": "WOS:000305269500010"}
