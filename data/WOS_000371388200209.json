The proposed FD cognitive MAC (I-DC-MAC) protocol does not require synchronization among SUs, and it efficiently utilizes the spectrum and mitigates the self-interference in the FD transceiver. We develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the I-DC-MAC protocol, where both half-duplex (HD) transmission and FD transmission modes are considered in the transmission stage. Then, we study the FDC-MAC configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the spectrum sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage. We prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to achieve the maximum throughput, and we develop an algorithm to configure the proposed I-DC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation quality on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the I-DC-MAC protocol with respect to the existing HD MAC and single-stage FD MAC protocols.", "paper_title": "Design and Optimal Configuration of Full-Duplex MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks Considering Self-Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200209"}
