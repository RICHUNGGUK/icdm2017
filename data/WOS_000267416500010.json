Design/methodology/approach - At the beginning of conducting an index demonstration and development on a new system, its unit reliability index can already reflect the unit reliability level accurately. Based on this characteristic, this index is used as the confidence lower limit of single side estimated in the unit reliability interval to find the failure distribution law of the unit. On this basis, a great number of simulated tests are made by a computer to calculate the unit failure number and reliability point estimated value every test. Findings - The confidence lower limit of single side estimated in the system reliability interval is found by counting up the simulated test data of these units. Research limitations/implications - Availability of data is the main limitation regarding which model will be applied. Practical implications - A useful advice for system reliability analysis and calculation. Originality/value - This paper presents a new approach of system reliability analysis.", "paper_title": "A computational method of system reliability of a successful product based on a simulated test", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500010"}
