This paper proposes a coexistence scheme that is called a Hybrid station aided coexistence (HYSAC) scheme to solve this problem. This scheme employs a hybrid-station (H-STA) that possesses two types of network device functions. The scheme improves the data transmission quality of the WPAN devices which transmit energy management information such as power consumption. The proposed HYSAC scheme employs WLAN control frames, which are used to assign WPAN system traffic resources. Moreover, we propose a coexistence method to achieve excellent WLAN throughput where multiple WPANs coexist with a WLAN. We theoretically derive the performance of the proposed scheme by considering the QoS support in WLAN and show that the results of the simulation and theoretical analysis are in good agreement. The numerical results show that the HYSAC scheme decreases the beacon loss rate of WPAN to less than 1% when the WLAN system consists of 10 STAs under saturated traffic conditions. Furthermore, the WLAN throughput of the proposed synchronization method is shown to be 30.6% higher than that of the HYSAC scheme without synchronization when the WLAN that consists of 10 STAs coexists with four WPANs.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Station Aided Coexistence Scheme between Wireless PANs and Wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400017"}
