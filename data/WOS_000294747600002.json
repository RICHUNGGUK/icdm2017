DELS are networks of resources through which material flow. They have been the subject of a large body of analytic research. A huge variety of specific models exists that generally require application by model and/or solution experts to answer narrowly-defined logistics questions about inventory, sourcing, scheduling, routing, etc. It has, however, proven difficult to integrate these models in any comprehensive way into information systems for logistics because of the lack of conceptual alignment between the models produced by researchers and the information systems deployed in practice with which they should be integrated. In this paper, we systematically identify several challenges for DELS research. We analyse the root of the difficulties for applying academic research results in DELS, and indicate some potential future research directions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
