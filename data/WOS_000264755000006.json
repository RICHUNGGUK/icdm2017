The fault model considered in this research is a system level fault model based on the generic properties of NoC switch functionality. The proposed method is evaluated by fault simulation in a platform using this system level fault model. The experimental results show that with a relatively low area overhead, a large number of NoC switch faults can be detected and diagnosed.", "paper_title": "Online Network-on-Chip Switch Fault Detection and Diagnosis Using Functional Switch Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000264755000006"}
