We conducted two controlled experiments: the first included a simple set of DFDs and tasks that required a basic understanding of the system, while the second involved more detailed views of the same processes, and also a more complex task. Subjects who used the fisheye process models outperformed those using the traditional presentations. This difference was reflected in task performance for all subjects, and in task completion time for inexperienced subjects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
