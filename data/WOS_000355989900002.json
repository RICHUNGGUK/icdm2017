VCPS is deeply influenced by the performance of the underlying vehicular network with intermittent connections, which make existing routing solutions hardly to be applied directly. Epidemic routing, especially the one using random linear network coding, has been studied and proved as an efficient way in the consideration of delivery performance. Much pioneering work has tried to figure out how epidemic routing using network coding (ERNC) performs in VCPS, either by simulation or by analysis. However, none of them has been able to expose the potential of ERNC accurately. In this paper, we present a stochastic analytical framework to study the performance of ERNC in VCPS with intermittent connections. By novelly modeling ERNC in VCPS using a token-bucket model, our framework can provide a much more accurate results than any existing work on the unicast delivery performance analysis of ERNC in VCPS. The correctness of our analytical results has also been confirmed by our extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "An Improved Stochastic Modeling of Opportunistic Routing in Vehicular CPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900002"}
