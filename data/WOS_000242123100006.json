In Pictorial KeyGraph, photographs of physical objects corresponding to incomprehensible items in given data are embedded to the visual result of KeyGraph applied to their business report. In their communications with Pictorial KeyGraph, novel and practical scenarios of new products design were extracted, and 5 new patents have been applied. We found evidences that the team members tend to combine established concepts via rare words in creative designing.", "paper_title": "Emerging novel scenarios of new product design with teamwork on scenario maps using pictorial KeyGraph", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100006"}
