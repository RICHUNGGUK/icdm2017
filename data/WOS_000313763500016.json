In light of the growing activities, how to measure a user's influence to other users in online social media becomes increasingly important. This research need is urgent especially in the online healthcare community since positive influence can be beneficial while negative influence may cause-negative impact on other users of the same community. In this article, a research framework was proposed to study user influence within the online healthcare community. We proposed a new approach to incorporate users' reply relationship, conversation content and response immediacy which capture both explicit and implicit interaction between users to identify influential users of online healthcare community. A weighted social network is developed to represent the influence between users. We tested our proposed techniques thoroughly on two medical support forums. Two algorithms User Rank and Weighted in-degree are benchmarked with Page Rank and in-degree. Experiment results demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of our proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Ranking User Influence in Healthcare Social Media", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763500016"}
