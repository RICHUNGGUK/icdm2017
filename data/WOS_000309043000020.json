The existence of linear-sized supercentrator has been proved in [4]. Since then, the size has been decreased significantly. The best known size is 28N which is proved by U. Schoning in [8]. Our work follows their construction and proves a smaller size superconcentrator.", "paper_title": "Smaller Bound of Superconcentrator", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043000020"}
