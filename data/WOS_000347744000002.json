The GLOMONET was first proposed by Suzuki and Nakada in 1997. In 2012, Mun et al. designed an improved scheme based on GLOMONET, but their scheme still has some weaknesses. To overcome these weaknesses, we proposed a novel authentication scheme that uses smart card and also reduces the computational cost. Hence, our scheme achieves the requirement of providing good security, and it also has better efficiency, which makes it suitable for use in the battery-powered mobile devices that are used in global mobility networks.", "paper_title": "Practical Secure and High Efficient Authentication Scheme in Global Mobility Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347744000002"}
