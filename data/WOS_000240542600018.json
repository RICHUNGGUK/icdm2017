Using video cameras is quite straightforward on this matter. However, it is still a difficult task to do human motion analysis through only video data. In this paper, we discuss the necessity and the way to combine information from video sensors and other types of sensors, especially, the RFID reader. Data acquisition of RFID and video data is discussed first. Combinatorial information fusion techniques for multiple sources of information are then introduced. On the other hand, rule based methods provide an alternative solution for combining the two sources of information. An example in monitoring real-life learning behavior is also given.", "paper_title": "Behavior analysis with combined RFID and video information", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600018"}
