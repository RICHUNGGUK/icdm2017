Therefore, an ecological model can be considered a text T, written in a formal (mathematical) language defined by the authors as L(M-T). Design/methodology/approach - The language chosen is a regular language generated by regular grammars which in turn are generated by finite automaton. Findings - A text results from a union of some finite automata defining a textual grammar. Recognoscitive and generative grammars of words, defining the basis of the L(M-T) language are developed. Practical implications - A mathematical modelling of ecological systems is developed in parts I and H of this research project. Originality/value - A language for ecological systems modelling has been defined and its implementation discussed.", "paper_title": "Regular grammars of L(M-T): a language for ecological systems modelling (I) - part I", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900021"}
