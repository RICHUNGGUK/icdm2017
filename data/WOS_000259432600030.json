Various uncertainties, including uncertain processing time, uncertain orders and uncertain arrival times, are considered and described as random variables. A mathematical model for this order scheduling problem is presented with the objectives of maximizing the total satisfaction level of all orders and minimizing their total throughput time. Uncertain completion time and beginning time of production process are derived firstly by using probability theory. A genetic algorithm, in which the representation with variable length of sub-chromosome is presented, is developed to generate the optimal order scheduling solution. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm by using real-world production data. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
