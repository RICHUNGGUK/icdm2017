A prewhitening procedure is introduced, which makes it numerically robust. The estimation capability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations of DOA (Degree of Arrival) estimation. The estimation results of the proposed PAST outperform those of the ordinary PAST.", "paper_title": "A prewhitening RLS projection alternated subspace tracking (PAST) algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000199"}
