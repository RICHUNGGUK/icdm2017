This has been done for the purpose of establishing an accurate coupling model which can be used in an automatic tuning device of volume-producing filters. In the method, a coupling model that reveals the effect of mechanical structure on the filter electrical performance is established by using a proposed algorithm which can incorporate multi-kernel and prior knowledge into linear programming support vector regression (LPSVR). Some experiments from three microwave filters have been performed, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the support-vector modeling method. Moreover, the comparative results also show that the proposed multi-kernel prior knowledge LPSVR can improve the data-driven modeling accuracy of small dataset. The proposed algorithm show great potential in some problems where a sufficient experimental data is difficult and costly to obtain, but some prior knowledge data from a simulation model can be easily obtained.
