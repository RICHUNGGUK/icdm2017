In this paper, the proposed method integrates the temporal, spatial and geometric constraint information to improve the recognition accuracy. To interpret the sketch as an incremental process, the paper investigates the use of the information fusion technique with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) chain for modeling and understanding the spatial and temporal information of sketch sequences. Online sketch recognition is achieved through the use of the SVMs-chain for systematically modeling the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of the sketch. To validate its efficiency, the experimental results in various domains and the comparison with traditional Hidden Markov Models have been presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
