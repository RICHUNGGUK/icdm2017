Due to the amount of different information to be managed during the process, the use of GIS is essential. To properly proceed with the distribution of the new replacement plots, the alphanumeric database included noteworthy factors such as the soil quality of the initial lands and the preferences of the owners. The graphic database consisted of a geo-reference map over which other interesting information, such as topography, types of soil and means of communication, are merged. As result of this procedure, different information was obtained (such as final assignments and mass for each replacement plot, as well as land consolidation plans), and the software developed has showed its capability for more efficient land consolidation.
