Strong evidence indicates that these neurons are part of a path integration system. This raises the question, how such a system could be implemented in the brain. Here, we present a cyclically connected artificial neural network based on a path integration mechanism, implementing grid cells on a simulated mobile agent. Our results show that the synaptic connectivity of the network, which can be represented by a twisted torus, allows the generation of regular triangular grids across the environment. These tessellations share same spacing and orientation, as neighboring grid cells in the dMEC. A simple gain and bias mechanism allows to control the spacing and the orientation of the grids, which suggests that these different characteristics can be generated by a unique algorithm in the brain.", "paper_title": "A model of grid cells based on a path integration mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100077"}
