We formulate this problem as an optimal stopping problem and propose a myopic rule with low complexity, called one stage look ahead (1-SLA), to solve it. Moreover, the optimality of the 1-SLA rule for the energy-efficient channel exploration problem is proved, and simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the 1-SLA rule.", "paper_title": "Optimal Energy-Efficient Channel Exploration for Opportunistic Spectrum Usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000008"}
