Based on the drive-response concept the stochastic differential inclusions theory and Lyapunov functional method some new criteria are established to guarantee the exponential synchronization in the pth moment of stochastic memristor-based neural networks. The obtained sufficient conditions can be checked easily and improve the results in earlier publications. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the new scheme.
