In the following paper the method of using the operational map of robot surrounding, which is complemented with visible structured passive landmarks, is described. These landmarks are used to improve self-localisation accuracy of the robot camera and to reduce the size of the Kalman-filter state-vector with respect to the vector size involving point-wise environment features only. Structured landmarks reduce the drift of the camera pose estimate and improve the reliability of the map which is built on-line. Results of simulation experiments are described, proving advantages of such an approach.", "paper_title": "VISUAL SIMULTANEOUS LOCALISATION AND MAP-BUILDING SUPPORTED BY STRUCTURED LANDMARKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279919600006"}
