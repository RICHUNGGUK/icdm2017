Specifically, we focus on applications where drivers are supported in complex driving tasks by safe strategies involving the coordinated movements of multiple vehicles to complete the driving task successfully. We propose a divide and conquer approach for formally verifying timed probabilistic requirements on successful completion of the driving task and collision freedom based on formal specifications of a set of given manoeuvring and communication capabilities of the car. In particular, this allows an assessment of whether they are sufficient to implement strategies for successful completion of the driving task.", "paper_title": "Can we build it: formal synthesis of control strategies for cooperative driver assistance systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321510700002"}
