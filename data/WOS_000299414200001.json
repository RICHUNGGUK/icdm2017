Feature Set Reduction (FSR) was able to reduce the dimensions of an SNP array dataset by more than two orders of magnitude while achieving at least equal, and in most cases superior predictive classification performance over that achieved on features selected by existing feature selection methods alone. An examination of the biological relevance of frequently selected features from FSR-reduced feature sets revealed strong enrichment in association with cancer.", "paper_title": "FSR: feature set reduction for scalable and accurate multi-class cancer subtype classification based on copy number", "paper_id": "WOS:000299414200001"}
