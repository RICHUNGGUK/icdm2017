The objective of m-Healthcare is to provide ubiquitous healthcare services; however, its application in the life-critical vehicular environment has thus far received limited attention. In this paper, we propose mvSERS, a secure emergency response solution for vehicular environments. Based on existing advanced technologies, mvSERS facilitates secure realtime monitoring and rapid emergency responses. In particular, mvSERS utilizes dual emergency response centers to effectively process different levels of emergencies. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that mvSERS meets fundamental security requirements, such as data confidentiality, authenticity and integrity; we also verify that it resists replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, identity theft and forgery attacks. Simulated experiments are also performed to demonstrate that mvSERS achieves good performance in terms of reducing storage costs, computational complexity and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "mvSERS: A Secure Emergency Response Solution for Mobile Healthcare in Vehicular Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000017"}
