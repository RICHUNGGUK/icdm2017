In many earlier works, the locations of the transmitters is often modeled as a Poisson point process for analytical tractability. While analytically convenient, the PPP only accurately models networks whose nodes are placed independently and use ALOHA as the channel access protocol, which preserves the independence. Correlations between transmitter locations in non-Poisson networks, which model intelligent access protocols, makes the outage analysis extremely difficult. In this paper, we take an alternative approach and focus on an asymptotic regime where the density of interferers eta goes to 0. We prove for general node distributions and fading statistics that the success probability P(S) similar to 1 - gamma eta(kappa) for eta -> 0, and provide values of gamma and kappa for a number of important special cases. We show that kappa is lower bounded by 1 and upper bounded by a value that depends on the path loss exponent and the fading. This new analytical framework is then used to characterize the transmission capacity of a very general class of networks, defined as the maximum spatial density of active links given an outage constraint.", "paper_title": "High-SIR Transmission Capacity of Wireless Networks With General Fading and Node Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300034"}
