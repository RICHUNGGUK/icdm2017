A variety of relaxations for quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) can be formulated as semidefinite programs (SDPs). The primary purpose of this paper is to present a systematic comparison of SDP relaxations for QCQP. Using theoretical analysis, it is shown that the recently developed doubly nonnegative relaxation is equivalent to the Shor relaxation, when the latter is enhanced with a partial first-order relaxation-linearization technique. These two relaxations are shown to theoretically dominate six other SDP relaxations. A computational comparison reveals that the two dominant relaxations require three orders of magnitude more computational time than the weaker relaxations, while providing relaxation gaps averaging 3% as opposed to gaps of up to 19% for weaker relaxations, on 700 randomly generated problems with up to 60 variables. An SDP relaxation derived from Lagrangian relaxation, after the addition of redundant nonlinear constraints to the primal, achieves gaps averaging 13% in a few CPU seconds.", "paper_title": "Semidefinite relaxations for quadratically constrained quadratic programming: A review and comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000293791700007"}
