The SegBus platform is one of the solutions for application deployment on multi-core applications. There are many applications where identical data is transferred from the same source towards different destinations. Multicast services may come as a performance improving factor for the interconnection platform, together with interrupt service. In this paper, the task is to analyze, how different services can be designed for the SegBus platform and observe the improvement in system performance. The designer can select the services according to the requirements. The running example is represented by the H.264 encoder. The SegBus platform architecture, the communication mechanism, the allocation of processing elements on the platform, the communication services and their implementation are the main topics elaborated here.
