Phase watermarking algorithm that uses multi-polarity Walsh-Hadamard and Complex Hadamard transform is developed. The robustness of presented algorithm is investigated by its uniqueness, JPEG encoding, image resizing, dithering noise distortions, sharpening, cropping and successive watermarking.", "paper_title": "Phase watermarking algorithm using hybrid multi-polarity Hadamard transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000252167700002"}
