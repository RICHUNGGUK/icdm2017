While a myriad of proportional-share algorithms were made for network and processor resources. little research work has been conducted on disk resources, which exhibit non-linear performance characteristics attributed to disk head movements. This paper proposes a new proportional-share disk-scheduling algorithm, which accounts for overhead caused by disk head movements and QoS guarantees in an integrated manner. Performance evaluations via simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm improves I/O throughput by 11-19% with only 1-2% QoS deterioration. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
