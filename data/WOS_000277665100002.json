In this paper, we present a dynamic meta-learning framework for failure prediction. It intends to not only provide reasonable prediction accuracy, but also be of practical use in realistic environments. Two key techniques are developed to address technical challenges of failure prediction. One is meta-learning to boost prediction accuracy by combining the benefits of multiple predictive techniques. The other is a dynamic approach to dynamically obtain failure patterns from a changing training set and to dynamically extract effective rules by actively monitoring prediction accuracy at runtime. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practical use of this framework by means of real system logs collected from the production Blue Gene/L systems at Argonne National Laboratory and San Diego Supercomputer Center. Our case studies indicate that the proposed mechanism can provide reasonable prediction accuracy by forecasting up to 82% of the failures, with a runtime overhead less than 1.0 min.
