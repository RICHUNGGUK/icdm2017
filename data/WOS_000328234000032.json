We assume that the processing time of a job is a function of the amount of a resource allocated to it, its position in the processing sequence, and its aging effect. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is a function of earliness, tardiness, due-window starting time, due-window size, and resource consumption. We consider two models of the job processing time function and provide polynomial-time solution algorithms for the corresponding problems. We also give a more efficient solution algorithm for a special case of the second problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
