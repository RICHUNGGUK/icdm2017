The uncertainties satisfy the so-called \"matching conditions\" and the bound is known. In this paper, a sufficient condition for practical stability of dynamic systems is first presented. Then a controller design method for uncertain T-S fuzzy systems is derived, which is based on the above sufficient condition and the quadratic stability condition for T-S fuzzy systems. The advantage of our approach is that the controller we present contains a tuning parameter which can improve systems performance and the main computation process can be conveniently performed by LMI toolbox. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the obtained approach.", "paper_title": "Practical stability analysis and synthesis of a class of uncertain T-S fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000002"}
