The systems using clustering provide the grouped information to the users. The complex metadata description generated on the basis of pre-defined ontologies serve as perfect input data for clustering. In this paper, we propose an approach for clustering ontology-based metadata. Main contribution of this paper are the definition of evaluation function to measure ontology-based metadata and study using this evaluation function within hierarchical clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "A study of the evaluation function and the clustering algorithm for semantic web environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100129"}
