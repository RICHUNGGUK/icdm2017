In ILABC, at each generation, the whole population is divided into several subpopulations by the clustering partition and the size of subpopulation is dynamically adjusted based on the last search experience, which results in a clear division of labor. Furthermore, the two search mechanisms are designed to facilitate the exchange of information in each subpopulation and between different subpopulations, respectively, which acts as the cooperation. Finally, the comparison results on a number of benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed method performs competitively and effectively when compared to the selected state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Based on Information Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300017"}
