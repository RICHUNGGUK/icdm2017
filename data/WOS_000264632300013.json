With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of identifying \"similar\" artists using features from diverse information sources. In this paper, we first present a clustering algorithm that integrates features from both sources to perform bimodal learning. We then present an approach based on the generalized constraint clustering algorithm by incorporating the instance-level constraints. The algorithms are tested on a data set consisting of 570 songs from 53 albums of 41 artists using artist similarity provided by All Music Guide. Experimental results show that the accuracy of artist similarity identification can be significantly improved.", "paper_title": "Music Clustering With Features From Different Information Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632300013"}
