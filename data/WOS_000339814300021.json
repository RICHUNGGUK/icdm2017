The program is based on algorithms with running time O(n log n) for the triplet distance calculation and O(d . n log n) for the quartet distance calculation, where n is the number of leaves in the trees and d is the degree of the tree with minimum degree. These are currently the fastest algorithms both in theory and in practice.", "paper_title": "tqDist: a library for computing the quartet and triplet distances between binary or general trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000339814300021"}
