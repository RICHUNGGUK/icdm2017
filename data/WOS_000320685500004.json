Collaboration requires communication, but it may happen that it could not be established for some reason. In this context, members of the herd have to make decisions on their own, trying to do the best for the group. Inspired by this principle, we have designed a method to overcome the communication difficulties of the environment. The team members compete using their own decisions, and this competition affects the best possible way for the team to benefit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
