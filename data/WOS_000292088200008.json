Simulation results prove that the probe radiates with a pattern like a dipole showing a realized gain of around -8 dBi at 60 GHz, which is a huge leakage from a probe. The radiation pattern and the realized gain of the probe at 60 GHz have also been measured, confirming the simulation results. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
