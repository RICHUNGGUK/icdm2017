The study involved simulating the performance of a 5 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator in an environment with static obstacle. The robot manipulator is required to move from one position to a desired goal position with minimum error while avoiding collision with obstacles in the workspace. The four variants of PSO are namely PSO-W, PSO-C, qPSO-W and qPSO-C where the latter two algorithms are hybrid version of the first two. The hybrid PSO is created by incorporating quadratic approximation operator (QA) alongside velocity update routine in updating particles' position. The computational results reveal that PSO-W yields better performance in terms of faster convergence and accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
