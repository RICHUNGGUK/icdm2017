The closed-form expressions of diversity order and the end-to-end outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio regime are derived for arbitrary relay number (K) and antenna configuration (N antennas at the source and each relay, ND antennas at the destination) under independent but not necessarily identical Rayleigh fading channels. The analysis is carried out in terms of the availability of the direct link between the source and the destination. It is demonstrated that the diversity order is min{N,ND}KN if the direct link is blocked, and if the direct link is available, the diversity order becomes min{N,ND}KN+NND. Simulation and numerical results verify the analysis well.
