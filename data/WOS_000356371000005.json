Due to these forces, the substrate experiments a volume reduction leading to a characteristic shape. ECM contraction is a key process in many biological processes such as embryogenesis, morphogenesis and wound healing. However, little is known about the specific parameters that control this process. With this aim, we present a 3D computational model able to predict the contraction process of a hydrogel matrix due to cell-substrate mechanical interaction. It considers cell-generated forces, substrate deformation, ECM density, cellular migration and proliferation. The model also predicts the cellular spatial distribution and concentration needed to reproduce the contraction process and confirms the minimum value of cellular concentration necessary to initiate the process observed experimentally. The obtained continuum formulation has been implemented in a finite element framework. In parallel, in vitro experiments have been performed to obtain the main model parameters and to validate it. The results demonstrate that cellular forces, migration and proliferation are acting simultaneously to display the ECM contraction.", "paper_title": "Structural biology response of a collagen hydrogel synthetic extracellular matrix with embedded human fibroblast: computational and experimental analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000356371000005"}
