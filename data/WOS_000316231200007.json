The ambiguous location information often makes the collected data useless in these applications. Environmental monitoring relies on an accurate position estimation to process or evaluate the collected data. In this paper, we present a novel and scalable approach for positioning of mobile sensor nodes with the goal of monitoring the Amazon river. The actors in the scenario are stationary and positioned at reachable spots on the land alongside the river whereas sensor nodes are thrown into the river to collect data such as water temperature, depth, and geographical features. The actors are not equipped with positioning adaptors, and they are only aware of their distances from the other actors. The sensor nodes collect data and forward it to the actors. While floating in the river, sensor nodes are often multiple hops away from the actors, which makes it challenging to apply traditional positioning techniques. Through extensive simulations, we show that the nodes can be efficiently positioned using a multi-hop approach with local information exchange only. The introduced approach is also applied to a scenario, where monkey swarm monitoring is simulated, to test the generalizability of the algorithm.
