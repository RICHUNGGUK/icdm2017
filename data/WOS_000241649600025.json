Conditions for the algorithm to produce correct results are derived using a path-based approach. Previous sequential algorithms for this task have been based on algorithms that compute the digital Euclidean distance transform. It is shown that the latter approach is not well-suited for distances based on neighbourhood sequences.", "paper_title": "Generating distance maps with neighbourhood sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600025"}
