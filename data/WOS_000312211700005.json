In particular, there have been several recent algorithms proposed that extend the usefulness of LZ factorization, for example, to the calculation of maximal repetitions. In this article, we provide an overview of these new algorithms and compare their efficiency in terms of their usage of time and space.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Index-Based Lempel-Ziv LZ77 Factorization Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000312211700005"}
