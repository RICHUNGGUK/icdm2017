Our method is a fusion strategy based on selection among the segmentation outcomes of different segmentation methods or models. First, we present and analyse an iris segmentation framework which uses three different models to show that improvements can be obtained by selection among the outcomes generated by the three models. Then, we introduce a model selection method which defines the optimal segmentation based on a ring-shaped region around the outer segmentation boundary identified by each model. We use the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) as features extracted from the ring-shaped region, and train a SVM-based classifier which provides the selection decision. Experiments on colour iris datasets, captured by mobile devices and static camera, show that the proposed method achieves an improved performance compared to the individual iris segmentation models and existing algorithms.
