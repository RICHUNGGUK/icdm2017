A scale wheel loader was designed and manufactured to validate the dynamic model in two conditions, namely turning on slopes and passing over obstacles. Experimental data and simulated data fitted well on the whole, so the developed dynamic model was proved to be useful and could serve as an important tool to analyse the stability of wheel loaders. At last, the lateral stability of one ZL50 wheel loader was analysed by using this dynamic model. The results showed that there is a phenomenon of sudden stability losing during the wheel loader cornering due to the relative rotation between the subframe and the rear axle. The subframe can enhance the stability when the wheel loader is passing over obstacles but reduces the stability when it is turning.", "paper_title": "Research on lateral stability and rollover mechanism of articulated wheel loader", "paper_id": "WOS:000330932000003"}
