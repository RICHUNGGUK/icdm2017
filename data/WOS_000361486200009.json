However, the search space for an optimal or suboptimal schedule will exponentially grow with the increase of problem size. In this paper, we consider the scheduling problems of FMS in the framework of timed-transition Petri nets. In the framework, each token owns a individual timestamp which faciliates the analysis of the concurrency characteristic of modeled system. To save search effort, we provide an admissible heuristic function which also considers the available time of shared machine resources and subparts during calculating the lower bound of the remaining time for unprocessed operations. We prove the heuristic function is more effective than prior ones. Thus, an optimal scheduling strategy can be obtained at much less effort. Several numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effect of the improved heuristic function.", "paper_title": "Scheduling FMS problems with heuristic search function and transition-timed Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000361486200009"}
