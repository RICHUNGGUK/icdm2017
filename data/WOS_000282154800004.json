For this purpose, the bridging stress and crack opening relations were obtained by the fiber bridging constitutive law which is quantitatively able to consider the fiber distribution characteristics. And then, a multi-linear model is employed for a simplification of the bridging stress and crack opening relation. In addition, to account the variability of material properties, randomly distributed properties drawn from a normal distribution with 95% confidence are assigned to each element which is determined on the basis of crack spacing. To consider the variation of crack spacing, randomly distributed crack spacing is drawn from the probability density function of fiber inclined angle calculated based on sectional image analysis. An equation for calculation of the crack spacing that takes into quantitative consideration the dimensions and fiber distribution was also derived. Subsequently, a series of simulations of ECC tensile stress-strain curves was performed. The simulation results exhibit obvious strain hardening behavior associated with multiple cracking, which correspond well with test results.", "paper_title": "Prediction of ECC tensile stress-strain curves based on modified fiber bridging relations considering fiber distribution characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000282154800004"}
