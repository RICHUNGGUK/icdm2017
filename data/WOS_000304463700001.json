To survive, electrical and electronics manufacturers have had to develop strategies to meet these requirements as well as search for new management methods that are feasible and have low risk. A number of studies have pointed out that a large portion of a new product's environmental quality (e. g. in compliance with RoHS) is determined at the beginning of the product development stage. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose, from a systematic point of view, several critical control processes applicable to the product development stage. Backcasting is applied for the process development. An internationally recognised quality management system, IECQ QC080000 HSPM, is referred to at the baseline step to help analyse a sustainability gap analysis of major flows. Unified Modeling Language sequence diagrams are further adopted to describe and specify the details of these processes. At the end, potential applications and possible extensive research projects are discussed. It is expected that the results can help firms gain effective control of product management.", "paper_title": "Critical control processes to fulfil environmental requirements at the product development stage", "paper_id": "WOS:000304463700001"}
