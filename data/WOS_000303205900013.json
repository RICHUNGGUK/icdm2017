The main idea of this approach is first to approximate a nonlinear function by a piecewise-linear representation. Then, using the recursive formulae of general orthogonal polynomials, orthonormal bases can be produced for fast simulation of the PWL model. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two nonlinear circuit models.", "paper_title": "Application of General Orthogonal Polynomials to Fast Simulation of Nonlinear Descriptor Systems Through Piecewise-Linear Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303205900013"}
