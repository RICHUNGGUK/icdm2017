Recently, Hwang et al. proposed a practical (t, n) threshold proxy signature scheme based on the RSA cryptosystem. However, the scheme has several security weaknesses pointed out by Wang et al. In order to overcome the security issues of the existing threshold proxy signature schemes, we propose an improved (t, n) threshold proxy signature scheme, and demonstrate that our scheme is more secure and effective when compared to Hwang's scheme and others. Moreover, the proposed scheme has an optional capability of fault tolerance to balance the scalability under different situations.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED (t, n) THRESHOLD PROXY SIGNATURE SCHEME WITH FAULT TOLERANCE BASED ON RSA", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800028"}
