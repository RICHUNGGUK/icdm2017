Design/methodology/approach - Sliding mode control approach is known to be an efficient alternative way to implement synchronization for uncertain chaotic systems. However, design of traditional sliding mode controller usually needs complex state transformation. Owing to a novel idea of virtual state feedback, a control strategy for synchronization of uncertain chaotic systems is presented, which does not need any complex state transformation. Furthermore, based on Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition is drawn for the robust stability of the error dynamics of synchronization for uncertain chaotic systems. Findings - A novel active sliding mode control approach is proposed to achieve the synchronization of two uncertain chaotic systems. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that uncertainties must meet matched conditions. Practical implications The paper presents a useful control approach for synchronization of two uncertain chaotic systems. Originality/value - The proposed sliding mode control approach based on novel virtual state feedback does not need any complex state transformation, unlike the traditional sliding mode control.", "paper_title": "A novel active sliding mode control for synchronization of uncertain chaotic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312434000008"}
