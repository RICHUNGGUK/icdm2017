By using suitable on-off controllers, sufficient conditions for finite-time outer synchronization are derived based on the Lyapunov function and the finite-time differential inequality method. The theoretical results imply that the two networks will achieve finite-time outer synchronization for fixed on-off rate if the control coupling strength is large enough. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time outer synchronization between two complex dynamical networks with on-off coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000353956300012"}
