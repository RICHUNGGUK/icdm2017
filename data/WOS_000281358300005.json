The benefit is to let the user stick to his/her own data model to access database in another data model. This paper presents a semantic metadata to preserve database constraints for data materialization to support the user's view of database on an ad hoc basis. The semantic metadata can store the captured semantics of a relational or an XML-enabled database into classes. The stored constraints and data can be materialized into a target database upon user request. The user is allowed to perform data materialization many times alternatively. The process can provide a relational as well as an XML view to the users simultaneously. This concurrent data materialization function can be applied into data warehouse to consolidate heterogeneous database into a fact table in a data model of user's choice. Furthermore, a user can obtain either a relational view or an XML view of the same dataset of an XML-enabled database interchangeably.", "paper_title": "CONCURRENT DATA MATERIALIZATION FOR XML-ENABLED DATABASE WITH SEMANTIC METADATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000281358300005"}
