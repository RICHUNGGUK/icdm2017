Based on the search biases strategy suggested by Runarsson and Yao, a hybrid of multiobjective differential evolution and genetic algorithm with (N+N) framework for constrained MOPs is given. And then the hybrid algorithm adopting the two schemes respectively is compared with the constrained NSGA-II on 4 benchmark functions constructed by Deb. The experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm has better performance, especially in the distribution of non-dominated set.", "paper_title": "A hybrid of differential evolution and genetic algorithm for constrained multiobjective optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300041"}
