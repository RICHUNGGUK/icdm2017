This study considers mathematical programming problems with non-L-R type fuzzy parameters. It shows that the fuzzy solutions to such problems can be obtained by solving an optimization problem on a mixed domain. The necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the resulting optimization problems are investigated by employing the theory of convex optimization on mixed domains. This is the first attempt to solve the fuzzy optimization problem with non-L-R type membership functions in view of optimization problems on a mixed domain.", "paper_title": "Non-L-R Type Fuzzy Parameters in Mathematical Programming Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200002"}
