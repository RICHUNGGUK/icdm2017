In spite of this rapid growth, users experience high levels of frustration when searching for the desired image. Even though new images are profitable to the service providers. traditional collaborative filtering methods cannot recommend them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose feature-based collaborative filtering (FBCF) method to reflect the user's most recent preference by representing his purchase sequence in the visual feature space. The proposed approach represents the images that have been purchased ill the Past as the feature Clusters ill the multi-dimensional feature Space and then selects neighbors by using an inter-cluster distance function between their feature clusters. Various experiments using real image data demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a higher quality recommendation and better performance than do typical collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.", "paper_title": "Image Recommendation Algorithm Using Feature-Based Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630300004"}
