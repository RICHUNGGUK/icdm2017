The standard approach is often based oil the conventional limit equilibrium method using equivalent Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters (c and phi) in a slip circle slope stability analysis. The purpose of this paper is to apply the finite element upper and lower bound techniques to this problem with the aim of providing seismic stability charts for rock slopes. Within the limit analysis framework, the pseudo-static method is employed by assuming a range of the seismic coefficients. Based oil the latest version of Hock-Brown failure criterion, seismic rock slope stability charts have been produced. These chart solutions bound the true stability numbers within +/- 9% or better and are suited to isotropic and homogeneous intact rock or heavily jointed rock masses. A comparison of the stability numbers obtained by bounding methods and the limit equilibrium method has been performed where the later was found to predict unconservative factors of safety for steeper slopes. It wits also observed that the stability numbers may increase depending oil the material parameters in the Hoek-Brown model. This phenomenon has been further investigated in the paper.
