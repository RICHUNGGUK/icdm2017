We identify very precisely the condition on a linear permutation defining a CCZ isomorphism between functions which ensures that the CCZ isomorphism can be rewritten as EA isomorphism. We introduce new algebraic invariants n(f) of the EA isomorphism class of f and s(f) of the CCZ isomorphism class of f, with n(f) < s(f), and relate them to the differential uniformity of f. We formulate three questions about partitioning CCZ classes into EA classes and relate these to a conjecture of Edel's about quadratic APN functions.", "paper_title": "PARTITIONING CCZ CLASSES INTO EA CLASSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000299867600006"}
