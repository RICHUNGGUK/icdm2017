Two heuristic optimizations provide over 3x speedup versus a sequential baseline. In our parallel approach, sets of design signals are assigned to different processor cores and routed concurrently. Communication between cores is through the message passing interface communications protocol. We propose a geographic partitioning of signals into independent sets to help minimize the communication overhead. Our parallel implementation provides approximately 2.3x speedup using four cores and produces deterministic/repeatable results. When combined, the parallel and heuristic techniques provide over 7x speedup with four cores versus the router in the widely used Versatile Place and Route (VPR) FPGA placement/routing framework, with no significant impact on circuit speed or wirelength.", "paper_title": "Accelerating FPGA Routing Through Parallelization and Engineering Enhancements Special Section on PAR-CAD 2010", "paper_id": "WOS:000298327500007"}
