The proposed dVFC has been designed in 1.2-V 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, and it works properly over the whole differential input range (0.6 +/- A 0.6 V) providing an output frequency range of 0.0-0.9 MHz. The system has been tested for temperature variations from -40 to +120 A degrees C and supply voltage variations of up to 30 %, being the maximum linearity error in the worse case of 0.017 %. Simulations against common mode voltage variations show a deviation in the output frequency of 0.4 %. This dVFC has power consumption below 60 mu W, and it includes an enable terminal that sets the system in a sleep mode (180 nW) while no conversion is request. The dVFC occupies an active area of 250 mu m x 150 mu m.", "paper_title": "A rail-to-rail differential quasi-digital converter for low-power applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000323652500003"}
