The relative Kolmogorov n-width of W relative to V in X is defined by K-n(W, V)(X) := inf(Ln) sup(f is an element of W) inf(g is an element of V boolean AND Ln) parallel to f - g parallel to(X), where the infimum is taken over all n-dimensional subspaces L-n of X. For alpha is an element of R+, define W-p(alpha) (1 <= p <= infinity) to be the collection of 2 pi-periodic and continuous functions f representable as a convolution where g is an element of Lp(T), T = [0, 2 pi], parallel to g parallel to(p)<= 1, integral(T) g(x)dx = 0, and B-alpha(t) is an element of L-1(T) with the Fourier expanded form B-alpha(t) = 1/2 pi Sigma(k is an element of Z\\[0]) (ik)(-alpha)e(ikt). In this article, we discuss the relative Kolmogorov n-width of W-p(alpha) relative to W-p(alpha) in the space L-q(T). For the case p=infinity, 1 <= q <= 2, alpha > 1-1/q and the case p=1, 2 < q <= infinity, alpha > 3-1/q, we obtain their weak asymptotic results. In addition, we also obtain the weak asymptotic result of W-p(alpha) relative to W-p(alpha) in the space L-p(T) for 0 < alpha <= 2. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
