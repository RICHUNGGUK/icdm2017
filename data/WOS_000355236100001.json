Tautomers are isomers that can be transformed to each other through chemical equilibrium reactions. In this paper the first exact Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm to calculate tautomer structures is proposed. The algorithm is complete in the sense of tautomerism and generates all possible tautomers of a structure according to the tautomer definition, it is initialized with. To be efficient, the algorithm takes advantage of symmetric and formation proper-ties. Some restrictions are used to enable an early pruning of some branches of the B&B tree. This is important, since a simple enumeration strategy would lead to number of candidate tautomers that is exponentially increasing with the number of hydrogen atoms and their attachment sites. The proposed implementation of the B&B algorithm covers the majority of the prototropic tautomer cases, but can be adapted to other kinds of tautomerism too. Furthermore, a computer processable definition of tautomerism is given in the form of the moving hydrogen atom problem.", "paper_title": "A Branch-and-Bound Approach for Tautomer Enumeration", "paper_id": "WOS:000355236100001"}
