This paper presents a distributed, scalable and robust layered overlay (L-overlay) to index and manage multidimensional data in a dynamic P2P network. The proposed method distinguishes between the data and peer layers, with efficient mapping between the two. The data is organized such that semantically similar data objects are accessed hastily. Grid and tree structures are proposed for the peer layer. As application examples of L-overlay in query processing and data mining, k-nearest neighbors query processing and distributed Na < ve Bayes classification algorithms, are proposed. We show the effectiveness of our scheme in static and dynamic environments using simulation. L-overlay is shown to be more efficient than SSW, an available semantic overly, in terms of maintenance and query processing costs.", "paper_title": "L-overlay: A layered data management scheme for peer-to-peer computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331659400008"}
