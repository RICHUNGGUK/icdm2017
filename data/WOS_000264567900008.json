The techniques in proving the convergence for time steps are also be used in devicing the posteriori error estimator of the equations of the fractional scheme. The estimator yields upper bounds on the error which are global in space and time and lower bounds that are global in space and local in time. These functions satisfy two fundamental properties: (i) they are explicitly computable and thus their difference to the numerical solution is controlled a postefiori, and (ii) they lead to optimal order residuals as well as to appropriate pointwise representations of the error equation of the same form as the underlying evolution equation. The resulting estimators are shown to be of optimal order by deriving upper and lower bounds for them depending only on the discretization parameters and the data of our problem. We present an adaptive algorithm which can terminate in finite steps for a given tolerance. Numerical experiments validate the theory and yield refined meshes.", "paper_title": "Error Analysis of the Semi-Implicit Four-Step Fractional Scheme and Adaptive Finite Element Method for the Unsteady Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264567900008"}
