However, construction of such models by means of machine learning requires the availability of costly health-care data, often resulting in small samples. We analysed data from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with the goal of constructing a model to predict the occurrence of exacerbation events, i.e., episodes of decreased pulmonary health status. Methods: Data from 10 COPD patients, gathered with our home monitoring system, were used for temporal Bayesian network learning, combined with bootstrapping methods for data analysis of small data samples. For comparison a temporal variant of augmented naive Bayes models and a temporal nodes Bayesian network (TNBN) were constructed. The performances of the methods were first tested with synthetic data. Subsequently, different COPD models were compared to each other using an external validation data set. Results: The model learning methods are capable of finding good predictive models for our COPD data. Model averaging over models based on bootstrap replications is able to find a good balance between true and false positive rates on predicting COPD exacerbation events. Temporal naive Bayes offers an alternative that trades some performance for a reduction in computation time and easier interpretation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
