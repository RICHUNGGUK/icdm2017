Ultimately, our objective is to verify the precision of the analytical models with simulation results. First, we outline a number of issues and criticalities in underlying assumptions of existing approaches to backoff process modeling for unsaturated and saturated scenarios. Then, by revisiting the assumptions in existing backoff process models, we reassess them for the more complicated unsaturated case under more realistic assumptions. We argue that under unsaturated load conditions the backoff process exhibits a rho-persistent behavior. Our claims are supported by observing the simulated behavior of a wireless local area network (WLAN) under varying load conditions. Also, the principle of 'measures of uncertainty' provides theoretical basis for our arguments. Comparison with known models in different simulation environments confirms the increased accuracy of the proposed model over a wide range of settings.", "paper_title": "Revisiting Assumptions in Backoff Process Modeling and Queueing Analysis ofWireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)", "paper_id": "WOS:000337049600009"}
