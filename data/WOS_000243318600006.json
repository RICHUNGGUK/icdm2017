In this paper, we present a novel load balancing model based on Lattice Boltzmann Cellular Automata. Using numerical simulations our model is compared to diffusion algorithms adopted on HPC load balancing and to agent-based balancing strategies on Grid systems. We show how the proposed model generally gives better performances for both the considered scenarios.", "paper_title": "Grid and HPC dynamic load balancing with lattice Boltzmann models", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600006"}
