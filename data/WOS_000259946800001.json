Along with the wellknown tests such as the Bartels test, runs test, tests of homogeneity of several sample proportions, the Brunner-Munzel tests, the Lorenz curve, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and others, the package contains new distribution-free robust tests for symmetry, robust tests for normality that are more sensitive to heavy-tailed departures, measures of relative variability, Levene-type tests against trends in variances etc. All implemented tests and methods are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal cases, economics and biostatistics. Although the packageis called lawstat, it presents implementation and discussion of statistical procedures and tests that are also employed in a variety of other applications, e.g., biostatistics, environmental studies, social sciences and others, in other words, all applications utilizing statistical dataanalysis. Hence, name of the package should not be considered as a restriction to legal statistics. The package will be useful to applied statisticians and \"quantitatively alert practitioners \" of other subjects as well as an asset in teaching statistical courses.", "paper_title": "lawstat: An R Package for Law, Public Policy and Biostatistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000259946800001"}
