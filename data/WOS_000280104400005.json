It addresses the problem of detecting mobile targets that have continuous movement. We categorise these targets into two classes. The first type is rational targets, which have the knowledge of existing sensors. The other type is on the contrary. These targets neither know anything about the sensors, nor plan their path for specific purposes; therefore, their traces are straight lines. Our objective is to find a few critical positions to deploy additional sensors, so that the freedom of mobile targets can be limited. Simulation and case studies show that a few additional sensors can greatly increase the detection probability on mobile targets.", "paper_title": "Improving mobile target detection on randomly deployed sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104400005"}
