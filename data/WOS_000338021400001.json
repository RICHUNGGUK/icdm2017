This paper presents a model-driven approach to the development of Web applications by combining Conallen's web applications design concept and Kleppe's MDA process. We use the UML extension mechanism, i.e. stereotypes, to define the various web elements, and use the Robustness diagram to represent MVC 2 structure for Web application. After required analysis, we start by using a use case diagram as CIM, and then transform CIM to PIM, and PIM to PSM. We propose mapping rules for model-to-model transformation. Finally, we develop a tool named WebPSM2Code, which can automatically transform PSM diagram to Web application code, such as Java, JSP, HTML, Servlet, Javascript, as well as deployment descriptor file. All the files can automatically address to the correct directory structure for JSP Web application, and the transformation rate is about 39% of the whole system. Using this methodology, systems can be analyzed, designed, and generated more easily and systematically. Thereby, the time that Web programmers spend on coding can be reduced.", "paper_title": "Developing Web Applications Based on Model Driven Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000338021400001"}
