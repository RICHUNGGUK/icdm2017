The construction of such a nonlinear system is firstly shown in this paper, by dissipative characteristic analysis, equilibrium point and stability analysis, the strange attractor is possibly existing at each equilibrium point is confirmed. Also the dynamic characters are discussed, which indicates the nonlinear circuit we built based on LDR MR is a chaotic system.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC CHARACTER ANALYSIS OF A LDR, MEMRISTOR-BASED CHAOTIC SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000336384400009"}
