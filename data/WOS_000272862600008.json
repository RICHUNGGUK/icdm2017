Position estimation most often includes errors due to the measurements of distance and incoming angles between neighbors. Erroneous positions are propagated from a node to other nodes exacerbating the degree of errors in the estimation of the positions of these nodes. In this paper, we propose a new localization method, called HA-A2L (High Accuracy localization based on Angle to Landmark); it consists of (a) a new protocol that allows nodes to exchange information pertinent to the localization process: and (b) a localization algorithm that uses estimation of distances and incoming angles to locate nodes in sensors networks. Compared, via simulations, to previous methods, such as APS and A2L, HA-A2L considerably increases the number of located nodes with far better accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
