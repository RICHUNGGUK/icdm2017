Colors used are formed by actual palette colors from artists. To create the palette, we have referred mostly to colors used in Van Gogh's works and determined the color of brush strokes by transferring it to the most similar one, through comparing colors used in source images and the palette colors. Also, by referring to the edge orientation of source images, we have applied a brush stroke direction that surrounds the edges. The sizes were determined depending on the different sizes of the objects from wide to narrow brushes. Finally, we applied spline curve and line shapes. The brush strokes created in such method, were applied separately according to its segmented images, and composed after rendering.", "paper_title": "Dynamic brush stroke generation for an impressionist effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900043"}
