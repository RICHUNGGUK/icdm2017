We have written a computer program that plays Siguo game. This paper reveals and discusses the method that is based on optimistic and cautious attitudes to construct evaluation function of our system. We also present the worth and rank of material and analyze several features of evaluation function, which are piece capture, position domain of piece and oriflamme guard. Each feature of evaluation function is evaluated by general and optimistic algorithm, respectively.", "paper_title": "Evaluation function for Siguo game based on two attitudes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000165"}
