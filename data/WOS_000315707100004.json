It provides not only the basic GIS functions, but also visually realistic landscape and architectural detail. It also gives the user an immersive 3-D virtual reality environment through the Internet that is rather different from that obtained merely through text, pictures, or videos. However, in terms of high accuracy and level-of-detail (LOD), the generation of a fully photo-realistic city model is labor intensive and time consuming. At the same time, from the aspect of computer graphics, the result is simply a geometric model without thematic information. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose a cost-effective multi-scale building modeling strategy based on the 2-D GIS building footprint that has rich attributes and to realize its application in the real estate market through a web-based 3-D GIS platform. Generally, the data volume needed for a photo-realistic city model is huge, thus for the purpose of increasing Internet data streaming efficiency and reducing the building modeling cost, a multiple-scale building modeling strategy, including block modeling, generic texture modeling, photo-realistic economic modeling, and photo-realistic detailed modeling is proposed. Since 2-D building boundary polygons are popularly used and well attributed, e.g., as to number of stories, address, type, material, etc., we are able to construct the photo-realistic city model based on this. Meanwhile, the conventional 2-D spatial analysis can be maintained and extended to 3-D GIS in the proposed scheme. For real estate applications, a location query system for selecting the optimum living environment is established. Some geospatial query and analysis functionalities are realized, such as address and road-junction positioning and terrain profile analysis. An experimental study area of 11 km(2) in size is used to demonstrate that the proposed multi-scale building modeling strategy and its integration into a web-based 3-D GIS platform is both efficient and cost-effective.
