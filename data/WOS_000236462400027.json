Our study is based on our previous model that simulates the Cancer - Immune System competition activated by a tumor vaccine. The model reproduces pre-clinical results obtained for an immunoprevention cancer vaccine (Triplex) for mammary carcinoma on HER-2/neu mice. A complete prevention of mammary carcinoma was obtained in vivo using a Chronic vaccination schedule. Our genetic algorithm found complete immunoprevention with a much lighter vaccination schedule. The number of injections required is roughly one third of those used in Chronic schedule.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm against cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400027"}
