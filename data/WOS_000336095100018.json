The explosive growth of bacterial genome sequence also brought an extremely big challenge to pan-genome profile analysis. We developed a tool, named PanGP, to complete pan-genome profile analysis for large-scale strains efficiently. PanGP has integrated two sampling algorithms, totally random (TR) and distance guide (DG). The DG algorithm drew sample strain combinations on the basis of genome diversity of bacterial population. The performance of these two algorithms have been evaluated on four bacteria populations with strain numbers varying from 30 to 200, and the DG algorithm exhibited overwhelming advantage on accuracy and stability than the TR algorithm.", "paper_title": "PanGP: A tool for quickly analyzing bacterial pan-genome profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100018"}
