The rationale of our proposed methods is based on integrating temporal information from the reference image and its previous and next several images. The difference between the two methods lies mainly on the modeling in utilizing multiple images. The proposed methods can be applied to each point independently, and hence is suitable for many image-based applications. Experiments were conducted on various image sequences and the results show that using multiple frames can indeed reduce the estimation error significantly, especially at those points that possess good features.", "paper_title": "Estimating Optical Flow by Integrating Multi-Frame Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000261206300007"}
