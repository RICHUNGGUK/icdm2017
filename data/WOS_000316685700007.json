The algorithm exposits an innovative solution via the unrestricted least squares and is based on the regression tree and branch-and-bound techniques for computing the best subset regression. The aim is to filling a gap in computationally tractable solutions to the non-negative least squares problem and model selection. The proposed method is illustrated with a real dataset. Experimental results on real and artificial random datasets confirm the computational efficacy of the new strategy and demonstrates its ability to solve large model selection problems that are subject to non-negativity constrains.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for non-negativity model selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000316685700007"}
