One possible reason is a lack of a formal model and associated process to more precisely and accurately design and develop ontologies. The authors' prior work explored UML, entity-relationship diagrams, and XML as compared to RDF and OWL, identifying modeling capabilities lacking in ontologies. In all three approaches, design precedes instantiation which contrasts with ontology developers who build ontologies at the application level targeted to a specific domain. The paper proposes design-level modeling enhancements to ontologies by extending the OMG Ontology Definition Model (ODM) and OWL grammar with capabilities from the three aforementioned approaches, promoting a software engineering-based process. As a result, this work provides a more software engineering-oriented process to ontology design and development.", "paper_title": "A Software Modeling Approach to Ontology Design via Extensions to ODM and OWL", "paper_id": "WOS:000330483900003"}
