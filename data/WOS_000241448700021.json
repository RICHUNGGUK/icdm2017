The main goal is to allow AN management aligned to the network requirements, incorporating functionalities such as self-configuration, self-management, self-healing and self-protection. In the proposed architecture, all these functionalities are controlled by a distributed policy-based system, allowing network configuration based on business policies.", "paper_title": "An architecture for autonomic management of ambient networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241448700021"}
