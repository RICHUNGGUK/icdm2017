Design/methodology/approach - The paper will outline the theoretical basis for the use of videos for library instruction, especially with reference to the habits and preferences of so-called Generation Y students and to the potential value of video for facilitating memory and learning. Findings - The use of humorous and interesting content, in a dramatised style, were found to improve Generation Y students' learning and enjoyment of instructional videos. Practical implications - The development of the project demonstrates the practical and marketing benefits of collaboration by academic librarians with students and faculty. However, it proved more difficult to evaluate the efficiency of the final product in terms of influencing the attitude of students toward the library and library resources and thereby changing their behaviour when studying. Originality/value - The authors recommend that such library videos should definitely form part of an academic library's information literacy programme, but should not constitute the sole element.", "paper_title": "All the world wide web's a stage Improving students' information skills with dramatic video tutorials", "paper_id": "WOS:000315014400005"}
