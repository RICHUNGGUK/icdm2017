In that paper, knowledge of graph theory was used to transform the MTSP to be a TSP, then such TSP route was analyzed and proved to be the optimal Hamilton route theoretically. Besides, a new hybrid genetic algorithm was designed for solving the problem. However, only length of the route was considered, as the objective function, while time windows, another much more important factor was neglected. In this paper, the MTSP with tine windows is studied, and the best equilibrium solution of emergency materials distribution is obtained via numerical simulation. Moreover, combine with the SIR epidemic model, relationship between the parameters and the results are discussed. The research results show that the best emergency materials distribution scheme can be found by the method proposed in this paper effectively, which have a certain guiding significance for the actual emergency rescue work.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY MATERIALS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WITH TIME WINDOWS IN ANTI-BIOTERRORISM SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900001"}
