Our method firstly constructs a new energy function by including both spatial and temporal constrains. Then the retargeting processing can be performed effectively by minimizing our proposed energy function for each frame. We also propose a new objective measurement to assess temporal coherence after video retargeting, the accuracy of which is verified by psycho-visual tests. Experimental results show that our video retargeting method is able to provide comfortable resized videos in terms of subjective and objective measurements.", "paper_title": "Effective Video Retargeting With Jittery Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100023"}
