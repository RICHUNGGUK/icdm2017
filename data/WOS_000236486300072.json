The advantage of using BSS is that the MIMO channel can be continuously tracked without the need of pilot symbols. CSI is only sent through the feedback channel when the BSS algorithm indicates the presence of a strong channel variation.", "paper_title": "Utilization of blind source separation algorithms for MIMO linear precoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300072"}
