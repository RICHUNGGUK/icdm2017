It highlights the reasons why existing approaches fail and proposes a procedure which can be applied to any high order fluctuation splitting scheme to impose positivity on it. Its success is demonstrated through application to a series of linear and nonlinear scalar problems, using a pseudo-time-stepping technique to reach steady state solutions on two-dimensional unstructured meshes.
