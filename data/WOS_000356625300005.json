Methods of global statistical network analysis can explain the observed correlations between columns in the MSA by a small set of directly coupled pairs of columns. Strong couplings are indicative of residue-residue contacts, and from the predicted contacts a structure can be computed. Here, we exploit the structural regularity of paired beta-strands that leads to characteristic patterns in the noisy matrices of couplings. The beta-beta contacts should be detected more reliably than single contacts, reducing the required number of sequences in the MSAs. Results: bbcontacts predicts beta-beta contacts by detecting these characteristic patterns in the 2D map of coupling scores using two hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for parallel and one for antiparallel contacts. beta-bulges are modelled as indel states. In contrast to existing methods, bbcontacts uses predicted instead of true secondary structure. On a standard set of 916 test proteins, 34% of which have MSAs with < 1000 sequences, bbcontacts achieves 50% precision for contacting beta-beta residue pairs at 50% recall using predicted secondary structure and 64% precision at 64% recall using true secondary structure, while existing tools achieve around 45% precision at 45% recall using true secondary structure.", "paper_title": "bbcontacts: prediction of beta-strand pairing from direct coupling patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625300005"}
