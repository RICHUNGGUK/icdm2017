By using a sophisticated nonlinear finite element analysis program, the accuracy and objectivity of the assessment process can be enhanced. A computer program, the RCAHEST (Reinforced Concrete Analysis in Higher Evaluation System Technology), was used for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures. Tensile, compressive and shear models of cracked concrete and models of reinforcing and prestressing steel were used to account for the material nonlinearity of prestressed concrete. The smeared crack approach was incorporated. A bonded or unbonded prestressing bar element is used based on the finite element method, which can represent the interaction between the prestressing bars and concrete of a prestressed concrete member. The proposed numerical method for the evaluation of behavior and strength of prestressed concrete deep beams is verified by comparing its results with reliable experimental results.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of behavior and strength of prestressed concrete deep beams using nonlinear analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000298825600005"}
