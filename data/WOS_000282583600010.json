They are one-dimensional arrays of interacting identical deterministic finite automata. In this paper, realtime-IAs with sublinear space bounds are used to recognize formal languages. The existence of an infinite proper hierarchy of space complexity classes between logarithmic and linear space bounds is proved. Some decidability questions on logarithmically space bounded realtime-IAs are investigated, and an optimal logarithmic space lower bound for non-regular language recognition on realtime-IAs is shown. Finally, some non-recursive trade-offs between space bounded realtime-IAs are emphasized.", "paper_title": "SUBLINEARLY SPACE BOUNDED ITERATIVE ARRAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282583600010"}
