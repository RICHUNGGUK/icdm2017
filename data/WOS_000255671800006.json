In particular, the market conditions are represented as a set of probabilities over the success rate of product prices, and those prices are learned online as the market develops. The dynamic pricing model is integrated into a real-time supply chain management agent using the Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management game as a test framework. We evaluate the agent experimentally in competition with other supply chain agents, and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating more market data into the dynamic pricing mechanism.
