The corner outlier artifacts are detected based on the directions of edges going through a block corner and the characteristics of blocks around the edges. According to the detection results, we compensate the stair-shaped discontinuities, the so-called corner outlier artifacts, using the neighboring pixels of the artifacts in spatial domain. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves, when combined with a deblocking filter in particular, both objective and subjective visual quality.", "paper_title": "Simple detection method and compensation filter to remove corner outlier artifacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700048"}
