For image segmentation, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied directly to the spectrum of each pixel, and using sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for feature selection to reduce the time of training SVM classifier. Mass of experiments showed that the method is robust, effective and insensitive to smear staining and illumination condition. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
