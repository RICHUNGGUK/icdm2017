Unlike traditional QSAR techniques, mt-QSAR permits to calculate the probability of activity of a given compound against different biological or pharmacological targets. In simple terms, a single equation for multiple outputs. To emphasize more the importance of the mt-QSAR in the field of drug discovery, we also present a novel mt-QSAR model, made on purpose by our research group, for the prediction of the susceptibility of Gram + and Gram - anaerobic bacteria.", "paper_title": "QSAR Multi-Target in Drug Discovery: A Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000340815300005"}
