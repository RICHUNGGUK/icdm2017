Researchers have proposed many mutual authentication schemes for the access control of the cloud server by using the smart card to protect the sensitive data. However, few of them can resist from the smart card lost problem and provide both of the forward security and the backward security. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme for cloud computing which can address these problems and also provide the anonymity for the user. The trick we use is using the password, the smart card and the public key technique to protect the processes of the user's authentication and key exchange. Under the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) assumption, it is provably secure in the random oracle model. Compared with the existing smart card based authentication schemes in the cloud computing, the proposed scheme can provide better security degree.", "paper_title": "Towards Smart Card Based Mutual Authentication Schemes in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358997000022"}
