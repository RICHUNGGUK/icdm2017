Compared with evolutionary algorithm, the artificial immune system used for solving MO problems (MOPs) has shown many good performances in improving the convergence speed and maintaining the diversity of the antibody population. However, the simple clonal selection computation has some difficulties in handling some more complex MOPs. In this paper, the simple clonal selection strategy is improved and a novel immune clonal algorithm (NICA) is proposed. The improvements in NICA are mainly focus on four aspects. 1) Antibodies in the antibody population are divided into dominated ones and nondominated ones, which is suitable for the characteristic of one multiobjective optimization problem has a series Pareto-optimal solutions. 2) The entire cloning is adopted instead of different antibodies having different clonal rate. 3) The clonal selection is based on the Pareto-dominance and one antibody is selected or not depending on whether it is a nondominated one, which is different from the traditional clonal selection manner. 4) The antibody population updating operation after the clonal selection is adopted, which makes antibody population under a certain size and guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. The influences of the main parameters are analyzed empirically. Compared with the existed algorithms, simulation results on MOPs and constrained MOPs show that NICA in most problems is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front.", "paper_title": "A Novel Immune Clonal Algorithm for MO Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299812000003"}
