Cheriyan and Maheshwari gave an O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2)) algorithm for finding three independent spanning trees in a 3-connected graph. In this paper we present an O(vertical bar V vertical bar(3)) algorithm for finding four independent spanning trees in a 4-connected graph. We make use of chain decompositions of 4-connected graphs.", "paper_title": "Finding four independent trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000236805200002"}
