Also, a methodology of analysis of local orbital stability of those periodic motions is proposed. The given analysis is based on the concept of the state locus of a relay feedback system. Techniques for computing the state locus are proposed. Also, a methodology of finding a periodic motion that involves the state locus is given. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by an example.", "paper_title": "Analysis of periodic motions in relay feedback systems with saturation in plant dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000267286800009"}
