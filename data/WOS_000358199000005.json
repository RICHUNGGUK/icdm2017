Tags are used to index, annotate and retrieve resource as an additional metadata of resource. Poor retrieval performance remains a major challenge of most social annotation systems resulting from several problems of ambiguity, redundancy and less semantic nature of tags. Clustering is a useful tool to handle these problems in social annotation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel tag clustering algorithm based on kernel information propagation. This approach makes use of the kernel density estimation of the kNN neighborhood directed graph as a start to reveal the prestige rank of tags in tagging data. The random walk with restart algorithm is then employed to determine the center points of tag clusters. The main strength of the proposed approach is the capability of partitioning tags from the perspective of tag prestige rank rather than the intuitive similarity calculation itself. Experimental studies on the six real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art clustering approaches in terms of various evaluation metrics.", "paper_title": "KIPTC: a kernel information propagation tag clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000358199000005"}
