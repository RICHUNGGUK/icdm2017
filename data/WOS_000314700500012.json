Let Y be a random d-dimensional subcomplex of Delta(n-1) obtained by starting with the full (d - 1)-dimensional skeleton of Delta(n-1) and then adding each d-simplex independently with probability p = c/n. We compute an explicit constant gamma(d), with gamma(2) similar or equal to 2.45, gamma(3) similar or equal to 3.5, and gamma(d) = Theta(log d) as d -> infinity, so that for c < gamma(d) such a random simplicial complex either collapses to a (d - 1)-dimensional subcomplex or it contains partial derivative Delta(d+1), the boundary of a (d + 1)-dimensional simplex. We conjecture this bound to be sharp. In addition, we show that there exists a constant gamma(d) < c(d) < d + 1 such that for any c > c(d) and a fixed field F, asymptotically almost surely H-d(Y; F) not equal 0.", "paper_title": "Collapsibility and Vanishing of Top Homology in Random Simplicial Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500012"}
