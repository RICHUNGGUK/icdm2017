At first, P1 chooses a set F-1 of m facilities following which P2 chooses another set F-2 of m facilities, disjoint from F-1, where m(=O(1)) is a positive constant. The payoff of P2 is defined as the cardinality of the set of points in U which are closer to a facility in F-2 than to every facility in F-1, and the payoff of P1 is the difference between the number of users in U and the payoff of P2. The objective of both the players in the game is to maximize their respective payoffs. In this paper, we address the case where the points in U are located along a line. We show that if the sorted order of the points in U along the line is known, then the optimal strategy of P2, given any placement of facilities by P1, can be computed in O(n) time. We then prove that for m >= 2 the optimal strategy of P1 in the one-round discrete Voronoi game, with the users on a line, can be computed in O(n(m-lambda m)) time, where 0 < lambda(m) < 1, is a constant depending only on m.", "paper_title": "Optimal strategies for the one-round discrete Voronoi game on a line", "paper_id": "WOS:000328146100003"}
