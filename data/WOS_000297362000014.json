As an application in protein simulations, the new integral equation is reduced to a second kind Fredholm boundary integral equation on the interface between the solute and solvent regions for a piecewise constant permittivity function, together with two new integral expressions for the electrostatics within the solute and solvent regions. The new integral equation and expressions work for any charge problem over the whole space (including the one with charges on the interface). This valuable feature is verified numerically for a dielectric sphere model with a point charge inside, outside, or on the sphere in this paper.", "paper_title": "A new boundary integral equation for molecular electrostatics with charges over whole space", "paper_id": "WOS:000297362000014"}
