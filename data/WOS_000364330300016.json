The accuracy of an iterate to the solution set is measured by the residual of a characterization of the original problem, which is different from conventional measures such as the distance to the solution set.", "paper_title": "On the convergence rate of Douglas-Rachford operator splitting method", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300016"}
