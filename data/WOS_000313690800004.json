In a progressive matrix problem, the task is to identify the missing element that completes the pattern of a pictorial matrix. We present a method for solving progressive matrix problems. The method is not limited to problems that are on the multiple choice format, which makes it potentially useful for solving real-world pattern discovery problems that do not come with predefined answer alternatives. The method is anthropomorphic in the sense that it uses certain problem solving strategies that were reported by high-achieving human solvers. We also describe a computer program implementing this method. The computer program was tested on the sets C, D, and E of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test and it produced correct solutions for 28 of the 36 problems considered. This score corresponds roughly to an IQ of 100. Finally, we conclude that it is possible to solve progressive matrix problems without analyzing potential answer alternatives and discuss some implications of this finding. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
