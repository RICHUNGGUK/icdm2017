This paper presents the benefits of using this file grouping for prestaging data and compares it with previously proposed file grouping techniques along a range of performance metrics. Our experiments with real workloads demonstrate that filecule grouping is a reliable and useful abstraction for data management in science Grids; that preserving time locality for data prestaging is highly recommended; that job reordering with respect to data availability has significant impact on throughput; and finally, that a relatively short history of traces is a good predictor for filecule grouping. Our experimental results provide lessons for workload modeling and suggest design guidelines for data management in data-intensive resource-sharing environments.", "paper_title": "Workload characterization in a high-energy data grid and impact on resource management", "paper_id": "WOS:000268208900004"}
