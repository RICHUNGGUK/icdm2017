This generates massive amounts of data on individual cell characteristics that need to be analyzed in an efficient manner from both physiological and chemical points of view. In this study, a methodology of analysis for FCM data was comprehensively studied to assess quality changes in semen extracted from boars. The proposed methodology combines new automated multi-dimensional data normalization, a density-based clustering method for identification of cell populations, and multivariate methods for post-analysis of the identified populations, enabling the exploratory evaluation and prediction/classification of subpopulations within the experimental data set. The performance of the suggested methodology was compared with the performance of an existing automated clustering method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
