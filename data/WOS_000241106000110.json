We present a novel approach that uses fuzzy integral to fuse the texture and color features for background subtraction. The method could handle various small motions of background objects such as swaying tree branches and bushes. Our method requires less computational cost. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene that enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. The results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient in real-time and accurate background maintenance in complex environment.", "paper_title": "Fusing color and texture features for background model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000110"}
