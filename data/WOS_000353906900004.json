On the basis of wavelet analysis, the seismic data in southwest from 1900 to 2013 was analyzed and the features on different time scales were studied. Moreover, an analysis of the future seismic trend was conducted by using wavelet coefficients on all scales and the main period of seismic activities.", "paper_title": "Predicting seismicity trend in southwest of China based on wavelet analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000353906900004"}
