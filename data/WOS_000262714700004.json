We investigate which cues are relevant for gaze prediction and find that shot changes, facial orientation of the signer and face locations are the most useful. We then design a face orientation tracker based upon grid-based likelihood ratio trackers, using profile and frontal face detections. These cues are combined using a grid-based Bayesian state estimation algorithm to form a probability surface for each frame. We find that this gaze predictor outperforms a static gaze prediction and one based on face locations within the frame.", "paper_title": "A Multicue Bayesian State Estimator for Gaze Prediction in Open Signed Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000262714700004"}
