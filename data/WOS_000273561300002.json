Here, Gabor wavelet transformation is used for extraction of features from face images as it deals with images in spatial as well as in frequency domain to capture different local orientations and scales efficiently. In face recognition problem multilayer perceptron (MLP) has already been adopted owing to its efficiency, but it does not capture overlapping and nonlinear manifolds of faces which exhibit different variations in illumination, expression, pose, etc. A fuzzy MLP on the other hand performs better than an MLP because fuzzy MLP can identify decision surfaces in case of nonlinear overlapping classes, whereas an MLP is restricted to crisp boundaries only. In the present work, a new approach for fuzzification of the feature sets obtained through Gabor wavelet transforms has been discussed. The feature vectors thus obtained are classified using a newly designed fuzzified MLP. The system has been tested on a composite database (DB-C) consisting of the ORL face database and another face database created for this purpose and a recognition rate of 97.875% with fuzzy MLP against a recognition rate of only 81.25% with MLP whose feature vectors were also obtained through same Gabor wavelet transforms has been obtained.", "paper_title": "Human face recognition using fuzzy multilayer perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000273561300002"}
