Our approach adapts Concurrent Versioning, a successful paradigm in software development, to allow several developers to make changes concurrently to an ontology. Conflict detection and resolution are based on novel techniques that take into account the structure and semantics of the ontology versions to be reconciled by using precisely-defined notions of structural and semantic differences between ontologies and by extending state-of-the-art ontology debugging and repair techniques. We also present ContentCVS, a system that implements our approach, and a preliminary empirical evaluation which suggests that our approach is both computationally feasible and useful in practice.
