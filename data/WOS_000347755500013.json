Three major challenges have been identified: programmability, manageable architecture design, and reliability. TERAFLUX is a Future and Emerging Technology (FET) large-scale project funded by the European Union, which addresses such challenges at once by leveraging the dataflow principles. This paper presents an overview of the research carried out by the TERAFLUX partners and some preliminary results. Our platform comprises 1000+ general purpose cores per chip in order to properly explore the above challenges. An architectural template has been proposed and applications have been ported to the platform. Programming models, compilation tools, and reliability techniques have been developed. The evaluation is carried out by leveraging on modifications of the HP-Labs COTSon simulator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
