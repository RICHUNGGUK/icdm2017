Moreover, we present a method for the construction of phylogenetic trees based on this bicriteria framework. Two exemplary cases are discussed. Results: Numerical results on a real dataset show that this approach is very fast in practice. The pruning technique saves up to 90% in memory usage and 80% in CPU time. Based on this method, phylogenetic trees are constructed from real-life data. In addition of providing complementary information, some of these trees match those obtained by the Maximum Likelihood method.", "paper_title": "Improvements on bicriteria pairwise sequence alignment: algorithms and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000318109300005"}
