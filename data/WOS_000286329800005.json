This paper proposes a novel architecture that meets these requirements. By the use of distributed optimization algorithms we propose a dynamically reconfigurable overlay architecture that organizes its peers according to network locality information and heterogeneous uploading capabilities of them. The benefits of our optimized overlay are fully exploited by our proposed scheduler, which guarantees the complete and fast distribution of the stream. The evaluation of our system under a series of scenarios that take into account the all requirements above reveals the advantages of our proposed system.", "paper_title": "LiquidStream-network dependent dynamic P2P live streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000286329800005"}
