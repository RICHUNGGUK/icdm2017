We describe an algorithm that improves the computation of these knock-out sets when the elementary modes (minimal functional subsystems) of the network are given. We also describe an algorithm that computes both the knock-out sets and the elementary modes containing the blocked reactions directly from the description of the network and whose worst-case computational complexity is better than the algorithms currently in use for these problems. Computational results are included.", "paper_title": "Computing knock-out strategies in metabolic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254997500003"}
