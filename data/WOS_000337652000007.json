This strategy pays particular attention to mitigating negative interstructure interactions. Moreover, it is based on recent advances in static output-feedback control, which make possible the efficient computation of decentralized velocity-feedback controllers by solving a single-step optimization problem with Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. To illustrate the main ideas, a local velocity-feedback energy-to-peak controller is designed for the seismic protection of a two-building system. This controller is remarkably effective and extremely simple. Moreover, it can also be implemented by a linear passive damper. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed controller, numerical simulations are conducted with positive results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
