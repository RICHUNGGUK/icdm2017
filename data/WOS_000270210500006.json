Design/methodology/approach - Normative knowledge concepts are used within the framework of PSO algorithms in order to influence the cognitive and social components of the particle behaviour. Findings - It is shown that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the performance of PSO on the selected benchmark problem, in terms of both best and average solutions. Research limitations/implications - Although the chosen benchmark is considered to be representative of typical electromagnetic problems, different test cases may give less satisfactory results. Practical implications - The proposed approach appears to be an efficient general purpose stochastic optimizer for electromagnetic design problems. Originality/value - This paper introduces the use of normative knowledge concepts to control the cognitive and social components of PSO algorithms.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization combined with normative knowledge applied to Loney's solenoid design", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500006"}
