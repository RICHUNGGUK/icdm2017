The discovery and dynamic update of the users' preferences are key issues in the development of these systems. In this work we propose to use the information provided by a user during his/her interaction with a recommender system to infer his/her preferences over the criteria used to define the decision alternatives. More specifically, this paper pays special attention on how to learn the user's preferred value in the case of numerical attributes. A methodology to adapt the user profile in a dynamic and automatic way is presented. The adaptations in the profile are performed after each interaction of the user with the system and/or after the system has gathered enough information from several user selections. We have developed a framework for the automatic evaluation of the performance of the adaptation algorithm that permits to analyze the influence of different parameters. The obtained results show that the adaptation algorithm is able to learn a very accurate model of the user preferences after a certain amount of interactions with him/her, even if the preferences change dynamically over time.", "paper_title": "Dynamic adaptation of numerical attributes in a user profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000323278500013"}
