Threshold implementations (TIs) provide provable security against first-order power analysis attacks for hardware and software implementations. Like masking, the approach relies on secret sharing but it differs in the implementation of logic functions. While masking can fail to provide protection due to glitches in the circuit, TIs rely on few assumptions about the hardware and are fully compatible with standard design flows. We investigate two important properties of TIs in detail and point out interesting trade-offs between circuit area and randomness requirements. We propose two new TIs of AES that, starting from a common previously published implementation, illustrate possible trade-offs. We provide concrete ASIC implementation results for all three designs using the same library, and we evaluate the practical security of all three designs on the same FPGA platform. Our analysis allow us to directly compare the security provided by the different trade-offs, and to quantify the associated hardware cost.", "paper_title": "Trade-Offs for Threshold Implementations Illustrated on AES", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100014"}
