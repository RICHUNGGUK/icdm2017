As a P2P application system based on JXTA, the implementation technologies of the P2P communication layer of SemreX are illustrated, including the software architecture and the classes in P2P communication layer. Some lessons about JXTA, from the system development practices and software testing, are also concluded, such as peer automatic discovery, program robustness and bug report.", "paper_title": "Building a semantic P2P scientific references sharing system with JXTA", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000098"}
