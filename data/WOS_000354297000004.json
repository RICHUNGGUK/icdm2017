Focusing on two-dimensional fan-beam tomography, we provide an error analysis and a common framework for the comparison of several schemes used to discretize this derivative. The leading error terms for each scheme are determined. The results demonstrate some advantages and drawbacks of the methods that are confirmed by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "On Numerical Analysis of View-Dependent Derivatives in Computed Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000354297000004"}
