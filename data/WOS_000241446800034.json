To build a knowledge-based system (KBS) for e-government has proved to be an effective way to enhance the efficiency of handling governmental services. However, few efforts are made to address automatic reasoning of knowledge-intensive tasks within e-government processes. For this purpose, we present an approach to building an e-government KBS by using the CommonKADS, a knowledge-engineering methodology, and semantic web technologies (OWL, SWRL, OWL-S), with the aiming of automatically solving knowledge-intensive tasks within e-govemmental services. Our experiences show that the CommonKADS is crucial to the analysis and identification of know] edge-intensive tasks within government processes, whereas the semantic web technologies enable the refinement of domain ontologies, domain rules and task methods.", "paper_title": "Applying CommonKADS and semantic web technologies to ontology-based e-government knowledge systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800034"}
