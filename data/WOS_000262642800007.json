It allows to reason on the existence of strategies for coalitions of agents in order to enforce a given property. In this paper, we first precisely characterize the complexity of ATL model-checking over Alternating Transition Systems and Concurrent Game Structures when the number of agents is not fixed. We prove that it is Delta(P)(2)- and Delta(P)(3)-complete, depending on the underlying multi-agent model (ATS and CGS resp.). We also consider the same problems for some extensions of ATL. We then consider expressiveness issues. We show how ATS and CGS are related and provide translations between these models w.r.t. alternating bisimulation. We also prove that the standard definition of ATL (built on modalities \"Next\", \"Always\" and \"Until\") cannot express the duals of its modalities: it is necessary to explicitely add the modality \"Release\".", "paper_title": "ON THE EXPRESSIVENESS AND COMPLEXITY OF ATL", "paper_id": "WOS:000262642800007"}
