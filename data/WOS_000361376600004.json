As cyber physical systems are used more and more extensively and thoroughly, security of cyber physical systems has become the utmost important concern in system design, implementation and research. Many kinds of attacks arise (e.g. the Stuxnet worm), causing heavy losses and serious potential security risks. For the past few years, researchers are focusing their researches on different aspects of security of cyber physical systems. In this paper, we propose a security framework assuring the security of cyber physical systems and analyze main universities and institutes studying CPS security and their relations in three levels: CPS security objectives, CPS security approaches and security in specific CPS applications. Finally, a conclusion of this article is given.", "paper_title": "Towards a Framework for Assuring Cyber Physical System Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000361376600004"}
