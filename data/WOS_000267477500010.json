Design/methodology/approach - A basic study of flow characteristics of ER fluid in a damper model is conducted experimentally and numerically. The electric field is appiied between inner wall of the cylinder and outer wall of the piston, and the pressure difference between upper and lower chamber of the cylinder is measured. A numerical prediction of ER fluid flow in the damper model system is performed in order to study the ER fluid flow characteristics. Visualization experiment is also made and used to qualitatively verify the numerical formulation. Findings - The agreement between the numerical, predictions and experimental results is encouraging, and the ER fluid flow patterns under different piston aspect ratios, movement speeds and applied electric field strengths are presented. The results show that the piston aspect ratio has much smaller influence on the ER flow pattern than other influencing factors. Increasing piston movement speed or reducing the electric field applied is helpful to reduce the pressure response time period, which is an important indicator showing sensitiveness of the damper. It is also seen that the pressure difference between the upper and lower chamber of the cylinder increases with the electric field strength and the piston movement speed. Originality/Value - First time the detailed investigation into the hydrodynamics behavior in such working models of engineering applications for ER fluid.", "paper_title": "A study on flow characteristics of electrorheological fluid in a damper model", "paper_id": "WOS:000267477500010"}
