We analysis the research trend of authors and conferences based on keywords extracted from paper titles. We can understand research fields and change of research trend to find appropriate co-authors and conferences to submit our work. We also find potential co-authors for an existing author in DBLP data by using a variety of similarity measures and a random walk model. It can be useful for building a recommendation system.", "paper_title": "Big Bibliographic Data Analytics by Random Walk Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000360003900014"}
