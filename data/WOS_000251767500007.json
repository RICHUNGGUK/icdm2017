A random graph process on n vertices, (G) over tilde (t), is a sequence of ((n)(2)) graphs, where (G) over tilde (0) is the edgeless graph on n vertices, and (G) over tilde (t) is the result of adding an edge to G(t - 1), uniformly distributed over all the missing edges. The authors show that in almost every graph process i (G) over tilde (t)) equals the minimal degree of (G) over tilde (t) as long as the minimal degree is o(logn). Furthermore, it is shown that this result is essentially best possible, by demonstrating that along the period in which the minimum degree is typically Theta(log n), the ratio between the isoperimetric constant and the minimum degree falls from 1 to 1/2, its final value.
