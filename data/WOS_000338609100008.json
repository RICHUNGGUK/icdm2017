First, initial estimates of the vocal tract and glottal flow are evaluated by an existing GIF method, iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF). Simultaneously, the initially estimated glottal flow is synthesized using the Rosenberg-Klatt (RK) model and filtered with the estimated vocal tract filter to create a synthetic speech frame. In the MCMC estimation process, the first few poles of the initial vocal tract model and the RK excitation parameter are refined in order to minimize the error between the synthetic and original speech signals in the time and frequency domain. MCMC approximates the posterior distribution of the parameters, and the final estimate of the vocal tract is found by averaging the parameter values of the Markov chain. Experiments with synthetic vowels produced by a physical modeling approach show that the MCMC-based GIF method gives more accurate results compared to two known reference methods.
