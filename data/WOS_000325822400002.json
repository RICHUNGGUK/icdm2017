In this study, we propose a new technique to visualize the instantaneous 3D structure of a pulsed gas micro-jet. Using phase-averaging of Schlieren visualizations obtained with a high-speed camera and 3D reconstruction through a filtered back projection algorithm, it is possible to follow the high-speed dynamics of the pulsed jet. The experimental technique is illustrated by a 3D reconstruction of a pulsed helium micro-jet. The technique is simple yet very useful. To our knowledge, it is the only experimental method to analyze the instantaneous 3D structure and high frequency dynamics of pulsed micro-jets.", "paper_title": "Single camera time-resolved 3D tomographic reconstruction of a pulsed gas jet", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822400002"}
