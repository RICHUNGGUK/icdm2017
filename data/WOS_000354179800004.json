To establish this summarisation model, the document summarisation problem is transformed into a mathematical problem by the analysis of the quality factors for summary and calculation of summary quality indices and constraints of quality factors. The genetic algorithm can be applied to solve the optimisation problem for text summarisation, and the text summary can be generated based on the optimal solution derived via the genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "A conceptual model for text summarisation based on reader requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000354179800004"}
