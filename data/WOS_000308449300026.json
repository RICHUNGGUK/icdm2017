For simulation performed for analysis purposes at the engineering level, which requires a considerable amount of computation power, a discrete-time system simulation that computes significant values at every single unit time using the established mathematical model or engineering model is mainly employed. To simulate a complex or complicated task such as a traffic analysis or tactical measure of effectiveness (MOE) analysis at the engagement level, it is appropriate to use a discrete-event system simulation that causes transition between model states through the triggering of events on the basis of the passing of messages between simplified mathematical models coupled in various ways. In this paper, we studied a maneuvering control of underwater vehicle from the perspective of a combined discrete-event and discrete-time system simulation; the simulation model is established on the basis of discrete-event system specification (DEVS) formalism, which is a representative modeling formalism of a discrete-event system simulation. In detail, the simulation includes DEVS modeling implementations of simulation execution time control and discrete-time step size control in real time at the time of performing a discrete-time system simulation for the purpose of three-dimensional visualization or carrying out a performance analysis using the DEVS model. This hybrid approach makes possible to build a simulation-based expert system which supports the decision making for the acquisition of an underwater vehicle. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
