The overhead of naive DPA evaluation software increases excessively as the number of points in a trace or the number of traces is enlarged due to the rapid increase of file I/O overhead. This paper presents some techniques, with respect to DPA-arithmetic and file handling, which can make the overhead of DPA software become not extreme but gradual as the increase of the amount of trace data to be processed. Through generic experiments, we show that the software, equipped with the proposed methods, using both CPU and GPU can shorten the time for evaluating the DPA resistance of devices by almost half.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of Differential Power Analysis through the Parallel Use of GPU and CPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245600013"}
