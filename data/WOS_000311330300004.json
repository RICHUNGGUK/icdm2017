The reasons and motivations behind this interest are clear, since finite mixture models offer a formal approach to the important problems of clustering and data modeling. In this paper, we address the problem of modeling non-Gaussian data which are largely present, and occur naturally, in several computer vision and image processing applications via the learning of a generative infinite generalized Gaussian mixture model. The proposed model, which can be viewed as a Dirichlet process mixture of generalized Gaussian distributions, takes into account the feature selection problem, also, by determining a set of relevant features for each data cluster which provides better interpretability and generalization capabilities. We propose then an efficient algorithm to learn this infinite model parameters by estimating its posterior distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We show how the model can be used, while comparing it with other models popular in the literature, in several challenging applications involving photographic and painting images categorization, image and video segmentation, and infrared facial expression recognition.
