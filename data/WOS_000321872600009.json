The convective Mach number Mc is prescribed to be 0.4 and 0.8. Direct numerical simulations were performed using a Discontinuous Galerkin method. Special attention is paid on the panorama of spatial evolution of large-scale structures, as well as on the compressibility effect on these structures. Fine structures such as the sonic waves at the inlet, and shocklet structures for the Mc = 0.8 case are also visualized. For the three-dimensional cases, in order to show the spatial evolution of the large-scale structures more clearly, both the and Q (2) structure extraction methods colored with stream-wise velocity magnitude are utilized. The \"H-type\" secondary instability structure and the \"forest\" structures are evident. It is found that the method gives better results in the case of high compressibility effect shear flows.", "paper_title": "Visualization of large-scale structures in spatially developing compressible mixing layers", "paper_id": "WOS:000321872600009"}
