However, his treatment of morphogenesis, and in particular a difficulty he identified relating to the uneven distribution of certain forms as a result of symmetry breaking, are key to connecting his theory of universal computation with his theory of biological pattern formation. Making such a connection would not overcome the particular difficulty that Turing was concerned about, which has in any case been resolved in biology. But instead the approach developed here captures Turing's initial concern and provides a low-level solution to a more general question by way of the concept of algorithmic probability, thus bridging two of his most important contributions to science: Turing pattern formation and universal computation. I will provide experimental results of one-dimensional patterns using this approach, with no loss of generality to a n-dimensional pattern generalisation.", "paper_title": "Turing patterns with Turing machines: emergence and low-level structure formation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319433600014"}
