We analyze the relationship between the complexity of such a problem and the corresponding maximality (minimality) problem asking for a solution of size k maximal (minimal) with respect to set inclusion. As our results show maximality problems may increase the parameterized complexity, while \"in terms of the W-hierarchy\" minimality problems do not increase the complexity.", "paper_title": "The parameterized complexity of maximality and minimality problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800003"}
