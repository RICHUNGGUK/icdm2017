A well-known precoding scheme is based upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix, which transforms the MIMO channel into parallel subchannels. Despite having low maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) complexity, this SVD precoding scheme provides a diversity gain which is limited by the diversity gain of the weakest subchannel. We therefore propose X- and Y-Codes, which improve the diversity gain of the SVD precoding scheme but maintain the low MLD complexity, by jointly coding information across a pair of subchannels. In particular, subchannels with high diversity gain are paired with those having low diversity gain. A pair of subchannels is jointly encoded using a 2 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. For X-Codes, these rotation matrices are parameterized by a single angle, while for Y-Codes, these matrices are left triangular matrices. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same structure as X-, Y-Codes, but with encoding matrices adapted to each channel realization. We observed that X-Codes/Precoders are good for well-conditioned channels, while Y-Codes/Precoders are good for ill-conditioned channels.", "paper_title": "MIMO Precoding With X- and Y- Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900028"}
