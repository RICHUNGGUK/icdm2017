In the 1970s, their covering radius was determined in a series of papers to be rho = 5. However, one problem for these codes that has been open up to now is to find their coset distribution. In this paper this problem is solved and the number of cosets of each weight in any binary primitive triple-error-correcting BCH code is determined. As a consequence this also gives the coset distribution of the extended codes of length N = 2(m) with minimum distance 8.", "paper_title": "The coset distribution of triple-error-correcting binary primitive BCH codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000034"}
