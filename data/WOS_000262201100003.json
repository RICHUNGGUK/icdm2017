Based on an intensive study of three software-producing organizations, we identify multiple metaphors ('Blueprint,' 'Literature,' 'Language' and 'Decision') that stakeholders use to understand the term software architecture, which in turn, allows them to effectively participate in its creation and use. Our results point to new research directions that may better encompass a broader view of software architecture.", "paper_title": "Software architectures: Blueprint, Literature, Language or Decision?", "paper_id": "WOS:000262201100003"}
