These imprecise or vague data can be suitably characterized by linguistic terms which are fuzzy in nature. LINMAP has been widely used to solve multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. This paper extends the conventional LINMAP model to a fuzzy group decision making framework using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The ranking approach is used to transform the fuzzy model into a crisp model. The fuzzy LINMAP method proposed in this paper is a simple and effective tool for tackling the uncertainty and imprecision associated with the group MADM problems. A case study in fast food industry is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy group linear programming technique for multidimentional analysis of preference", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100021"}
