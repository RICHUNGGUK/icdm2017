Despite some cases where a neat expression is available, the computation is generally rather complicated. In this note, we determine the weight distribution of a class of reducible cyclic codes whose dual codes may have arbitrarily many zeros. This goal is achieved by building an unexpected connection between the corresponding exponential sums and the spectra of Hermitian forms graphs.", "paper_title": "The Weight Distribution of a Class of Cyclic Codes Related to Hermitian Forms Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500031"}
