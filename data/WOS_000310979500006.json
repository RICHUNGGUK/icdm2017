Due to the different characteristics of the indoor and outdoor, it is difficult to management of moving object using existed methods in indoor setting. We propose a new index structure called ACII(adaptive Cell-based index for Indoor moving objects) for Indoor moving objects. ACII is Cell-based access structure adopting an overlapping technique. The ACII refines cells adaptively to handle indoor regional data, which may change its locations over time. The ACII consumed at most 30% of the space required by R-tree based methods, and achieved higher query performance compared with r-tree based methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Cell-Based Index For Moving Objects In Indoor", "paper_id": "WOS:000310979500006"}
