The nonlinear delay system is represented by the well-known T-S fuzzy model. The so-called parallel distributed compensation idea is employed to design the state feedback controller. Sufficient conditions for mean square exponential stability of the closed-loop system are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy control of nonlinear stochastic delay systems with impulsive effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000281652800004"}
