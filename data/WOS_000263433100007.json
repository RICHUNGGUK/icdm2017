The mathematical background of the analytical and numerical techniques is presented in a unified format. Frequency and time-domain analyses are conducted to validate the potential-based finite element formulation. A case study of a typical dam-reservoir system subjected to earthquake loading is presented. The dynamic response of the system is discussed to illustrate the effects of fluid-structure interaction and reservoir bottom absorption. The validated potential-based fluid elements and boundary conditions are shown to perform adequately for practical seismic analysis of dam-reservoir systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
