For Kleene algebras we show how models can be programmed, including sets of traces and paths, languages, binary relations, max-plus and min-plus algebras, matrices, formal power series. For relation algebras we discuss primarily proof automation in a comprehensive library and present an advanced formalisation example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
