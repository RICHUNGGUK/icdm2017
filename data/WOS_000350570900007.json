The possibility of driving to zero (in a finite number of \"steps\") either all or part of the system variables, by means of a partial interconnection controller, proves to be equivalent to the reconstructibility of the variables that are not accessible for control. On the other hand, if we search for \"admissible\" dead-beat controllers, the only ones providing meaningful results in practice, we have to introduce the zero-time-controllability assumption. These two properties are just the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an observer-based (admissible) dead-beat controller, which consists of a dead-beat observer, to estimate the relevant variables from the measured ones, and of a full interconnection dead-beat controller, acting on both the measured and the estimated variables.", "paper_title": "Partial interconnection and observer-based dead-beat control of two-dimensional behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000350570900007"}
