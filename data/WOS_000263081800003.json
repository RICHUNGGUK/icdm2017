In building a BPNN model, many training factors are typically involved and the most difficult factor is the initial weight distribution (IWD). In this study, a technique to optimize the IWD effect on BPNN prediction performance is presented. This was accomplished by using genetic algorithm (GA). The experimental data were collected from the etching of silica thin films in a CHF3-CF4 inductively coupled plasma. The etch process was statistically characterized and the etch responses to model include silica etch rate, Al etch rate, Al selectivity, and silica profile angle denoted as anisotropy. The effect of GA parameters (mutation and crossover probabilities) was also evaluated by conducting a 42 full factorial experiment. The performances of GA-BPNN models were compared to those for conventional models. The comparison revealed an improved prediction of GA-BPNN models for all etch responses. The improvement was even more than 15% for all but the Al etch rate data. The proven improvements support the finding that the presented technique is effective in optimizing an IWD effect on BPNN modeling.", "paper_title": "MODELING OF THIN FILM PROCESS DATA USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM-OPTIMIZED INITIAL WEIGHT OF BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000263081800003"}
