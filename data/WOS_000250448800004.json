We upper-bound the capacity loss by a universal constant C* which is independent of the channel matrix and the noise distribution. For a single-user MIMO channel with n(t) inputs and n(r) outputs C*=min {1/2, n(r)/2n(t) log(2) (1+n(t)/n(r))} bit per input dimension (or 2C* bit per transmit antenna per second per hertz), under both total and per-input power constraints. If we restrict attention to (colored) Gaussian noise, then the capacity loss is upper-bounded by a smaller constant C(G=)n(r)/2n(t) log(2) (n(t)/n(r)) for n(r) >= n(t)/e, and C-G = 0.265 otherwise, and this bound is tight for certain cases of channel matrix and noise covariance. We also derive similar bounds for the sum-capacity loss in multiuser MIMO channels. This includes in particular uncorrelated Gaussian transmission in a MIMO multiple-access channel (MAC), and \"flat\" Gaussian dirty-paper coding (DPC) in a MIMO broadcast channel. In the context of wireless communication, our results imply that the benefit of beamforming and spatial water-filling over simple isotropic transmission is limited. Moreover, the excess capacity of a point-to-point MIMO channel over the same MIMO channel in a multiuser configuration is bounded by a universal constant.", "paper_title": "The cost of uncorrelation and noncooperation in MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800004"}
