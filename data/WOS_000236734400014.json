To achieve this goal, the optimal codeword separation is sacrificed in favor of a maximum class discrimination in the partitions. The creation of the hierarchical partition set is performed using a binary tree. As a result, a compact matrix with high discrimination power is obtained. Our method is validated using the UCI database and applied to a real problem, the classification of traffic sign images.", "paper_title": "Discriminant ECOC: A heuristic method for application dependent design of error correcting output codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236734400014"}
