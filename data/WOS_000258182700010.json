For each class, we select a desirable feature subset, which leads to the lowest classification error rate for this class using a classifier for a given feature subset search algorithm. To fairly compare all models, we propose a weight method for the class-dependent classifier, i.e., assigning a weight to each model's output before the comparison is carried out. The method's performance is evaluated on two artificial data sets and several real-world benchmark data sets, with the support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier, and with the RELIEF, class separability, and minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevancy (mRMR) as attribute importance measures. Our results indicate that the class-dependent feature subsets found by our approach can effectively remove irrelevant or redundant features, while maintaining or improving (sometimes substantially) the classification accuracy, in comparison with other feature selection methods.", "paper_title": "A general wrapper approach to selection of class-dependent features", "paper_id": "WOS:000258182700010"}
