A novel offline degraded numeral recognition method (DNRBM) based on the measure of medium truth degree (MMTD) is proposed in this paper to identify segmented degraded numeral characters in gray images. It consists of distinguishing foreground from background, rotating an image, wiping off mottles, cutting margins, calculating both statistic and structural features, and recognizing numerals by the fuzzy classifiers constructed based on MMTD using features selected by logistic regression. The experimental results show that in comparison with the template matching method and the k-NN method, the proposed method performs well on recognizing degraded numeral characters with better scalability and better recognition performance.", "paper_title": "Offline recognition of degraded numeral characters with MMTD-based fuzzy classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500011"}
