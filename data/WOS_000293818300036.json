The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor must be able to seamlessly process input/output data. This paper presents the design and implementation of a continuous data flow parallel memory-based FFT (CF-PMBFFT) processor without the use of input buffer for pre-loading the input data. The processor realizes a memory space of two N-words and multiple processing elements (PEs) to achieve the seamless data flow and meet the design requirement. The circuit has been fabricated in TSMC 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process with the supply voltage of 1.8 V. Measurement results of the test chip shows that the developed CF-PMBFFT processor takes a core area of 1.97 mm(2) with a power consumption of 62.12 mW for a throughput rate of 528 MS/s.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost Continuous-Flow Parallel Memory-Based FFT Processor for UWB Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300036"}
