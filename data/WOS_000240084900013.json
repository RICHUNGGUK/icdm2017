In this paper, we propose an efficient data-collection scheme that can be used for event monitoring or network-wide diagnosis. Our scheme relies on the well-known representation of data-contour maps, which trade off accuracy with the amount of samples. The scheme consists of three novel algorithms to build contour maps: distributed spatial and temporal data suppression, contour reconstruction at the sink via interpolation and smoothing, and an efficient mechanism to convey routing information over multiple hops. By reducing the number of transmissions required to convey relevant information to the sink, the proposed contour mapping scheme saves energy and improves network lifetime. In a sharp contrast to related work in this area, the scheme does not require all nodes to explicitly share information. The contour mapping scheme can be applied for tasks such as: (1) presenting a global picture of the network in both temporal and spatial domains, (2) being used as a diagnosis tool, e.g., to detect faulty sensors and to scan for residual energy, (3) working in concert with in-network aggregation schemes to further reduce the communication overhead of aggregation schemes. The proposed scheme imposes little processing and storage overhead, allowing for the sensor networking paradigm of 'dumb sensor, smart sink' which enables economical deployment of large-scale sensor networks. Simulation results show that our scheme is resilient to both high packet loss rate and measurement noise. The design is also energy efficient, resulting in up to an-order-of-magnitude power savings when compared with the base line scheme where every sensor sends its report to the sink.
