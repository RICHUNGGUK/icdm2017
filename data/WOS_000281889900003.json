This is done utilizing generalized concurrences as building blocks which are defined by ipping of M constituents and indicate states that are separable with regard to bipartitions when vanishing. Furthermore, we provide an analytically computable lower bound for {R(m) (rho)} via a simple ordering relation of the convex roof extension. Using the derived lower bound, we illustrate the effect of the isotropic noise on a family of four-qubit mixed states for each intermediate separability.", "paper_title": "MIXED STATE ENTANGLEMENT MEASURES FOR INTERMEDIATE SEPARABILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000281889900003"}
