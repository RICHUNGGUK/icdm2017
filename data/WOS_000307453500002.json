For the anti-jamming purpose, frequency hopping sequences are required to have a large linear span. In this paper, by using a permutation polynomial delta(x) over a finite field, we transform several optimal sets of frequency hopping sequences with small linear span into ones with large linear span. The exact values of the linear span are presented by using the methods of counting the terms of the sequences representations. The results show that the transformed frequency hopping sequences are optimal with respect to the Peng-Fan bound, and can resist the analysis of Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.", "paper_title": "LINEAR SPANS OF OPTIMAL SETS OF FREQUENCY HOPPING SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000307453500002"}
