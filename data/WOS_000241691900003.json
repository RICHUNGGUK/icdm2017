The IST-FET Integrated Project SENSORIA aims at developing a novel comprehensive approach to the engineering of service-oriented software systems where foundational theories, techniques and methods are fully integrated in a pragmatic software engineering approach. In this paper we present first ideas for the SENSORIA semantic-based development of service-oriented systems. This includes service-oriented extensions to the UML, a mathematical basis formed by a family of process calculi, a language for expressing context-dependent soft constraints and preferences, qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, and model transformations from UML to process calculi. The results are illustrated by a case study in the area of automotive systems.", "paper_title": "Semantic-based development of service-oriented systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241691900003"}
