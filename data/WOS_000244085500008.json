The most widespread development platform, the Java 2, Micro Edition, is available on nearly 80 percent of currently available smart phones. Experience gained during a commercial development project demonstrates how J2ME technologies, particularly security-related functionality, are implemented on real devices and provides insights into the problems researchers encounter during the development process.", "paper_title": "Challenges in securing networked J2ME applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000244085500008"}
