Based on engineering insights of the system to be monitored, certain algebraic and dynamic properties of the residual generators may be preferred, and therefore, a method for finding sequential residual generators is developed that accounts for these properties of the residual generator candidates. It is shown that only a small fraction of all residual generator candidates fulfill fundamental requirements, and thereby, proves the value of systematic methods. Furthermore, methods are devised for utilization of the residual generators, such as initialization of dynamic residual generators. A proposed method, considering the fault excitation in the residuals using the internal form of the residuals, significantly increases the diagnosis performance. A hybrid electric vehicle is used in a simulation study for demonstration, but the methods used are general in character and provides a basis when designing diagnosis systems for other complex systems.", "paper_title": "Selecting and Utilizing Sequential Residual Generators in FDI Applied to Hybrid Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000330131800004"}
