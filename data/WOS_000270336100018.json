For this purpose different machine learning methods have been proposed. These methods usually do not provide information about the reliability of the classification. This, however, is a common requirement in, e.g. medicine and biology. In this line the present contribution offers an approach to enhance classifiers with reliability estimates in the context of prototype vector quantization. This extension can also be used to optimize precision or recall of the classifier system and to determine items which are not classifiable. This can lead to significantly improved classification results. The method is exemplarily presented on satellite remote spectral data but is applicable to a wider range of data sets.
