These normative values will be more specific when normal physiological differences are taken into account. One common variation is a split bundle. This paper describes a method to automatically detect these split bundles. Methods. The thickness profile along the NFL bundle is described by a non-split and a split bundle model. Based on these two fits, statistics are derived and used as features for two non-parametric classifiers (Parzen density based and k nearest neighbor). Features were selected by forward feature selection. Three hundred and nine superior and 324 inferior bundles were used to train and test this method. Results: The prevalence of split superior bundles was 68% and the split inferior bundles' prevalence was 13%. The resulting estimated error of the Parzen density-based classifier was 12.5% for the superior bundle and 10.2% for the inferior bundle. The k nearest neighbor classifier errors were 11.7% and 9.2%. Conclusions. The classification error of automated detection of split inferior bundles is not much smaller than its prevalence, thereby limiting the usefulness of separate cut-off values for split and non-split inferior bundles. For superior bundles, however, the classification error was low compared to the prevalence. Application of specific cut-off values, selected by the proposed classification system, may therefore increase the specificity and sensitivity of pathological NFL detection.", "paper_title": "Spilt bundle detection in polarimetric images of the human retinal nerve fiber layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000249094000008"}
