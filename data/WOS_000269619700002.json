The base classifiers used are fuzzy clustering (FC) and the parametric Bayesian (BP) method. During the training phase, different partitions are established until a valid partition is found. Partitioning and validation are two automatic processes based on validation measurements. From a valid partition, the parameters of both classifiers are estimated. During the classification phase, FC provides for each pixel the supports (membership degrees) that determine which cluster the pixel belongs to. These supports are punished or rewarded based on the supports (probabilities) provided by BP. This is achieved through the FCM approach, which combines the different supports. The automatic strategy and the combined strategy under the FCM framework make up the main findings of this study. The analysis of the results shows that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other hybrid methods and more accurate than the single usage of existing base classifiers.", "paper_title": "Combining classifiers through fuzzy cognitive maps in natural images", "paper_id": "WOS:000269619700002"}
