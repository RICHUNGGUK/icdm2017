Hence, in this research we consider minimizing the length of time required for both emergency roadway repair and relief distribution, as well as the related operating constraints, to develop a model, for planning emergency repair and relief distribution routes and schedules within a limited time. We construct a time-space network for emergency repair and another for relief distribution. A number of operational constraints are set between these two networks according to real constraints. Our model is a multi-objective, mixed-integer, multiple-commodity network flow problem. We adopt the weighting method and develop a heuristic to efficiently solve this problem in practice. To evaluate our model and the solution algorithm, we perform a case study. The results show the model and the solution algorithm could be useful in practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
