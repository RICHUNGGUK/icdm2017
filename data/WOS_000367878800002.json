However, there are some issues which encompass current data center such as physical location, energy consumption, performance, flexibility. Big organizations like Google, IBM have migrated toward cloud computing, and using cloud data center as the most cost efficient alternative to the current data center. Cloud computing is a model that provides suitable and on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, but unfortunately, it has some attendant problems like security issue, lack of proper policy and standardization. Therefore, in spite of the provision of all the benefits of cloud computing, such as cost reduction, flexibility, easy implementation and accessibility, some organisations are suspected to move toward cloud computing data center. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to determine the critical success factors for the adoption of cloud computing data center. To achieve this, a structural literature review of existing work and semi structured interview with ten IT administration and IT staff were carried out. We also performed a content validity using a panel of experts including 12 experts with more than 5 years experience. Subsequently, a FAHP technique was used to evaluate experts' consensuses.", "paper_title": "Cloud Computing Data Center Adoption Factors Validity By Fuzzy AHP", "paper_id": "WOS:000367878800002"}
