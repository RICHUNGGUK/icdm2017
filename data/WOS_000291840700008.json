However, they are vulnerable to security attacks, especially the attacks to the storage nodes that buffer and process the data readings from sensors. In this paper, we propose a secure data collection protocol SDC to support time-based queries in tiered WSNs. With small overhead introduced to data communication, SDC protects both data confidentiality and data integrity. In particular it employs data co-commitment scheme such that it can detect the seriousness of data losing and estimate the value of lost data in the network. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
