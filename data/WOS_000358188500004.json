The power of such quantum attacks lies in quantum Fourier sampling, an algorithmic paradigm based on generating and measuring coset states. In this article we extend previous negative results of quantum Fourier sampling for Graph Isomorphism, which corresponds to hidden subgroups of order two (over S-n), to several cases corresponding to larger hidden subgroups. For one case, we strengthen some results of Kempe, Pyber, and Shalev on the Hidden Subgroup Problem over the symmetric group. In another case, we show the failure of quantum Fourier sampling on the Hidden Subgroup Problem over the general linear group GL(2)(F-q). The most important case corresponds to Code Equivalence, the problem of determining whether two given linear codes are equivalent to each other up to a permutation of the coordinates. Our results suggest that for many codes of interest including generalized Reed Solomon codes, alternant codes, and Reed-Muller codes- solving these instances of Code Equivalence via Fourier sampling appears to be out of reach of current families of quantum algorithms.", "paper_title": "LIMITATIONS OF SINGLE COSET STATES AND QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR CODE EQUIVALENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188500004"}
