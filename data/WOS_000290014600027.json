The vibrations caused by passing vehicles can be a source of vibration and may damage buildings close to the line. This article aims to develop an analytical mathematical model for predicting the ground vibrations caused by the passing of trams along a slab track. The model is based on the wave equation and is solved in the frequency domain through the Fourier Transform. The loads caused by the vehicle are calculated using a quarter car model. The model is calibrated and validated with real data collected along the tram network of Alicante (Spain), providing a useful tool for future research on the transmission of ground vibrations.
