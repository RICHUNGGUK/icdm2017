Motivated by this challenge, the study reported here compared the effect of an educational e-book on improvements in Phonological Awareness (PA) and Concept About Print (CAP) among 136 pre-school-aged children at risk for learning disabilities (ALD) and typically developing children (TD). The findings indicated improved performance by both experimental groups, but especially ALD children in the area of CAP. These results are explained by the effectiveness of the multimedia e-book especially for ALD. Implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
