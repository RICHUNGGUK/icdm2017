The representation gives a functional view on nodes named a transit line. Statistical measures are computed and introduced in complex network analysis. It shows that the urban transit system forms small-world networks and exhibits properties different from random networks and regular networks. Furthermore, the topological properties of the transit-line network are investigated to get some useful conclusions for public transportation engineering.", "paper_title": "The Topological Analysis of Urban Transit System as a Small-World Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000013"}
