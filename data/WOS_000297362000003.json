We prove various stability estimates along with convergence results toward properly defined (entropy) solutions of linear and nonlinear equations. Finally, the qualitative behavior of solutions of such equations are illustrated through numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "The discontinuous Galerkin method for fractional degenerate convection-diffusion equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000297362000003"}
