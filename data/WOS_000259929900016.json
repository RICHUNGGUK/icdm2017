Moreover, business processes often go beyond the sole recording the events and base decisions on the events observed in the past. To model such processes we extend the basic Petri net framework with the notion of history by associating tokens with histories. adding Guards evaluated on the history to the transitions and mapping arcs to expressions involving histories. Guards and arc expressions can involve data associated with the transitions.", "paper_title": "Token History Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000259929900016"}
