Rogozhin did this by finding the smallest known universal Turing machines at the time, both in terms of number of states and number of symbols. This brief note summarises this and a few of Yurii's other contributions to the field, including his work with Manfred Kudlek on small circular Post machines.", "paper_title": "Yurii Rogozhin's Contributions to the Field of Small Universal Turing Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000352646800018"}
