The purpose of the partition model is to represent mesh partitioning and support mesh-level parallel operations through inter-processor communication links. FMDB has been used to efficiently support parallel automated adaptive analysis processes in conjunction with existing analysis engines.", "paper_title": "Efficient distributed mesh data structure for parallel automated adaptive analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000243365500005"}
