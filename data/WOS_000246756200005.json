The proposed algorithm is developed in the state space and is given in analytical form, which is an advantage in comparison with optimisation based control schemes. Fuzzy model-based predictive control is potentially interesting in the case of batch reactors, heat-exchangers, furnaces and all the processes with strong nonlinear dynamics and high transport delays. In our case it is implemented to a continuous stirred-tank simulated reactor and compared to optimal PI control. Some stability and design issues of fuzzy model-based predictive control are also given.", "paper_title": "Design and stability analysis of fuzzy model-based predictive control - A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000246756200005"}
