To achieve group consensus, a novel group consensus protocol and a time-varying estimator of the uncertain parameters are proposed. By combining algebraic graph theory with the Barbalat lemma, several effective sufficient conditions are obtained. It is found that the time-delay group consensus can be achieved provided that the inner coupling matrices are equal in the different sub-networks. Besides, the switching topologies between homogeneous agents are also considered, with the help of the Barbalat-like lemma, and some relevant results are also obtained. Finally, these theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
