First, a new delay-distribution-dependent Lyapunov function is established. Then, sufficient conditions are proposed for guaranteeing that the uncertain discrete singular system with time-varying delay has the properties of regularity, causality and stability. Finally, a suitable robust state feedback controller is designed by linear matrix inequality. Numerical examples illustrate that the results derived from the proposed method are less conservative than the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Less conservative robust stability criteria for uncertain discrete stochastic singular systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479200003"}
