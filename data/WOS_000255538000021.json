We prove that if there is a judgmental inconsistency in the fuzzy pair-wise comparisons, it is impossible to ensure the preservation of the order regarding to preference intensities in the resultant priority vector. Further, it is shown with ail example from the published literature that the order of the preference intensities may not be preserved even there is no inconsistency in the judgment set, albeit it is possible to comply with this order via using fuzzy preference programming (FPP) methodology. Finally, it is proved that if the interval judgments regarding to the decompositions of original judgments to alpha-level sets are consistent, FPP guarantees the preservation of the order of the preference intensities at those levels.
