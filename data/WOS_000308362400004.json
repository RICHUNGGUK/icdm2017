Although these standards ensure the interoperability of TEL systems across different Learning Management Systems (LMS), they are generic and lack expressiveness. In addition, the use of LTS limits designers to using a compliant LMS. MDA addresses these limits by allowing pedagogic modeling based on specific modeling languages and by ensuring interoperability across Learning Management Systems based on model transformations. In the context of an MDA-based design process, we propose a novel approach, named ACoMoD, to help designers to bridge the gap between pedagogic modeling and LMS specifications, based on graphic and interactive model transformations. Our approach, implemented with a tool called Gen-COM, enables designers to choose more effective LMS tools, based on a contextual recommendation of best practice for LMS tool use. Gen-COM and its evaluation with designers are described in this paper. The main results show, first, the usefulness of tailoring pedagogy with LMS tools based on the proposed solution. Second, the results show different levels of usefulness of the proposed assistance according to different situations that will be detailed. Some improvements are suggested and are in progress concerning the extension of Gen-COM to offer assistance to designers based on their profiles.", "paper_title": "Contextualizing Learning Scenarios According to Different Learning Management Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308362400004"}
