We prove that the coefficients of the expansion of a function f(x) in Gegenbauer (also known as ultraspherical) polynomials coincide with the Fourier coefficients of a suitable integral transform of the function f d(x). This allows to compute N Gegenbauer coefficients in O(Nlog(2)N) operations by means of a single Fast Fourier Transform of the integral transform of f(x). We also show that the inverse Gegenbauer transform is expressible as the Abel-type transform of a suitable Fourier series. This fact produces a novel algorithm for the fast evaluation of Gegenbauer expansions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
