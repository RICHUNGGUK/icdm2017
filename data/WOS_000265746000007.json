Cell proliferation is positively regulated, while apoptosis is negatively regulated. The resulting age-structured model is reduced to a system of three differential equations, with three independent delays, and existence of steady states is investigated. The stability of the trivial steady state, describing cells dying out with a saturation of growth factor concentrations is proven to be asymptotically stable when it is the only equilibrium. The stability analysis of the unique positive steady state allows the determination of a stability area, and shows that instability may occur through a Hopf bifurcation, mainly as a destabilization of the proliferative capacity control, when cell cycle durations are very short. Numerical simulations are carried out and result in a stability diagram that stresses the lead role of the introduction rate compared to the apoptosis rate in the system stability.
