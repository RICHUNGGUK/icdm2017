By introducing novel strategies in the generalized differential evolution (GDE3), the proposed algorithm can generate a better converged and distributed Pareto front than the standard GDE3. Five typical benchmark functions are optimized by the proposed improved GDE3 (IGDE) to verify its effectiveness. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied in two-pattern synthesis problems, including an unequal spaced linear array and a conformal array. The superior performance of the proposed IGDE demonstrates that it is an efficient and competitive algorithm in the function optimization, pattern synthesis, and other electromagnetic problems.
