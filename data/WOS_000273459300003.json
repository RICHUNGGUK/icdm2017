The BRMSCS switch consists of shared memory banks, a crossbar fabric and the BRMSCS scheduler. Our goals are to relieve the blocking situation in the scheduler and to guarantee freedom from, a memory access conflict, that is, no more than two output ports should access different cells that come from the same input port. To meet the goals, the BRMSCS scheduler can quickly insert address cells into a scheduling table and fill the scheduling table as full as possible. The simulation results show that the BRMSCS scheduler can efficiently insert the address cells into the conflict free locations of the scheduling table and has the advantage of reducing blocking.", "paper_title": "A Multiple Slot Cell Scheduling Algorithm for Multicast Switching Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273459300003"}
