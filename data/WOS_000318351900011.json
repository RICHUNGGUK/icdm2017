Initially, at different selected time points, one can obtain a series of time-constant neutral system models with Markov jumping parameter. Subsequently, H controller is designed for each constant stochastic neutral system which guarantees exponential stochastic stabilisation of the system. Lastly, continuous gain-scheduled controller design method is employed, and an entire time-varying controller is designed for the whole working region. Simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of developed techniques.", "paper_title": "H-infinity scheduling control on stochastic neutral systems subject to actuator nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000318351900011"}
