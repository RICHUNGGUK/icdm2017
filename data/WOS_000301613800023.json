First the multi-particle information share strategy and mutation operation are introduced into Simple PSO algorithm in order to improve the modeling capability of WNN, and then according to modeling flow the aerodynamic model from flight data for flight vehicles is established by WNN based on IPSO algorithm. Simulation results show that the method proposed has a good capability with features of precision, convergence and surmounting prematurity or local optimum, and is also effective and feasible for aerodynamic modeling from flight data.
