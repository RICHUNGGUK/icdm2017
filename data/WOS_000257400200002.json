It is based on the application of data envelopment analysis to bibliometric data on the Italian university system. For that purpose, different input values (research personnel by level and extra funding) and output values (quantity, quality and level of contribution to actual scientific publications) are considered. Our study aims at overcoming some of the limitations connected to the methodologies that have so far been proposed in the literature, in particular by surveying the scientific production of universities by authors' name.", "paper_title": "The measurement of Italian universities' research productivity by a non parametric-bibliometric methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257400200002"}
