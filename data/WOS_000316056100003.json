A patient underwent augmentation of an atrophic maxillary arch using titanium mesh and particulate autogenous plus bovine demineralised bone. After computed tomography data elaboration, computer-aided design and computer-aided machining were used to plan the augmentation of bone volume to improve the implant position needed to support the final dental prosthesis. The augmented maxilla was rapidly prototyped in plastic, and the titanium mesh was tested on this model before the surgical intervention. Then, the preformed titanium mesh was implanted in the maxillary arch with bone grafting. The bone was augmented relative to the position of the implants for the definitive fixed implant-supported rehabilitation. The protocol presented here is a viable, reproducible way to determine the correct bone augmentation for the final implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation.", "paper_title": "CADCAM prosthetically guided bone regeneration using preformed titanium mesh for the reconstruction of atrophic maxillary arches", "paper_id": "WOS:000316056100003"}
