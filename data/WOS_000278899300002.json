The aim of this benchmark is to propose a challenging test for numerical methods used for reactive transport modeling in porous media. In order to focus on numerical methods, the problem presented here is of quite a small size, both from a hydrodynamical and from a geochemical point of view. Though the chemical coefficients used in this benchmark are not taken from a real chemical system, they are realistic, and the test case is quite challenging.", "paper_title": "Reactive transport benchmark of MoMaS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278899300002"}
