In this paper, an extended ontology model is constructed using Description Logics. Based on the extended model, the issue on ontology checking is studied with the conclusion that the four kinds of term checking, including term satisfiability checking, term subsumption checking, term equivalence checking and term disjointness checking, can be reduced to the satisfiability checking, and satisfiability checking can be transformed into instantiation consistence checking.", "paper_title": "Extended ontology model and ontology checking based on description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000072"}
