This approach is based on the decomposition of the computational domain into a number of non-overlapping subdomains wherein the CBFs are generated by employing a novel procedure, which differs from all those that have been used in the past. Clearly, the CBFs; are obtained by calculating the fields radiated by a finite number of dipole-type sources, which are placed hypothetically along the boundary of the conducting object. The major advantages of the proposed technique are twofold: (i) it provides a substantial reduction in the matrix size, and thus, makes use of direct solvers efficiently and (ii) it enables the utilization of parallel processing techniques that considerably decrease the overall computation time. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach via several 3D electromagnetic scattering problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
