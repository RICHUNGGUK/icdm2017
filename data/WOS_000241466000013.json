For the selection of the best descriptors, the elimination selection stepwise regression method is utilized. The accuracy of the proposed MLR model is illustrated using the following evaluation techniques: cross validation, validation through an external test set, and Y-randomization. Furthermore, the domain of applicability which indicates the area of reliable predictions is defined.", "paper_title": "A novel QSAR model for evaluating and predicting the inhibition activity of dipeptidyl aspartyl fluoromethylketones", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466000013"}
