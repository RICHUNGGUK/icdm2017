Due to its recent rapid advance, using SAT solving seems a promising approach for search-based testing and indeed has already been practiced in test generation for pairwise testing. The previous approaches use SAT solving either for finding a small test set in the absence of parameter constraints or handling constraints, but not for both. This letter proposes an approach that uses a SAT solver for constructing a test set for pairwise testing in the presence of parameter constraints. This allows us to make full use of SAT solving for pairwise testing in practice.", "paper_title": "Using Satisfiability Solving for Pairwise Testing in the Presence of Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100008"}
