This knowledge is usually available in a distributed environment, in structured or non-structured form, and often is not exactly known where it is located and how to retrieve it in flexible ways. This paper describes an architecture to manage typical activities for an organization such as our University. During system analysis and specification, we had to collect a lot of information about structure and content of our organization. information available in various formats and media and not always automatically collectable. Hence, we designed a Document-based Software Architecture to support systems where formalization of information repositories, standardization of information location and management of every aspect involved in distributed contexts are crucial needs. We discuss if the configuration of a central-knowledge centered organization is the right solution or if it is better the choice of a distributed one. Since, all the documents managed in any organization are usually available in a structured way, we foresee a strong usage of XML documents and metadata standard definitions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
