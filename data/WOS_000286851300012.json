This study goes beyond the boundaries of an individual organization to develop an integrated framework for successful implementation of ERP systems. We also discuss the internal/external facilitators which make this possible. Meanwhile, the authors utilize the SERVQUAL instrument, project management and information systems success theory in our empirically investigation of the roles and interdependent relationships of system vendors, consultants, project management and system performance, based on existing measures suitable for this study. The results reveal a significant causal relationship between system providers, implementation consultants and project management, and project to system performance, except directly from SERVQUAL to system performance. It is believed that an understanding of the relationships between the relevant factors for ERP success is necessary to satisfy the adopter's requirement, both practically and theoretically.
