The primary goals of our research were: to provide insights into competition between a new entrant with a significant presence in foreign countries and a home-grown incumbent, and to offer evidence in support to the theory of competition in the software market. Our analysis of word-processing software competition in South Korea between 1997 and 2003 suggested that there are several factors that caused the new entrant [Microsoft in this case], to overtake the native incumbent as the market leader. The findings are integrated into a discussion of the managerial implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
