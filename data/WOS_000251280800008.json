Such data have unique features that could be exploited for effective compression. For example, tables often represent database files with rows as records so certain columns or fields in a table may have few distinct values. This means that simply transposing the data can make it compress better. Further, a large source of information redundancy in a table is the correlation among columns representing related types of data. This paper formalizes the notion of column dependency as a way to capture this information redundancy across columns and discusses how to automatically compute and use it to substantially improve table compression.
