The objective is to determine the optimal frequency of a multimodal transit network, which minimizes total users' travel cost and operation cost of transit lines. The problem is formulated as a bilevel programming problem with equilibrium constraints describing non-cooperative Nash equilibrium in a dynamic simulation-based transit assignment context. A hybrid algorithm combing the cross entropy multiagent learning algorithm and Hooke-Jeeves algorithm is proposed. Computational results are provided on the Sioux Falls network to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Cross Entropy Algorithm for Solving Dynamic Transit Network Design Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000322284700004"}
