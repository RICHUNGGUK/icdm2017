We then present a new haptic sculpting system for B-spline surfaces with shaped tools of implicit surface. In the physical world, people touch or sculpt with their fingers or tools, instead of just manipulating points. Shaped virtual sculpting tools help users to relate the virtual modeling process to physical-world experience. Various novel haptic sculpting operations are developed to make the sculpting of B-spline surfaces more intuitive. Wavelet-based multi-resolution tools are provided to let modelers adjust the resolution of sculpture surfaces and thus the scale of deformation can be easily controlled. Moreover, sweep editing and 3D texture have been implemented by taking advantage of both the wavelet technique and haptic sculpting tools. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
