It can identify the elements corresponding to each other. At present, with the rapid development of ontology applications, domain ontologies became very large in scale. Solving large scale ontology matching problems is beyond the reach of the existing matching methods. To improve this situation a modularization-based approach (called MOM) was proposed in this paper. It tries to decompose a large matching problem into several smaller ones and use a method to reduce the complexity dramatically. Several large and complex ontologies have been chosen and tested to verify this approach. The results show that the MOM method can significantly reduce the time cost while keeping the high matching accuracy.", "paper_title": "Matching large scale ontology effectively", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800010"}
