After replacing the incompressibility constraint by the pressure Poisson equation, the key is how to give an appropriate boundary condition for the pressure Poisson equation. We propose a new boundary condition for the pressure on the open boundary. Some numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy and stability of scheme.
