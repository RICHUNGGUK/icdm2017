This method employs linear matrix inequality (LMI) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on cellular neural networks (CNN).We use two images that one is desired image and the other is corrupted to find the CNN template. The Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to derive the criterion for uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the CNN equilibrium point. The current study characterizes the template design problem as a standard LMI problem and the optimization parameters of the templates are carried out by PSO. Finally, the examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Cellular Neural Networks for Gray Image Noise Cancellation Based on a Hybrid Linear Matrix Inequality and Particle Swarm Optimization Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000283099900003"}
