In this paper, an efficient single-camera multidirectional wheelchair detector based on a cascaded decision tree (CDT) is proposed to detect a wheelchair and its moving direction simultaneously from video frames for a healthcare system. Our approach combines a decision tree structure and boosted-cascade classifiers to construct a new CDT that can perform early confidence decisions in a hierarchical manner to rapidly reject nonwheelchairs and decide the moving directions. We also impose the tracking history to guide detection routes in the CDT to further reduce detection time and increase detection accuracy. The experiments show over 92% detection rate under cluttered scenes.", "paper_title": "Wheelchair Detection Using Cascaded Decision Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100014"}
