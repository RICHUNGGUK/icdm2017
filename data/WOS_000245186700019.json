Multiple-ring search operates in distributed control, and gathers network information through neighboring nodes. Hence, the proposed methods can be adopted in the arbitrary networking topology to obtain flexible protection segments and are very practical to work in the real-world environment. The segment protection has benefit of fasting the recovery time. This study also considers shared protection technique with constraints of Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) and Shared Bandwidth Assignment (SBA); therefore, bandwidth utilization can be improved. Based on the dynamic traffic load, the performance of NOSP and OSP are investigated by the simulation. The results show that NOSP and OSP perform better outcome than other compared algorithms in the metrics of blocking probability and mean hop count.", "paper_title": "Pragmatic segment protection employing distributed multiple-ring search in WDM mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245186700019"}
