A defect embedded in a low-contrast surface image is extremely difficult to detect, because the intensity difference between the unevenly illuminated background and the defective region is hardly observable and no clear edges are present between the defect and its surroundings The proposed anisotropic diffusion model provides a generalized diffusion mechanism that can flexibly change the curve of the diffusion coefficient function It adaptively carries out a smoothing process for faultless areas and performs a sharpening process lot defect areas in an Image An entropy criterion is proposed as the performance measure of the diffused image and then a stochastic evolutionary computation algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to automatically determine the best parameter values of the generalized diffusion coefficient function Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively and efficiently detect small defects in various low-contrast surface images.
