Firstly, a discrete FWT algorithm by the fractional kernel matrix is performed to preprocess fault samples. To obtain the optimal fractional order, two methods trained with the genetic algorithm are introduced. One approach is performed by the best diagnostic result, and the other is based on the maximum among-cluster center distance by the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) algorithm. In this paper, a threshold value is used to decrease the fuzzy region which in the overlap between hyperspheres of SVDD. Then, a SVDD fuzzy multi-classifier is applied to diagnose faults in analog circuit, and fuzzy faults are diagnosed in fuzzy sets by the relative distance. The simulation results show that the FWT succeeds in extracting local fault features and the classifier effectively detects faults. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
