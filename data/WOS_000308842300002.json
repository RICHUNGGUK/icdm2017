First, using the theory of semi-tensor product of matrices, the logical systems can be converted into a discrete time variant system. Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability via two types of controls are provided respectively. Third, optimal control design algorithms are presented. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the proposed results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
