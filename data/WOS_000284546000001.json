Switching activity of logic gates in a digital system is a deterministic process, depending on both circuit parameters and input signals. However, the huge number of logic blocks in a complex IC makes digital switching a cognitively stochastic process. For a combinational logic network, we can model digital switching currents as stationary shot noise processes, deriving both their amplitude distributions and their power spectral densities. From the spectra of digital currents, we can also calculate the spectral components and the rms value of disturbances injected into the on-chip power supply lines. The stochastic model for switching currents has been validated by comparing theoretical results with circuit simulations.", "paper_title": "Properties of Digital Switching Currents in Fully CMOS Combinational Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546000001"}
