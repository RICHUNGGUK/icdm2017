This problem entails planning an IP/MPLS network layer over a photonic mesh infrastructure whilst, at the same time, ensuring the highest availability of services and minimizing the capital expenditures (CAPEX) investments. Such a problem is currently identified as an open issue among network operators, and hence, its solution is of great interest. To tackle SIMNO, we first provide an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation which provides an insight into the complexity of its managing. Then, a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with path-relinking (PR) together with a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) are specifically developed to help solve the problem. The performance of both heuristics is exhaustively tested and compared making use of various network and traffic instances. Numerical experiments show the benefits of using GRASP instead of BRKGA when dealing with highly complex network scenarios. Moreover, we verified that the use of GRASP with PR remarkably improves the basic GRASP algorithm, particularly in real-sized, complex scenarios such as those proposed in this paper.
