A monitor-based supervisor performs better, i.e., with more permissive behavior, if its monitors are well designed. Deadlock control policies developed by max-controlled siphons are shown to be overly conservative from permissive behavior points of view. On. the basis of the concept. of max'-controlled siphons, this paper provides three methods, from structural points of view, to design monitors for siphons in SI R nets, systems of simple sequential processes with shared resources. A deadlock prevention policy is developed accordingly, leading to liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors with more permissive behavior. The proposed approaches and algorithm are then illustrated through an example.", "paper_title": "MONITOR DESIGN FOR SIPHON CONTROL IN (SR)-R-4 NETS: FROM STRUCTURE ANALYSIS POINTS OF VIEW", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500005"}
