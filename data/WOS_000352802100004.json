Our main purpose is to provide a repertoire of operators that offer the possibility of managing satisfaction degrees by adding structural constraints and fuzzy operators inside conditions, in order to produce a ranked sorted list of answers according to user's preferences when composing queries. By using the FLOPER system designed in our research group, our proposal has been implemented with a fuzzy logic language to take profit of the clear synergies between both target and source fuzzy languages.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy XPath through Fuzzy Logic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000352802100004"}
