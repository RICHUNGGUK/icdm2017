It is built with two main purposes in mind: (1) enable necessary surveys, observe applicant's reserved parcel, register the parcel online, and issue and follow up necessary permits/licenses in the field of exploration, (2) provide a mutual platform for data exchange among various service systems in the field of exploration and mining in Iran. The EMCS model is designed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) with three main sets of classes: (1) RegisterObject (2) ActivityLicense, and (3) Person. Other relevant features of the model are also specified at the class level. These include: conditional registered parcels, unregisterable areas such as prohibited or protected areas, legal borders around registered or serving parcels, reference documents such as legal survey results documents, responsibilities, and restrictions. The model also considers issues related to exploration cost, parcel code, tax, royalty, commodity, priorities, facilitations, evaluation, transfer of ownership, changing parameters, and temporal registration. The temporal aspects of the classes are also supported by the model to take care of the time periods that involve the general procedures in the registration of exploration and mining properties. We anticipate that the framework and model structure provide a platform for data storage, improve the supervision of exploration and mining process, change manual into online registration system, prevent administrative corruption, and reduce bureaucracy.", "paper_title": "Framework and modeling structure of Exploration and Mining Cadastre system in Iran", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040900006"}
