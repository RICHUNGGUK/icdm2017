All implemented approaches are based on a combination of information-theoretic measures and sequential Monte Carlo methods for state estimation in nonlinear, non-Gaussian dynamic systems. Properties of information measures are conveniently used to quantify the impact of process measurements on the posterior probability density function of the state, assuming that sub-optimal Bayesian estimation algorithms (such as classic or risk-sensitive particle filters) are to be used to obtain an empirical representation of the system uncertainty. The proposed anomaly detection strategies are tested and evaluated both in terms of (i) detection time (early detection) and (ii) false alarm rates. Verification of detection schemes is performed using simulated data for battery State-Of-Health accelerated degradation tests, to ensure absolute knowledge on the time instant where a regeneration phenomenon occurs.", "paper_title": "Information-Theoretic Measures and Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Detection of Regeneration Phenomena in the Degradation of Lithium-Ion Battery Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755200016"}
