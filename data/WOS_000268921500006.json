Our analysis of a system is able to describe the essential behaviour of each box, tracking all the possible bindings of variables, all the possible intra- and inter-boxes communications, and, finally, all the possible movements across compartments. The analysis offers a basis for establishing static checks of biological dynamic properties. We apply our analysis to an abstract specification of the interaction between a virus and cells of the immune system and to a model of the cAMP-signaling Pathway in Olfactory Sensory Neurons.
