In this paper, we propose a solution by using a novel distributed data structure called distributed data cube (DDC). A DDC maintains a set of special forms of aggregate values (prefix sum, prefix average, prefix max, and prefix min) in distributed sensor nodes. We will first present fast algorithms to build a DDC within a sharp time bound. Then, we will present efficient distributed query-processing algorithms to handle aggregate queries by using a DDC. For a query region with n sensor nodes, our algorithms can return within O(root n) time. Finally, extensive simulation studies confirm that a DDC can be built very quickly, which is consistent with the theoretical time bound. The network traffic injected while constructing a DDC is acceptable and also scalable as the network size grows. Query processing on a DDC is fast and energy efficient in terms of the time units needed and the number of messages incurred.", "paper_title": "Fast and Simultaneous Data Aggregation Over Multiple Regions in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289471700006"}
