Optimization included the search for a suitable solvent mixture, temperature and reaction time. Finally, the generality of the optimized reaction was tested using different starting materials. It was possible to create a variety of tri- and tetrasubstituted imidazoles in moderate to good yields via a continuous procedure.", "paper_title": "Continuous synthesis of tri- and tetrasubstituted imidazoles via a multicomponent reaction under microreactor conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238548900009"}
