However, most other members of the MD4 family of hash functions use multiple sets of rotation constants, i.e. the rotation amounts change with the step being processed. To our knowledge, no design rationales on the choice of rotation constants are given on any of these hash functions. This is the first paper that analyzes rotations in iterated hash functions. We focus on SHA-1-like hash functions and use recent developments in the analysis of these hash functions to evaluate the security implications of using multiple sets of rotation constants in the compression function instead of a single set. Additionally, we give some observations on the set of constants used in SHA-0 and SHA-1.", "paper_title": "Impact of rotations in SHA-1 and related hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900018"}
