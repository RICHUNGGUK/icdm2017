However, these models may not be appropriate for modeling the data traffic resulting from a particular application. Furthermore, they may be overestimating the performance of a WSN. In this paper, we show the significance of using a realistic and application-specific packet traffic model by comparing the performance of a well-known WSN protocol under the Surveillance WSN packet traffic model (SPTM), as well as under periodic and binomial traffic models. A packet traffic framework specific to surveillance applications is proposed which is then used for deriving SPTM analytically. In order to be adaptable and flexible, SPTM incorporates a probabilistic and parametric sensor detection model. Simulation results show that to employ an application-specific packet traffic model has significant impact on the performance evaluation of the WSN and ordinary traffic models may overestimate the capacity of the WSN.
