Using a process-based approach, the method was developed from a review of the IS evaluation literature, and then validated and refined through an in-depth case study of a manufacturing firm. Its originality lies in the fact that the whole range of performance indicators actually used by managers are integrated in the evaluation of the system.", "paper_title": "Linking the Effects of ERP to Organizational Performance: Development and Initial Validation of an Evaluation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000273610800004"}
