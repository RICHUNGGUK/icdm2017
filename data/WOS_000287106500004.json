Published works and existing security analysis tools are usually based on general intruder models that embody at least some aspects of the seminal work of Dolev-Yao, in an attempt to detect failures of secrecy. In this work, we propose an alternative intruder model, which is based on a thorough analysis of how potential attacks might proceed. We introduce an intruder model that provides an open-ended base for the integration of multiple basic attack tactics. Those attack tactics have the possibility to be combined, in a way to compose complex attack actions that require a number of procedural steps from the intruder's side, such as a Denial of Service attack. In our model checking approach, protocol correctness is checked by appropriate user-supplied assertions or reachability of invalid end states. The analyst can express security properties of specific attack actions that are not restricted to safety violations captured by a generic model checker. The described intruder model methodology was implemented within the SPIN model checker for verifying two security protocols, Micromint and PayWord.
