This problem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam filtering and improper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can reconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform convergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in practice.", "paper_title": "Estimating Labels from Label Proportions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272346400007"}
