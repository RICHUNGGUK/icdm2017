Local minimizers of continuous optimization problems satisfy these conditions without constraint qualifications. It is interesting to discover whether well-known optimization algorithms generate primal-dual sequences that allow one to detect that a sequential optimality condition holds. When this is the case, the algorithm stops with a correct' diagnostic of success (convergence'). Otherwise, closeness to a minimizer is not detected and the algorithm ignores that a satisfactory solution has been found. In this paper it will be shown that a straightforward version of the Newton-Lagrange (sequential quadratic programming) method fails to generate iterates for which a sequential optimality condition is satisfied. On the other hand, a Newtonian penalty-barrier Lagrangian method guarantees that the appropriate stopping criterion eventually holds.", "paper_title": "On the behaviour of constrained optimization methods when Lagrange multipliers do not exist", "paper_id": "WOS:000328027000013"}
