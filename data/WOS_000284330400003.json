The body posture could reveal further insight about the pedestrian's intent and her awareness of the oncoming car. This article details the algorithms and implementation of a library for real-time body posture recognition. It requires prior person detection and then calculates overall stance, torso orientation in four increments, and head location and orientation, all based on individual frames. A syntactic post-processing module takes temporal information into account and smoothes the results over time while correcting improbable configurations. We show accuracy and timing measurements for the library and its utilization in a training application.", "paper_title": "Human posture recognition for intelligent vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000284330400003"}
