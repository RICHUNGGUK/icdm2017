The fuzzy system can be further adapted to modify its rule base and output membership functions to provide satisfactory performance. This proposed scheme, called generalised influential rule search scheme, has been successfully implemented to develop pure fuzzy function approximators as well as fuzzy logic controllers. The satisfactory performance of the proposed scheme is amply demonstrated by implementing it to develop different major components in a process control loop. The versatility of the algorithm is further proved by implementing it for a benchmark nonlinear function approximation problem.", "paper_title": "Generalised influential rule search scheme for fuzzy function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236851500001"}
