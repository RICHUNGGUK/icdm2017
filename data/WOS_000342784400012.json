Our fine-grained access control aware multi-user secure keyword search approach interdependently harmonizes these two security notions, access control and encrypted keyword search. Owing to the shrinkage of the cloud server's search space to the user's decryptable subset, the proposed scheme both decreases information leakage and is shown to be efficient by the results of our contrastive performance simulation.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grained Access Control Aware Multi-User Data Sharing with Secure Keyword Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400012"}
