We formulate an algebraic test to determine whether an arbitrary network can compute linear functions using linear codes. We identify a class of linear functions that can be computed using linear codes in every network that satisfies a natural cut-based condition. Conversely, for another class of linear functions, we show that the cut-based condition does not guarantee the existence of a linear coding solution. For linear functions over the binary field, the two classes are complements of each other.", "paper_title": "Computing Linear Functions by Linear Coding Over Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600032"}
