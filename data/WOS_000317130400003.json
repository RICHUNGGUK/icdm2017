The celebrated theorem of Hajnal and Szemeredi asserts that every graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least (1 - 1/r)n contains a K-r-factor. In this note, we propose investigating the relation between minimum degree and existence of perfect K-r-packing for edge-weighted graphs. The main question we study is the following. Suppose that a positive integer r >= 2 and a real t is an element of [0, 1] is given. What is the minimum weighted degree of K-n that guarantees the existence of a K-r-factor such that every factor has total edge weight at least t((r)(2))? We provide some lower and upper bounds and make a conjecture on the asymptotics of the threshold as n goes to infinity.", "paper_title": "Towards a Weighted Version of the Hajnal-Szemeredi Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000317130400003"}
