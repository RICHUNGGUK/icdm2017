Given that the prior process is not always available, an MI-based block division method is proposed to divide blocks automatically by considering both cross-relations and high-order statistical information among variables. The PCA monitoring model is established in each sub-block and each mode, and a joint probability based on T-2 statistics is defined to identify running-on mode. Then, the statistics in different sub-blocks are combined by using Bayesian inference to provide an intuitive indication. Finally, an improved contribution plot method is proposed to identify the root cause of faults. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are evaluated by case studies on a numerical process and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process. Monitoring results and comparisons with conventional PCA methods indicate the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
