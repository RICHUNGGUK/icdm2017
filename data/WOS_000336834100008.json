Censoring is allowed only at the change-stress point in the final stage. An exponential failure time distribution with mean life that is a log-linear function of stress, along with a cumulative exposure model, is considered as the working model. The problem of choosing the optimal tau is addressed using the variance-optimality criterion. Under this setting, we then show that the optimal k-level step-stress ALT model with unequal duration steps reduces just to a 2-level step-stress ALT model.", "paper_title": "Planning step-stress test under Type-I censoring for the exponential case", "paper_id": "WOS:000336834100008"}
