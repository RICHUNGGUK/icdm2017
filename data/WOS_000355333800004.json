It is suitable for parallel wideband RF spectrum sensing in cognitive radios. The frequency synthesizer consists of an injection locked oscillator cascade (ILOC) where all the LO signals are derived from a single reference oscillator. The ILOC is implemented in a 130-nm technology with an active area of . It generates 4 uniformly spaced LO carrier frequencies from 500 MHz to 2 GHz. This design is the first known implementation of a CMOS based ILOC for wide-band RF spectrum sensing applications.", "paper_title": "A 0.5-2.0 GHz injection locked oscillator cascade for parallel wideband RF spectrum sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000355333800004"}
