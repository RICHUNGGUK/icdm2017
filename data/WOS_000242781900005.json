Informatics tools are needed, yet implementing them remains challenging. Objective: To identify critical success factors enabling the translation of clinical and operational knowledge about effective and efficient chronic care management into primary care practice. Design: A prospective case study of positive deviants using key informant interviews, process observation, and document review. Setting: A chronic disease management (CDM) collaborative of primary care physicians with documented improvement in adherence to clinical practice guidelines using a web-based patient registry system with CDM guideline-based flow sheet. Participants: Thirty community-based physician participants using predominately paper records, plus a project management team including the physician lead, project manager, evaluator and support team. Analysis: A critical success factor (CSF) analysis of necessary and sufficient pathways to the translation of knowledge into clinical practice. Results: A web-based CDM 'toolkit' was found to be a direct CSF that allowed this group of physicians to improve their practice by tracking patient care processes using evidence-based clinical practice guideline-based flow sheets. Moreover, the information and communication technology 'factor' was sufficient for success only as part of a set of seven direct CSF components including: health delivery system enhancements, organizational partnerships, funding mechanisms, project management, practice models, and formal knowledge translation practices. Indirect factors that orchestrated success through the direct factor components were also identified. A central insight of this analysis is that a comprehensive quality improvement model was the CSF that drew this set of factors into a functional framework for successful knowledge translation. Conclusions: In complex primary care settings environment where physicians have low adoption rates of electronic tools to support the care of patients with chronic conditions, successful implementation may require a set of interrelated system and technology factors.", "paper_title": "Informatics system support as a critical seccess factor for chronic disease management: Necessary but not sufficient", "paper_id": "WOS:000242781900005"}
