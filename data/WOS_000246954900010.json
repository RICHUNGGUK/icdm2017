This work is an extension from an earlier published work on the 2D model. In this paper, a 3D FEM model of the human eye is simulated for the steady state temperature distribution during normal condition and during electromagnetic (EM) wave radiation. Results show a discrepancy of 0.49% for a normal condition as opposed to 1.9% of a 2D model when compared to experimental results from open literatures. Investigations on the EM wave radiations found an average power absorption density of 15,151 and 22,145Wm(-3) for the 750 and 1500 MHz radiation, respectively. A peak temperature of 38.18 degrees C was predicted for the 750 MHz radiation while 41.19 degrees C was computed for the 1500 MHz radiation. These temperatures are in reasonable agreement with the simulated results computed by another report in the past. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
