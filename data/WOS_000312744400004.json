Since sensor measurements are often sensitive data acquired in hostile environments, securing WSN becomes mandatory. However, WSNs consists of low-end devices and frequently preclude the presence of a centralized security manager. Therefore, achieving security is even more challenging. State-of-the-art proposals rely on: (1) attended and centralized security systems; or (2) establishing initial keys without taking into account how to efficiently manage rekeying. In this paper we present a scalable group key management proposal for unattended WSNs that is designed to reduce the rekeying cost when the group membership changes.", "paper_title": "Low-cost group rekeying for unattended wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312744400004"}
