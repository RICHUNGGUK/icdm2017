The infrastructures forming aFederated Grid are classified as internal or external. This is because our scheduling policies map as much jobs as possible first to internal resources. In this way the mapping strategies save time and communication bandwidth by exploiting the location of the internal resources and the membership to their respective resource domains. At the same time, the policies avoid overloading external resources facilitating the cooperation between organizations to share resources. In this paper we consider three new algorithms for scheduling in situations where there are several Grid infrastructures of different types: enterprise, partner, or utility.
