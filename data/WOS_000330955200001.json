Instead of associating a level set function with a specific fluid material, the function is associated with a pair of materials and the interface that separates them. A voting algorithm collects sign information from all level set functions and determines material designation. To represent a general M-material configuration, M(M - 1)/2 level set functions need to be accounted for; problems of practical interest use far fewer functions, as not all pairs of materials share an interface, and level-set functions that coincide are grouped together. Under this model, regions of potential material ambiguity, i.e. overlaps or vacuum, are markedly reduced in size: in 2D, ambiguous regions are points, as opposed to lines in material-based level set models; in 3D, they are lines as opposed to surfaces. The model produces excellent results without the need for reinitialization, thereby avoiding additional computational costs and preventing excessive numerical diffusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
