By use of integrated circuit technology, the length of the electrodes, the area of the recording sites, as well as the spaces between the sites are closely controlled. SiO2/SiNx/SiO2 composite dielectric membrane and Pt black are introduced to improve the characteristics of the electrodes. The whole thickness of the thin-film probe was 21 mu m. By combining the modifying process with the micro-fabrication method, this kind of silicon based microelectrode satisfies high-density recording and the performance characterization is evaluated by test in vitro and in vivo.", "paper_title": "32-site microelectrode modified with Pt black for neural recording fabricated with thin-film silicon membrane", "paper_id": "WOS:000334860600006"}
