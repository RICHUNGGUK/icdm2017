In this paper, we study the ability of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES) to solve this problem when scenarios specifying the input feeding the field and desired output profiles are provided. A set of spatial lower and upper bounds, called templates are introduced to define a set of desired output profiles. The usefulness of the method is illustrated on three classical scenarios of dynamic neural fields: competition, working memory and tracking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
