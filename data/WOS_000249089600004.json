Various prior distributions are investigated and the corresponding estimates are derived. The stress is put on the asymptotic properties of the estimates with the particular stress on the Bayesian risk. Small sample properties are studied via simulations in the special case.", "paper_title": "On Bayesian estimation in an exponential distribution under random censorship", "paper_id": "WOS:000249089600004"}
