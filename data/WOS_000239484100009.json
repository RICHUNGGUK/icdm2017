All previous deterministic distributed algorithms, for constant stretch spanner of o(n(2)) edges, have a running time Omega(n(is an element of)) for some constant is an element of > 0 depending on the stretch. Our deterministic distributed algorithms construct constant stretch spanners of o(n(2)) edges in o(n(is an element of)) time for any constant is an element of > 0. More precisely, in the Linial's free model, we construct in n(O(1/root log n)) time, for every graph, a 5-spanner of O(n(3/2)) edges. The result is extended to O(k(2.322))-spanners with O(n(1+1/k)) edges for every parameter k >= 1. If the minimum degree of the graph is Omega(root n), then, in the same time complexity, a 9-spanner with O(n) edges can be constructed.", "paper_title": "Fast deterministic distributed algorithms for sparse spanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000239484100009"}
