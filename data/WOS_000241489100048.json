This paper presents a new algorithm and feature model for blue-sky detection. The algorithm classifies the sky areas by computing a pixel-accurate sky probability. Such a probabilistic measure matches well with the requirements of typical video enhancement functions in TVs. This algorithm enables not only content-adaptive picture quality improvement, but also more advanced applications such as content-based annotation of, and retrieval from image and video databases. When compared to existing algorithms, our proposal shows considerable improvements in correct detection/rejection rate of sky areas, and an improved consistency of the segmentation results.", "paper_title": "Blue sky detection for picture quality enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100048"}
