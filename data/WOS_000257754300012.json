To achieve this goal, candidate image features associated with clinical symptoms ire extracted from endoscopic images. With these candidate features, the SFFS method is applied to select feature subsets, which perform the best classification results under SVM with respect to different histological features. By using the classifiers obtained from the feature subsets, a new diagnosis system is implemented to provide physicians with H. pylori-related histological results from endoscopic images.", "paper_title": "Helicobacter pylori - Related gastric histology classification using support-vector-machine-based feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000257754300012"}
