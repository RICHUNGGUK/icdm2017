The question of how large a k-uniform G-intersecting family can be was first considered by Bohman, Frieze, Ruszinko and Thoma [2], who identified two natural candidates for the extrema depending on the relative sizes of k and n and asked whether there is a sharp phase transition between the two. Our first result shows that there is a sharp transition and characterizes the extremal families when G is a matching. We also give an example demonstrating that other extremal families can occur. Our second result gives a sufficient condition for the largest G-intersecting family to contain almost all k-sets. In particular we show that if C(n) is the n-cycle and k > alpha n + o(n), where alpha = 0.266 ... is the smallest positive root of (1-x)(3)(1+x) = 1/2, then the largest C(n)-intersecting family has size (1-o(1))((n)(k)). Finally we consider the non-uniform problem, and show that in this case the size of the largest G-intersecting family depends on the matching number of G.", "paper_title": "G-intersection theorems for matchings and other graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258173600008"}
