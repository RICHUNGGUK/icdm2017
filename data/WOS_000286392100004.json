The computation of the omega pairing requires the simple final exponentiation and short loop length in Miller's algorithm which leads to a significant improvement over the previously known techniques on certain pairing-friendly curves. Experimental results show that the omega pairing is about 22% faster and 19% faster than the super-optimal pairing proposed by Scott at security level of AES 80 bits on certain pairing-friendly curves in affine coordinate systems and projective coordinate systems, respectively.", "paper_title": "Computing bilinear pairings on elliptic curves with automorphisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000286392100004"}
