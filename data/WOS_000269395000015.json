The problem to be addressed is to design a filter which is subject to gain variations, such that the filtering error system is robustly exponentially stable in the mean square with a prescribed H-infinity norm bound. A delay-dependent sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is obtained. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "NON-FRAGILE H-infinity FILTERING FOR UNCERTAIN STOCHASTIC TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000015"}
