Unlike the extended kernel recursive least squares (Ex-KRLS) algorithm proposed by Liu, the state model of our algorithm is still constructed in the original state space and the hidden state is estimated using the Kalman filter. The measurement model used in hidden state estimation is learned by the kernel recursive least squares algorithm (KRLS) in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The novel algorithm has more flexible state and noise models. We apply this algorithm to vehicle tracking and the nonlinear Rayleigh fading channel tracking, and compare the tracking performances with other existing algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
