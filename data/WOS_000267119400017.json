Most existing message-oriented middleware for mobile networks rely on infrastructure or assume the existence of reliable and continuous connections among communicating entities. These schemes do not take advantage of cross-layer optimization. Publish/subscribe middleware has been widely used to provide asynchronous communication functionality in distributed application environments. Due to frequent node disconnections, asynchronous publish/subscribe message middleware is a proper communication model for mobile ad hoc networking environments. This paper presents mobility aware and a cross-layer based middleware (MOBCROSS) for MANETs. MOBCROSS is based on the publishing and subscription of topics. The main features of MOBCROSS are mobility awareness, network reconfiguration, message caching, and cross-layer interaction support. The performance of the middleware is evaluated in a simulation environment. MOBCROSS is compared with middleware without cross-layer (MWCL) scheme. MWCL provides caching but does not employ cross-layering. The simulation results indicated that MOBCROSS achieves higher performance as compared to MWCL with respect to packet delivery ratio with slightly lower message overhead. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
