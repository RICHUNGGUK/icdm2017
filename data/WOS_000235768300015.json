It has been reported recently that a new technique called FaceHashing, which is proposed for personal authentication using face images, has achieved perfect accuracy and zero equal error rates (EER), In this paper, we are going to reveal that the secret of FaceHashing in achieving zero EER is based on a false assumption. This is done through simulating the claimants' experiments. Thus, we would like to alert the use of '' safe '' token.", "paper_title": "Revealing the secret of FaceHashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300015"}
