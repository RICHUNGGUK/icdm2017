Thus the interplay between positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an important research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign inference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of these two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the two nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e. g., common friend). In this paper, we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by applying a new model for node types and use the proposed model to perform link sign prediction and link ranking. Initially, we analyze the local node structure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying node types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their types; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors. We show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed triads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or social status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies based upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in which the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges. Based upon the proposed features, we present the link sign prediction and link ranking models subsequently. We show that our approaches yield better performance than state-of-the-art approaches for these two tasks based upon three signed directed networks.", "paper_title": "Link sign prediction and ranking in signed directed social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300027"}
