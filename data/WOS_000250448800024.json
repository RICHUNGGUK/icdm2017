The matrix C is constructed by taking the inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a diagonal matrix, in which the diagonal elements comprise an arbitrary periodically perfect sequence gamma. Properties of the matrix C are presented. In addition, the Fourier dual E of the matrix C is investigated. When gamma is a Zadoff-Chu sequence for the case of N even, M = 1, and g = 0, an explicit representation for the matrix E is derived.", "paper_title": "A constructive representation for the Fourier dual of, the Zadoff-Chu sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800024"}
