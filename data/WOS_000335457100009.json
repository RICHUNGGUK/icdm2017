Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Bayesian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.", "paper_title": "Kernel Bayes' Rule: Bayesian Inference with Positive Definite Kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000335457100009"}
