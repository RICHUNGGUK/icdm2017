A potential solution is to deploy servers in appropriate locations. However, due to the unique features and requirements of P2P systems, the traditional placement models cannot yield the desirable service performance. To fill this gap, we propose an efficient server placement model for P2P live streaming systems. Compared to the existing solutions, this model takes the Internet Service Provider (ISP) friendly problem into account and can reduce the cross-network traffic among ISPs. Specifically, we introduce the peers' contribution into the proposed model, which makes it more suitable for P2P live streaming systems. Moreover, we deploy servers based on the theoretical solution subject to practical data and apply them to practical live streaming applications. The experimental results show that this new model can reduce the amount of cross-network traffic and improve the system efficiency, has a better adaptability to Internet environment, and is more suitable for P2P systems than the traditional placement models.", "paper_title": "A suitable server placement for peer-to-peer live streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500025"}
