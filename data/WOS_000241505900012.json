The separation of the server and the storage introduces a non-negligible delay in retrieving video frames in real time. We assume an additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease transport protocol to support the streaming process and develop an effective scheme to achieve consistent, high streaming quality. The heart of the scheme is the control of buffer occupancy at the proxy server. We model the buffer as a bilinear dynamical system disturbed by a point process with stochastic state-dependent intensity. We first develop a buffer controller that does not exploit this model. Then, using the buffer model, we construct a second controller based on an optimal-control analysis for the case without retrieval delay. Extending these two controllers, we subsequently synthesize two controllers based on prediction of future system states using the model, taking into account both the delay and the state-dependent disturbance intensity. Our empirical study illustrates the effectiveness of the streaming scheme. We further find that the controllers exploiting the buffer model demonstrate performance significantly superior to that of the model-free controller in overcoming the adverse impact of the retrieval delay. We also conduct limited experiments to study the impact of variable retrieval delays. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
