A PFMB control system is formed by a polynomial fuzzy model and a polynomial fuzzy controller with integral action connected in a closed loop. Three cases of PFMB control systems regarding the premise membership functions and number of fuzzy rules, which have their own properties and advantages, are considered. The stability of the PFMB control systems is investigated based on the Lyapunov stability theory. With consideration of the information of membership functions, SOS-based stability conditions corresponding to each case are obtained to guarantee system stability and to realize output regulation. Simulation examples are given to compare the three cases and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Output Regulation of Polynomial-Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001400006"}
