However, in the indoor environment, the propagation of signals at this millimeter wave band is strongly hindered by walls, people and their movement, furniture, etc. As a result, a mobile user might experience frequent loss of connection as the user moves from one cell to another. In this paper, we propose a flexible and cost-effective Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) based network architecture to support indoor networking at millimeter wave bands. To create sufficient overlap areas between cells and thus to ensure a seamless communication environment for mobile users, the concept of Extended Cell is introduced. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture with a detailed simulation study of an indoor scenario. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the architecture on the performance of two popular state-of-the-art protocols, namely IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16, to find which Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is suitable for RoF networks.
