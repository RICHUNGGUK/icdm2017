It allows such a system to compute tentative solutions by using default knowledge about agents even if communications between agents are delayed or fail. Previously we have proposed a logical framework for speculative constraint processing for master-slave multi-agent systems. In this paper, we extend the framework to support more general multi-agent systems that are hierarchically structured. We provide an operational model for the framework and present a prototype implementation of the model.", "paper_title": "Speculative constraint processing for hierarchical agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000284940700006"}
