The error convergence of the AGSMO for the SOC estimation is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. Comparing with conventional sliding mode observers for the SOC estimation, the AGSMO can minimise chattering levels and improve the accuracy by adaptively adjusting switching gains to compensate modelling errors. To design the AGSMO for the SOC estimation, the state equations of the CBECM are derived to capture dynamics of a battery. Alithium-polymer battery (LiPB) is used to conduct experiments for extracting parameters of the CBECM and verifying the effectiveness of the proposed AGSMO for the SOC estimation.
