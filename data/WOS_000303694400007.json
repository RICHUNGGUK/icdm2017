These simulations contain some of the most important features of landing gear flow fields. The main noise generation mechanism of landing gear is the interaction of the upstream cylinder wake with the downstream cylinder. The purpose of this work is to determine the level of accuracy that is currently achievable for this problem using high-order numerical schemes together with a turbulence model suitable for complex separated flows. The computation is based on the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The two cylinders in tandem are identical and 3.7 cylinder diameters apart. Grid resolution studies involving up to 133 million grid points are carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the predictions to grid resolution. Results are compared with available experimental measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
