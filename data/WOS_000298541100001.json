The method finds a projection of multivariate data into a lower dimensional space so that the groups in the data are well separated. The resulting projected values are subsequently used to classify unlabeled observations into the groups.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000298541100001"}
