Our algorithm makes poly(s,1/epsilon) black-box queries to f and runs in time na <...poly(s,1/epsilon). The only previous algorithm for this testing problem (Diakonikolas et al. in Proceedings of the 48th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, pp. 549-558, 2007) used poly(s,1/epsilon) queries, but had running time exponential in s and super-polynomial in 1/epsilon. Our approach significantly extends the \"testing by implicit learning\" methodology of Diakonikolas et al. (Proceedings of the 48th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, pp. 549-558, 2007). The learning component of that earlier work was a brute-force exhaustive search over a concept class to find a hypothesis consistent with a sample of random examples. In this work, the learning component is a sophisticated exact learning algorithm for sparse GF(2) polynomials due to Schapire and Sellie (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 52(2):201-213, 1996). A crucial element of this work, which enables us to simulate the membership queries required by Schapire and Sellie (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 52(2):201-213, 1996), is an analysis establishing new properties of how sparse GF(2) polynomials simplify under certain restrictions of \"low-influence\" sets of variables.", "paper_title": "Efficiently Testing Sparse GF(2) Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000293962400004"}
