In this paper, the convergence of discrete delayed Hopfield neural networks is mainly investigated. One new sufficient and necessary condition for the delayed network having no one stable state is given. Also, several new sufficient conditions for the delayed networks converging towards a limit cycle with 2-period and with 4-period are respectively obtained. All results established here partly extend the previous results on the convergence of both discrete Hopfield neural networks and discrete delayed Hopfield neural networks in parallel updating mode.", "paper_title": "Convergence analysis of discrete delayed Hopfield neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000041"}
