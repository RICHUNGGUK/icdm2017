The basis of the paper is a proposal for overcoming a potential deficiency of PLS path modeling. In the PLS approach the reflective scheme assumed for the endogenous latent variables (LVs) is inverted; moreover, the model errors are not explicitly taken into account for the estimation of the endogenous LVs. The proposed approach utilizes all the relevant information in the formative manifest variables (MVs) providing solutions which respect the causal structure of the model. The estimation procedure is based on the optimization of the redundancy criterion. The new approach, entitled redundancy analysis approach to path modeling (RA-PM) is compared with both traditional PLS Path Modeling and LISREL methodology, on the basis of real and simulated data.
