The garbled circuit construction is a central tool for constant-round secure computation and has several other applications. Motivated by these applications, we suggest an efficient arithmetic variant of Yao's original construction. Our construction transforms an arithmetic circuit C : Z(n) -> Z(m) over integers from a bounded (but possibly exponential) range into a garbled circuit C along with n affine functions L-i : Z -> Z(k) such that C together with the n integer vectors L-i(x(i)) reveal C(x) and no additional information about x. The security of our construction relies on the intractability of the learning with errors problem.", "paper_title": "HOW TO GARBLE ARITHMETIC CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335820900022"}
