Dimensionality of hyperspectral data was reduced and statistical and histogram features were extracted from NIR images of significant wavelengths and given as input to three statistical discriminant classifiers (linear, quadratric, and Mahalanobis) and a back propagation neural network (BPNN) classifier. A total of 230 features (colour, textural, and morphological) were extracted from the colour images and the most contributing features were selected and used as input to the statistical and BPNN classifiers The quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier gave the highest accuracy and correctly identified 96.4% healthy and 91.0-1000% insect-damaged wheat kernels using the top 10 features from 230 colour image features combined with hyperspectral image features (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Identification of insect-damaged wheat kernels using short-wave near-infrared hyperspectral and digital colour imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000280945700003"}
