Accordingly, organizations must retain a quick adaptability, which capability can be achieved and maintained by sufficient attention to the whole lifecycle of business process management. In order to accomplish such agility, organizations need to improve their business processes continuously in response to changes in the business environments. In this paper, we present an approach to continuous process improvement based on case-based reasoning and business process change patterns. The approach includes a decision support feature and suggests a specific business process improvement guide for process improvement staff. It is expected that the proposed approach, through provision of such a concrete and detailed guide, will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of process improvement efforts.", "paper_title": "AN APPROACH TO CONTINUOUS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT (CPI) BASED ON CASE-BASED REASONING AND PROCESS CHANGE PATTERNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100030"}
