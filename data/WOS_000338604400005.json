The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a novel modality that uses the brain signals of a user to enable natural and intuitive interaction with an external device. In this paper we present a human factors study on the use of an Emotiv EEG BCI headset for 3D CAD modeling. The study focuses on substituting the conventional computer mouse- and keyboard-based inputs with inputs from the Emotiv EEG headset. The main steps include (1) training the headset to recognize user-specific EEG/EMG signals and (2) assigning the classified signals to emulate keystrokes which are used to activate/control different commands of a CAD package. To assess the performance of the new system, we compared the time taken by the users to create the 3D CAD models using both the conventional and BCI-based interfaces. In addition, to exhibit the adaptability of the new system, we carried out the study for a set of CAD models of varying complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
