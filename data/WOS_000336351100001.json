This paper presents simple, geometric criteria that imply that, for regular shift-invariant tessellations, only a small subset of such spline families yield nested spaces: primarily the well-known tensor-product and box splines. Among the many non-refinable constructions are hex-splines and their generalization to the Voronoi cells of non-Cartesian root lattices. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.
