Natural variants of the PA arise from viewing a PA equivalently as an automaton that keeps a count of its transitions and semilinearly constrains their numbers. Here we adopt this view and define the affine PA, that extends the PA by having each transition induce an affine transformation on the PA registers, and the PA on letters, that restricts the PA by forcing any two transitions on the same letter to affect the registers equally. Then we report on the expressiveness, closure, and decidability properties of such PA variants. We note that deterministic PA are strictly weaker than deterministic reversal-bounded counter machines.", "paper_title": "AFFINE PARIKH AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000310757900005"}
