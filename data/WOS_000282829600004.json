When the data are noisy, it is of interest to bound the solution error relative to the (unknown) solution of the original noiseless problem. Related to this is an error bound for the linear convergence analysis of first-order gradient methods for solving these problems. Example applications include compressed sensing, variable selection in regression, TV-regularized image denoising, and sensor network localization.", "paper_title": "Approximation accuracy, gradient methods, and error bound for structured convex optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000282829600004"}
