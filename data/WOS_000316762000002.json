The difficulty of this problem arises from the fact that it is characterized by four variants of the vehicle routing problem that have been studied independently in the literature, but not together. The experimental analysis on a large set of randomly-generated instances shows the good performance of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, computational results using real data show that the method outperforms real existing approaches to reverse logistics.", "paper_title": "Designing routes for WEEE collection: the vehicle routing problem with split loads and date windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762000002"}
