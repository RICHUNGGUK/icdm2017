However, its computational complexity is too high to apply in practical real-time applications. This paper proposes a low complexity keypoint extraction algorithm based on SIFT descriptor and utilization of the database, and its real-time hardware implementation for Full-HD resolution video. The proposed algorithm computes SIFT descriptor on the keypoint obtained by corner detection and selects a scale from the database. It is possible to parallelize the keypoint detection and descriptor computation modules in the hardware. These modules do not depend on each other in the proposed algorithm in contrast with SIFT that computes a scale. The processing time of descriptor computation in this hardware is independent of the number of keypoints because its descriptor generation is pipelining structure of pixel. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm on software is 12 times faster than SIFT. Moreover, the proposed hardware on FPGA is 427 times faster than SIFT and 61 times faster than the proposed algorithm on software. The proposed hardware performs keypoint extraction and matching at 60 fps for Full-HD video.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Keypoint Extraction Based on SIFT Descriptor and Its Hardware Implementation for Full-HD 60 fps Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500041"}
