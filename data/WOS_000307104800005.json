An effective coarse model is proposed to represent the SIW filter. The proposed coarse model can be analyzed in the available commercial software ADS. The embedded knowledge includes not only formulas but also extracted design curves, which help to build the mapping between the coarse and fine models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a design example of a six-pole SIW filter. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
