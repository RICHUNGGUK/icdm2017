The quality of service can be quantified by the subjective evaluation of an individual. The acceptance limit value to society is then defined by a stable limit of the social condition. We then calculate the stable limit in quantity by a numerical simulation using the Hierarchized Cellular Automata model. Results of the calculation show that the stable limit can be determined with the corresponding constants of the subject group. Finally we predict the acceptance limit with the result of calculations and an experimental constant for the subject group. Moreover, an applicable condition of the predicted value is discussed.
