Continuations are not an algebraic effect, but previously developed combinations of algebraic effects given by sum and tensor extend, with effort, to include commonly used combinations of the various algebraic effects with continuations. Continuations also give rise to a third sort of combination, that given by applying the continuations monad transformer to an algebraic effect. We investigate the extent to which sum and tensor extend from algebraic effects to arbitrary monads, and the extent to which Felleisen et al.'s C operator extends from continuations to its combination with algebraic effects. To do all this, we use Dubuc's characterisation of strong monads in terms of enriched large Lawvere theories. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
