The proposed approach has a good performance in finding a diverse set of solutions and in converging near the true Pareto-optimal set. Numerical results for two sample test systems have been presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions of economic environmental dispatch problem in one single run. Simulation results with the proposed approach have been validated with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II.", "paper_title": "ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL DISPATCH BY A MODE TECHNIQUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648200010"}
