This paper focuses on structuring a ship design project approval mechanism (SDPAM) based on fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) methodology which is concerned with the system design of relevant interfaces on an engine room control console. Design characteristics such as accessibility and operational requirements are treated as \"hard\" constraints being encountered in this complex problem Hence, the proposed methodology requires performance assessment using fuzzy values This Study provides original contributions to the existing approval procedures of classification societies, which are non-governmental construction and classification organizations in the shipping industry. Furthermore, the study proposes a new approach to handle uncertainty and vagueness by an axiomatic design extension to ship project execution problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
