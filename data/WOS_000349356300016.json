It has been shown that using the combination of both could provide better performance. In this paper, a K-means based histogram (KBH) using the combination of color and texture features for image retrieval is proposed. Multiresolution feature vectors representing color and texture features are directly generated from the coefficients of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and K-means is exploited to partition the vector space with the objective to reduce the number of histogram bins. Thereafter, a fusion of z-score normalized Chi-Square distance between KBHs is employed as the similarity measure. Experiments have been conducted on four natural color texture data sets to examine the sensitivity of KBH to its parameters. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results evaluated in terms of Precision-Recall and Average Retrieval Rate (ARR) show that our approach outperforms the referred approaches.", "paper_title": "K-means based histogram using multiresolution feature vectors for color texture database retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356300016"}
