An experimental study is carried out to estimate the heat transfer characteristics as a function of some input parameters, namely frequency, amplitude, heat flux and filling heights. In the experiments, a piston cylinder mechanism is used to generate an oscillating flow in a liquid column at certain frequency and amplitude. The cycle-averaged values are considered in the calculation of heat transfer using the control volume approach. An experimentally evaluated data set is prepared to be processed with the use of neural networks. Back propagation algorithm, the most common learning method for ANNs, is used for training and testing the network. Results of the experiments and the ANN are in close agreements with errors less than 5%. The study showed that the ANNs could be used effectively for modeling oscillating flow heat transfer in a vertical annular duct. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
