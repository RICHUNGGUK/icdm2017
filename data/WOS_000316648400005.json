We consider general multilinear and multihomogeneous tensors. We show how to reduce the problem to a truncated moment matrix problem and give a new criterion for flat extension of Quasi-Hankel matrices. We connect this criterion to the commutation characterization of border bases. A new algorithm is described. It applies for general multihomogeneous tensors, extending the approach on binary forms by J.J. Sylvester. An example illustrates the algebraic operations involved in this approach and how the decomposition can be recovered from eigenvector computation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
