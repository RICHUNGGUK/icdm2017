In this study, it is applied to the study of self-assemblies of colloidal particles with two different sizes, partially immersed in a fluid layer on a substrate. Simulation results show that the separation of different particles can emerge as the ratio of particles radii increases. Also, the influence of the thickness of fluid layer on both the assembling process and the assembled structures is investigated.", "paper_title": "SIMULATION OF SELF-ASSEMBLIES OF COLLOIDAL PARTICLES WITH DIFFERENT SIZES BY USING A LATTICE BOLTZMANN PSEUDO-SOLID MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313200002"}
