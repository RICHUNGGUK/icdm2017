Can this bivalence be somehow used to our advantage? The present note briefly surveys the progress made in the last three decades toward making that theme precise from an abstract point of view, with emphasis on the most recent work on effectively extracting useful procedures from it, and illustrating some of its applications to the domains of semantics and proof-theory.", "paper_title": "Many-valuedness Meets Bivalence: Using Logical Values in an Effective Way", "paper_id": "WOS:000305440000005"}
