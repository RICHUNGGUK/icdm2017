We consider the non-resumable case. The objectives are to minimize the makespan and the total completion time. We show that both problems are NP-hard and present pseudo-polynomial time optimal algorithms to solve them. Furthermore, for the makespan problem, we present an optimal approximation algorithm for the on-line case, and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the off-line case. For the total completion time problem, we provide a heuristic and evaluate its efficiency by computational experiments. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
