The traditional Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and quasi-likelihood ratio statistics weakly converge to functions of Gaussian processes, rather than to convenient chi-squared distributions. Also, their large-sample null distributions are problem dependent, limiting applicability. We overcome this challenge by applying functional regression methods of Cho et al. [8] to extreme learning machines (ELM). The Wald ELM (WELM) test statistic proposed here is easy to compute and has a large-sample standard chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis of correct specification. We provide associated theory for time-series data and affirm our theory with some Monte Carlo experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
