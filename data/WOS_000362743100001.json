Accordingly, it is expected that the number of information devices used and utilized in industry would be increased significantly. Therefore, intracompany smart IT management becomes more important to efficiently utilize information devices increased rapidly due to introduction of intelligent environment computing. In addition, there is a need of understanding corporate smart IT management levels in the intelligent environment computing to establish information strategies for flexibly responding to internal and external environment factors being varied rapidly by corporate policies. Therefore, this study would like to analyze management levels for smart IT to improve corporate smart IT application capabilities in the intelligent environment computing. In detail, it designed a conceptual system for analyzing smart IT management levels to analyze 282 companies. And it suggested a direction of utilizing smart IT efficiently and properly in the intelligent environment computing through comparative analysis of the smart IT management level cases analyzed by other organizations.", "paper_title": "Smart IT Management Evaluation in Intelligent Environment Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000362743100001"}
