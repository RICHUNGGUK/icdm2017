Wediscuss the existence of multiple positive solutions for the following fractional differential equation with a negatively perturbed term [-D-0+(alpha) u(t) = p(t)f(t, u(t)) - q(t), 0 < t < 1, u(0) = u'(0) = u(1) = 0, where 2 < alpha <= 3 is a real number, the perturbed term q : (0, 1) -> [0,+infinity) is Lebesgue integrable and may be singular at some zero measures set of [ 0,1], which implies the nonlinear term may change sign.
