Each infinite binary sequence A is assigned a dimension dim(A) is an element of [0, 1] and a strong dimension Dim(A) is an element of [0, 1]. Let DIM alpha and DIMstr alpha be the classes of all sequences of dimension alpha and of strong dimension alpha, respectively. We show that DIM0 is properly Pi(0)(2), and that for all Delta(0)(2)-computable alpha is an element of (0, 1], DIM alpha is properly Pi(0)(3). To classify the strong dimension classes, we use a more powerful effective Borel hierarchy where a coenumerable predicate is used rather than an enumerable predicate in the definition of the Sigma(0)(1) level. For all Delta(0)(2)-computable alpha is an element of [0, 1), we show that DIMstr alpha is properly in the Pi(0)(3) level of this hierarchy. We show that DIMstr1 is properly in the Pi(0)(2) level of this hierarchy. We also prove that the class of Schnorr random sequences and the class of computably random sequences are properly Pi(0)(3).", "paper_title": "The arithmetical complexity of dimension and randomness", "paper_id": "WOS:000246013800006"}
