In this paper, we propose a multi-objective network optimal model with random fuzzy coefficients for the logistics distribution center location problem. Furthermore, we convert the uncertain model into a deterministic one by the probability and possibility measure. Then the spanning tree-based genetic algorithm (st-GA) by the Prufer number representation is introduced to solve the crisp multi-objective programming. At last, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to the Xinxi Dairy Holdings Limited Company to show the efficiency.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective chance-constrained network optimal model with random fuzzy coefficients and its application to logistics distribution center location problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300098500004"}
