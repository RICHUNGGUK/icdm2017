In particular, we extend Nesterov's technique developed in Nesterov (SIAM J Optim 22(2):341-362, 2012) for analyzing the RBCD method for minimizing a smooth convex function over a block-separable closed convex set to the aforementioned more general problem and obtain a sharper expected-value type of convergence rate than the one implied in Richtarik and Taka (Math Program 144(1-2):1-38, 2014). As a result, we also obtain a better high-probability type of iteration complexity. In addition, for unconstrained smooth convex minimization, we develop a new technique called randomized estimate sequence to analyze the accelerated RBCD method proposed by Nesterov (SIAM J Optim 22(2):341-362, 2012) and establish a sharper expected-value type of convergence rate than the one given in Nesterov (SIAM J Optim 22(2):341-362, 2012).", "paper_title": "On the complexity analysis of randomized block-coordinate descent methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000358292600021"}
