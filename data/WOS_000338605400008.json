The actual elements are diffusers with angles between 7.5 degrees and 40 degrees and elbows of RID ratios between 1 and 10. Three fluids were studied; water (for validation purposes), a power-law fluid (0.13 m/m% Carbopol 971 solution) and Bingham plastic fluids with Hedstrom number varying from 10 to 10(6). Experiments were conducted with water and power-law fluid to validate the CFD computations. Loss coefficients are given for the Reynolds number regime that is usual in engineering applications. The behavior of different turbulence models (eddy-viscosity and Reynolds stress models) are also reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
