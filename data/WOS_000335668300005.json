The new idea in this article is to connect two very efficient approaches: the discretised Lyapunov functional for systems with pointwise delay and the convex analysis for systems with time-varying delay. The proposed method is able to check the stability interval when the time-varying delay d(t) belongs to an interval [r, tau]. The case of unstable delayed systems for r = 0 is also treatable. The resulting criterion, expressed in terms of a convex optimisation problem, outperforms the existing ones in the literature, as illustrated by the numerical examples.", "paper_title": "New delay-interval stability condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300005"}
