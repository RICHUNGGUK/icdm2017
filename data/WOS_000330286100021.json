This result is then applied to the closed-form characterization of the bivariate Nakagami-m distribution and of the distribution of the minimum eigenvalue of correlated noncentral Wishart matrices, both important in communication theory. New expressions for the corresponding cumulative distributions are obtained and a number of communication-theoretic problems involving them are pointed out.", "paper_title": "Connections Between the Generalized Marcum Q-Function and a Class of Hypergeometric Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330286100021"}
