The results of numerical simulations performed for three commonly used modulation formats at two different bit-rates each demonstrate simultaneous and independent monitoring of optical signal-to-noise ratio, chromatic dispersion, and differential group delay with mean errors of 1 dB, 4 ps/nm, and 1.6 ps, respectively, without knowing the signal's bit-rate and modulation format. Similarly, the results for joint BR-MFI validate accurate identification of all the bit-rates and modulation formats despite the presence of various network impairments. The effects of fiber nonlinearity and transmitter variations on the performance of the proposed technique are also investigated.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Optical Performance Monitoring and Modulation Format/Bit-Rate Identification Using Principal Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000335958500002"}
