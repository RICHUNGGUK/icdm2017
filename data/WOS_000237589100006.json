In this paper, an automated approach to clinical image segmentation is presented. The processing of these images in our approach is divided into learning and segmentation stages to facilitate the application of principal component analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. During the initial learning stage, representative images are chosen to represent typical input images. These images are segmented using a variational level set method driven by a modeled energy functional designed to delineate the pathological characteristics of the images. Then a window-based feature extraction is applied to these segmented images. Principal component analysis is applied to these extracted features and the results are used to train an SVM classifier. After training the SVM, any time a clinical image needs to be segmented, it is simply classified with the trained SVM. By the proposed method, we take the strengths of both machine learning and the variational level set method while limiting their weaknesses to achieve automatic and fast clinical segmentation. To test the proposed system, both chest (thoracic) computed tomography (CT) scans (2D and 3D) and dental X-rays are used. Promising results are demonstrated and analyzed. The proposed method can be used during pre-processing for automatic computer-aided diagnosis. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
