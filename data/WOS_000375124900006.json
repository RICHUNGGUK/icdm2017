In this paper, we design a novel CB-PHR system. It allows PHR owners to securely store their health data on the semi-trusted cloud service providers, and to selectively share their health data with a wide range of PHR users. To reduce the key management complexity, we divide PHR users into two security domains named public domain and personal domain. PHR owners encrypt their health data for the public domain using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme, while encrypt their health data for the personal domain using anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption scheme. Only authorized users whose credentials satisfy the specified ciphertext-policy or whose identities belong to dedicated identities can decrypt the encrypted health data. Extensive analytical and experimental results are presented which show that our CB-PHR system is secure, privacy-protected, scalable and efficient.", "paper_title": "Privacy-preserving Cloud-based Personal Health Record System Using Attribute-based Encryption and Anonymous Multi-Receiver Identity-based Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000375124900006"}
