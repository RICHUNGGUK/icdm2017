The challenge associated with our UAV is related to the fact that all motions of our UAV are controlled by two independently-actuated-ailerons namely elevons, together with its throttle. The scope of this research, nonetheless, falls within the area of elevon control based on the trimmed linear longitudinal flight modes obtained experimentally while throttle was set constant. The reason for considering mu-synthesis autopilot is to minimise the effects of uncertainty in modelling by maximising the amount of tolerable uncertainty within our system's bandwidth as we aim to minimise the structure singular value mu of the corresponding robust performance associated with the uncertain systems. Second, it also provides flexibility in tunning due to the absence of partitioning model of MIMO system. Hence the entire autopilot was designed by keeping the system model as a whole. We also perform a comparative study with respect to well-known mixed sensitivity autopilot. Our study indicates that the mu synthesis autopilot designed possesses better performances both in time and frequency domain as indicated by reasonably quick settling time in the absence of overshoot while still maintaining better robust stability margin.", "paper_title": "Robust mu-synthesis Loop Shaping for Altitude Flight Dynamics of a Flying-Wing Airframe", "paper_id": "WOS:000356816000007"}
