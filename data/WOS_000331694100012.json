Creating texture maps has always been a complex task and existing methods carefully balance flexibility with ease of use. One difficulty in using texturing is the repeated placement of individual textures over larger areas. In this paper, we propose a method which uses decals to place images onto a model. Our method allows the decals to compete for space and to deform as they are being pushed by other decals. A spherical field function is used to determine the position and the size of each decal and the deformation applied to fit the decals. The decals may span multiple objects with heterogeneous representations. Our method does not require an explicit parametrization of the model. As such, varieties of patterns, including repeated patterns like rocks, tiles and scales can be mapped. We have implemented the method using the GPU where placement, size and orientation of thousands of decals are manipulated in real time.", "paper_title": "Implicit Decals: Interactive Editing of Repetitive Patterns on Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000331694100012"}
