Let S-sigma (v) denote the set of colors assigned to IN(v) in G under incidence coloring sigma and s(sigma) = max{vertical bar S-sigma (v)vertical bar : v is an element of V(G)}. Let G(1)square G(2) denote the Cartesian product of graphs G(1) and G(2). Let cri be an incidence coloring of graph G(i) and n(sigma(i)) the number of colors used by sigma(i) for i is an element of {1, 2}. In this paper, we show that if n(sigma(1)) >= n(sigma(2)) - s(sigma(2)), then there exists an incidence coloring of G(1)square G(2) which uses n(sigma(1)) + s(sigma(2)) colors; otherwise, there exists an incidence coloring of G(1)square G(2) using n(sigma(2)) colors. Based on the result above, we settle the following conjecture in affirmative: For integer p >= 1, chi(i)(Q(n)) = {n + 1 if n = 2(p) - 1 n + 2 otherwise, where Q(n) is the n-dimensional hypercube and chi(i)(Q(n)) is the incidence coloring number of Q(n).
