Here, we used a machine learning method to try to improve the tRNAScan-SE results. A new predictor, tRNA-Predict, was designed. We obtained real and pseudo-tRNA sequences as training data sets using tRNAScan-SE and constructed three different tRNA feature sets. We then set up an ensemble classifier, LibMutil, to predict tRNAs from the training data. The positive data set of 623 tRNA sequences was obtained from tRNAdb 2009 and the negative data set was the false positive tRNAs predicted by tRNAscan-SE. Our in silico experiments revealed a prediction accuracy rate of 95.1% for tRNA-Predict using 10-fold cross-validation. tRNA-Predict was developed to distinguish functional tRNAs from pseudo-tRNAs rather than to predict tRNAs from a genome-wide scan. However, tRNA-Predict can work with the output of tRNAscan-SE, which is a genome-wide scanning method, to improve the tRNAscan-SE annotation results.
