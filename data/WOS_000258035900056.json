In this paper we propose a two layer architecture to prevent Denial of Service attacks on VoIP systems based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The architecture is designed to handle different types of attacks, including request flooding, malformed message sending, and attacks on the underlying DNS system. The effectiveness of the prevention mechanisms have been tested both in the laboratory and on a real live VoIP provider network. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
