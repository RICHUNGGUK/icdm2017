However, the nondeterministic garbage collection operation in NAND flash memory makes it difficult to predict the system response time of each data request. This article presents Lazy-RTGC, a real-time lazy garbage collection mechanism for NAND flash memory storage systems. Lazy-RTGC adopts two design optimization techniques: on-demand page-level address mappings, and partial garbage collection. On-demand page-level address mappings can achieve high performance of address translation and can effectively manage the flash space with the minimum RAM cost. On the other hand, partial garbage collection can provide the guaranteed system response time. By adopting these techniques, Lazy-RTGC jointly optimizes both the average and the worst system response time, and provides a lower bound of reclaimed free space. Lazy-RTGC is implemented in FlashSim and compared with representative real-time NAND flash memory management schemes. Experimental results show that our technique can significantly improve both the average and worst system performance with very low extra flash-space requirements.", "paper_title": "Lazy-RTGC: A Real-Time Lazy Garbage Collection Mechanism with Jointly Optimizing Average and Worst Performance for NAND Flash Memory Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357174900010"}
