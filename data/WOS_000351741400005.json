The resonator of the modified LC-VCO is based on a compact circuit topology with high Q-value and better isolation. The active amplifier of the VCO is optimized with a combination of several circuit techniques to reduce phase noise and increase the operation speed. Resonant filters containing high-quality CPWs are employed in the signal preprocessor to accommodate the 37 Gb/s data rate. The measured figure of merit of the modified VCO is about -196 dBc/Hz at 37-GHz when the PLL is locked. The experimental results also demonstrate that the recovered clock signal of the CR circuit has a phase noise of -81.66 dBc/Hz at 50 kHz off the center frequency.", "paper_title": "An ultra-high speed monolithic clock recovery circuit in 0.2-A mu m GaAs process", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400005"}
