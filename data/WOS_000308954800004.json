In this context, users generate large amounts of data, especially containing opinion, which has been proven useful for many real-world applications. In order to extract knowledge from user-generated content, automatic methods must be developed. In this paper, we present different approaches to multi-document summarization of opinion from blogs and reviews. We apply these approaches to: (a) identify positive and negative opinions in blog threads in order to produce a list of arguments in favor and against a given topic and (b) summarize the opinion expressed in reviews. Subsequently, we evaluate the proposed methods on two distinct datasets and analyze the quality of the obtained results, as well as discuss the errors produced. Although much remains to be done, the approaches we propose obtain encouraging results and point to clear directions in which further improvements can be made.", "paper_title": "Challenges and solutions in the opinion summarization of user-generated content", "paper_id": "WOS:000308954800004"}
