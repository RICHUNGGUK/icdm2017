NET, and others. We consider patterns for improving transformation modularization and efficiency and for reducing data storage requirements. We define a metamodel-based formalization of model transformation design patterns, and measurement-based techniques to guide the selection of patterns. We also provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of transformation patterns on a range of different case studies.", "paper_title": "Model-Transformation Design Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000346224400005"}
