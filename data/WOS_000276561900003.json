The cost per unit for cutting operations is partly related to cutting time and tool life. The acceptable quality level is measured mainly in regard to surface roughness. The cutting time, tool life and surface roughness are all functions of cutting parameters. For cost and quality optimisation, in cutting parameter determination, an integration of three elements in problem formulation is necessary. However, with recent developments in computer hardware and software, the computer experimental approach consisting of both a computer simulation and a statistical method has become possible. With removal geometry configuration being specified, the computer simulation is performed by existing computer-aided engineering software, such as CATIA and Computer Cutting Data Service. The simulated outputs are analysed by statistical methods, such as response surface methodology, to obtain the predicted cutting time and tool life functions. These two functions will be further plugged into a unit cost model as the objective function, along with quality level as constraints. Then, the problem is formulated with mathematical programming to determine optimal cutting parameters for both quality and cost.", "paper_title": "A computational simulation approach for optimising process parameters in cutting operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000276561900003"}
