To determine the parameters that affect the required storage size, the storage factor was derived analytically. This factor defines the ratio between the annual throughput of a dry bulk terminal and the required stockyard size. Simulation is required for stockyard dimensioning when including the stochastic variations in the ship interarrival times, ship sizes and bulk material storage times. In addition, operational procedures were investigated that potentially increase the storage capacity. In a case study, the proposed approach was demonstrated by sizing the required stockyard area for a specific import terminal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
