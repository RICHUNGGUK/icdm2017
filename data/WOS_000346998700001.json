This paper presents the integration of SGPS into a sensor network in order to improve the overall accuracy using evolutionary algorithms. Another contribution of the paper is to theoretically solve both global and relative positioning of the sensors composing the network within the same framework without satellite-based GPS technology. Results show that this approach is promising and has potential to be improved further.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms for Sunlight-Based Positioning Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000346998700001"}
