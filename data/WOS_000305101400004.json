These components were derived from K-means-like algorithms and their extensions. With the suggested clustering design architecture, it is possible to reconstruct popular algorithms, but also to build new algorithms by exchanging components from original algorithms and their improvements. In this way, the design of a myriad of representative-based clustering algorithms and their fair comparison and evaluation are possible. In addition to the architecture, we show the usefulness of the proposed approach by providing experimental evaluation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
