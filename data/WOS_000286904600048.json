The proposed AORCMAC has superior capability to the conventional cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) in efficient learning mechanism and dynamic response. In this study, an intelligent backstepping tracking control system is proposed for wheeled inverted pendulums (WIPs) with unknown system dynamics and external disturbance. In this control system, an ABORCMAC is used to copy an ideal backstepping control (IBC), and a compensated controller is designed to compensate for difference between the IBC law and AORCMAC. Moreover, all adaptation laws of the proposed system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, the Taylor linearization technique, so that the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed.
