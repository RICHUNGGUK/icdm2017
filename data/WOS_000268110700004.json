While previous works have mostly focused on producing a high quality quad mesh of a single model, the connectivity of the quadrangulation is typically difficult to control and varies among models even with similar shapes. In this paper, We propose a novel interactive framework for quadrangulating a set of models collectively With compatible connectivity. Furthermore, We demonstrate its application to 3D mesh morphing. In our approach, the user interactively sketches a skeleton Within each model, and our method automatically computes compatible base domains for all models from these skeletons, On Which the models are parameterized. With this novel parameterization, it is very easy to generate a pleasing and smooth 3D morphing sequence among these compatible models. The method yields quadrangulation With comparable quality to existing approaches, but greatly simplifies compatible re-meshing among a group of topologically equivalent models, in particular characters and animals models, With direct applications in shape blending and morphing.
