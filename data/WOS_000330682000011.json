Such a framework can be awkward in handling a situation where a collection of captured fingerprints are not from the enrolled people. This study proposes an unsupervised fingerprint classification mechanism in lieu of the supervised one. Our aim is to partition a collection of unknown fingerprints into clusters, so that each cluster consists of fingerprints from the same finger and the number of generated clusters equals the number of distinct fingers involved in the collection. This mechanism is helpful for criminal investigators to identify fingerprints from the same people, even when the people is not enrolled in the database. The proposed fingerprint clustering system operates by first computing the similarities between fingerprints and then grouping together the fingerprints deem similar to each other using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach. To determine the optimal number of generated clusters, which represents the number of involved distinct fingers, we propose a criterion based on the minimum Rand index. Experiments conducted using FVC2002 database and NIST Special Database-4 show that feasibility of the proposed fingerprint clustering method.", "paper_title": "Blind Clustering of Fingerprints for Database Indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000330682000011"}
