Critical development studies, as a form of social theory and critique, is used as a framework for analysing dominant ideologies of development. The implications of this critique for library development projects are most evident when examining the role of the state in public library development. Specifically, the state's co-optation by dominant classes and interests is a formidable barrier in the development of more democratically focused public libraries that are responsive to the needs of marginalized populations. It is suggested that for a more grassroots democratic vision of public libraries to emerge in India and in other parts of the Third World, a deeper engagement of library issues with social activism and social movements is needed.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Roles of Public Libraries in (Inter)National Development: Lessons from India", "paper_id": "WOS:000273545200006"}
