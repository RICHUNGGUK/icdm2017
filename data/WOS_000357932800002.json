We show that provability in the multiplicative exponential fragment is TOWER-hard already in the affine case-and hence non-elementary. We match this lower bound for the full propositional affine linear logic, proving its TOWER-completeness. We also show that provability in propositional contractive linear logic is ACKERMANN-complete.", "paper_title": "Nonelementary Complexities for Branching VASS, MELL, and Extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000357932800002"}
