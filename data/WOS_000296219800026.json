The procedure is an extension of a hybrid shifting bottleneck procedure with a tabu search algorithm while incorporating various company specific constraints. The various extensions to cope with the company specific constraints have a strong similarity with the complex job shop problem formulation of Mason, Fowler, and Carlyle (2002). The new procedure is used as a simulation engine to test the relevance of various scenarios in order to improve the current planning approach of the company. A detailed computational experiment highlights the main contribution of the novel procedure for the company. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
