SMSP have been widely studied by the researchers. Most of them used mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to solve the problems. With the problem size increasing, the computational effort of MILP increases greatly. Therefore, it is very difficult for MILP to obtain acceptable solutions to large-size problems within reasonable time. To solve large-size problems, the preferred method in industry is the use of scheduling rules. However, due to the constraints in SMSP, the simple rule-based method may not guarantee the feasibility and quality of the solution. In this study, a random search based on heuristic rules was proposed first. Through exploring a set of random solutions, better feasible solutions can be achieved. To improve the quality of the random solutions, a genetic algorithm-based on heuristic rules has been proposed. The heuristic rules play a very important role in cutting down the solution space and reducing the search time. Through comparative study, the proposed method demonstrates promising performance in solving large-size SMSP. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
