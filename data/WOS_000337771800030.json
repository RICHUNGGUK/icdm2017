The procedure is based upon the efficient importance sampling (EIS) approach and exploits the mixture structure of the model via data augmentation when constructing importance sampling distributions as mixtures of distributions. The proposed mixture EIS procedure is illustrated with ML estimation of a Student-t state space model for realized volatilities. MC simulations are used to characterize the sampling distribution of the ML estimator based upon the mixture EIS approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
