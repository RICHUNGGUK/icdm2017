We present a features-preserving filtering algorithm for point set surface and surface attributes. The proposed approach is based on robust statistics, by constructing robust prediction framework for first-order estimation of points and surface attributes. Experiments show that the proposed approach preserves the sharp features and the edges of surface attributes while smoothing point set surface and corresponding attributes.", "paper_title": "A Feature-Preserving Filtering Algorithm for Point Set Surface and Surface Attributes Based on Robust Statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197700011"}
