This will lead to a function p(f) (a, b) for the probability of failure depending on parameters a and b corresponding to the two parameterized density functions. Further the parameters a and b are assumed to be uncertain. Using intervals, sets or random sets to model their uncertainty results in upper probabilities (p) over bar (f) of failure. In this context we also discuss different notions of independence such as strong independence, epistemic irrelevance and random set independence and present a simple engineering example.
