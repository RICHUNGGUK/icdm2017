In the proposed design technique, the characteristic function of the filter is linearized around the displacement of the transmission zeros. A linear system is then obtained and solved in combination with a damping technique used to guarantee the convergence. Design examples which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method are presented and an experimental verification at 4 GHz using open-loop resonators validates the methodology.
