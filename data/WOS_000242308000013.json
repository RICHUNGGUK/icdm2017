While this approach had a significant impact on several practical applications (e.g. speech recognition, biological sequence alignment) it has two major limitations: it requires a known model topology, and learning is only locally optimal. We propose a new PAC framework for learning both the topology and the parameters in partially observable Markov models. Our algorithm learns a Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA) which approximates a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) up to some desired degree of accuracy. We discuss theoretical conditions under which the algorithm produces an optimal solution (in the PAC-sense) and demonstrate promising performance on simple dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "PAC-learning of Markov models with hidden state", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000013"}
