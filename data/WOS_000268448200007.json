The mathematical ingredient of the proposed signal processing technique is the flexible Gabor-wavelet transform or the alpha-transform that reliably detects both high and low frequency components of such complicated short-time signals. We go from the functional treatment of this wavelet-type transform to its numerical implementation and we show how it can be used as an improved tool for spectral investigations compared to the short-time Fourier transform or the classical wavelet transform.", "paper_title": "THE FLEXIBLE GABOR-WAVELET TRANSFORM FOR CAR CRASH SIGNAL ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268448200007"}
