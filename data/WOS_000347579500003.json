However, this promising technique may occasionally confront ill-posed problem, which is a plague ignored by most researchers. In this paper, a regularized GMC(1,N) framework (R-GMC(1,N)) is proposed to estimate the grey coefficients in case there exists potential ill-posed problem. More specifically, we adopt two state-of-the-art regularization methods, i.e. the Tikhonov regularization (TR) and truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), together with two regularization parameters detection methods, i.e. L-curve (LC) and generalized cross-validation (GCV), to identify the stable solutions. Numerical simulations on industrial indicators of China demonstrate that our methods yield more accurate forecast results than the existing GMC(1,N). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
