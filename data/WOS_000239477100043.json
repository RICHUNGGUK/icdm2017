This work is situated in the framework of the deployment of the Aplusix system, a learning environment for algebra. The process has two phases. The first phase is a local diagnosis where a student's transformation of an expression A into an expression B is diagnosed with a sequence of rewriting rules. A library of correct and incorrect rules has been built for that purpose. The second phase uses conceptions for modeling students more globally. Conceptions are attributed to students according to a mechanism using the local diagnoses as input. This modeling process has been applied to data (log files) gathered in France and Brazil with 13-16 years old students who used the Aplusix learning environment. The results are described and discussed.", "paper_title": "Automatic calculation of students' conceptions in elementary algebra from Aplusix log files", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100043"}
