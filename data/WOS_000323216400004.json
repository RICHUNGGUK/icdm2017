This is the entire range of m not covered by previous results. The proof involves determining properties of the core and kernel of random graphs with minimum degree at least 2. The case of 2-edge-connectedness is treated similarly. We also obtain formulae for the number of 2-connected graphs with given degree sequence for most (typical) sequences. Our main result solves a problem of Wright from 1983. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic enumeration of sparse 2-connected graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323216400004"}
