Unlike most other approaches, it simultaneously exploits the structure of the Web graph as well as page contents and features. The method is efficient, scalable, and provides state-of-the-art accuracy on a standard Web spam benchmark.", "paper_title": "Graph regularization methods for Web spam detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000282915500005"}
