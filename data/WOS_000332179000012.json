Compared with the weak physisorption on the pristine BNNT, PCP molecule presents strong chemisorption on the Fe-doped BNNT. The calculated data for the electronic properties indicate that doping Fe atom into the BNNT significantly improves the electronic transport property of BNNT, induces magnetism in the BNNT, and increases its adsorption sensitivity toward PCP molecule. It is suggested that doping BNNTs with Fe is an available strategy for improving the properties of BNNTs, and that Fe-doped BNNT would be a potential resource for adsorbing PCP pollutant in environments.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the adsorption of pentachlorophenol on the pristine and Fe-doped boron nitride nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000332179000012"}
