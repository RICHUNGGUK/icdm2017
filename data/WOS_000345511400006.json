The functional properties of the cost are studied and the necessary conditions for the optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings are derived. An optimization algorithm that imposes these conditions iteratively, in conjunction with the noisy channel relaxation method to mitigate poor local minima, is proposed. The numerical results show strict improvement over prior methods. The numerical approach is extended to the scenario of source-channel coding with decoder side information. The resulting encoding mappings are shown to be continuous relatives of, and in fact subsume as special case, the Wyner-Ziv mappings encountered in digital distributed source coding systems. A well-known result in information theory pertains to the linearity of optimal encoding and decoding mappings in the scalar Gaussian source and channel setting, at all channel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). In this paper, the linearity of optimal coding, beyond the Gaussian source and channel, is considered and the necessary and sufficient condition for linearity of optimal mappings, given a noise (or source) distribution, and a specified a total power constraint are derived. It is shown that the Gaussian source-channel pair is unique in the sense that it is the only source-channel pair for which the optimal mappings are linear at more than one CSNR values. Moreover, the asymptotic linearity of optimal mappings is shown for low CSNR if the channel is Gaussian regardless of the source and, at the other extreme, for high CSNR if the source is Gaussian, regardless of the channel. The extension to the vector settings is also considered where besides the conditions inherited from the scalar case, additional constraints must be satisfied to ensure linearity of the optimal mappings.", "paper_title": "On Zero-Delay Source-Channel Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400006"}
