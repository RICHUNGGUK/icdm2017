We have studied the consistency in random matrices of different sizes. We do not agree with the traditional criterion of accepting matrices due to their inflexibility and because it is too restrictive when the size of the matrix increases. Our system is capable of adapting the acceptance requirements to different scopes and consistency necessities. The advantages of our consistency system are the introduction of adaptability in the acceptance criterion and the simplicity of the index we have used, the eigenvalue (lambda(max)) and the simplicity of the criterion.", "paper_title": "Consistency in the analytic hierarchy process: A new approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239909300005"}
