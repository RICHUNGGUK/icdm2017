The vibration level depends on the force-pressure characteristics of valve systems, which determine the damping force and high-frequency acceleration characteristic of a damper, and which need to be optimally tuned to lower the noise level. The paper considers a model-based approach to obtain the optimal pressure-flow characteristic via simulations conducted with the use of coupled models, including the damper and the servo-hydraulic tester model. The objectives of this work were as follows: (i) develop or adapt a double-tube damper model including pressure-flow valve characteristics; (ii) define key parameters of the valve characteristics influencing the high-frequency piston-rod acceleration, which is considered as a measure of vibration level; (iii) identify the parameter values (trends) minimizing the piston-rod acceleration using two alternative methods, namely a quick-and-dirty method based on a design of experiment (DOE) plan and a nonlinear programming method; (iv) obtain the optimal pressure-flow characteristic minimizing the vibration level by means of simulation; and (v) perform an experimental study comparing the high-frequency content of acceleration produced by the damper assembled with the original and optimized valve system using a laboratory setup.", "paper_title": "Development of an optimization method for minimizing vibrations of a hydraulic damper", "paper_id": "WOS:000324473000004"}
