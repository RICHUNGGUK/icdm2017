A network using OFDM- based spectrum-sliced elastic optical path (SLICE) has a higher spectrum efficiency, due to the fine granularity of subcarrier frequencies used. To minimize the utilized spectrum in SLICE networks, the routing and spectrum allocation problem (RSA) has to be efficiently solved. We have solved the RSA problem using a mixed integer linear programming formulation and have compared our approaches with another recent formulation.", "paper_title": "An optimal and a heuristic algorithm for solving the route and spectrum allocation problem in OFDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361526700011"}
