The first six harmonic current components are identified through the variation analysis of waveform characteristics. The effectiveness of this method is tested by applying it to the model of a single-phase active power filter, dedicated to the selective compensation of harmonic current drained by an AC controller. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
