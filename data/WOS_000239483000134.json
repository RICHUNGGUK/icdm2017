The inverse model of a nonlinear system is achieved by off-line black-box identification according to input and output data. Then parameters of the model are modified online using gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results show that SVM based self-tuning control can be well applied to nonlinear uncertain system. And the SVM based self-tuning control of nonlinear system has good robustness performance in tracking reference input with good generalization ability.", "paper_title": "SVM based nonlinear self-tuning control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000134"}
