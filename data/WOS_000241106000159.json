In this paper, we introduce Conditional Random Fields model to recognize biomedical named entities from biomedical literature. Rich features including literal, context and semantics are involved in Conditional Random Fields model. Shallow syntactic features are first introduced to Conditional Random Fields model and do boundary detection and semantic labeling at the same time, which effectively improve the model's performance. Experiments show that our method can achieve an F-measure of 71.2% in JNLPBA test data and which is better than most of state-of-the-art system.", "paper_title": "Biomedical named entities recognition using conditional random fields model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000159"}
