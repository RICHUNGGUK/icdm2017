Decision-making in times of crisis is complex and usually accompanied by acute time pressure. Environment can change rapidly and decisions may have to be made based on uncertain information. IT-based decision support can systematically help to identify response and recovery measures, especially when time for decision-making is sparse, when numerous options exist, or when events are not completely anticipated. This paper proposes a case- and scenario-based approach to supporting the management of nuclear events in the early and later phases. Important information needed for decision-making as well as approaches to reusing experience from previous events are discussed. This work is embedded in a decision support method to be applied to nuclear emergencies. Suitable management options based on similar historical events and scenarios could possibly be identified to support disaster management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
