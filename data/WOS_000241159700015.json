The key to U-payment is convenience and security in the transfer of financial information. The purpose of this paper is to find a desirable U-payment scheme promoting seamlessness and privacy with a strong personal device and peer-based information transactions. We propose U-SDT(Secure Direct Transfer) Protocol as a way to make transactions seamless, secure and privacy-protected.", "paper_title": "Seamlessness and privacy enhanced ubiquitous payment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241159700015"}
