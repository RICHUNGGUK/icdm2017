Our main result is that we can verify security using only public communication-via parameter estimation of the given untrusted state. The technique applies even to bound-entangled states, thus extending QKD to the regime where the available quantum channel has zero quantum capacity. We also show how to convert our purification-based QKD schemes to prepare/measure schemes.", "paper_title": "Quantum key distribution based on private states: Unconditional security over untrusted channels with zero quantum capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033700016"}
