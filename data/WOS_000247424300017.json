Two five-descriptor models were established to model and predict beta and gamma with R of 0.943 and 0.963, respectively. The stabilities of the proposed models were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation and randomization experiments. The descriptors involved in these models were calculated alone from the chemical structures of chromophores. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
