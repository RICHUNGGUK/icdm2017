For the generation of cell tracks in embryogenesis, so-called tracking-by-assignment methods are flexible approaches. However, as every two-stage approach, they suffer from irrevocable errors propagated from the first stage to the second stage, here from segmentation to tracking. It is therefore desirable to model segmentation and tracking in a joint holistic assignment framework allowing the two stages to maximally benefit from each other. Results: We propose a probabilistic graphical model, which both automatically selects the best segments from a time series of oversegmented images/volumes and links them across time. This is realized by introducing intra-frame and inter-frame constraints between conflicting segmentation and tracking hypotheses while at the same time allowing for cell division. We show the efficiency of our algorithm on a challenging 3D+t cell tracking dataset from Drosophila embryogenesis and on a 2D+t dataset of proliferating cells in a dense population with frequent overlaps. On the latter, we achieve results significantly better than state-of-the-art tracking methods.", "paper_title": "Graphical model for joint segmentation and tracking of multiple dividing cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000352268900020"}
