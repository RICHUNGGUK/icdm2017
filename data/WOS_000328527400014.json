The proposed incremental SVM is fast, as its training phase relies on only a few images and it uses the mathematical properties of SVM to update only the needed parts. In our system, first of all, feature extraction and selection are implemented, based on color and texture features (appearance of the person). Then the incremental SVM classifier is introduced to recognize a person from a set of 20 persons in CASIA Gait Database. The proposed incremental classifier is updated step by step when a new frame including a person is presented. With this technique, we achieved a correct classification rate of 98.46%, knowing only 5% of the dataset at the beginning of the experiment. A comparison with a non-incremental technique reaches recognition rate of 99% on the same database. Extended analyses have been carried out and showed that the proposed method can be adapted to on-line setting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
