Genes affected by a larger number of perturbations were found to be involved in responses to various environmental challenges. Deletion of essential genes was suggested to cause larger number of genes to be significantly up or down regulated. We explored the network structure made up of several sub-networks using core-periphery models to find ancient pathways. Glycolysis and TCA cycle have relatively core positions in the energy-related processes of yeast.", "paper_title": "On the society of genome: Social affiliation network analysis of microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000132"}
