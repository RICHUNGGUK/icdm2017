However, these rule-based systems may suffer the problem of low performance, when there is a large amount of facts data to be matched with the rules. The way of cluster or grid to construct rule engines can flexibly expand system processing capability by increasing cluster scale, and acquire shorter response time. In order to speed up pattern matching in rule engine, a double hash filter approach for alpha network, combined with beta node indexing, is proposed to improve Rete algorithm in this paper. By using fact type node in Rete network, a hash map about 'fact type - fact type node' is built in root node, and hash maps about 'attribute constraint - alpha node' are constructed in fact type nodes. This kind of double hash mechanism can speed up the filtration of facts in alpha network. Meanwhile, hash tables with the indexes calculated through fact objects, are built in memories of beta nodes, to avoid unnecessary iteration in the join operations of beta nodes. In addition, rule engine based on this improved Rete algorithm is applied in the enterprise information systems. The experimental results show that this method can effectively speed up the pattern matching, and significantly decrease the response time of the application systems.", "paper_title": "An Improved Rete Algorithm Based on Double Hash Filter and Node Indexing for Distributed Rule Engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300014"}
