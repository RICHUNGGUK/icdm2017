Because the scarcity of frequency resources and increasing wireless broad-band requirements have become very serious problems worldwide, increasing attention has been focused on time-division duplexing based technology, on which we focus in this article. Time-division synchronous code-division multiple access based and time-division Long Term Evolution based solutions are introduced with appropriate technology analysis. The experimental results of TD-SCDMA-based solutions in the Shanghai maglev high-speed network environment and the simulation results of TD-LTE-based solutions are presented. Finally, to improve performance, we discuss an enhanced solution based on mobile relays with performance evaluation, which is considered as a more comprehensive solution for high-speed railway scenarios.", "paper_title": "TDD-BASED MOBILE COMMUNICATION SOLUTIONS FOR HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY SCENARIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000330229100003"}
