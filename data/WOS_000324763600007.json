The target prior information from PET images was employed to the FMT reconstruction procedure using the iteratively reweighted least-squares method. Numerical simulations and phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that incorporating the PET prior information into the FMT reconstruction can potentially improve the spatial resolution of FMT.", "paper_title": "Fluorescence Tomography Reconstruction With Simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography Priors", "paper_id": "WOS:000324763600007"}
