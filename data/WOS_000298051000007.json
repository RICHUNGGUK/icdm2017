Through the years several researchers modelled and defined creativity focusing to the psychological aspect of the topic. More recent researchers approach creativity as a computerized process by simulating it within creativity support tools (CST). This article supports that usage of context aware recommender system, in creativity support tools and more specifically, collaborative creativity support tools (CCST) can enhance creativity process. In this work we focus on the development of a context awareness recommender system and look into how such a system can be useful for the creativity process, through preliminary evaluation results in regards to its usefulness and usability.", "paper_title": "A Context Aware Recommender System for Creativity Support Tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000298051000007"}
