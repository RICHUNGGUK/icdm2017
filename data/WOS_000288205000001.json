Previous efforts extended the framework by using item response theory (IRT) based trait scores, and by employing an iterative process using group-specific item parameters to account for DIF in the trait scores, analogous to purification approaches used in other DIF detection frameworks. The current investigation advances the technique by developing a computational platform integrating both statistical and IRT procedures into a single program. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation approach was incorporated to derive empirical criteria for various DIF statistics and effect size measures. For purposes of illustration, the procedure was applied to data from a questionnaire of anxiety symptoms for detecting DIF associated with age from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.", "paper_title": "lordif: An R Package fo rDetecting Differential Item Functioning Using Iterative Hybrid Ordinal Logistic Regression/Item Response Theory and Monte Carlo Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000288205000001"}
