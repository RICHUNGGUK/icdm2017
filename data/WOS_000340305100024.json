The framework is integrated and embedded with sequential, interrelated subprocedures and a database for liquefaction-induced damage evaluation that standardizes and both individually and collectively quantifies analytical results. To integrate the current in situ condition of a selected port area, the framework functions as a spatial database system for geotechnical and structural data and as a recipient of automatic transmission of seismic monitoring data. The geotechnical profile correlated with liquefaction potential is compiled into a geotechnical spatial grid built by geostatistical methods. Linked with the geotechnical spatial grid, the processing of site-specific responses is automatically interpreted from previously derived correlations between rock acceleration and maximum acceleration of each soil layer. As a result, the liquefaction severity is determined based on a combined geotechnical spatial grid with seismic load correlation in real-time according to a simplified procedure, allowing calculation of the liquefaction potential index (LPI). To demonstrate practical applications of the framework in estimating the liquefaction hazard in real-time, liquefaction-hazard maps were visualized for two earthquake scenarios, verifying the applicability of the proposed framework.
