Theoretically, microscopic simulation models can be used to evaluate traffic management strategies in real time before a course of action is recommended. However, the problem is that the strategies would have to be evaluated in real time; this might not be computationally feasible for large-scale networks and complex simulation models. To address this problem, two artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms-support vector regression (SVR) and case-based reasoning (CBR)-are presented as alternatives to the simulation models as a decision support tool. Specifically, prototype SVR and CBR decision support tools are developed and used to evaluate the likely impacts of implementing diversion strategies in response to incidents on a highway network in Anderson, South Carolina. The performances of the two prototypes are then evaluated by a comparison of their predictions of traffic conditions with those obtained from VISSIM, a microscopic simulation model. Although the prototype systems' predictions were comparable to those obtained by simulation, their run times were only fractions of the time required by the simulation model. Moreover, SVR performance is superior to that of CBR for most cases considered. The study results provide motivation for consideration of the proposed Al paradigms as potential decision support tools for real-time transportation management applications.", "paper_title": "Applications of artificial intelligence paradigms to decision support in real-time traffic management", "paper_id": "WOS:000245460800011"}
