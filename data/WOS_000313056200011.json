This theorem has been proved for several weights and alphabets, including the original MacWilliams' Equivalence Theorem for the Hamming weight on codes over finite fields. The question remains: What conditions must a weight satisfy so that the Extension Theorem will hold? In this paper we provide an algebraic framework for determining such conditions, generalising the approach taken in Greferath and Honold (Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop in Algebraic and Combinatorial Coding Theory (ACCT-10), pp. 106-111. Zvenigorod, Russia, 2006).", "paper_title": "Characteristics of invariant weights related to code equivalence over rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200011"}
