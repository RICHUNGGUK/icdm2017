An adaptive feedback control scheme is adopted to design controllers for achieving synchronization of a general network with both complex inner and outer couplings. For a network with only complex inner or outer coupling, pinning control and adaptive coupling strength methods are adopted to achieve synchronization under some assumptions. Several synchronization criteria are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONIZATION OF COMPLEX-VARIABLE DYNAMICAL NETWORKS WITH COMPLEX COUPLING", "paper_id": "WOS:000316813000007"}
