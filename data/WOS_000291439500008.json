The proposed WDM local area network offers efficient data delivery and fast fault recovery via establishing four non-overlapping lightpaths for any source-destination pair. First, we describe a torus-based architecture and propose an efficient non-overlapping lightpath setup algorithm: FOLD (Four-way Optimal Disjoint Routing). The algorithm is proved to achieve optimal link utilization. Second, based on the proposed lightpath setup algorithm, a wavelength allocation and reuse (WAR) scheme enforcing wavelength continuity is proposed to minimize the wavelength utilization for all-to-all communication. An analytical calculation on wavelength utilization shows that the proposed WAR performs very close to an ideal wavelength assignment scheme without wavelength continuity being enforced. Lastly, the probabilistic and capacity analysis demonstrates vast reliability improvement via applying the proposed network architecture in terms of network-failure-induced impact on connection reliability and network capacity degradation.", "paper_title": "A Torus-Based 4-Way Fault-Tolerant Backbone Network Architecture for Avionic WDM LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439500008"}
