Among them are random sets, possibility distributions, probability intervals, and the more recent Ferson's p-boxes and Neumaier's clouds, both defined by pairs of possibility distributions. In the companion paper, we have extensively studied a generalized form of p-box and situated it with respect to other models. This paper focuses on the links between clouds and other representations. Generalized p-boxes are shown to be clouds with comonotonic distributions. In general, clouds cannot always be represented by random sets, in fact not even by two-monotone (convex) capacities.
