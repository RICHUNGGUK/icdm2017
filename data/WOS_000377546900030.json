In literature, most of the work is done to improve the error performance of the orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBCs) using feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter. In this letter, we study the performance of non-orthogonal space-time block codes (NOSTBCs) in a 2x1 multiple-input single-output system with diagonal weighting scheme; this scheme utilizes quantized one bit feedback with no delay from the receiver in a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel. The considered NOSTBCs are Golden code and Silver code. Error-tolerant diagonal weighting parameter which improves the pair wise error probability (PEP) of the receiver is derived. The PEP performance of the considered set-up is studied for the complex-valued constellation like quadrature amplitude modulation. Simulation results indicate that similar to OSTBCs, the error performance of the NOSTBCs also improves with the proposed diagonal precoding scheme.", "paper_title": "One Bit Feedback Based Diagonal Precoding for Non-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900030"}
