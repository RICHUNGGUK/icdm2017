Such systems exhibit type I and type II errors. Type I error is classifying a conforming item as non-conforming while type II error is classifying a non-conforming item as conforming. The errors may arise from the measurement system or the inspectors. It is essential to assess the impact of the inspection errors on the optimal parameters and objective functions of process targeting models. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the inspection errors on the optimal parameters and objectives functions values of Duffuaa and El-Ga'aly multi-objectives optimization model recently developed for process targeting (2013a). In order to accomplish the objectives of the paper, Duffuaa and El-Ga'aly multi-objective optimization model is extended by introducing the measurement errors in the inspection system and penalties to mitigate the effect of the errors. The results of the extended model is compared with the previous model and employed to studying the impact of the errors on the values of objective function and the optimal process parameters in a multi-objectives environment. The results indicated that inspection errors have significant impact on the profit and uniformity objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
