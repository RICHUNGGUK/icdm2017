Now that CBR has become a mature and established technology two necessities have become critical: the availability of tools to build CBR systems, and the accumulated practical experience of applying CBR techniques to real-world problems. In this paper we are presenting jCOLIBRI, an object-oriented framework in Java for building CBR systems, that greatly benefits from the reuse of previously developed CBR systems.
