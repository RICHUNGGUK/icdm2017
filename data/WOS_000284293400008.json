With simple surrounding protrusion geometry, the liquid crystal molecules present axially symmetric orientation in each pixel when the voltage is applied and thus exhibit wide-viewing angle characteristics. The electro-optic properties of the TVA cell are simulated by the three-dimensional finite element method, and agree well with the experimental results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
