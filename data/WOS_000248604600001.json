The multiport diagram is an object-oriented model structure described into a general mathematical framework, independently from any computer language. It is shown that usual diagrammatic representations of networks, e.g. block diagrams, signal flow graphs, compartmental networks and bond graphs, are subclasses of the multiport diagram. By bridging the gap between these four network representations, this unified diagram should contribute to facilitate education of networked system modelling in systems and control theories.
