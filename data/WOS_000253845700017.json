The proposed method is based-on transforming the joint motion trajectories using wavelets to extract spatio-temporal features which are then fed as input to a vector quantiser; a self-organising map for classification of walking patterns of individuals with and without pathology. We show that our proposed algorithm is successful in extracting features that successfully discriminate between individuals with and without locomotion impairment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
