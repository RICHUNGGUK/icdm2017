In recent studies, a variety of effective classification algorithms have been developed for SLR. Hence, it has been a common practice in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Language Recognition Evaluations (LREs) to fuse the results from several classification sub-systems to boost the performance of the SLR systems. In this work, we introduce a discriminative performance measure to optimize the performance of the fusion of 7 language classifiers developed as lIR's submission to the 2009 NIST LRE. We present an Error Corrective Fusion (ECF) method in which we iteratively learn the fusion weights to minimize error rate of the fusion system. Experiments conducted on the 2009 NIST LRE corpus demonstrate a significant improvement compared to individual sub-systems. Comparison study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the ECF method.", "paper_title": "Error Corrective Fusion of Classifier Scores for Spoken Language Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900024"}
