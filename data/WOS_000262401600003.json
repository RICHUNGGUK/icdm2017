We show that for N=1 such a definition of shape orientation is consistent with the shape orientation defined by the axis of the least second moment of inertia. For N > 1 this is not the case, and consequently our new method can produce different results. As an additional benefit our approach leads to a new method for computation of the orientation of compound objects.", "paper_title": "An Alternative Approach to Computing Shape Orientation with an Application to Compound Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262401600003"}
