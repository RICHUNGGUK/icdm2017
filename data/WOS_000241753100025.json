SIC can reduce bright speckles and shadows caused by over lighting. BPFF constructs a new virtual face with Bit-Plan information of face images. Generalized PCA is then applied to the virtual faces to achieve face recognition. Experiments show that, the proposed combined method can reduce the sensitivity of face recognition to illuminations using fewer projection vectors than the compared approaches.", "paper_title": "Generalized PCA face recognition by image correction and bit feature fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100025"}
