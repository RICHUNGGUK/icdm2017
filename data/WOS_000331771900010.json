To study this, this paper proposes two sets of topic attributes to examine topic dynamic characteristics: topic continuity and topic popularity. Topic continuity comprises six attributes: steady, concentrating, diluting, sporadic, transforming, and emerging topics; topic popularity comprises three attributes: rising, declining, and fluctuating topics. These attributes are applied to a data set on library and information science publications during the past 11 years (2001-2011). Results show that topics on \"web information retrieval\", \"citation and bibliometrics\", \"system and technology\", and \"health science\" have the highest average popularity; topics on \"h-index\", \"online communities\", \"data preservation\", \"social media\", and \"web analysis\" are increasingly becoming popular in library and information science.
