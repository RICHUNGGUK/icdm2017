The problem has important applications in numerical algebra, in particular in sparse matrix computations. We develop kernelization algorithms for the problem on several classes of sparse graphs. We obtain linear kernels on planar graphs, and kernels of size in graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor and in graphs of bounded degeneracy. As a byproduct of our results, we obtain approximation algorithms with approximation ratios on planar graphs and on H-minor-free graphs. These results significantly improve the previously known kernelization and approximation results for Minimum Fill-in on sparse graphs.", "paper_title": "Minimum Fill-in of Sparse Graphs: Kernelization and Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400001"}
