The number of GPS satellites that we can see changes in measurement and the degree of error is increased between measurement points. Our aim is to reduce the degree of error through the experiment and simulation and, as a result, we have succeeded in reducing error in most of the examples.", "paper_title": "Improvement of accuracy in changing the number of GPS satellites", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400029"}
