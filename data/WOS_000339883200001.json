The basic premise is that many prevalent datasets consist of multiple types of information: graph data to represent the relations between objects and attribute data to characterize the single objects. Analyzing both information types simultaneously can increase the expressiveness of the resulting patterns. Our patterns of interest are sets of objects that are densely connected within the associated graph and as well show high similarity regarding their attributes. As for attribute data it is known that full-space clustering often is futile, we have to analyze the similarity of objects regarding subsets of their attributes. In order to take full advantage of all present information, we combine the paradigms of dense subgraph mining and subspace clustering. For our approach, we face several challenges to achieve a sound combination of the two paradigms. We maximize our twofold clusters according to their density, size, and number of relevant dimensions. The optimization of these three objectives usually is conflicting; thus, we realize a trade-off between these characteristics to obtain meaningful patterns. We develop a redundancy model to confine the clustering to a manageable size by selecting only the most interesting clusters for the result set. We prove the complexity of our clustering model and we particularly focus on the exploration of various pruning strategies to design the efficient algorithm GAMer (Graph & Attribute Miner). In thorough experiments on synthetic and real world data we show that GAMer achieves low runtimes and high clustering qualities. We provide all datasets, measures, executables, and parameter settings on our website http://dme.rwth-aachen.de/gamer.", "paper_title": "GAMer: a synthesis of subspace clustering and dense subgraph mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000339883200001"}
