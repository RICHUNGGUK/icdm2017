We introduce a plan-based knowledge representation that provides a novel framework for infusing the core mechanics of a game with pedagogical content. We describe, in detail, a system that leverages this framework to dynamically adapt a game to individual learners at runtime.", "paper_title": "Annie: Automated Generation of Adaptive Learner Guidance for Fun Serious Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000292541700007"}
