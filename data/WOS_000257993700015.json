The system described presents something new which is the combination of both traditional traffic monitoring systems, that is, monitoring to get information on different traffic parameters and monitoring to detect accidents automatically. Therefore, we present a system in charge of compiling information oil different traffic parameters. It also has a surveillance module for that traffic, which can detect a wide range of the most significant incidents oil a freeway or highway. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
