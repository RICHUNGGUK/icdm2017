The proposed method decomposes a 3D model into multiple parts and simplifies each decomposed part individually. In this process, a 3D model is first converted into a voxel-based shape representation and a rough skeleton is extracted using the thinning operation. Then, a skeleton refinement algorithm is proposed to fine-tune the thinned skeleton and decompose the skeleton into multiple groups. The remaining processing steps include: (1) taking body measurements of each part with PCA transformation and (2) creating the 3D thumbnail by primitive approximation. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed voxel-based scheme outperforms the mesh-based scheme in the sense that the resultant 3D thumbnail can preserve more features when it is greatly simplified.
