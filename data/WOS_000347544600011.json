Smoothing splines are evaluated both with and without sample weights, and are compared with local linear estimator. Simulation studies find that nonparametric estimators perform better when sample weights are incorporated, rather than being treated as if iid. They also find that smoothing splines perform better than local linear estimator through completely data-driven bandwidth selection methods.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric regression estimators in complex surveys", "paper_id": "WOS:000347544600011"}
