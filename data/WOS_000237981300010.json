Since Sesame recognizes separate application and architecture models within a single system simulation, it needs an explicit mapping step to relate these models for cosimulation. The design tradeoffs during the mapping stage, namely, the processing time, power consumption, and architecture cost, are captured by a multiobjective nonlinear mixed integer program. This paper aims at investigating the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on solving large instances of the mapping problem. With two comparative case studies, it is shown that MOEAs provide the designer with a highly accurate set of solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, analyses for different crossover types, mutation usage, and repair strategies for the purpose of constraints handling are carried out. Finally, a number of multiobjective optimization results are simulated for verification.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective optimization and evolutionary algorithms for the application mapping problem in multiprocessor system-on-chip design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237981300010"}
