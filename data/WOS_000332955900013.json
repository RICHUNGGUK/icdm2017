In this paper, new models based on numerical method have been obtained to predict the roll force, the work roll wearing crown and the work roll thermal crown utilizing experimental data provided by Mobarake Steel Complex. Meanwhile, the work roll bending and flattening crown has been obtained from finite element method as well as elasticity approach. Then, a computer programing has been written to obtain the work roll initial crown in order to get desired strip profile. This program is called Initial Crown Prediction Software (ICPS). Finally, the obtained initial crowns from ICPS were applied for different stands of hot strip mill of Mobarake Steel Complex, and the strip profile shows a good agreement with the desired one for the mentioned mill.", "paper_title": "Calculation of work roll initial crown based on desired strip profile in hot rolling", "paper_id": "WOS:000332955900013"}
