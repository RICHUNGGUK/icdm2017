The authors propose a novel reputation propagation technique in composite services. The proposed approach provides a fair distribution of reputation values so that a component service is neither penalised nor awarded for the poor and good performance, respectively, of other peer component services. Experiment results indicate that the proposed technique propagates the \"fair share\" of reputation from the composite service to its component services.", "paper_title": "Reputation Management for Composite Services in Service-Oriented Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797500002"}
