The platform was developed to support the recently derived concept of holistic production control (HPC), which relies on model-based control. The prototype is comprised of a set of off-line and on-line modules. The off-line modules support the definition of key performance indicators (KPIs), the selection of the most influential input (manipulative) variables, and the identification of a simple production model from historical data. The on-line modules enable KPI prediction and suggest actions to the production manager, employing model-based production control and/or optimization techniques. In this way, a new decision-support reasoning based on historical production data can be introduced. ProOpter has a modular design and can be used as an add-on to existing production IT systems since it relies on established industrial communication standards. The use of the platform is validated on the well-known Tennessee Eastman benchmark simulation process and on two industrial case studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
