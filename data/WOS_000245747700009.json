It is found that a single IFN is sufficient for the applications that require a number of neurons in different hidden layers of a conventional neural network. Several benchmark and real-life problems of classification and time-series prediction have been illustrated. It is observed that the inclusion of some more biological phenomenon in an artificial neural network can make it more powerful. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
