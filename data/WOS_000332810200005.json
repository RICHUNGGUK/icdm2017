The model allows for the washout phenomenon: the disappearance of the biomass inside the chemostat. We establish the Fokker-Planck equation associated with this diffusion process, in particular we describe the boundary conditions that modelize the washout. We propose an adapted finite difference scheme for the approximation of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
