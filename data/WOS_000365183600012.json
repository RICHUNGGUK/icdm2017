These mobile phone data represent the practical travel routes of users and imply the intelligence of them in selecting a suitable route. Usually, an experienced user knows which route is congested in a specified period of time but unblocked in another period of time. Moreover, a route used frequently and recently by a user is usually the suitable one to satisfy the user's needs. Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R) is a computational cognitive architecture, which provides a good framework to understand the principles and mechanisms of information organization, retrieval and selection in human memory. In this paper, we employ ACT-R to model the process of selecting a suitable route of users. We propose a cognition-inspired route evaluation method to mine the intelligence of users in selecting a suitable route, evaluate the suitability of the routes, and then recommend an ordered list of routes for subscribers. Experiments show that it is effective and feasible to evaluate the suitability of the routes inspired by cognition.", "paper_title": "Cognition-inspired route evaluation using mobile phone data", "paper_id": "WOS:000365183600012"}
