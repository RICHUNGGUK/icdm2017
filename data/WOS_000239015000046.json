These results extend and improve some known relevant works, e.g. the restrictions to the connection weight matrices are slacker, and it is not required that the activation functions are globally Lipschitzian. Most importantly, these conditions are easy to check and apply. Finally, one example is employed to illustrate the conclusions, and the simulated results show the validity. Particularly, the right assertion about the existence, uniqueness and stability of the almost periodic solution of the specific generalized Hopfield neural networks is given only by our criteria, and the relevant criteria provided by a recent reference fail.
