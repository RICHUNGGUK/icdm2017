The system employs the line-symbol-text vectorization workflow to recognize graphic objects in the order of increasing characteristic complexity and progressively simplify the drawing image by removing recognized objects from it. Various recognition algorithms for basic graphic types have been developed and efficient interactive recognition methods are proposed as complements to automatic processing. Based on dimension recognition and analysis, the system reconstructs the literal dimension for vectorization results, which yields optimized vector data for CAD applications.", "paper_title": "A vectorization system for architecture engineering drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000002"}
