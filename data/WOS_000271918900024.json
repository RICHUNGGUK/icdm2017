In order to make the establishment of these communications simpler, the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology was created; it is very comfortable for the user as communication starts without any further configuration. This property makes the standard well suitable for the use with mobile coupons (mCoupons). Compared to paper based coupons, mCoupons differ significantly by the fact that the unprotected data can be easily copied or modified by anyone without significant costs. A large number of uncontrolled copies of coupons may result in a significant loss for the business. In this paper, a secure mCoupon scheme is proposed which is not only secure but also efficient. The proposed scheme may satisfy all the security requirements needed in the mCoupons system using NFC technology.", "paper_title": "A SECURE MCOUPON SCHEME USING NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900024"}
