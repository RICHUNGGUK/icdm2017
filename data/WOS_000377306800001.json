In this letter the conventional scheduling objective of maximizing rate is augmented by two other objectives, regulating fairness, and stabilization of the stored energy processes of the EHNs. This problem is formulated as a network of energy queues, which represent the batteries. Considering the stochastic nature of the wireless channel and the energy harvesting processes, this letter employs Lyapunov drift plus penalty technique to develop a cross-layer scheduler that operates in a slotted-time and distributed manner. At each epoch it selects an EHN for transmission and computes the transmit power. As an added advantage, the power control algorithm still retains the optimal water-filling solution. Through simulations, the proposed solution is compared against a conventional max-rate scheduler and is shown to better enforce fairness, stabilize the battery levels, and minimize the required battery capacity.", "paper_title": "Fair Scheduling for Energy Harvesting Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800001"}
