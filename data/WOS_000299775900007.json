Specifically, we investigate the mechanism through which a retailer with both Internet and Brick & Mortar retailing channels can use IS/IT to enhance its competitiveness in comparison to single-format retailers by integrating the information from both channels. We provide several example case studies of current industrial practice in this field and conclude with a discussion on the strategic implications of the proposed strategies.", "paper_title": "MIXED STRATEGY MULTIPLE-CHANNEL RETAILING WITH RFID INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000299775900007"}
