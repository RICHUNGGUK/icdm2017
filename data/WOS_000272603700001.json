The associated algorithm uses PID control to adapt parameter stepsize for branch-following strategies Such as those applicable to turning point and bifurcation problems. As representative continuation strategies, incremental Newton, Elder-Newton and pseudo-arclength continuation techniques are considered. Supporting numerical experiments are conducted for finite element simulation of the 'driven cavity' Navier-Stokes benchmark over a range in Reynolds number, the classical Bratu turning point problem over a reaction parameter range, and for coupled fluid flow and heat transfer over a range in Rayleigh number. Computational performance using PID stepsize control in conjunction with inexact Newton-Krylov solution for coupled flow and heat transfer is also examined for a 3D test case.
