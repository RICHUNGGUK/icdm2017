Earlier we treated the cities and the languages differently (and as connected; languages split since cities split, etc.). Hence, two distributions are obtained in the same computation at the same time. The same approach is followed here and Pareto-Zipf law for the distribution of the cities, log-normal for the languages, decreasing exponential for the city families (countries) in the rank order over population, and power law -2 for the language families over the number of languages in rank order are obtained theoretically in this combination for the first time (up to our knowledge) in the literature; all of which are in good agreement with the present empirical data.", "paper_title": "Model of world: Her cities, languages and countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000255842600009"}
