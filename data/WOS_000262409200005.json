We propose cross-layer schemes to solve the joint rate allocation, routing, scheduling, power control and channel assignment problems with the goals of maximizing network throughput and achieving certain fairness. Fairness is addressed using both a simplified max-min fairness model and the well-known proportional fairness model. Our schemes can also offer performance upper bounds such as an upper bound on the maximum throughput. Numerical results show that our proportional fair rate allocation scheme achieves a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer optimization for end-to-end rate allocation in multi-radio wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262409200005"}
