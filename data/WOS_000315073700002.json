Exploratory visualization systems (EVSs) maximize the amount of information users can gain through learning and have been widely used in scientific discovery and decision-making contexts. Although many EVSs have been developed recently, there is a lack of general guidance on how to evaluate such systems. Researchers face challenges such as understanding the cognitive learning process supported by these systems. In this paper, we present a formal user study on Newdle, a clustering-based EVS for Large news collections, shedding light on a general methodology for EVS evaluation. Our approach is built upon cognitive load theory, which takes the user as well as the system as the focus of evaluation. The carefully designed procedures allow us to thoroughly examine the user's cognitive process as well as control the variability among human subjects. Through this study, we analyse how and why clustering-based EVSs benefit (or hinder) users in a variety of information-seeking tasks. We also summarize leverage points for designing clustering-based EVSs.", "paper_title": "Evaluating exploratory visualization systems: A user study on how clustering-based visualization systems support information seeking from large document collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000315073700002"}
