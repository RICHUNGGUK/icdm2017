However, whereas service providers use the protocol to control their own subscribers, they do not widely deploy Kerberos infrastructures to handle subscribers coming from foreign domains, as happens in network federations. Instead, the deployment of Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructures has been preferred for that operation. Thus, the lack of a correct integration between these infrastructures and Kerberos limits the service access only to service provider's subscribers. To avoid this limitation, we design an architecture which integrates a Kerberos pre-authentication mechanism, based on the use of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and advanced authorization, based on the standards SAML and XACML, to link the end user authentication and authorization performed through an AAA infrastructure with the delivery of Kerberos tickets in the service provider's domain. We detail the interfaces, protocols, operation and extensions required for our solution. Moreover, we discuss important aspects such as the implications on existing standards. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
