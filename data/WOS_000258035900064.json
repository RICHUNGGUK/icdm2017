Due to the characteristics, constraints, and security requirements of mobile ad hoc networks, our protocol does not require the aid of any centralized administration and mobile nodes could cooperate with each other to securely facilitate e-voting. Finally, the proposed protocol provides the ability to deniable authentication. When a legal voter casts a vote with this voting system, he/she can deny that he/she has voted for a third party and the third party cannot judge who votes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
