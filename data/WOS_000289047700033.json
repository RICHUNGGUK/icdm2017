This paper presents an approach to deal with fuzzy earned value indices. This includes developing new indices under fuzzy circumstances and evaluating them using alpha cut method. The model improves the applicability of the earned value techniques under real-life and uncertain conditions. A small example illustrates how the new model can be implemented in reality.
