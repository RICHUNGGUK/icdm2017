The proposed scheme employs forward error correction (FEC) across packets to cope with the unreliable situations of the channel. To optimally allocate FEC codes for the different partitions packets of the different frames in one group of pictures (GOP), the overall expected distortion over one GOP is developed as the performance metric to guide the optimization process. In addition, a low-complexity FEC allocation algorithm is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the other loss protection schemes, the proposed scheme achieves better reconstructed video quality.", "paper_title": "Unequal Loss Protection for H.264/AVC Video Streaming Over Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348998900001"}
