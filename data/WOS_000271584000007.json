In text mining, the documents are most often represented by feature vectors of very high dimensions, requiring dimensionality reduction to obtain visual projections in two- or three-dimensional space. Correspondence analysis is an unsupervised approach that allows for construction of low-dimensional projection space with simultaneous placement of both documents and features, making it ideal for explorative analysis in text mining. Its present use, however, has been limited to word-based features. In this paper, we investigate how this particular document representation compares to the representation with letter n-grams and word n-grams, and find that these alternative representations yield better results in separating documents of different class. We perform our experimental analysis on a bilingual Croatian-English parallel corpus, allowing us to additionally explore the impact of features in different languages on the quality of visualizations.", "paper_title": "Textual features for corpus visualization using correspondence analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271584000007"}
