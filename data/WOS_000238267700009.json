This paper describes the design of a new 8-path pseudo switched-capacitor LC bandpass filter and its command circuit made up by a ring voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with 'XOR' gates. The proposed architecture presents the possibility of tuning over a frequency broadband allowing to sweep different channels with a high quality factor. This circuit is intended to replace the surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters in broadband wireless applications. Experimental results carried out on a prototype show quality factors up to 200, and a tunable center frequency range of 300 MHz [250-550 MHz].", "paper_title": "New high-Q discrete-time LC bandpass filter design with center frequency broadband tuning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238267700009"}
