We propose two techniques for reducing the settling time of an ADPLL, i.e. the oscillator tuning word (OTW) presetting technique and counter-based mode switching controller (CB-MSC). In the first technique, the OTW is preset in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) calibration mode (P-mode), which leads to the digitally controlled oscillator being initialized with a frequency closer to the target. In the second technique, the CB-MSC is used to shorten the mode switching time. A prototype 1.9 GHz ADPLL with a 13 MHz reference is implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Measurements show that the proposed techniques reduce the settling time by about 33 %. The proposed ADPLL settles within 130 reference cycles and presents a phase noise of -116 dBc/Hz@1 MHz.", "paper_title": "A 1.9 GHz ADPLL with 130 reference cycles settling time in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500008"}
