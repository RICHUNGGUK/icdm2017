It is becoming a promising platform for embedded and mobile applications. Since the embedded and mobile devices are usually battery-powered, improving battery lifetime becomes one of the primary design issues in using CGRAs. In this paper, we propose a battery-aware task-mapping method to optimize energy consumption and improve battery lifetime. The proposed method mainly addresses two problems: task partitioning and task scheduling when mapping applications onto CGRA. The task partitioning and scheduling are formulated as a joint optimization problem of minimizing the energy consumption. The nonlinear effects of real battery are taken into account in problem formulation. Using the insights from the problem formulation, we design the task-mapping algorithm. We have used several real-world benchmarks to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show that our method can dramatically lower the energy consumption and prolong the battery-life.", "paper_title": "Battery-Aware Task Mapping for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300003"}
