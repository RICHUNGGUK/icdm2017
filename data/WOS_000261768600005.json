They often utilize stateless greedy forwarding and require the use of recovery algorithms when the greedy approach fails. We propose a novel idea based on virtual repositioning of nodes that allows to increase the efficiency of greedy routing and significantly increase the success of the recovery algorithm based on local information alone. We explain the problem of predicting dead ends, which the greedy algorithm may reach and bypassing voids in the network, and introduce Node Elevation Ad hoc Routing (NEAR), a solution that incorporates both virtual positioning and routing algorithms that improve performance in ad hoc networks containing voids. We demonstrate by simulations the advantages of our algorithm over other geographic ad hoc routing solutions.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Recovery State in Geographic Ad Hoc Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000261768600005"}
