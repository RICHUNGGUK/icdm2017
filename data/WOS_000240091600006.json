In this paper, we address three fundamental problems in the area of biologically weighted sequences: (i) computation of repetitions, (ii) pattern matching, and (iii) computation of regularities. Our algorithms can be used as basic building blocks for more sophisticated algorithms applied on weighted sequences.", "paper_title": "Computation of repetitions and regularities of biologically weighted sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091600006"}
