This is a generalisation of our previous work on harmonic and biharmonic Bezier surfaces whereby we studied the Bezier solutions for Laplace and the standard biharmonic equation, respectively. Here we study the Bezier solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation associated with the most general quadratic functional. We show that there is a large class of fourth-order operators for which Bezier solutions exist and hence we show that such operators can be utilised to generate Bezier surfaces from the boundary information. As part of this work we present a general method for generating these Bezier surfaces. Furthermore, we show that some of the existing techniques for boundary based surface design, such as Coons patches and Bloor-Wilson PDE method, are indeed particular cases of the generalised framework we present here.
