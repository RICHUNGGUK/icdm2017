The key idea is to incorporate the global search capability of the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) into the HNN, which typically has a powerful local search capability and fast operation. On account of this property of the EDA, our proposed algorithm also exhibits a powerful global search capability. In addition, the possible infeasible solutions generated during the re-sampling period of the EDA are eliminated by the HNN. Therefore, the merits of both these methods are combined in a unified framework. The proposed model is tested on a numerical example, the max-cut problem. The new and optimized model yielded a better performance than certain traditional intelligent optimization methods, such as HNN, genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed mutation Hopfield neural network (MHNN) is also used to solve a practical problem, aircraft landing scheduling (ALS). Compared with first-come-first-served sequence, MHNN sequence reduces both total landing time and total delay. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
