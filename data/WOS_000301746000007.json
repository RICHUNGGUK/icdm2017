In the literature, various WLAN multicast protocols have been proposed in order to overcome these problems. Existing multicast protocols, however, are not so efficient when they are used combining with the frame aggregation scheme of IEEE 802.11n. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC-level multicast protocol for IEEE 802.11n, named Reliable and Efficient Multicast Protocol (REMP). To enhance the reliability and efficiency of multicast services in IEEE 802.11n WLANs, REMP enables selective retransmissions for erroneous multicast frames and efficient adjustments of the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). In addition, we propose an extension of REMP, named scalable REMP (S-REMP), for efficient delivery of scalable video over IEEE 802.11n WLANs. In S-REMP, different MCSs are assigned to different layers of scalable video to guarantee the minimal video quality to all users while providing a higher video quality to users exhibiting better channel conditions. Our simulation results show that REMP outperforms existing multicast protocols for normal multicast traffic and S-REMP offers improved performance for scalable video streaming.", "paper_title": "Design of Efficient Multicast Protocol for IEEE 802.11n WLANs and Cross-Layer Optimization for Scalable Video Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000301746000007"}
