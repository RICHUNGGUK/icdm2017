However, privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. To resolve this challenging problem, data owners must design a solution that meets privacy requirements and guarantees valid data clustering results. To achieve this dual goal, we introduce a new method for privacy-preserving clustering called Dimensionality Reduction-Based Transformation (DRBT). This method relies on the intuition behind random projection to protect the underlying attribute values subjected to cluster analysis. The major features of this method are: (a) it is independent of distance-based clustering algorithms; (b) it has a sound mathematical foundation; and (c) it does not require CPU-intensive operations. We show analytically and empirically that transforming a data set using DRBT, a data owner can achieve privacy preservation and get accurate clustering with a little overhead of communication cost.
