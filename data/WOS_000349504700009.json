It not only provides an efficient method for generating the desired projection profiles for matching, it also enables us to determine the rotation angle, and is invariant to scale changes. Compared to other model-based methods, the proposed spiral projection model (SPM) provides the structural and statistical information about the template in a more general and easier to comprehend format. The SPM is a model-based texture-description scheme that enables the simultaneous representation for each value of projection profile. The profile, a set of parametric projection values functions by angular indexing, is the aggregate from a group of spiral sampling pixels. The experimental evaluation shows that the properties of the algorithm achieved very attractive results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
