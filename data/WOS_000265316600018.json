The C2IEDM/JC3IEDM (Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model) ensures the interconnection of Command and Control Information Systems (C2ISs) throughout all levels, from the corps down to the lower ranks. The usability of C2ISs highly correlates with the capacities of data information carriers, and the need is growing for greater capacity and reliability of transmission media and cryptographic message security. Simulation of tactical networks is an important task in planning military missions. Such methodologies assure a higher probability of success during critical tactical operations. This article focuses on a new radio network modeling method for the C2IS. which is verified by the OPNET simulation environment. This modeling method can be used in tactical radio network planning and optimization processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
