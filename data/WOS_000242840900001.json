The above problem is addressed under a convex programming approach. Indeed, the fundamental tool in the analysis is an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities) characterization of output feedback compensators that stochastically stabilize the closed loop system and ensure H(infinity) performances. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Output feedback H(infinity) control of a class of stochastic hybrid systems with Wiener process via convex analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242840900001"}
