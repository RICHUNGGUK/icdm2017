Design/methodology/approach - A computational approach based on the finite integration technique and computed magnetic energy is developed to extract parasitic inductances. The finite integration analysis is conducted via the magnetoquasistatic solver of CST EM Studio(R) capturing the 3D geometrical effects of the design, as well as the skin and proximity effects, Findings - The method is applied successfully to evaluate the leakage inductances of two printed circuit boards structures; a backplane sample for the verification purpose and a real DC bus employed in a three-phase pulse width modulation inverter. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates that the method calculates the loop inductances accurately. It does not, however, verify the used technique to split loop inductances into partial inductances. Practical implications - The extraction method is easy-to-use and able to handle complex geometries within acceptable computation time and accuracy. Originality/value - The paper introduces a way to compute the parasitic inductances from the results of a numerical electromagnetic field solver.", "paper_title": "Extraction of DC busbar parasitics in PWM inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000269323700020"}
