The lateral migration properties of the cells in Poiseuille flows have been investigated. The simulation results show that the rate of migration toward the center of the channel depends on the swelling ratio and the deformability of the cells. We have also combined the above methodology with a fictitious domain method to study the motion of RBCs in a two-dimensional micro-channel with a constriction with an application to blood plasma separation.
