The priced timed automaton is used to model the running behaviors of the cloud computing system. After introducing the matching matrix of cloud tasks and cloud resources as well as the power matrix of the running states of cloud servers, we design a generation algorithm for the cloud system automaton based on the generation rules and reduction rules given ahead. Then, we propose another algorithm to settle the minimum path energy consumption problem in the cloud system automaton, therefore obtaining an energy optimal solution and an energy optimal value for the cloud system. A case study and repeated experimental analyses manifest that our method is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "Using priced timed automaton to analyse the energy consumption in cloud computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400015"}
