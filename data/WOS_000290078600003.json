It is related to properties of cortical gamma oscillations as expressed with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis. The rhythm dominating among excitatory units is imprinted on the inhibitory units through columnar couplings. Excitatory units that participate in the dominating rhythm may escape the feedback from the inhibitory pool through being active in the time windows given by the minima of the inhibitory effect. The activity of other units is suppressed. Constituting an excitatory rhythm that is compatible with the inhibitory one, the participating units comprise the winning patterns. This windowing mechanism is specified through giving an oscillatory network model and demonstrating it with image processing examples. Thereby, we also provide a gradient system formulation for inhibitory generation of synchrony. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
