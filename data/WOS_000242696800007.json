Chemical shifts (CS) in alkanes for carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) were well correlated with a set of novel molecular graph indices, called the rooted path vector of various lengths, as several multivariate regression equations as following: CS = 3.022 + 5.336P(1) + 7.356P(2) - 1.648P(3) + 0.83859P(4) + 0.21 OP5 - 0.138P(6) - 0.506P(7) + 2.486P(8) - 1.669P(9); n = 402, m = 9, R = 0.944 R-CV = 0.9413 S.D. = 3.333, F = 358.343, U = 35833.211, Q = 4355.422 for all types (primary, secondly, tertiary, quaternary as well as methane) of carbon atoms CS = 0.983 + 6.811P(1) + 7.584P(2) - 2.029P(3) + 0-809P(4) + 0.106P(5) + 0.043P(6) - 0.124P(7) + 1.715P(8) - 1.101P(9); n = 374; m = 9; R = 0.975, R-CV = 0.9737, S.D. = 2.303, F = 773.3721 U = 36912.109, Q = 1930.363 for primary, secondly, tertiary (including methane) carbon atoms; and CS = 27.819 + 2.351P(2) + 0.549P(3) - 0.440P(4) + 0.170P(5) - 0.050P(6); n = 27, m = 5.

Quite good estimation and prediction results were obtained from the quantitative molecular modeling and the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR) equations were tested to work well through cross-validation (CV) with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure.
