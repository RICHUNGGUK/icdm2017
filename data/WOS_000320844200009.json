We show how regularity properties of the mappings and are able to guarantee that every sequence generated by the method is convergent either q-linearly, q-superlinearly, or q-quadratically, according to the particular assumptions. We also show there are circumstances in which at least one convergence sequence is sure to be generated. As a byproduct, we obtain convergence results about inexact Newton methods for solving equations, variational inequalities and nonlinear programming problems.", "paper_title": "Convergence of inexact Newton methods for generalized equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000320844200009"}
