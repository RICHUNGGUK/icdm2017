Using a compartmental model, we derive the system parameters or network conditions under which the P2P network may reach a malware free equilibrium. The model also evaluates the effect of control strategies like node quarantine on stifling the spread of malware. The model is then extended to consider the impact of P2P networks on the malware spread in networks of smart cell phones.", "paper_title": "Dynamics of Malware Spread in Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290585300011"}
