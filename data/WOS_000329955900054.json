By preprocessing using semi-fuzzy kernel clustering algorithm, original samples are divided into two subsets: deterministic samples and fuzzy samples. Only the fuzzy samples, rather than all original ones, require expert judgment to decide their categories and are selected as training samples to accomplish SVDD specification. Therefore, the samples preprocessing method can not only decrease experts working strength, but also achieve less computational consumption and better performance of the classifier. Nevertheless, in order to accomplish practical decision making, another condition has to be met: good explanations to the decision. A rule extraction method based on cooperative coevolution algorithm (CCEA), is introduced to achieve the target. To validate the proposed methodology, samples from real world were employed for experiments, with results compared with conventional multi-classification support vector machine approaches and other artificial intelligence techniques. Moreover, in terms of rule extraction, experiments on key parameters, different methods including decompositional and pedagogical ones etc. were also conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
