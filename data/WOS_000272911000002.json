The model can include known predictor information in the form of a regression term, and can represent additional structure via sender-specific and receiver-specific latent factors. This approach allows for the graphical description of a social network via the latent factors of the nodes, and provides a framework for the prediction of missing links in network data.", "paper_title": "Multiplicative latent factor models for description and prediction of social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272911000002"}
