This approach enables identifying multiple global optima and multiple discontinuous Pareto set solutions of the optimization problem in a compact search space. After evaluating the algorithm with test functions, we apply our method to the identification of the parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of a genetic regulatory mechanism during Drosophila early development, our simulations being in agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons with a multi-objective version of the CMA-ES (MO-CMA-ES) on this dataset show that our algorithm outperforms largely the speed of convergence of MO-CMA-ES. We have identified an infinite number of accurate solutions of the model equations, associated with the Pareto set of the optimization problem. This non-unicity property of a biological developmental process explains phenotypic plasticity and resilience in biological systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
