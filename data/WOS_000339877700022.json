As the number of collaborators with a large number of disparate access devices increases in ubiquitous collaboration environment, the difficulties for protecting secured resources from unauthorized users as well as unsecured access devices will increase since the resources can be compromised by inadequately secured human and devices. Therfore, authentication mechanism for access of legitimate participants is essential in ubiquitous collaboration environment. In this paper we present an efficient authentication mechanism in ubiquitous collaboration environment. We show that proposed scheme is secure through security analysis and is efficient through the experimental results obtained from the practical evaluation of the scheme in ubiquitous collaboration environment.", "paper_title": "An effective authentication mechanism for ubiquitous collaboration in heterogeneous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700022"}
