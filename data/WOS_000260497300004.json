The system consists of two primary units, one standby unit, and one repair facility which is activated when switching to standby fails. Times to failure and times to repair of the operating units are assumed to follow exponential distributions. When time to failure and time to repair have uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean time to system failure and steady-state availability. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the results derived in this paper.", "paper_title": "On a redundant repairable system with switching failure: Bayesian approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000260497300004"}
