Then the W-2,W-1-seminorm estimates for the regularized derivative Green's function and the discrete derivative Green's function are derived. Finally, we show the applications of the W-2,W-1-seminorm estimate for the discrete derivative Green's function in finite element (FE) superconvergence.", "paper_title": "An Estimate for the Four-Dimensional Discrete Derivative Green's Function and Its Applications in FE Superconvergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559300007"}
