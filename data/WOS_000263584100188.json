We propose a procedure to protect the privacy of data by adding noisy items to each transaction. Then, an algorithm is proposed to reconstruct frequent itemsets from these noise-added transactions. The experimental results indicate that this method can achieve a rather high level of accuracy. Our method utilizes existing algorithms for frequent itemset mining, and thereby takes full advantage of their progress to mine frequent itemset efficiently. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
