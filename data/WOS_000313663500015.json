In this article, we compare popular sizing techniques in which gates are chosen from a discrete standard cell library and slew and interconnect effects are accounted for. The difference between sizing methods reduces from roughly 53% to 8% between best and worst case after slew propagation is taken into account. In our benchmarks, no one sizing technique consistently outperforms the others.", "paper_title": "Discrete Sizing for Leakage Power Optimization in Physical Design: A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000313663500015"}
