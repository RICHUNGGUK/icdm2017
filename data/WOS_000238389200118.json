Its main assumptions are the existence of random point flaws and a fracture mechanism based on the larger net force. For the 4-ary fragment size distribution it was obtained a power law with exponent 1.0 <= beta <= 1.15. The visualizations of the model resemble brittle material fragmentation.", "paper_title": "Large-scale simulations of a bi-dimensional n-ary fragmentation model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200118"}
