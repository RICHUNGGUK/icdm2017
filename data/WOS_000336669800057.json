In order to realize the full sharing, free circulation, on-demand use, and optimal allocation of various manufacturing resources and capabilities, the applications of the technologies of IoT and CC in manufacturing are investigated in this paper first. Then, a CC-and IoT-based cloud manufacturing (CMfg) service system (i.e., CCIoT-CMfg) and its architecture are proposed, and the relationship among CMfg, IoT, and CC is analyzed. The technology system for realizing the CCIoT-CMfg is established. Finally, the advantages, challenges, and future works for the application and implementation of CCIoT-CMfg are discussed.", "paper_title": "CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud Computing and Internet of Things-Based Cloud Manufacturing Service System", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800057"}
