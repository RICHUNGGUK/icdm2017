Due to the enormous volumes of such data, statistical process monitoring tools, such as those traditionally used on data in the product manufacturing arena, are inadequate. \"Exotic\" data may indicate a potential attack; detecting such data requires a characterization of \"typical\" data. We devise some new graphical displays, including a \"skyline plot,\" that permit ready visual identification of unusual Internet traffic patterns in \"streaming\" data, and use appropriate statistical measures to help identify potential cyberattacks. These methods are illustrated on a moderate-sized data set (135,605 records) collected at George Mason University. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
