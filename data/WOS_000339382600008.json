Using Hilbert's method we show that for any integers d and r such that 4 <= r <= 2d(2) - 2d, there is a non-singular hyperbolic curve of degree 2d in R-2 with exactly r line segments in the boundary of its convex hull. We also give a complete classification of possible distributions of inflection points among the ovals of a maximally inflected non-singular hyperbolic curve of degree 6.", "paper_title": "On Maximally Inflected Hyperbolic Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000339382600008"}
