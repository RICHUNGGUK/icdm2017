Although the content of a Web site is usually organized with an inherent structure like a topic hierarchy, which is a directed tree rooted at a Web site's homepage whose vertices and edges correspond to Web pages and hyperlinks, such a topic hierarchy is not always available to the user. In this work, we studied the problem of automatic generation of Web sites' topic hierarchies. We modeled a Web site's link structure as a weighted directed graph and proposed methods for estimating edge weights based on eight types of features and three learning algorithms, namely decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression. Three graph algorithms, namely breadth-first search, shortest-path search, and directed minimum-spanning tree, were adapted to generate the topic hierarchy based on the graph model. We have tested the model and algorithms on real Web sites. It is found that the directed minimum-spanning tree algorithm with the decision tree as the weight learning algorithm achieves the highest performance with an average accuracy of 91.9%.", "paper_title": "Web Site Topic-Hierarchy Generation Based on Link Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000263935100006"}
