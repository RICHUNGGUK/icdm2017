We further obtain the quad dominant mesh by dropping the not-aligned diagonal edges from the triangle mesh. A post-processing stage is introduced to further improve the results. The major advantage of our algorithm is its conceptual simplicity since it is merely based on elementary mesh operations such its edge collapse, flip, and split. Various results are presented in the paper; they show a good alignment to surface features and rather uniform distribution of mesh vertices. This makes them well suited, e.g., its Catmull-Clark Subdivision control meshes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
