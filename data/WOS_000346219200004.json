Elon reduces the transferred code size significantly by introducing the concept of replaceable component. It avoids the cost of hardware reboot with a novel software reboot mechanism. Moreover, it significantly prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime (i.e., the time period during which the sensor nodes can be reprogrammed) by avoiding flash writes for TelosB nodes. Experimental results show that Elon transfers up to 120-389 times less information than Deluge, and 18-42 times less information than Stream. The software reboot mechanism that Elon applies reduces the rebooting cost by 50.4%-53.87% in terms of beacon packets, and 56.83% in terms of unsynchronized nodes. In addition, Elon prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime by a factor of 3.3.", "paper_title": "Elon: Enabling Efficient and Long-Term Reprogramming for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000346219200004"}
