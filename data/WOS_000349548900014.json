Current multi-domain networking techniques mainly rely on the path-computing element, while SDN has shown considerable potential for this inevitable issue. The first field demonstration of multi-domain software-defined transport networking (SDTN) without global topology information is detailed in this paper. A multi-controller collaboration framework and three schemes, a controller-driven scheme (ConDS), a cloud-driven scheme (ClDS), and a ClDS with dynamic optimization (ClDS-DO), for datacenter interconnection based on SDTN are demonstrated via field networks. We also extend the OpenFlow protocol and design the Java-Script Object Notation application programming interface to support this framework. Multi-domain lightpaths are automatically provided with limited signaling latency. The blocking performances of the proposed schemes are estimated, and the ClDS-DO has the best performance approaching the optimal boundary.", "paper_title": "Field Demonstration of Multi-Domain Software-Defined Transport Networking With Multi-Controller Collaboration for Data Center Interconnection", "paper_id": "WOS:000349548900014"}
