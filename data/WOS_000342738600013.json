So far, two forms of multivariate generalizations of the problem have been considered in the context of crypt-analysis. The first is simultaneous modular univariate linear equations, whose polynomial time algorithm was proposed at ANTS 2012 by Cohn and Heninger. The second is modular multivariate linear equations, whose polynomial time algorithm was proposed at Asiacrypt 2008 by Herrmann and May. Both algorithms cover Howgrave-Graham's algorithm for univariate cases. On the other hand, both multivariate problems also become identical to Howgrave-Graham's problem in the asymptotic cases of root bounds. However, former algorithms do not cover Howgrave-Graham's algorithm in such cases. In this paper, we introduce the strategy for natural algorithm constructions that take into account the sizes of the root bounds. We work out the selection of polynomials in constructing lattices. Our algorithms are superior to all known attacks that solve the multivariate equations and can generalize to the case of arbitrary number of variables. Our algorithms achieve better cryptanalytic bounds for some applications that relate to RSA cryptosystems.", "paper_title": "Better Lattice Constructions for Solving Multivariate Linear Equations Modulo Unknown Divisors", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738600013"}
