A key issue of the present method is the immersed free surface model proposed by the authors, which enables us to estimate accurately and efficiently capillary forces exerted on particles on a free surface. Using the immersed free surface model along with immersed boundary method and level set method, the present method leads to a three-way coupling of the fluid flow, the free surface motion and the particle motion. In addition, the present method includes a way of curvature estimation using virtual grid differencing to calculate accurately a surface tension. The way of curvature estimation is quantitatively validated through the simulation of a still droplet. The immersed free surface model is quantitatively validated through the simulation of a sphere moving across a free surface and the simulation of two spheres moving along a free surface. Finally, simulations of drying colloidal suspension containing 130 particles are performed to demonstrate the applicability of the present method to actual systems. (C) 2014 The Authors.
