The initial beliefs are modeled by a set of two-bit words that grow, update, and generate other beliefs as the different experiences of the dynamic context appear. Reason is presented as an emergent effect of the experience on the beliefs. The system presents a layered structure that allows a functional organization of the belief system. Our approach seems suitable to model different ways of thinking and to apply to different realistic scenarios such as ideologies.", "paper_title": "A Belief System's Organization Based on a Computational Model of the Dynamic Context: First Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000357406400006"}
