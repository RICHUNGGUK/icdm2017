The computations are conducted on a single node multi graphic processing unit (GPU) system, consisting of three nVIDIA M2070 devices using OpenMP. Results show that transition takes place between 1750 Re-cr < 1950, for cubic cavity and 1100 < Re-cr < 1450, for deep cavity flows with aspect ratio 2 and 3. This indicates that an increase of the depth-width aspect ratio would induce the transition at lower Reynolds number and is consistent with the previous results for two-dimensional cavities, though the critical Reynolds number is approximately 75% lower for three dimensional cavity.
