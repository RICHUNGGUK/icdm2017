An initial detection is performed by a fuzzy possibilistic clustering technique and morphological operations, while a deformable model is used to achieve a precise segmentation. This method has been successfully applied on five 3D images with tumors of different sizes and different locations, showing that the combination of region-based and contour-based methods improves the segmentation of brain tumors.", "paper_title": "3D brain tumor segmentation using fuzzy classification and deformable models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400039"}
