New services have emphasized the limits of the current Internet and motivated the development of the Future Internet. Future communication infrastructures intend to be more distributed and, ideally, more secure, resulting in high complexity. Further, as new technologies emerge, new requirements and security issues are highlighted. These issues reinforce the importance of Identity Management systems for the network infrastructure in the Future Internet, termed Future Network, to provide adequate dynamic services in relation to user's personal data and requirements. Hence, this survey presents the state of the art of Identity Management systems for the Future Network. It highlights the existing architectures, specific devices applied, challenges and future perspectives.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Identity Management for the Future Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000318893100012"}
