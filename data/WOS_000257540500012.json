In this protocol, the maximally and non-maximally entangled bipartite d-dimension states are used as the quantum channels, respectively. The first stage of the protocol requires usual teleportation. In the second stage of the protocol, with the assistance (two-qudit projective measurement) of the preparer, the perfect copy of an original unknown state can be produced.", "paper_title": "Scheme for implementing assisted cloning of an unknown bipartite d-dimension equatorial entangled state", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500012"}
