In this article, a new generic hybrid control architecture called ORCA (dynamic Architecture for an Optimized and Reactive Control) is first proposed. This hybrid architecture is able to dynamically and partially switch between a hierarchical predictive architecture and a heterarchical reactive architecture, if an event forbidding the planned behavior to be followed occurs. In this article, this architecture was applied to a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) problem and denoted ORCA-FMS. ORCA-FMS was tested on an existing manufacturing cell with simulations and real experiments to prove the applicability and the effectiveness of this kind of hybrid architecture in an industrial environment.
