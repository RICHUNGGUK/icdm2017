This problem seeks for a systematic decision aid mechanism which could be adopted into the official recruitment procedures of academic administrations. Hence, this paper proposes fuzzy integrated multi-stages evaluation model (FIMEM) under multiple criteria in order to manage the academic personnel selection and development processes in Maritime Education and Training (MET) institutions. The diversity of evaluation attributes requires making an assessment via both fuzzy and crisp values. Moreover, performing SWOT analysis over the initial outcomes adds development strategy capability towards the assigned academic personnel. Consequently, this paper has suggested utilization of FIMEM as a recruitment toolkit in MET institutions in order to prevent the probable conflicts and manipulations in evaluation process of candidates for different academic positions.
