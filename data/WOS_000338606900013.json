However, image segmentation of the tooth from CBCT is more complex than from MSCT due to lower bone signal-to-noise. This paper describes a level-set method to extract tooth shape from CBCT images of the head. We improve the variational level set framework with three novel energy terms: (1) dual intensity distribution models to represent the two regions inside and outside the tooth; (2) a robust shape prior to impose a shape constraint on the contour evolution; and (3) using the thickness of the tooth dentine wall as a constraint to avoid leakage and shrinkage problems in the segmentation process. The proposed method was compared with several existing methods and was shown to give improved segmentation accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
