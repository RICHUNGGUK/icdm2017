Only a subset of scan flip-flops are activated to shift test data or capture test responses in any clock cycle. This can effectively reduce the capture test power and peak test power. Two routing-driven schemes are proposed to reduce the routing overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed scan architecture can effectively reduce peak test power, capture power, test data volume, and test application cost.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Scan Testing for Test Data Compression Using a Routing-Driven Scan Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000016"}
