The notions of input-to-state stability and finite L-2-gain of non-linear systems are introduced and exploited to investigate the robustness properties of this predictive controller under the state and input constraints and the disturbance. Moreover, this robustness of the controller is extended to the case of suboptimality of the solution. With its feasibility at initial time, the feasibility of the online optimisation problem is guaranteed for all times in the presence of disturbances and constraints. Finally, an example is employed to illustrate the proposed results.", "paper_title": "On robustness of constrained non-linear H-infinity predictive controllers with disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000273829100006"}
