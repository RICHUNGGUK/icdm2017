However, making a network device green can cause performance deterioration. The target of this paper is to propose a cross-layer approach for the design of a mobile video cloud for the uplink transmission towards the Internet. The proposed approach is adaptive in both the video sources and the wireless transmitter. A source Rate Controller is applied to compensate transmission bandwidth reduction due to the energy saving policies. Energy saving in wireless transmission on the mobile cloud cellular channel is achieved by introducing an energy-efficient ARQ protocol. This protocol can apply different transmission laws, in order to exploit the correlation of the cellular channel behavior. An analytical model of the system is defined to compare the transmission laws, and provide some design guidelines to choose one of them and design its parameters.", "paper_title": "A Model-Assisted Cross-Layer Design of an Energy-Efficient Mobile Video Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000345571300019"}
