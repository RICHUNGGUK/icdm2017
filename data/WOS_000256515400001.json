The first class of molecular descriptors, denoted as SpAD(M,w), is defined in terms of the absolute deviations of the eigenvalues and is a generalization of the concept of graph energy proposed by I. Gutman [1]. The second class, denoted as SpMAD(M,w), is defined in terms of mean absolute deviations of the eigenvalues and, unlike the first class, is size-independent. Some simple QSPR models were calculated, showing an encouraging capability of these descriptors to model physico-chemical properties of compounds.", "paper_title": "New spectral indices for molecule description", "paper_id": "WOS:000256515400001"}
