This study aims to propose a new model to provide a simple approach to assess enterprise systems in business intelligence aspects. This approach also helps the decision-maker to select the enterprise system which has suitable intelligence to support managers' decisional tasks. Using wide literature review, 34 criteria about business intelligence specifications are determined. A model that exploits fuzzy TOPSIS technique has been proposed in this research. Fuzzy weights of the criteria and fuzzy judgments about enterprise systems as alternatives are employed to compute evaluation scores and ranking. This application is realized to illustrate the utilization of the model for the evaluation problems of enterprise systems. On this basis, organizations will be able to select, assess and purchase enterprise systems which make possible better decision support environment in their work systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
