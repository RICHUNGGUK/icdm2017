In general, the higher abstraction level is used to model a complex system like 3D graphics SOC. However, the concerned issue is that how to use efficient methods to traverse design space hierarchically, reduce simulation time, and refine the performance fast. This paper demonstrates a system-level design space exploration model for a tile-based 3D graphics SoC refinement. This model uses UML tools which can assist designers to traverse the whole system and reduces simulation time dramatically by adopting SystemC. As a result, the system performance is improved 198% at geometry function and 69% at rendering function, respectively.", "paper_title": "A System-Level Model of Design Space Exploration for a Tile-Based 3D Graphics SoC Refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700030"}
