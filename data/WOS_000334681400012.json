The proposed structure consists of two parallel multimode resonators, resulting in a dual notch-band UWB BPF, integrated with a single cell of CSRR to realize the third notch-band. The mechanism of realizing the notch-bands is mathematically presented and a triple notch-bands UWB BPF is designed, simulated and fabricated. The overall size of the proposed filter is reported to be around 36 x 7.7 mm(2) where a size reduction of around 35% is demonstrated in comparison to the conventional filter.
