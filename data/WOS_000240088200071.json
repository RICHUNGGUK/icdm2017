It groups text into different clusters by contents without apriori knowledge. In this paper, different text clustering methods are studied and three text clustering validation criteria are studied and used to evaluate the experimental results. We compare and contrast the effectiveness of k-means and FIHC text clustering methods by experiments, and address the different levels of quality of the resulting text clusters.", "paper_title": "A comparative study on text clustering methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200071"}
