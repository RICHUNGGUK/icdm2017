Exponentiations modulo a large prime have been considered the most expensive operations in discrete-logarithm-based cryptographic protocols, and they may be burdensome for the resource-limited devices such as RFID tags or smartcards. Therefore, it is important to present an efficient method to securely outsource such operations to (untrusted) cloud servers. In this paper, we propose a new secure outsourcing algorithm for (variable-exponent, variable-base) exponentiation modulo a prime in the two untrusted program model. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm, the proposed algorithm is superior in both efficiency and checkability. Based on this algorithm, we show how to achieve outsource-secure Cramer-Shoup encryptions and Schnorr signatures. We then propose the first efficient outsource-secure algorithm for simultaneous modular exponentiations. Finally, we provide the experimental evaluation that demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed outsourcing algorithms and schemes.", "paper_title": "New Algorithms for Secure Outsourcing of Modular Exponentiations", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000017"}
