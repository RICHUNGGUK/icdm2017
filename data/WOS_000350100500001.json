Five categories are identified: use of loose analogies and metaphors between concepts in quantum physics and library/information science; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in information retrieval; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in studying meaning and concepts; quantum social science, in areas adjacent to information science; and the qualitative application of quantum concepts in the information disciplines. Quantum issues have led to demonstrable progress in information retrieval and semantic modelling, with less clear-cut progress elsewhere. Whether there may be a future \"quantum turn\" in the information sciences is debated, the implications of such a turn are considered, and a research agenda outlined.", "paper_title": "Potentialities or Possibilities: Towards Quantum Information Science?", "paper_id": "WOS:000350100500001"}
