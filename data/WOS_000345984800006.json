The proposed adaptive blind receivers are based on the property of the discreteness of the input data symbol and are updated in every symbol interval. We also use the concept that the variance of the output signal approaches to the variance of the desired signal to get the cost function. The three proposed receiver structures are the traditional finite impulse response (FIR) structure, the despreading (DES) filter structure and the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure. The advantage of the FIR filter is that the length of the filter weights does not have to be the same length as the spreading code. For the DES filter, the combination of the adaptive weight and the despreading code has the simplest structure than the other two proposed receiver structures. The constrained GSC filter is superior to the other two proposed receiver structures in the environments dominated by multiple-access interference. By this constraint, the blind GSC filter can guarantee to converge to the desired solution. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness and comparison of the proposed adaptive blind receivers.
