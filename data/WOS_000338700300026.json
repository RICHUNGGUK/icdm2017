To cope with these challenges, most routing protocols employ the \"store-carry-forward\" strategy to transmit messages. However, the difficulty of this strategy is how to choose the best relay node and determine the best time to forward messages. Fortunately, social relations among nodes can be used to address these problems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent social-aware routing protocols, which offer an insight into how to utilize social relationships to design efficient and applicable routing algorithms in DTNs. First, we review the major practical applications of DTNs. Then, we focus on understanding social ties between nodes and investigating some design-related issues of social-based routing approaches, e. g., the ways to obtain social relations among nodes, the metrics and approaches to identify the characteristics of social ties, the strategies to optimize social-aware routing protocols, and the suitable mobility traces to evaluate these protocols. We also create a taxonomy for social-aware routing protocols according to the sources of social relations. Finally, we outline several open issues and research challenges.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Social-Aware Routing Protocols in Delay Tolerant Networks: Applications, Taxonomy and Design-Related Issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000338700300026"}
