Using practical channel estimation algorithms, the statistic model of the channel estimation error is first derived. Then based on the channel error model, the resource allocation scheme aims at maximizing the sum rate of the overall network. Specifically, both subcarrier allocation and power allocation are taken into account. In the subcarrier allocation, a realistic problem of the power leakage between neighboring subcarriers is also addressed. Furthermore, based on Lagrange dual-decomposition algorithm, a practical power allocation algorithm is proposed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed robust design.", "paper_title": "Statistically robust resource allocation for distributed multi-carrier cooperative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317246800016"}
