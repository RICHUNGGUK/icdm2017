Solution method: Algebraic extraction of singularities in dimensional regularisation using iterated sector decomposition. This leads to a Laurent series in the dimensional regularisation parameter epsilon, where the coefficients are finite integrals over the unit-hypercube. Those integrals are evaluated numerically by Monte Carlo integration. Restrictions: Depending on the complexity of the problem, limited by memory and CPU time. Multi-scale integrals can only be evaluated at Euclidean points. Running time: Between a few minutes and several days, depending on the complexity of the problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
