By allowing an arbitrary information exchange pattern, the considered channel model is a unified one. It includes several existing channel models as special cases: 1) K -user MIMO Y channel; 2) multi-pair MIMO two-way relay channel; 3) generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel; and 4) L-cluster MIMO multiway relay channel. Previous studies mainly considered the achievability of the DoF cut-set bound 2N at the antenna configuration N < 2M by applying signal alignment for network coding. This paper aims to investigate the achievability of the DoF cut-set bound KM for the case N >= 2M. To this end, we first derive tighter DoF upper bounds for three special cases of the considered channel model. Then, we propose a new transmission framework, generalized signal alignment (GSA), to approach these bounds. The notion of GSA is to form network-coded symbols by aligning every pair of signals to be exchanged in a compressed subspace at the relay. A necessary and sufficient condition to construct the relay compression matrix is given. We show that using GSA, the new DoF upper bound is achievable when: 1) N/M is an element of (0, 2+ 4/K (K4-1) boolean OR [K 2, +oo) for the K -user MIMO Y channel; 4 2) m is an element of (0,2 K 1 U [K 2, +oo) for the multi-pair MIMO two-way relay channel; and 3) N/M is an element of (0, 2+ 8/K-2 boolean OR [K 2, +infinity) for the generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel. We also provide the antenna configuration regions for the general multi-user MIMO two-way relay channel to achieve the total DoF KM.", "paper_title": "Generalized Signal Alignment: On the Achievable DoF for Multi-User MIMO Two-Way Relay Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600027"}
