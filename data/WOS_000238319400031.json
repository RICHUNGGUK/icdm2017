The term \"feasible matching\" is introduced to describe a set of (transmitter, receiver) pairs for which there exists some set of transmit powers which can simultaneously meet the SINR requirements at the receivers. Given disjoint equally sized sets of transmitters and receivers, it is shown that when the SINR requirement at the receivers is greater than 1, no more than one feasible matching between the transmitters and the receivers exists. Sufficient conditions are provided under which certain broad classes of matchings in a network are guaranteed to be feasible; for example all matchings involving k or fewer links. The application of these results to ad hoc wireless networks and to scheduling is discussed.", "paper_title": "The feasibility of matchings in a wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238319400031"}
