This article studies the influence of round-off on the conservation of first integrals such as the total energy in Hamiltonian systems. For implicit Runge-Kutta methods, a standard implementation shows an unexpected propagation. We propose a modification that reduces the effect of round-off and shows a qualitative and quantitative improvement for an accurate integration over long times.", "paper_title": "Achieving Brouwer's law with implicit Runge-Kutta methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000258527500005"}
