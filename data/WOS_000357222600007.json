This paper focuses on computing the beta-spectrum, a labeling of the edges of the Delaunay triangulation, DT(V), which makes it possible to quickly find the lune-ased beta-skeleton of V for any query value beta is an element of [1,2]. We consider planar n-point sets V with L-p metric, 1 < p < infinity. We present an O (n log(2) n) time sequential, and an O (log(4) n) time parallel, beta-spectrum labeling. We also show a parallel algorithm, which for a given beta is an element of [1,2] finds the lune-based beta-skeleton in O (log(2) n) time. The parallel algorithms use O(n) processors in the CREW-PRAM model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
