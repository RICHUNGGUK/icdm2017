This numerical technique imitates the musical performance process that takes place when a musician searches for a better state of harmony. Jazz improvisation seeks to find musically pleasing harmony similar to the optimum design process which seeks to find the optimum solution. The design algorithm considers the serviceability and ultimate strength constraints which are implemented from Load and Resistance Factor Design-American Institute of Steel Construction (LRFD-AISC). It selects the appropriate W-sections for the transverse and longitudinal beams of the grillage system out of 272 discrete W-section designations given in LRFD-AISC. This selection is carried out such that the design limitations described in LRFD-AISC are satisfied and the weight of the system is the minimum. Many design examples are considered to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm presented.", "paper_title": "Harmony search based algorithm for the optimum design of grillage systems to LRFD-AISC", "paper_id": "WOS:000263065700003"}
