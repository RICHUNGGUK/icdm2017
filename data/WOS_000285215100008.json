Nonetheless, they are yet to be widely adopted. One reason is the lack of efficient operating system support for these platforms. In this paper, we address the problem of runtime task scheduling as a main part of the operating systems. To do so, a new task replacement parameter, called Time-Improvement, is proposed for compiler assisted scheduling algorithms. In contrast with most related approach, we validate our approach using real application workload obtained from an application for multimedia test remotely taken by students. The proposed online task scheduling algorithm outperforms previous algorithms and accelerates task execution from 4% up to 20%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
