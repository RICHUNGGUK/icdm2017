Not surprisingly, this is a very active area as attested by the large number of related published research literature. Recently, the journal engineering applications of artificial intelligence published a paper by Chen and Deng (2009) where the authors propose a mutual authentication protocol for RFID. This protocol has fundamental flaws that can be readily taken advantage by a resourceful adversary. We identify and discuss these vulnerabilities and point out the characteristics of this protocol that exposes it to these vulnerabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
