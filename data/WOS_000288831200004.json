Although offering enormous data storage capacity, low power consumption, and reduced fabrication complexity (at least for the memory cell array), such memories are subject to a high degree of intermittent and transient faults leading to reliability issues. This article examines the use of Conventional Redundant Residue Number System (C-RRNS) error correction code, which has been extensively used in digital signal processing and communication, to detect and correct intermittent and transient cluster faults in hybrid memories. It introduces a modified version of C-RRNS, referred to as 6M-RRNS, to realize the aims at lower area overhead and performance penalty. The experimental results show that 6M-RRNS realizes a competitive error correction capability, provides larger data storage capacity, and offers higher decoding performance as compared to C-RRNS and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. For instance, for 64-bit hybrid memories at 10% fault rate, 6M-RRNS has 98.95% error correction capability, which is 0.35% better than RS and 0.40% less than C-RRNS. Moreover, when considering 1Tbit memory, 6M-RRNS offers 4.35% more data storage capacity than RS and 11.41% more than C-RRNS. Additionally, it decodes up to 5.25 times faster than C-RRNS.", "paper_title": "Redundant Residue Number System Code for Fault-Tolerant Hybrid Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000288831200004"}
