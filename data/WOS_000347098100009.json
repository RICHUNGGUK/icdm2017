In this paper, we propose a game-theoretical framework over a multi-view and multi-video network where one server delivers multiple multi-view 3D videos to multiple viewers. In a mobile network, any individual viewers can subscribe to a video with any viewing angle within a specified viewing range in 3D-enabled mobile handsets. To facilitate efficient resource allocation for multi-view 3D videos, we formulate a new resource allocation problem, named Price-based 3D Viewing Range Control problem (PVRC), as a Stackelberg game in Game Theory, in which the server and the viewers are modeled as the leader and the followers, respectively, to jointly consider the revenue of the server and the utilities of the viewers. We analyze the price setting problem by investigating the Stackelberg equilibrium between the server and viewers. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to popular uniform-price setting, non-uniform pricing is an effective approach for reducing the difference of utilities among the viewers, effectively controlling the viewing ranges and avoiding starvation of the network resources to only few viewers. Moreover, we also derive the social optimum in the problem, and the simulation results show that the derived Stackelberg equilibrium is close to the social optimum.", "paper_title": "Efficient Resource Allocation of Mobile Multi-View 3D Videos with Depth-Image-Based Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000347098100009"}
