A set of operations together with their required tools are selected so as to maximize the total weight. The machines have limited time and tool magazine capacities and the tools are available in limited quantities. We develop a beam search algorithm and obtain near optimal solutions for large size problems very quickly. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
