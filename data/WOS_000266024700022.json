By employing a tree-structure-based encryption, the proposal reduces the communication overhead dramatically when transmitting digital content to receivers. Also, an ID-based public key cryptosystem is seamlessly incorporated into our scheme to decrease the storage requirement of certifications management. Compared with the currently available encryption schemes on Internet, it will be evident that our proposal is more efficient and practical.", "paper_title": "BROADCAST YOURSELF SECURELY: ENHANCED TRANSMISSION SCHEME FOR SHARING DIGITAL CREATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700022"}
