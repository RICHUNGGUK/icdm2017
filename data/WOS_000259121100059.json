Based on the drive-response concept, LMI approach and the Lyapunov stability theorem, a novel control method is presented and two sufficient conditions have been obtained to ensure the global exponential stability for the error system which helps the drive system synchronize with the response system. In addition, the activation functions are assumed to be of more general descriptions, which generalizes and improves those earlier methods. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of presented synchronization scheme.
