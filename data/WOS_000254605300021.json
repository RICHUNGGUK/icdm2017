The frequency estimate is obtained from a solving a cubic equation and a simple root selection procedure is provided. Asymptotical variance of the estimated frequency is derived and confirmed by computer simulations. It is demonstrated that the proposed estimator is superior to the reformed Pisarenko harmonic decomposer, which is the improved version of Pisarenko harmonic decomposer.", "paper_title": "Single sinusoidal frequency estimation using second and fourth order linear prediction errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300021"}
