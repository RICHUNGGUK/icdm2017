This paper deals with an integrated method for grouping the distributed sites into clusters and customizing the database fragments allocation to the clusters and their sites. We design a high speed clustering and allocating method to determine which fragments would be allocated to which cluster and site so as to maintain data availability and a constant systemic reliability, and evaluate the performance achieved by this method and demonstrate its efficiency by means of tabular and graphical representation. We tested our method over different network sites and found it reduces the data transferred between the sites during the execution time, minimizes the communication cost needed for processing applications, and handles the database queries and meets their future needs.", "paper_title": "A high-performance computing method for data allocation in distributed database systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242731900001"}
