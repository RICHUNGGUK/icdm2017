These tools implement optimization algorithms that modify the distribution of some materials within a predefined design space without a priori ideas regarding the topology or the geometry of the best solution. In this paper, we study a specific tool that combines a genetic algorithm, a material distribution formalism based on Voronoi cells and a commercial FEM evaluation tool. In particular, this paper shows, through a simple but representative case study, that it is possible to improve the performance of the topology optimization tool during the local search phase, i.e. the geometrical and dimensional optimization phase for which the topology optimization methods are originally not well-suited.
