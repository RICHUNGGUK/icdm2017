Universal cycles, introduced by Chung, Diaconis, and Graham in 1992, and Gray codes are examples of listing elements of a combinatorial family in a specific manner, and Godbole invented the following generalization of these in 2010. 1-overlap cycles require a set of strings to be ordered so that the last letter of one string is the first letter of the next. In this paper, we prove the existence of 1-overlap cycles for automorphism free Steiner triple systems of each possible order. Since Steiner triple systems have the property that each block can be represented uniquely by a pair of points, these 1-overlap cycles can be compressed by omitting non-overlap points to produce rank two universal cycles on such designs, expanding on the results of Dewar.", "paper_title": "1-Overlap cycles for Steiner triple systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600012"}
