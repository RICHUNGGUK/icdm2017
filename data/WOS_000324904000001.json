The contemplated effects of the actions are represented as a transition operator that hopefully transforms the present state into a more desirable future state. As a case study, the model is applied to the self-regulation of glycemia in type-2 diabetes. An outline for the extension of the model to multi-agent, multidimensional self-regulation is also suggested.", "paper_title": "A Model of Single-Agent Illness Self-Regulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000324904000001"}
