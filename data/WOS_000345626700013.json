The results of studying this mechanism at the G3(MP2)//B3-CEP level pointed to the occurrence of a single-electron transfer (SET) from the aromatic pi-system to the nitronium ion prior to sigma-complex formation. The formation of an initial pi-complex between the nitronium ion and phenol was not observed. Excellent agreement between the activation barriers predicted by G3(MP2)//B3-CEP and those yielded by other, more accurate, versions of the G3 theory showed that the former is a useful tool for studying reaction mechanisms, as G3(MP2)//B3-CEP is much less computationally expensive than other high-level methods.", "paper_title": "An interpretation of the phenol nitration mechanism in the gas phase using G3(MP2)//B3-CEP theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700013"}
