To satisfy this requirement, radio frequency technology is not as expensive as other complex ones. This work focuses on acquiring the fastest information by applying radio frequency identification (RFID) system that is integrated with a cloud computing system. Detecting numerous tags simultaneously always leads to the possibility of collisions occurring. In particular, a collision problem occurs for both a tag and a reader. The collision may result in either undetected tags ID or misinterpretation of a different code. This work proposes a novel RFID-based system that implementing the anti-collision feature of a mobile reader involves solving the problem of collision. Performance results indicate that the Slotted ALOHA protocol for 1,000 tags requires nearly 2.7 sec, while the proposed method requires only around 1.4 sec. Overall comparison performance reveals that the proposed method decreases the reading time by nearly 50% over that of the Slotted ALOHA method.", "paper_title": "High Efficient Mobile RFID Networking with Anti-collision", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100010"}
