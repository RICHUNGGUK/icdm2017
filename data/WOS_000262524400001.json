In this paper, an extension of the Sugeno integral for the framework of possibilistic truth values is presented. resulted in a powerful domain-specific aggregation operator. Next. it is shown how the presented integral call be plugged into a reasoning framework for identification of coreferent objects. which are entity descriptions that refer to the same entity in a different way. The concept of hierarchical fuzzy measures, linked to in object structure is introduced, offering a new conditional possibilistic reasoning framework for object matching. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.
