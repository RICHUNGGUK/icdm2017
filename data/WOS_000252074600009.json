Based on an analysis of this effect, we present an interaction technique for view-projection animation that reduces inter-object occlusion in 3D environments without modifying the geometrical properties of the objects themselves. The technique allows for smooth on-demand animation between parallel and perspective projection modes as well as online manipulation of view parameters, enabling the user to quickly and easily adapt the view to reduce occlusion. A user study indicates that the technique provides many of the occlusion reduction benefits of traditional camera movement, but without the need to actually change the viewpoint. We have also implemented a prototype of the technique in the Blender 3D modeler. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
