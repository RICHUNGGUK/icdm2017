However, the high cost and power consumption are limiting their popularity and versatility. TCAM testing is also time consuming due to the complex integration of logic and memory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the design techniques for low-power TCAMs. We also propose a novel test methodology for various TCAM components. The proposed test algorithms show significant improvement over the existing algorithms both in test complexity and fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Design techniques and test methodology for low-power TCAMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239405100002"}
