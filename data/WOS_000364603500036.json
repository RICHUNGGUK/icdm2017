The data-driven model, utilising an M5 decision tree modelling technique, is validated using a 12-month training data set derived from published measured data. Daily runoff and drainage is predicted, and the results are compared with existing data-driven models developed in this domain. Results for the model give an R-2 of 0.82 and Root Relative Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 35.9%. 80% of the residuals for the predicted test values fall within a 2 mm discharge depth/day error range. The main significance is that the proposed model gives comparable results with fewer samples and simpler parameters when compared to previous published research, which offers the potential for implementation in resource constrained monitoring and control systems.
