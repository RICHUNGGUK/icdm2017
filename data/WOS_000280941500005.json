Ideas around social aspects in such design teams are discussed followed by our previous research efforts as an evolutionary process that has led us to develop in this direction. It is argued that facilitating timely and contextually grounded communication in a distributed environment can help to build the social networks and associated social capital common in collocated design teams but often absent in distributed ones. We describe our framework for providing such facilitation through monitoring and awareness of the information \"space\" of a construction project. We believe that by leveraging the relationships in the information space, we can go some way to identifying those individuals who would benefit from developing interpersonal relations in their work and further by exploiting those relationships in real time we can accelerate the formation of personal social networks and social capital between those individuals.", "paper_title": "Activity Awareness as an Enabler for Communication and Network Building in Construction Design Teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000280941500005"}
