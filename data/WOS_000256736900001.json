The quaternionic Schrodinger equation plays an important role in quaternionic quantum mechanics, and it is known that the study of the quaternionic Schrodinger equation is reduced to the study of quaternionic eigen-equation A alpha = alpha lambda with A an anti-self-adjoint real quaternion matrix (time-independent). This paper, by means of complex representation of quaternion matrices, introduces concepts of norms of quaternion matrices, studies the problems of quaternionic Least Squares eigenproblem, and give a practical algebraic technique of computing approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quaternion matrix in quaternionic quantum mechanics.
