More generally, the framework is that of jointly estimating the geometric and radiometric deformations relating two observations on the same object. We show that the original high-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonconvex search problem of simultaneously recovering the geometric and radiometric deformations can be represented by an equivalent sequence of two linear systems. A solution of this sequence yields an exact, explicit, and efficient solution to the joint estimation problem.", "paper_title": "Decoupled Linear Estimation of Affine Geometric Deformations and Nonlinear Intensity Transformations of Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000275569300013"}
