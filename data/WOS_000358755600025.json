The main tool is Banach fixed point theorem. Also we study the numerical approximation of the solutions of a fuzzy fractional initial value problem by using product trapezoidal and product rectangle formulas; the convergence of the numerical scheme is analyzed rigorously. Finally some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy fractional initial value problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600025"}
