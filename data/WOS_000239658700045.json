The main contributions of this paper include: (1) Proposing the structure of PS-Tree which can manifest the relationship of data exchange between simulation members. (2) Describing the method of dynamic data distribution based on PS-Tree by mining association rule and (3) Analyzing the performance. Experiment shows that this dynamic data distribution method can implement data distribution efficiently and effectively.", "paper_title": "Dynamic data distribution of high level architecture based on publication and subscription tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700045"}
