To facilitate the comparison, we have developed a complete framework with an intuitive and simple sketch-based interface to enable interactive mesh segmentation by marking strokes to specify the foreground and background with the mouse buttons, allowing us to quantify the algorithms in a unified manner. The evaluation has been performed via extensive user experiments in which each participant was assigned to segment models with the evaluated algorithms and the corresponding update of each segmentation was recorded as a new refinement when additional interactions were added. We then collected the segmentations from participants and evaluated them against the ground-truth corpus constructed from the Princeton segmentation database. To investigate how well the interactive segmentations match the ground-truth, five metrics were used to measure the boundary and region accuracy of segmentations. By studying the experimental results, we have analyzed the performance of the evaluated algorithms and provided valuable insights into their characteristics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
