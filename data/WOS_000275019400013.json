Fast neighborhoods are proposed for the problem. They are based on a block representation of the schedule. A timing operator is presented as well as swap and extract-and-reinsert neighborhoods. They are used in an iterated local search framework. Two types of perturbations are developed based, respectively, on random swaps and earliness and tardiness costs. Computational results show that very good solutions for instances with significantly more than 100 jobs can be derived in a few seconds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
