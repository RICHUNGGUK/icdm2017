In linguistic decision, symbolic scheme thereby is more attractive than set-based scheme. The counted (expanded) linguistic variable (CLV/CELV) model is proposed for representing and aggregating linguistic decision information. The model is developed from the ordinary linguistic variable by attaching a counting label. This label separately contains the quantitative information that may influence the comparison and aggregation of linguistic variables. Using the CLVs (CELVs) and their operations for computing with words, the linguistic information can be handled more intelligibly.", "paper_title": "Counted Linguistic Variable in Decision-Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000338826200007"}
