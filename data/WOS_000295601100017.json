The DOAs of uncorrelated signals are first estimated via subspace-based high resolution DOA estimation technique. Then a matrix that only contains the information of coherent signals can be formulated by eliminating the contribution of uncorrelated signals. Finally a subspace block sparse reconstruction approach is taken for DOA estimations of the coherent signals.", "paper_title": "Robust DOA Estimation for Uncorrelated and Coherent Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100017"}
