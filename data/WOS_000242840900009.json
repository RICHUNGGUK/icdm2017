The technique of watermarking provides potential solutions for the problem. Comparing with the watermarking schemes designed for general multimedia data, watermarking a 2D vector map has some distinct features due to the special data structures and application environments of vector maps. These distinct features will be summarized in this paper by analyzing the characters of vector map data. Furthermore, an overview of the existing typical algorithms will be presented to show the state of the art of the study.", "paper_title": "A survey of digital vector map watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000242840900009"}
