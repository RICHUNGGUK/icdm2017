We propose a system for tracking persons identified at the entrance to a room in order to realize \"soft authentication.\" Our system can be constructed at low cost and works anytime and anywhere in a room. Through experiments, we confirmed that the system could track up to 5 persons with a high probability of correct identification, though precise identification is difficult.", "paper_title": "Soft authentication using an infrared ceiling sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000269914900004"}
