Normally, the social network is modeled as a network graph, consisting of nodes (In the rest of the paper, unless otherwise specified, we will use the terms \"user\" and \"node\" interchangeably.) representing users within the network and edges representing relationships between users. Choosing the appropriate nodes to form an auxiliary structure for supporting the effective query message spreading can reduce the troublesome repeated queries. To accomplish this, a hybrid search (HS) scheme is proposed. If the query message is received by a node belonging the auxiliary structure constructed by dynamic weighted distributed label clustering (DW-DLC), it would be flooded to all neighbors of the visited node; otherwise, it would be forwarded to one neighbor of the visited node. The DW-DLC based auxiliary structure can accelerate the process of obtaining required information within the network. The simulation results show that the HS+DW-DLC scheme can reduce the average searching delay time, even in a required-information-scarce social network. In addition, the proposed scheme can generate a relatively low amount of repeated messages to lower repeatedly asking social network users.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Search Scheme for Social Networks Supported by Dynamic Weighted Distributed Label Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000359236500013"}
