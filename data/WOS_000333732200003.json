The DG finite element discretization framework is used for both the flow field and turbulence transport. Turbulent flow in the near wall regions and the flow field is modeled by the Spalart-Allmaras one-equation model. The effect of rotation on turbulence modeling for shock-dominated supersonic flows is considered for accurate resolution of the large coherent and vortical structures that are of interest in high-speed combustion and supersonic flows. Implicit time marching methodologies are used to enable large time steps by avoiding the severe time step limitations imposed by the higher order DG discretizations and the source terms. Sufficiently high mesh density is used to enable crisp capturing of discontinuities. A p-type refinement procedure is employed to accurately represent the vortical structures generated during the development of the flow. The computed solutions showed qualitative agreement with experiments.
