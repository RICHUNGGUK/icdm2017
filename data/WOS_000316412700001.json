Borisov et al. [2007] proposed a denial-of-service-based attack on Tor (and related systems) that significantly increases the probability of compromising the anonymity provided. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of the attack using both an analytic model and simulation. We also describe two algorithms for detecting such attacks, one deterministic and proved correct, the other probabilistic and verified in simulation.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness and Detection of Denial-of-Service Attacks in Tor", "paper_id": "WOS:000316412700001"}
