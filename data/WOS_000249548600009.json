The primary focus is on quantitative micromechanical analysis of dissolution/diffusion phenomena that occur within the intergranular interface. First, the influence of the kinetics of the dissolution process on the underlying physical mechanisms is investigated. Subsequently, a macroscopic chemoplasticity formulation is outlined. Extensive numerical studies are carried out. Those include the analysis at micro-level, simulation of macroscopic creep deformation characteristics as well as application in a boundary value problem that involves a water injection test.
