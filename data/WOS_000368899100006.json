The result is a new complete and effective decision procedure for MITL. Although decision procedures for MITL already exist, the automata-based techniques they employ appear to be very difficult to realize in practice, and, to the best of our knowledge, no implementation currently exists for them. Aprototype tool for MITL based on the encoding presented here has, instead, been implemented and is publicly available. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
