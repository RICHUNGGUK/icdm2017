The main result is that every coding of rotations on two intervals is full, that is, it realizes the maximal palindromic complexity. As a byproduct, a slight improvement about return words in codings of rotations is obtained: every factor of a coding of rotations on two intervals has at most 4 complete return words, where the bound is realized only for a finite number of factors. We also provide a combinatorial proof for the special case of complementary-symmetric Rote sequences by considering both palindromes and antipalindromes occurring in it. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
