It is found that generally the condition of convexity can be relaxed to quasi-convexity in order to guarantee the existence of symmetry global optima. Furthermore, some new results about the symmetry properties of robust and discrete structural optimization problems are also presented. Numerous concrete examples illustrate the claims made in the present work explicitly.", "paper_title": "Symmetry properties in structural optimization: some extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000318624100001"}
