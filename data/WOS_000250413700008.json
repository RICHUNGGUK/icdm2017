We define two important behavioural properties of adaptive workflow nets: soundness and circumspectness. Soundness means that a proper final marking (state) can be reached from any marking which is reachable from the initial marking, and no garbage will be left. Circumspectness means that the upper layer is always ready to handle any exception that can happen in a lower layer. We define a finite state abstraction for adaptive workflow nets and show that soundness and circumspectness can be verified on this abstraction.", "paper_title": "Checking properties of adaptive workflow nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000250413700008"}
