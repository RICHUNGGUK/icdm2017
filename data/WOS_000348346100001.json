Ordinary peers are connected to the super-peers and rely on them for their transactional needs. Many criteria for a peer to choose its super-peer have been explored, some of them based on physical proximity, semantic proximity, or by purely random choice. In this paper, we propose an incentive-based criterion that uses semantic similarities between the content interests of the peers and, at the same time, encourages even load distribution across the super-peers. The incentive is achieved via a game theoretic framework that considers each peer as a rational player, allowing stable Nash equilibria to exist and hence guarantees a fixed point in the strategy space of the peers. This guarantees convergence (assuming static network parameters) to a locally optimal assignment of peers to super-peers with respect to a global cost that approximates the average query resolution time. We also show empirically that the local cost framework that we employ performs closely to (and in some cases better than) a similar scheme based on the formulation of a centralized cost function that requires the peers to know an additional global parameter.", "paper_title": "Optimizing cluster formation in super-peer networks via local incentive design", "paper_id": "WOS:000348346100001"}
