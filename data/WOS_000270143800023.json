A Lyapunov stability approach is used for the stability analysis of the tracking system. It is shown that the closed-loop tracking error and the approximating neural network weight estimates retain the property of uniformly ultimate boundedness under the presence of neural network approximation error and bounded unknown disturbances under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "Direct Heuristic Dynamic Programming for Nonlinear Tracking Control With Filtered Tracking Error", "paper_id": "WOS:000270143800023"}
