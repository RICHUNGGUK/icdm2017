Since design chemical process is operating close to tighter boundaries safely; much attention has been devoted to integrating design and control, in which the design decisions, dynamics, and control performance are considered simultaneously in some optimal fashion. However, rigorous methods for solving design and control simultaneously lead to challenging mathematical formulations which easily become computationally intractable. In an earlier paper of our group, a new mathematical methodology to reduce the combinatorial complexity of integrating design and control was introduced (Malcolm et al., 2007). We showed that substantial problem size reduction can be achieved by embedding control for specific process designs. In this paper, we extend the embedded control methodologies to plantwide flowsheet. The case study for the reactor-column flowsheet will demonstrate the current capabilities of the methodology for integrating design and control under uncertainty.
