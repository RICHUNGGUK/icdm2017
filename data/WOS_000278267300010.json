Recent advances in the Life Sciences have suggested that evolution has a much more diverse course. In this paper we will survey some of the models that have been proposed to overcome the limitations of using phylogenies to represent evolutionary histories.", "paper_title": "Beyond evolutionary trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000278267300010"}
