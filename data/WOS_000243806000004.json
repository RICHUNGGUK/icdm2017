A feedback control gain matrix is derived to achieve the global robust exponential stabilization of the neural networks by using the Lyapunov stability theory, and the stabilization condition can be verified if a certain Hamiltonian matrix with no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. This condition can avoid solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "Robust exponential stabilization of a class of delayed neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000243806000004"}
