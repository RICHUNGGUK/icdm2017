The coupler utilizes an artificial left-handed transmission line section for broadband phase response realization. Moreover, a narrowband model of left-handed section has been shown to prove the couplers equivalent circuit at the center frequency. To broaden the operational bandwidth multisection quarter-wave transformers have been proposed. The exemplary rat-race coupler with two-section impedance transformers has been designed and manufactured. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
