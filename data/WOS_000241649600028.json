As efficient as existing alternatives, it is the only method known to the author that also guarantees a quasi linear time complexity in the worst case. The approach presented can be used to determine if a set of n points is a naive digital hyperplane in Z(d) in O(n log(2) D) worst case time where D represents the size of a bounding box that encloses the points. In addition, the approach succeeds in reducing the naive digital plane recognition problem to a two-dimensional convex optimization program. Thus, the solution space is planar and only simple two-dimensional geometrical methods need to be applied during the recognition process. The algorithm is a composite of simple techniques based on one-dimensional optimization: Megiddo Oracle for linear programming and two-dimensional discrete geometry.", "paper_title": "A composite and quasi linear time method for digital plane recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600028"}
