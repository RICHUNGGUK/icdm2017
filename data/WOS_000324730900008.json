We then discuss some properties of these estimators and show by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study that the proposed estimators perform better than some other prominent estimators in terms of bias and root mean squared error. Finally, we present two real-life examples to illustrate the method of inference developed here.", "paper_title": "A consistent method of estimation for the parameters of the three-parameter inverse Gaussian distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900008"}
