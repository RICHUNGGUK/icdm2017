Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can sense inherent manufacturing variations as chip identifications. To enable the integration of PUFs into low-power and security applications, we study the impacts of process technology and supply voltage scaling on arbiter-based PUF circuit design. A Monte Carlo-based statistical analysis has demonstrated that advanced technologies and reduced supply voltage can improve the PUF uniqueness due to increased delay sensitivity. A linear regression approach has been leveraged to generate PUF delay profile by factoring in device, supply voltage and temperature variations. An accurate SVM-based software modeling analysis is used to verify the PUF additive delay behavior. Finally, postsilicon validation on arbiter-based PUF test chips in 45 nm SOICMOS technology has been correlated to simulation results and the inconsistency has been discussed. The test chips can resist the basic support vector machine attack due to the dynamic circuit effects and the limitation of our delay model.", "paper_title": "Design and Validation of Arbiter-Based PUFs for Sub-45-nm Low-Power Security Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000306520900024"}
