CYP2D6 metabolizes about 30% of drugs and predicting potential CYP2D6 inhibition is important in early-stage drug discovery. Results: We developed an original in silico approach for the prediction of CYP2D6 inhibition combining the knowledge of the protein structure and its dynamic behavior in response to the binding of various ligands and machine learning modeling. This approach includes structural information for CYP2D6 based on the available crystal structures and molecular dynamic simulations (MD) that we performed to take into account conformational changes of the binding site. We performed modeling using three learning algorithms -support vector machine, RandomForest and NaiveBayesian -and we constructed combined models based on topological information of known CYP2D6 inhibitors and predicted binding energies computed by docking on both X-ray and MD protein conformations. In addition, we identified three MD-derived structures that are capable all together to better discriminate inhibitors and non-inhibitors compared with individual CYP2D6 conformations, thus ensuring complementary ligand profiles. Inhibition models based on classical molecular descriptors and predicted binding energies were able to predict CYP2D6 inhibition with an accuracy of 78% on the training set and 75% on the external validation set.", "paper_title": "Integrated structure- and ligand-based in silico approach to predict inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400007"}
