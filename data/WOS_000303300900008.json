In this paper, we present a consensus model for group decision making problems in which the experts use linguistic interval fuzzy preference relations to represent their preferences. This model is based on two consensus criteria, a consensus measure and a proximity measure, and on the concept of coincidence among preferences. We compute both consensus criteria in the three representation levels of a preference relation and design an automatic feedback mechanism to guide experts in the consensus reaching process.
