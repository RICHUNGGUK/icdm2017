These groups are of the general form G = Hx(tau) K, where H and K are locally compact groups. In this paper, we consider the quasi regular representation on such a group G and investigate when it is possible to construct a family of coherent states associated to this representation.", "paper_title": "ON CONSTRUCTION OF COHERENT STATES ASSOCIATED WITH SEMIDIRECT PRODUCTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261734700007"}
