We study pencils of tropical curves with n-element support that pass through n-2 general points in the plane. Richter-Gebert et al. proved that such trees are compatible with their support set, and they conjectured that every compatible tree can be realized by a point configuration. In this article, we prove this conjecture. Our approach is based on a characterization of the fixed loci of tropical linear pencils.", "paper_title": "Linear Pencils of Tropical Plane Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400010"}
