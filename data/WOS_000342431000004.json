There are two main modules in this pipeline: the former is the illuminant estimation and correction module, the latter is the color matrix transformation. In this work we design extended color correction pipelines which exploit the crosstalks between their modules to lead to a higher color rendition accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed pipelines is shown on a publicly available dataset of RAW images.", "paper_title": "Error-Tolerant Color Rendering for Digital Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000342431000004"}
