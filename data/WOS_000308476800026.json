The related properties of rough subsets of lattices are investigated. We introduce the notion of rough ideals which is a generalized notion of ideals of a lattice, and some properties and homomorphism of such ideals are discussed.", "paper_title": "Rough ideals in lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800026"}
