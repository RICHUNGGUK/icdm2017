Recent years have witnessed many efforts on discovering fuzzy associations. The key strength of fuzzy association rule mining is its completeness. This strength, however, comes with a major drawback to handle large datasets. It often produces a huge number of candidate itemsets. The huge number of candidate itemsets makes it ineffective for a data mining system to analyze them. In the end, it produces a huge number of fuzzy associations. This is particularly true for datasets whose attributes are highly correlated. The huge number of fuzzy associations makes it very difficult for a human user to analyze them. Existing research has shown that most of the discovered rules are actually redundant or insignificant. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to overcome these problems; we are preprocessing the data tuples by focusing on similar behaviour attributes and ontology. Finally, the efficiency and advantages of this algorithm have been proved by experimental results.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT MINING OF FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES FROM THE PRE-PROCESSED DATASET", "paper_id": "WOS:000305314200004"}
