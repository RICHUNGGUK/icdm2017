The analysis has been done to explore and compare the suitability of the algorithms for the dynamic simulation of natural circulation steam generators based on a so called tube-header-model. The suitability of the algorithms was tested with the results of two simulation examples - a heat recovery steam generator with a horizontal tube bank (Fig. 3a) and a two-drum steam generator with a vertical tube bank (Fig. 3b). The calculations are done at low system pressure and under hot start-up conditions for the boilers. The results of the computations demonstrate that the SIMPLER algorithm should be preferred for dynamic simulations which are based on the tube-header-model. The algorithm shows a high stability, an extended field of variability of the under-relaxation factors as well as small required under-relaxation. The strong dependence of the calculation time on the number of control volumes is the only unfavourable characteristic of the SIMPLER algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
