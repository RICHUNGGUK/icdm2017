On scanning strongly curved objects, such as the ones with free form surfaces, the distance and impact angle of the laser beam are changing continuously during the scanning process. On the basis of these, two critical parameters are specified for the design model, which make it possible to predict these two factors in advance, depending on the morphology of the scanned object. First, a mathematical statistical design model of the scanning process is generated, which relies on ANOVA (analysis of variance) and DOE (design of experiments). In the next step, a fitness function is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) program. This optimization improves the accuracy of the final scanned surfaces, in terms of the minimum standard deviation values of reverse engineered 3D surface model. The proposed approach was confirmed in a case study, which is presented at the end of this Technical Note. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
