We propose a simple probabilistic extension of the pi-calculus, pi (p) , which is inspired by Herescu and Palamidessi's probabilistic asynchronous pi-calculus. An early semantics of our pi (p) is presented. We generalise several classic behavioural equivalences to probabilistic versions, obtaining the probabilistic (strong) barbed equivalence and probabilistic bisimulation for pi (p) . Then we prove that the coincidence between the barbed equivalence and bisimilarity in the pi-calculus is preserved in the probabilistic setting.", "paper_title": "Behavioural equivalences of a probabilistic pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000307720000008"}
