This trade-off is based on the reliance on local qualities for a precise delineation of particular regions and the reliance on nonlocal qualities that serve as differentia in the Aristotelian classification. An ontological analysis of the logical interrelations between vagueness, granularity, and scale is critical for developing logically rigorous, nonlocal, and nonarbitrary classification and delineation systems for inherently vague and granular geographic phenomena.", "paper_title": "Vagueness and the trade-off between the classification and delineation of geographic regions - an ontological analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000295465900007"}
