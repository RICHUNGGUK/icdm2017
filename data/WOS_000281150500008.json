Given a set of multi-dimensional objects, the skyline query finds the objects that are not dominated by others. To the best of our knowledge, the existing researches mainly focus on how to efficiently return the whole skyline set. However, as the cardinality and dimensionality of input dataset increase, the number of skylines grows exponentially, and hence this \"huge\" skyline set is completely useless to users. Motivated by the above fact, in this paper, we present a novel type of l-SkyDiv query, which only returns 1 skylines having maximum diversity, to improve the usefulness of skyline result. Also, we prove that the l-SkyDiv query belongs to the NP-Hard problem theoretically, and propose three efficient heuristic algorithms whose time complexities are polynomial to fast implement the proposed query. Furthermore, we present detailed theoretical analyses and extensive experiments, demonstrating that our algorithms are both efficient and effective.", "paper_title": "l-SkyDiv query: Effectively improve the usefulness of skylines", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500008"}
