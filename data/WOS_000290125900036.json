The unsharp masking (UM) is at first nonlinearized to prevent halos around large edges. This edge-preserving UM is then extended to cross-sharpening of multi-modal images where a component image is sharpened with the aid of more clear edges in another component image.", "paper_title": "Edge-Preserving Cross-Sharpening of Multi-Modal Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125900036"}
