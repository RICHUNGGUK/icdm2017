On the basis of nonstandard covolume grids, we propose a new kind of high-order upwind finite volume element method for the problems. We first prove the stability and mass conservation in the discrete forms of the scheme. Optimal second-order error estimate in L-2-norm in spatial step is then proved strictly. The scheme is effective for avoiding numerical diffusion and nonphysical oscillations and has second-order accuracy. Numerical experiments are given to verify the performance of the scheme.
