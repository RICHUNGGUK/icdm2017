Culberson, P. Rudnicki, A fast algorithm for constructing trees from distance matrices, Inform. Process. Lett. 30 (4) (1989) 215-220] gave an algorithm that reconstructs a degree d restricted tree from its distance matrix. According to their analysis, it runs in time O(dn log(d) n) for topological trees. However, this turns out to be false; we show that the algorithm takes Theta(n(3/2) root d) time in the topological case, giving tight examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
