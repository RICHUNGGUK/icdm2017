A well-known concern in the setting of attribute-based encryption is that a user (or set of colluding users) can create a new key (or decryption device) by using his legal one and distribute it for malicious use. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the notion of attribute-based traitor tracing (ABTT). We formalize the definitions and security notions for attribute-based traitor tracing scheme, and then present a construction of AB-TT. Our scheme makes use of the identity-based traitor tracing technology proposed by Abdalla et al., and is based on the second construction of Sahai-Waters' attribute-based encryption schemes, but in the asymmetric bilinear setting. Our scheme is shown to be secure in the standard model under some reasonable assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ABTT scheme up to now.", "paper_title": "Attribute-Based Traitor Tracing", "paper_id": "WOS:000286692500013"}
