This paper focuses on the role of personal dispositions in disclosing health information online. The conceptual model argues that individuals' intention to disclose such information depends on their trust, privacy concern, and information sensitivity, which are determined by personal dispositions-personality traits, information sensitivity, health status, prior privacy invasions, risk beliefs, and experience-acting as intrinsic antecedents of trust. The data (collected via a lab experiment) and the analysis shed light on the role of personal dispositions. This could assist in enhancing healthcare websites and increase the success of online delivery of health services. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
