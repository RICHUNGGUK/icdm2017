The main objective of this paper is to find an input to output mapping in order to stabilize the non-minimum phase systems and to obtain an input update law for handling uncertain systems. In conventional approaches on the tracking of non-minimum phase systems, zero dynamics is stabilized from the system equations and the input is calculated from the state information. For the learning of uncertain systems, conventional approaches depend on the output-to-state and state-to-input mappings. In the proposed method, the inverse system is stabilized using the input-to-output mapping for nonlinear non-minimum phase systems. A new input update law is proposed based on the relative degree and the number of non-minimum phase zeros. This makes the overall proposed learning system have a simple structure as in the classical ILC.", "paper_title": "Iterative learning control with advanced output data for nonlinear non-minimum phase systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241698200005"}
