The method, previously tried and tested using motion sensors installed in assisted living units, has permitted to establish motion-based behaviors of older-people based on their habits in term of displacements and activity-levels. The method is now expanded to measure more specific patterns of everyday life activity assuming an activity can be pre-identified on the long term using an activity recognition system. The study feasibility, carried out using semi-artificial data, includes an attempt to model disruptive patterns of living linked with dementia. The alert triggering method, part of the model is improved, and has been evaluated using a real-case study to detect behavioral changes with a higher sensibility. A customized software embedding the model shows the potential of the system tool to detect baseline behaviors and changes, which could be related to particular chronic disease symptoms.
