Therefore simulated anatomical fixed points on a wooden plate were measured during different movements. Seven different motion patterns in all three angles of space were evaluated. The simulated parameter trunk length was measured with an accuracy of 3.58 mm (SD +/- 3.29 mm) and the dimple distance was detected with an accuracy of 0.88 mm (SD +/- 1.04 mm). With this rasterstereographic prototype it is possible to examine dynamically the spinal posture with adequate accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
