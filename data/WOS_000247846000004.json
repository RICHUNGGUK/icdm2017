The original image is decomposed at various levels by WT. Then, by selecting an appropriate level at which the approximation sub-image is reconstructed, textures on the background are effectively removed. Thus, the difficult texture defect detection problem can be settled by non-texture techniques. An adaptive level-selecting scheme is presented by analyzing the co-occurrence matrices (COM) of the approximation sub-images. Experiments are done to detect the stains and broken points on texture surfaces. Comparisons with frequency domain low and high pass filters show that our method is much more effective.
