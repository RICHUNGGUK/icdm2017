This paper shows how simulation plays an important role in improving the flexibility of temporal logic based workflow specification (TLWS) model. Detecting the TLWS model's demand for changing and deciding what changes to carry out are very difficult. Simulation analysis can help to do these. After a task is finished, its time, cost and quality will be computed. And each will be compared with dual threshold values. If the value is below the bottom threshold, an exception will be thrown. If it is above this threshold, but below the top threshold, a warning will be sent out. If the value is above the top threshold, the execution is excellent. Workflow specification documents also need to be translated into simulation specification documents by using XLST. The utility of using simulation in improving the flexibility of TLWS model is outstanding.", "paper_title": "Using simulation to improve the flexibility of adaptive workflow models based on temporal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300079"}
