Some results on robust stability for this class of impulsive switched systems are obtained. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a guaranteed cost control law are also given. Subject to these sufficient conditions, the closed-loop uncertain impulsive switched system under the guaranteed cost control law is robustly stable with a guaranteed cost value.", "paper_title": "Robust stability analysis of guaranteed cost control for impulsive switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191900018"}
