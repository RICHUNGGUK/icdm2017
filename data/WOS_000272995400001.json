However, a general theory for bulk growth should consider that the mechanical stimulus may only be one of many factors contributing to growth. Another important factor could be time, as living tissues can be assumed to have a pre-programmed directional biological growth that is independent of mechanical stimuli. This paper has two objectives: the first is to introduce the concept of directional biological growth within a well developed growth theory, the second is to present the computational methods by which three-dimensional growth that encompasses time and stress effects can be simulated using commercially available finite element analysis software.", "paper_title": "Simulation of biological growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000272995400001"}
