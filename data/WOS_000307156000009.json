The analysis has been performed for a shot boundary detection application, based on Zernike moments, although it is general enough to be applied to many different application areas. A deep study of the performance, bottlenecks and design challenges is carried out showing the validity of this approach and achieving very high frame per second rates. In this paper. Zernike calculations are carried out on GPUs, taking advantage of a packing strategy proposed to minimize host-device communication time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
