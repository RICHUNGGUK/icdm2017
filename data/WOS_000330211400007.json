Log. 141:363-411, 2006). We show here that the sequences of level 2 are exactly the rational formal power series over one undeterminate. More generally, we study mappings from words to words and show that the following classes coincide: - the mappings which are computable by deterministic pushdown automata of level 2 - the mappings which are solution of a system of catenative recurrence equations - the mappings which are definable as a Lindenmayer system of type HDT0L. We illustrate the usefulness of this characterization by proving three statements about formal power series, rational sets of homomorphisms and equations in words.", "paper_title": "Word-Mappings of Level 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000330211400007"}
