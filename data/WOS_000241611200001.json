In this architecture, an ordered list instead of the tree-based structure is used in the AH algorithm for speeding up the compression data rate. The resulting architecture shows that it not only outperforms the AH algorithm at the cost of only one-fourth the hardware resource but it is also competitive to the performance of LZW algorithm (compress). In addition, both compression and decompression rates of the proposed architecture are greater than those of the AH algorithm even in the case realized by software.", "paper_title": "A lossless data compression and decompression algorithm and its hardware architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200001"}
