We revisit two methods, that uses linear codes, to construct Boolean functions satisfying multiple cryptographic criteria. We show that these methods can be used to build new cheating-immune (n, n)-secret sharing schemes. We also revisit two general constructions of secret sharing schemes using cumulative arrays and apply them to build cheating-immune (t, n)-threshold secret sharing schemes.", "paper_title": "Cheating-immune secret sharing schemes from codes and cumulative arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000330801600005"}
