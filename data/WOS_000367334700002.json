By representing string diagrams as graphs, equational reasoning can be done automatically by double-pushout rewriting. !-graphs give us the means of expressing and proving properties about whole families of these graphs simultaneously. While !-graphs provide elegant proofs of surprisingly powerful theorems, little is known about the formal properties of the graph languages they define. This paper takes the first step in characterising these languages by showing that an important subclass of !-graphs-those whose repeated structures only overlap trivially-can be encoded using a (context-free) vertex replacement grammar.", "paper_title": "!-Graphs with Trivial Overlap are Context-Free", "paper_id": "WOS:000367334700002"}
