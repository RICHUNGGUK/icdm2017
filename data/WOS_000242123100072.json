A header conversion is the method that converts IP Header of the IPv4 and IPv6 network address throughout converters. A header conversion method has the merit that conversion procedures were simple and easy for implementation. But, there is the problem that can contain security vulnerability, which is existed in IPv4 address. We propose an encrypted header conversion method by applying ESP of IPSec. to a header conversion method. The proposed method can improve end to end network layer security.", "paper_title": "Conversion scheme for reducing security vulnerability in IPv4/IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100072"}
