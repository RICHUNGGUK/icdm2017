However, despite considerable advances in the field, current systems are limited in terms of the pathologies they can detect, particularly regarding mental disorders. In this work we propose wearable eye tracking as a new method for mental health monitoring. We provide two reviews: one of the state-of-the-art in wearable eye tracking equipment and a second one of the work in experimental psychology and clinical research on the link between eye movements and cognition. Both reviews show a significant potential of wearable eye tracking for mental health monitoring in daily life settings. This finding calls for further research on unobtrusive sensing equipment and novel algorithms for automated analysis of long-term eye movement data. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
