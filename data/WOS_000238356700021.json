The aim of our work was to develop and implement methods for minimizing the impact of systematic error in the analysis of HTS data. To the best of our knowledge, two new data correction methods included in HTS-Corrector are not available in any existing commercial software or freeware. Results: This paper describes HTS-Corrector, a software application for the analysis of HTS data, detection and visualization of systematic error, and corresponding correction of HTS signals. Three new methods for the statistical analysis and correction of raw HTS data are included in HTS-Corrector: background evaluation, well correction and hit-sigma distribution procedures intended to minimize the impact of systematic errors. We discuss the main features of HTS-Corrector and demonstrate the benefits of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "HTS-corrector: software for the statistical analysis and correction of experimental high-throughput screening data", "paper_id": "WOS:000238356700021"}
