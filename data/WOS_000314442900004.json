The analysis uses a two dimensional trapezoidal enclosure with the left vertical wall and inclined walls kept in a low constant temperature and a heat source with constant heat flux placed on the bottom wall of the enclosure. The governing equations were discretized by the control volume method and solved numerically by SIMPLE algorithm. The computations were carried out for a wide range of the Rayleigh number (10(4) <= Ra <= 10(7)), Hartman number (0 <= Ha <= 100) and solid volume fraction (0 <= phi <= 0.05). The results show that at Ra = 10(4) and 10(5) the enhancement of the Nusselt number due to presence of nanoparticles increases with the Hartman number, but at higher Rayleigh number, a reduction has been observed. In addition it was observed that the entropy generation is decreased when the nanoparticles are present, while the magnetic field generally increases the magnitude of the entropy generation.
