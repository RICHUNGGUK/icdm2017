With hardware and/or software support, data prefetching brings data closer to a processor before it is actually needed. Many prefetching techniques have been developed for single-core processors. Recent developments in processor technology have brought multicore processors into mainstream. While some of the single-core prefetching techniques are directly applicable to multicore processors, numerous novel strategies have been proposed in the past few years to take advantage of multiple cores. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art prefetching techniques, and proposes a taxonomy that classifies various design concerns in developing a prefetching strategy, especially for multicore processors. We compare various existing methods through analysis as well.", "paper_title": "Taxonomy of Data Prefetching for Multicore Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000266386500001"}
