They can perform complex tasks in various contexts, using the available sensory information very effectively. Body models and continuous body state estimations appear necessary to realize such capabilities. We introduce the Modular Modality Frame (MMF) model, which maintains a highly distributed, modularized body model continuously updating, modularized probabilistic body state estimations over time. Modularization is realized with respect to modality frames, that is, sensory modalities in particular frames of reference and with respect to particular body parts. We evaluate MMF performance on a simulated, nine degree of freedom arm in 3D space. The results show that MMF is able to maintain accurate body state estimations despite high sensor and motor noise. Moreover, by comparing the sensory information available in different modality frames, MMF can identify faulty sensory measurements on the fly. In the near future, applications to lightweight robot control should be pursued. Moreover, MMF may be enhanced with neural encodings by introducing neural population codes and learning techniques. Finally, more dexterous goal-directed behavior should be realized by exploiting the available redundant state representations.", "paper_title": "The modular modality frame model: continuous body state estimation and plausibility-weighted information fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000314024600006"}
