These communities also have requirements in terms of provenance. We define the provenance of a result produced by a distributed system as the process that led to that result. This paper describes a protocol for recording documentation of a distributed system's execution. The distributed protocol guarantees that documentation with characteristics suitable for accurately determining the provenance of results is recorded. These characteristics are confirmed through a number of proofs based on an abstract state machine formalization.", "paper_title": "Recording Process Documentation for Provenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000268086400002"}
