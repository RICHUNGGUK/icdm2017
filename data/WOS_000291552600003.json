In this paper, we show that in fact the satistiability problem for this class of formulas is as hard as the reachability problem for Petri nets. Moreover, we salvage almost all of Yen's results by defining a fragment of this class of formulas for which the satisfiability problem is EXPSPACE-Complete by adapting his proof.", "paper_title": "ON YEN'S PATH LOGIC FOR PETRI NETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291552600003"}
