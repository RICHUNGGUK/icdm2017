This approach produces a kind of rule cooperation by means of the inference system, increasing the accuracy of the fuzzy system without losing its interpretability. We study the different alternatives for introducing parameters in the Inference System and analyze their interpretation and how they affect the rest of the components of the fuzzy system. We take into account three applications in order to analyze their accuracy in practice.
