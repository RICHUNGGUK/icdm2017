On the other hand, if we aim at extending the basic digital camera functionalities for such a purpose, post-processings will be of first importance, at least to improve the text legibility. In this paper, we address the specific problem of the virtual flattening of curved documents, as for example the pages of an opened book lying on its spine. In order to compute the document shape, we use the shape from shading technique and discuss why, in some cases, it is more suitable than other 3D single-view reconstruction techniques. We extend the seminal work by Wada et al. (Proceedings of the IAPR Workshop on machine vision and applications, Tokyo, Japan, pp. 591-594, 1992) and consecutive papers, reformulating the problem in terms of perspective shape from shading. Finally, we design a complete post-processing algorithm and test it on real images. Even if the documents are much curved, it is shown that the restored images are almost identical to scanned images of the flattened documents.", "paper_title": "Shape from shading for the digitization of curved documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000249919200004"}
