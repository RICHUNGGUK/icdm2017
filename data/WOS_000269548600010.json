This paper introduces a new method for 3D shape matching, which uses a simplified octree representation of 3D mesh models. The simplified octree representation was developed to improve time and space efficiency over prior representations. The proposed method also stores octree information in extensible markup language format, rather than in a new proprietary data file type, to facilitate comparing models over the Internet.", "paper_title": "Shape Similarity Matching With Octree Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000269548600010"}
