Each user tries to maximize his own utility function, which may be different from others. Sufficient conditions for the existence of an equilibrium point in this multi-objective optimization problem are identified. The methodology for analyzing this class of problems is illustrated by examples.", "paper_title": "Stability of distributed power and signature sequence control for CDMA systems - A game-theoretic framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000040"}
