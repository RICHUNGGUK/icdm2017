However, conventional depth cameras are incapable of imaging a translucent object which occupies a substantial portion of a real world scene. Such a limitation prohibits realistic imaging using depth cameras. In this work, we propose a new skewed stereo ToF camera for detecting and imaging translucent objects under minimal prior of environment We find that the depth calculation of a ToF camera with a translucent object presents a systematic distortion due to the superposed reflected light ray observation from multiple surfaces. We propose to use a stereo ToF camera setup and derive a generalized depth imaging formulation for translucent objects. Distorted depth value is refined using an iterative optimization. Experimental evaluation shows that our proposed method reasonably recovers the depth image of translucent objects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
