Rectangles arrive one by one. The decision of delivering the rectangles to a strip as well as packing them into the strip must be done immediately and irrevocably without any information on the next rectangles. Both randomized and deterministic online algorithms are investigated, all of which are guaranteed a constant competitive ratio. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
