We have constructed a new, flexible and intelligent distension system in which discomfort, pain and autonomic responses are recorded online. These responses can be fed back into the system in a regulatory loop and be used to shape the distension paradigm. Consequently, it is possible to take all subjects to a state of equal, although subjective, level of discomfort or pain, even though pressure, tension and volume might be totally different. By using a variable airflow, this new distension system can be effectively used in all kinds of paradigms, e.g. phasic, tonic, or ramp distensions or customized combinations of them. The system can be used to control pressure, volume or tension. A refinement of the system is that it is possible to automatically change the controlled entity during a distension, e.g. from an isobaric ramp directly into an isovolumetric tonic phase. Furthermore, the distension device allows double distensions with independent distension paradigms.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent distension system for hollow organs", "paper_id": "WOS:000245854700005"}
