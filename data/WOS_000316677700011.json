A large number of distributed software components are networked together through a task flow structure, and each component may have alternative algorithms among which it can choose to process tasks. However, the increased complexity and vulnerability to adverse events of such systems give rise to the need for more sophisticated yet scalable control mechanisms. In this study a control mechanism is designed to meet the need. First, stress environments are implicitly modeled by quantifying the resource availability of the system through sensors. Second, a mathematical programming model is built with the resource availability incorporated and with the stability in system behavior assured. Third, a multi-tier auction market is designed to solve the programming model by distributing computation and communication overheads. By periodically opening the auction market, the system can achieve desirable performance adaptively to changing stress environment while assuring stability and scalability properties. The control mechanism devised in this paper contributes to the efforts of managing the ever-increasing complexity of modern software systems.", "paper_title": "Distributed control for the networks of adaptive software components", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677700011"}
