Conventional RBDO methods are less than satisfactory in dealing with discrete design parameters and complex limit state functions (nonlinear and non-differentiable). Methods that are flexible enough to address the concerns above, however, come at a high computational cost. To enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing model flexibility, we propose a new RBDO framework: PS2, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Subset Simulation (SS). SS can efficiently estimate small failure probabilities, based on which SVM is adopted to evaluate the reliability of candidate solutions using binary classification. PSO is employed to solve the discrete optimization problem. Primary emphasis is placed upon the cooperation between SVM and PSO. The cooperation is mutually beneficial since the SVM classifier helps PSO evaluate the feasibility of solutions with high efficiency while the optimal solutions obtained by PSO assist in retraining the SVM classifier to attain better accuracy. The PS2 framework is implemented to find the optimal design of a ten-bar truss, whose component sizes are selected from a commercial standard. The reliability constraints are non-differentiable with two failure modes: yield stress and buckling stress. The interactive process between PSO and SVM contributes greatly to the success of the PS2 framework. It is shown that in various trials the PS2 framework consistently outperforms both the double-loop and single-loop approaches in terms of computational efficiency, solution quality, and model flexibility.", "paper_title": "Reliability-based design optimization with cooperation between support vector machine and particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000316214500003"}
