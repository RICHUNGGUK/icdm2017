Design/methodology/approach - The IPM motor design domain is discretized into a suitable equivalent graph representation and an Ant System (AS) algorithm is employed to achieve an efficient distribution of materials into this graph. Findings - The single-objective problems associated with the maximization of the torque and with the maximization of the shape smoothness of the IPM are investigated. The rotor of the device is discretized into a 9 x 18 grid in both cases, and three different materials are considered: air, iron and permanent magnet. Research limitations/implications - The graph representation used enables the solution of topological design problems with an arbitrary number of materials, which is relevant for 2 and 3D problems. Originality/value - From the numerical experiments, the AS algorithm was able to achieve reasonable shapes and torque values for both design problems. The results show the relevance of the mechanism for multi-domain topology optimization of electromagnetic devices.", "paper_title": "Ant colony optimization for the topological design of interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000017"}
