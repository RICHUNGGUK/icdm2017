How to build e-commerce applications based on the RosettaNet over the Grid infrastructure is what we are interested in this paper. We first introduce the RosettaNet and discuss the security strategy of the RosettaNet. Then, we look into the security issues of the Grid. Finally, we present how the security of RosettaNet can be improved, particularly, in the Grid environment.
