Based on winding function approach, the proposed model consists in computing self and mutual inductances considering no sinusoidal distribution of stator windings, slotting effect and no sinusoidal reluctance variation caused by the rotor saliency. Then, optimal current waveforms are determined for each rotor position by solving a second order equation to reduce torque ripple. These currents are used within a vector control scheme. Satisfactory agreement between simulation and experimental results is obtained. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
