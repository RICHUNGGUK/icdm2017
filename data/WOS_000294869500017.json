In this paper, we study semi-systolic and systolic implementations of the shifted polynomial basis multiplication and propose low time complexity semi-systolic and systolic array structures. We show that our proposed semi-systolic multiplier is faster than its existing counterparts available in the literature. Our application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of the proposed semi-systolic multiplier demonstrates that reduction in time complexity is achieved without imposing hardware overhead. Furthermore, our proposed systolic array shifted polynomial basis (SPB) multiplier has a low time complexity for general irreducible polynomials.", "paper_title": "Digit-Level Semi-Systolic and Systolic Structures for the Shifted Polynomial Basis Multiplication Over Binary Extension Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000294869500017"}
