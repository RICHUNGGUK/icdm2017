The program verification was conducted by checking the simulation results against experimental data and Gaussian Model and better agreements were obtained in comparison with the Gaussian model. The effects of meteorological and stack parameters on dispersion of pollutants like, wind velocity, ambient air temperature, atmospheric stability, exit temperature, velocity, concentration, and stack height can be easily studied using the program. Several illustrations for reducing maximum ground level concentrations using the program are given. The program can simulate all industrial stacks and only needs meteorological data and stack parameters. The outputs from the program are presented in graphical form. The program was designed to be user friendly and computationally efficient through the use of variable pollution grids, vectorized operations, and memory pre-allocation.
