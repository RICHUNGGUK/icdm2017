The FPKMC algorithm presented here is based on the method introduced in Oppelstrup et al. [10] and is implemented in a robust and flexible framework. Unlike standard KMC algorithms such as the n-fold algorithm, FPKMC is most efficient at low densities where it replaces the many small hops needed for reactants to find each other with large first-passage hops sampled from exact time-dependent Green's functions, without sacrificing accuracy. We describe in detail the key components of the algorithm, including the event-loop and the sampling of first-passage probability distributions, and demonstrate the accuracy of the new method. We apply the FPKMC algorithm to the challenging problem of simulation of long-term irradiation of metals, relevant to the performance and aging of nuclear materials in current and future nuclear power plants. The problem of radiation damage spans many decades of time-scales, from picosecond spikes caused by primary cascades, to years of slow damage annealing and microstructure evolution. Our implementation of the FPKMC algorithm has been able to simulate the irradiation of a metal sample for durations that are orders of magnitude longer than any previous simulations using the standard Object KMC or more recent asynchronous algorithms.
