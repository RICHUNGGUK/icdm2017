In this paper, a new iterative design flow for reconfigurable computing systems is proposed that integrates the synthesis and physical design phases to perform a static compilation process. We propose a new temporal partitioning algorithm for partitioning and scheduling, which attempts to decrease the time of reconfiguration on a partially reconfigurable hardware. In addition, we perform an incremental physical design process based on similar configurations produced in the partitioning stage. To validate the effectiveness of our methodology and algorithms, we developed a framework according to the proposed methodology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
