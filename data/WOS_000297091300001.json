Feature selection and tracking are performed in real-time, and used to train a template-based classifier during a capture phase prompted by the user. During normal operation, the system recognizes objects in the field of view based on their ranking. Severe resource constraints have prompted a re-evaluation of existing algorithms improving their performance (accuracy and robustness) as well as computational efficiency. We motivate the design choices in the implementation with a characterization of the stability properties of local invariant detectors, and of the conditions under which a template-based descriptor is optimal. The analysis also highlights the role of time as \"weak supervisor\" during training, which we exploit in our implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
