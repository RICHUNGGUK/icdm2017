The SAP reference model is a publically available model that contains more than 600 non-trivial process models expressed in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). We have automatically translated these EPCs into YAWL models and analyzed these models using WofYAWL, a verification tool based on Petri nets, in order to acquire knowledge about errors in large enterprise models. We discovered that at least 34 of these EPCs contain errors (i.e., at least 5.6% is flawed) and analyzed which parts of the SAP reference model contain most errors. This systematic analysis of the SAP reference model illustrates the need for verification tools such as WofYAWL.", "paper_title": "Faulty EPCs in the SAP reference model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100038"}
