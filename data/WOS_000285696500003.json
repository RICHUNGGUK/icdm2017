C-SPARQL queries consider windows, i.e., the most recent triples of such streams, observed while data is continuously flowing. Supporting streams in RDF format guarantees interoperability and opens up important applications, in which reasoners can deal with knowledge evolving over time. Examples of such application domains include real-time reasoning over sensors, urban computing, and social semantic data. In this paper, we present the C-SPARQL language extensions in terms of both syntax and examples. Finally, we discuss existing applications that already use C-SPARQL and give an outlook on future research opportunities.", "paper_title": "Querying RDF Streams with C-SPARQL", "paper_id": "WOS:000285696500003"}
