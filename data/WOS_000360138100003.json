Additionally, the process of performing context analysis on a specific company, although it may be done following a specific methodology, it is not a science which set in stone. Different approaches are possible, and the availability of new data sources, ranging from sensor data to web analytics data, can certainly enrich the process. However, there is a need for tools and methods, which can assist in tapping into these new data sources and extract relevant information that can assist enterprises in their context analysis process. The present paper proposes a framework that can assist in obtaining, filtering and processing relevant data from a variety of sources and in performing the necessary processing and reasoning to assist in performing a proper context analysis.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Enterprise Context Analysis Based on Semantic Principles", "paper_id": "WOS:000360138100003"}
