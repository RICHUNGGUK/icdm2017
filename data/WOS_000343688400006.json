Such problem is identified in Fast Moving Consumer Goods industry. The goal was to develop an algorithm for supporting dynamic production triggering decisions in relation with two supply chain key performance indicators: stock cover and customer service level. The presented approach is applied to a real example in several scenarios based on different decision criteria.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for Production Planning Based on Supply Chain KPIs", "paper_id": "WOS:000343688400006"}
