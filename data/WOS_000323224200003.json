The search complexity of a separating system is the minimum number of questions of type \"xaH?\" (where ) needed in the worst case to determine a hidden element xa[m]. If we receive the answer before asking a new question then we speak of the adaptive complexity, denoted by ; if the questions are all fixed beforehand then we speak of the non-adaptive complexity, denoted by . If we are allowed to ask the questions in at most k rounds then we speak of the k-round complexity of , denoted by . It is clear that . A group of problems raised by G.O.H. Katona is to characterize those separating systems for which some of these inequalities are tight. In this paper we are discussing set systems with the property for any ka parts per thousand yen3. We give a necessary condition for this property by proving a theorem about traces of hypergraphs which also has its own interest.", "paper_title": "Rounds in Combinatorial Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000323224200003"}
