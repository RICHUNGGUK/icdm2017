We define n-confusion as a concept for modeling the anonymity of a database table and we prove that n-confusion is a generalization of k-anonymity. After a short survey on the different available definitions of k-anonymity for graphs we provide a new definition for k-anonymous graph, which we consider to be the correct definition. We provide a description of the k-anonymous graphs, both for the regular and the non-regular case. We also introduce the more flexible concept of (k, l)-anonymous graph. Our definition of (k, l)-anonymous graph is meant to replace a previous definition of (k, l)-anonymous graph, which we here prove to have severe weaknesses. Finally, we provide a set of algorithms for k-anonymization of graphs.", "paper_title": "Reidentification and k-anonymity: a model for disclosure risk in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532700002"}
