However, its complexity is too high for practical implementation, especially when user population is large. To improve on this, semi-orthogonal user pairing (SUP) was suggested as an alternative. In this paper, two novel SUP algorithms, namely correlative angle-based SUP (CA-SUP) and Frobenius norm-based SUP (FN-SUP) algorithms are proposed. In view of the fact that ideal power control is difficult to implement, fixed power allocation (FPA) and adaptive power allocation (APA) constraints for the user pairing algorithms are introduced. Ergodic capacities for CA-SUP and FN-SUP algorithms with APA and FPA constraints, in terms of the numbers of users and antennas at Node-B, are evaluated and their capacity upper bounds are derived. Analysis and simulation results show that FN-SUP and CA-SUP algorithms requiring only limited channel state information (CSI) perform well and suit in particular for virtual V-MIMO systems.", "paper_title": "Multiuser Pairing-up Schemes under Power Constraints for Uplink Virtual MIMO Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275445400010"}
