The cornerstone of our framework is the use of choreography languages, which allow us to obtain correctness by construction. Workflow Patterns are also used as abstract tools to design real systems, while techniques based on abstract interpretation and on dynamic verification are integrated in our framework to reduce the complexity of verification.
