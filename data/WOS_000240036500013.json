In this paper, a new architecture, QUKU, is described which uses a coarse-grained reconfigurable PE array (CGRA) overlaid on an FPGA. The low-speed reconfigurability of the FPGA is used to optimize the CGRA for different applications, whilst the high-speed CGRA reconfiguration is used within an application for operator re-use. We will demonstrate the dynamic reconfigurability of QUKU by porting Sobel and Laplacian kernel for edge detection in an image frame.", "paper_title": "QUKU: A fast run time reconfigurable platform for image edge detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500013"}
