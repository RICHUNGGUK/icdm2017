The stochastic nature of involved processes such as X-ray photons generation, interaction with matter and detection makes MC the ideal tool for accurate modeling. MC calculations can be used to assess the impact of different physical design parameters on overall scanner performance, clinical image quality and absorbed dose assessment in CT examinations, which can be difficult or even impossible to estimate by experimental measurements and theoretical analysis. Simulations can also be used to develop and assess correction methods and reconstruction algorithms aiming at improving image quality and quantitative procedures. This paper focuses mainly on recent developments and future trends in X-ray CT MC modeling tools and their areas of application. An overview of existing programs and their useful features will be given together with recent developments in the design of computational anthropomorphic models of the human anatomy.
