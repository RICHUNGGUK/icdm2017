We generalize a method by Grigoriadis et al. to the case with weak approximate block solvers ( i.e., with only constant, logarithmic or even worse approximation ratios). Given an accuracy e. ( 0, 1), we show that our algorithm needs O( M( ln M + epsilon(-2) ln epsilon(-1))) calls to the block solver, a bound independent of the data and the approximation ratio of the block solver. For small approximation ratios the algorithm needs O( M( ln M + epsilon(-2))) calls to the block solver. As an application we study the problem of minimizing the maximum edge congestion in a multicast communication network. Interestingly the block problem here is the classical Steiner tree problem that can be solved only approximately. We show how to use approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problem to solve the multicast congestion problem approximately.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for general packing problems and their application to the multicast congestion problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000254203500007"}
