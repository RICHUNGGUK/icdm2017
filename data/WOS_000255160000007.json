Hence, a fundamental task is to complete a map of haplotypes (which identify SNPs) in the human population. Associated with this effort, a key computational problem is the inference of haplotype data from genotype data, since in practice genotype data rather than haplotype data is usually obtained. Different haplotype inference approaches have been proposed, including the utilization of statistical methods and the utilization of the pure parsimony criterion. The problem of haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP) is interesting not only because of its application to haplotype inference, but also because it is a challenging NP-hard problem, being APX-hard. Recent work has shown that a SAT-based approach is the most efficient approach for the problem of haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP), being several orders of magnitude faster than existing integer linear programming and branch and bound solutions. This paper provides a detailed description of SHIPs, a SAT-based approach for the HIPP problem, and presents comprehensive experimental results comparing SHIPs with all other exact approaches for the HIPP problem. These results confirm that SHIPs is currently the most effective approach for the HIPP problem.", "paper_title": "Haplotype inference with Boolean satisfiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000255160000007"}
