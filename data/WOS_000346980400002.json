In this paper, we explore [n, k, d] systematic error-correcting codes for rank modulation. Such codes have length n, k information symbols, and minimum distance d. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient information retrieval in conjunction with memory-scrubbing schemes. We study systematic codes for rank modulation under Kendall's t-metric as well as under the l(infinity)-metric. In Kendall's tau-metric, we present [k + 2, k, 3] systematic codes for correcting a single error, which have optimal rates, unless systematic perfect codes exist. We also study the design of multierror-correcting codes, and provide a construction of [k + t + 1, k, 2t + 1] systematic codes, for large-enough k. We use nonconstructive arguments to show that for rank modulation, systematic codes achieve the same capacity as general error-correcting codes. Finally, in the l(infinity)-metric, we construct two [n, k, d] systematic multierror-correcting codes, the first for the case of d = O(1) and the second for d = Theta(n). In the latter case, the codes have the same asymptotic rate as the best codes currently known in this metric.", "paper_title": "Systematic Error-Correcting Codes for Rank Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400002"}
