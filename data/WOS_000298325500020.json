This novel framework allows real-time 3-D segmentation since it reduces the dimensionality of the segmentation problem. In this paper, we propose a B-spline formulation of this approach, which further improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We also show that this framework allows evolving the active contour using local region-based terms, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original method while preserving computational speed. The feasibility of real-time 3-D segmentation is demonstrated using simulated and medical data such as liver computer tomography and cardiac ultrasound images.", "paper_title": "B-Spline Explicit Active Surfaces: An Efficient Framework for Real-Time 3-D Region-Based Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500020"}
