A polynomial is called stable if it has no zeros in the region of instability I > and robustly stable if it is stable and remains so under small variations of its coefficients. Inspired by the article Robust stability of multivariate polynomials. Part 1: Small coefficient perturbations by Kharitonov et al. (Multidimens Syst Signal Process 10(1):21-32, 1999), we generalise some of their results to arbitrary stability decompositions and develop some fundamental results on robustly stable polynomials. The central one of them is a characterisation of robust stability in terms of the stability of several other polynomials, which yields a test for robust stability based on stability tests. Finally, we consider the special situation that the region of instability is a Cartesian product and recover some results for the standard stability decompositions for linear partial differential resp. difference equations with constant coefficients.", "paper_title": "Robustly stable multivariate polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000312715000003"}
