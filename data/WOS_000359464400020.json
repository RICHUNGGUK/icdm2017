In this work, we apply two user selection schemes based on the orthogonality between the propagation channel of MSs. Indoor transmission experiments are carried out under several scenarios and the performances of user selection schemes are evaluated. It is shown that the transmission performance is improved and the user selection schemes are remarkably affected by the path loss between MSs.", "paper_title": "Experimental Evaluation of Low Complexity User Selection Schemes for Multi-User MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400020"}
