The developable surface in differential geometry shows the nice property. However it is difficult to fit developable surfaces to a boundary with complex shape. The technique presented in this paper can model a piecewise linear flattenable surface that interpolates the given boundary curve and approximates the cross-tangent normal vectors on the boundary. At first, an optimal planar polygonal region is computed from the given boundary curve B is an element of R(3), triangulated into a planar mesh surface, and warped into a mesh surface in R(3) satisfying the continuities defined on B. Then, the fitted mesh surface is further optimized into a flattenable Laplacian (FL) mesh, which preserves the positional continuity and minimizes the variation of cross-tangential normals. Assembled set of such FL mesh patches can be employed to model complex products fabricated from sheets Without stretching.", "paper_title": "Flattenable mesh surface fitting on boundary curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000256582700006"}
