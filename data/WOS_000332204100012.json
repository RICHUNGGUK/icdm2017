The norm-bounded uncertainties enter into the system in a randomly way, and such randomly occurring uncertainties (ROUs) obey certain Bernoulli distributed white noise sequence with known conditional probability. By constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the convergence of the estimation error for all discrete time-varying delays, ROUs and distributed sensor delays. Subsequently, the explicit form of the estimator parameter is derived by solving two linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily tested by using standard numerical software. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme.", "paper_title": "State estimation for a class of discrete nonlinear systems with randomly occurring uncertainties and distributed sensor delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000332204100012"}
