The gateways are then able to e.g. efficiently route queries which are only valid in particular regions of the deployment. The proposed algorithms combine coverage area reporting and geographical routing of queries which are injected by gateways. The combined solution is evaluated in terms of computational complexity and performance compared with existing geocasting protocols. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
