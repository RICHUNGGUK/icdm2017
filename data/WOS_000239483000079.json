Considering the image fuzzy generated in the process of image denoising in spatial field, the image denoising method based on wavelet neural network with orthonormal bases is elaborated. The denoising principle and construction method of orthonormal wavelet network is described. In the simulation experiment, median filtering, adaptive median filtering and sym wavelet neural network with orthonormal bases were used separately in the denoising for contaminated images. The experiment shows that, compared with traditional denoising method, image denoising method based on orthonormal wavelet neural network improves greatly the image quality and decreases the image ambiguity.", "paper_title": "The application of wavelet neural network with orthonormal bases in digital image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000079"}
