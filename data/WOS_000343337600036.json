By employing the Newton-Leibniz formulation and inequality technique, the controller with state or output coupling is designed to obtain global exponential synchronization of MNNs. The obtained delay-dependent conditions can be checked easily and they also enrich and improve the results in earlier publications. Finally, one numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
