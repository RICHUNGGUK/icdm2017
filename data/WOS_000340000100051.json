Based on a set of example poses, our approach can output its skeleton, joint positions, linear blend skinning weights, and corresponding bone transformations. The output can be directly used to set up skeleton-based animation in various 3D modeling and animation software as well as game engines. Specifically, we formulate the solving of a linear blend skinning model with a skeleton as an optimization with joint constraints and weight smoothness regularization, and solve it using an iterative rigging algorithm that (i) alternatively updates skinning weights, joint locations, and bone transformations, and (ii) automatically prunes redundant bones that can be generated by an over-estimated bone initialization. Due to the automatic redundant bone pruning, our approach is more robust than existing example-based rigging approaches. Furthermore, in terms of rigging accuracy, even with a single set of parameters, our approach can soundly outperform state of the art methods on various types of experimental datasets including humans, quadrupled animals, and highly deformable models.", "paper_title": "Robust and Accurate Skeletal Rigging from Mesh Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100051"}
