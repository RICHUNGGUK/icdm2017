A feed-forward, backpropagation, artificial neural network has been trained for this purpose using a custom-developed, regular express ion-based, text-to-phone transcription engine to generate training patterns. Initial experimental results show the expected properties of language independence and in-system learning capability of this approach. The ANN demonstrates the capacity to generalize and map the words missing at training time, as well as to reduce contradictions related to different pronunciations for the same word.
