Nevertheless, the issue of pairwise constraints has not been well studied in the recently proposed maximum margin clustering (MMC), which extends the maximum margin framework in supervised learning for clustering and often shows a promising performance. This paper therefore proposes a pairwise constrained MMC algorithm. Based on the maximum margin idea in MMC, we propose a set of effective loss functions for discouraging the violation of given pairwise constraints. For the resulting optimization problem, we show that the original nonconvex problem in our approach can be decomposed into a sequence of convex quadratic program problems via constrained concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Subsequently, we present an efficient subgradient projection optimization method to solve each convex problem in the CCCP sequence. Experiments on a number of real-world data sets show that the proposed constrained MMC algorithm is scalable and outperforms the existing constrained MMC approach as well as the typical semi-supervised clustering counterparts.", "paper_title": "Semi-Supervised Maximum Margin Clustering with Pairwise Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000301746800012"}
