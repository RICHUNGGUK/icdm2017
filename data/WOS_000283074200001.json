Traditional OLAP models (such as ROLAP and MOLAP) are not sufficient to answer queries for complex applications. In this research, we extend the traditional multidimensional model and OLAP operations with an object relational multidimensional model. We also discuss how to implement the object relational multidimensional model on top of a relational database.", "paper_title": "A MODEL FOR OBJECT RELATIONAL OLAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000283074200001"}
