In this paper, we propose an approach to determining the semantic similarity. This approach takes into consideration the similarity between two entities and their similarity reflected in context. Furthermore, the approach provides an efficient Tabu Search algorithm combined with multi-objective programming algorithm to improve the precision. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
