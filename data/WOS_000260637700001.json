Five (5) image enhancement algorithms were tested introducing the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), the local range modification (LRM) and the redundant discrete wavelet (RDW) linear stretching and shrinkage algorithms. CAD tuning optimization was targeted to the percentage of the most contrasted pixels and the size of the minimum detectable object which could satisfactorily represent a microcalcification. The highest performance in two mammographic datasets, were achieved for LRM (A(Z) = 0.932) and the wavelet-based linear stretching (AZ = 0.926) methodology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
