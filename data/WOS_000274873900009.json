First, it is shown that the regression vector space of a mechanical system switched by the magnitude of velocity cannot be separated by a hyperplane. Then a method based on support vector machines with a polynomial kernel is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulations and experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
