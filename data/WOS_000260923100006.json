The design and analysis of the presented method just depends on the I/O data of the freeway traffic system without requiring any other priori of the control system. Furthermore, the control input learning law is extended to a higher-order form by incorporating more control information of previous sampling instants for improving the control performance. Both convergence analysis and simulation results illustrate the validity of the presented methods.", "paper_title": "A MODEL-FREE ADAPTIVE CONTROL APPROACH FOR FREEWAY TRAFFIC DENSITY VIA RAMP METERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100006"}
