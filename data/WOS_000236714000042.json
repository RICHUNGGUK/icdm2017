The starting point of this analysis is the optimal Cambanis expansion of the stochastic process considered. Likewise, the extensions of the approximate series expansions based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method are presented for such linear operations on the process. The main advantages of these extensions are that they are computationally feasible and entail a significant reduction in the computational burden. Finally, their applicability as a practical simulation tool is examined.", "paper_title": "Approximate series representations of linear operations on second-order stochastic processes: Application to simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000042"}
