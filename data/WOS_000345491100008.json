By predicting exogenous events from human intention and generating proactive plans based on the predicted events, a robot can reduce delays and significantly improve interaction. In this paper, we propose a decision-theoretic proactive planning framework that selects best proactive actions and the best times for those actions as a means to improving human-robot interactions. To this end, we developed a composite node temporal Bayesian network as an extension to handle both the nature of an event and its time of occurrence within a single framework. We also developed a composite node temporal influence diagram that combines a composite node temporal Bayesian network with a limited memory influence diagram to solve proactive planning problems. Experimental results obtained using a robot assistant in a manual assembly task demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
