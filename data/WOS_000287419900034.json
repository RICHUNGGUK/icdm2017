The proposed system is constituted of three parts: information acquisition system, fuel consumption forecasting algorithm and performance evaluation. Although there are many factors which will effect the fuel consumption of a car in a practical drive procedure, however, in the present system the impact factors for fuel consumption are simply decided as make of car, engine style, weight of car, vehicle type and transmission system type which are used as input information for the neural network training and fuel consumption forecasting procedure. In the fuel consumption forecasting, to verify the effect of the proposed predictive system, an artificial neural network with back-propagation neural network has a learning capability for car fuel consumption prediction. The prediction results demonstrated that the proposed system using neural network is effective and the performance is satisfactory in fuel consumption prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
