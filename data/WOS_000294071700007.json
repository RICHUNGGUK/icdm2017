We develop spread-theoretic tools to determine when finite planes admit coordinatization by fractional semifields, and to find such semifields when they exist. We use our results to show that such semifields exist for prime powers 3 (n) whenever n is an odd integer divisible by 5 or 7.", "paper_title": "Fractional dimensions in semifields of odd order", "paper_id": "WOS:000294071700007"}
