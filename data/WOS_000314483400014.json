We examine the problem of off-line scheduling in the presence of such forbidden zones. The problem is closely related to a one-dimensional open-end bin packing problem. We prove that the decision version of the problem is strongly NP-complete and then establish bounds on the asymptotic performance ratio of an O(n log n) approximation algorithm for a special case, and test it numerically. We present a further heuristic for a non-regular case and test it empirically. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
