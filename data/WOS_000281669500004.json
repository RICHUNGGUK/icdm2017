The system was built for the use in the breast surgery with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as the means of the treatment. A number of different control strategies such as PID and model-based control were incorporated into a family of controllers to create the hybrid control. Depending on the objective, the supervisory control determines the type of controller used for the specified task so as to maximize the advantages of each of the controllers. Before it was implemented into the actual robotic system the then proposed control approach was modeled and simulated using MatlabA (R). This control approach was developed based on a review of popular control approaches used in medical robotic systems, in order to look at the feasibility of having a uniform control strategy for a spectrum of medical robotic system. With unified control strategy it is possible to have a safety standard regulation for the medical robotic systems which is currently difficult to be done because of various control strategies adopted by each of the medical robotic systems.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Control Approach for Non-invasive Medical Robotic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281669500004"}
