Unlike physical records such as paper-based records, identifying, collecting, and analyzing digital records require technical knowledge and tools that are not found in archival institutions. As a result, archival institutions face challenges in their attempt to collect digital archives. One approach to overcome this problem is for archival institutions to use digital forensic knowledge and technologies. In this paper, we propose the Digital Archive Management System that integrates digital forensic technologies and archival information management systems to acquire, identify, analyze, and manage digital records in archival intuitions.", "paper_title": "Secure and reliable electronic record management system using digital forensic technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000342468200010"}
