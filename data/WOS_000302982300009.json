The results reveal that multi-channel retailers' trust is transferred from the offline channel to the online channel. Secondly, the customers' initial interaction with the retailers ameliorates the effects of non-direct experience, such as Internet-based structural assurance and word-of-mouth. With increases in product uncertainty, the effects of word-of-mouth, offline trust, and efficacy of sanctions on online trust are greater for experience products than for search products.
