This work explores how well the ideal RAM performance can be approximated, for significant classes of computations, by machines whose building blocks have constant size and are connected at a constant distance. A novel memory structure is proposed, which is pipelined (can accept a new request at each cycle) and hierarchical, exhibiting optimal latency a(x)=O(x(1/d)) to address x, in d-dimensional realizations. In spite of block-transfer or other memory-pipeline capabilities, a number of previous machine models do not achieve a full overlap of memory accesses. These are examples of machines with explicit data movement. It is shown that there are direct-flow computations (without branches and indirect accesses) that require time superlinear in the number of instructions, on all such machines. To circumvent the explicit-data-movement constraints, the Speculative Prefetcher (SP) and the Speculative Prefetcher and Evaluator (SPE) processors are developed. Both processors can execute any direct-flow program in linear time. The SPE also executes in linear time a class of loop programs that includes many significant algorithms. Even quicksort, a somewhat irregular, recursive algorithm admits a linear-time SPE implementation. A relation between instructions called address dependence is introduced, which limits memory-access overlap and can lead to superlinear time, as illustrated with the classical merging algorithm.", "paper_title": "On Approximating the Ideal Random Access Machine by Physical Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000270098500003"}
