The contact map pattern matching (CMPM) problem is to decide if a contact map (called the pattern) is a substructure of another contact map (called the target). In general, the problem is NP-hard, but when there are restrictions on the form of the pattern, the problem can, in some case, be solved in polynomial time. In particular, a polynomial time algorithm has been proposed [1] for the case when the patterns are so-called crossing contact maps. In this paper we show that the problem is actually NP-hard, and show a flaw in the proposed polynomial-time algorithm. Through the same method, we also show that a related problem, namely, the 2-interval patten matching problem with {<,()}-structured patterns and disjoint interval ground set, is NP-hard.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of the crossing contact map pattern matching problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125600022"}
