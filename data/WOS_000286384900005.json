In this paper, we present a new simultaneous escape routing algorithm which is based upon a novel boundary routing approach. Our algorithm can solve complicated escape problems in a very short time. For a set of industrial escape problems, our algorithm successfully solved all of them while Cadence Allegro PCB router was only able to complete the routing of half of the problems. In addition, we propose a clustering strategy targeting at large escape routing problems. Experimental results show that this clustering strategy can significantly cut down the runtime of our router when solving large problems.", "paper_title": "A New Strategy for Simultaneous Escape Based on Boundary Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000286384900005"}
