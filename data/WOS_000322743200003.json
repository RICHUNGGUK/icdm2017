LES is carried out by using a higher order finite-difference method. The effects of different vortex orientation models and subgrid turbulence spectrums are assessed through comparisons of the LES predictions against DNS. Three Reynolds numbers 12000, 18000, and 22000 are studied. Good agreement with the DNS data for the mean and fluctuating quantities is observed.
