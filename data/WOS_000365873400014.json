These ciphers are designed to perform excellently on both hardware and software platforms. In this paper, we mainly present zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis on various versions of SIMON. Firstly, by using missin-the-middle approach, we construct zero-correlation linear distinguishers of SIMON, and zero-correlation linear attacks are presented based on careful analysis of key recovery phase. Secondly, multidimensional zero-correlation linear attacks are used to reduce the data complexity. Our zero-correlation linear attacks perform better than impossible differential attacks proposed by Abed et al. in ePrint Report 2013/568. Finally, we also use the divide-and-conquer technique to improve the results of linear cryptanalysis proposed by Javad et al. in ePrint Report 2013/663.", "paper_title": "Zero-Correlation Linear Cryptanalysis of Reduced-Round SIMON", "paper_id": "WOS:000365873400014"}
