The HWZ score-based virtual screening approach was tested against the compounds for 40 protein targets available in the Database of Useful Decoys (DUD; dud.docking.org/jahn/), and the virtual screening performance was evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUG), enrichment factor (EF), and hit rate (HR), demonstrating an improved overall performance compared to other popularly used approaches examined. In particular, the HWZ score-based virtual screening led to an average AUC value of 0.84 +/- 0.02 (95% confidence interval) for the 40 targets. The average HR values at the top 1% and 10% of the active compounds for the 40 targets were 46.3% +/- 6.7% and 59.2% +/- 4.7%, respectively. In addition, the performance of the HWZ score-based virtual screening approach is less sensitive to the choice of the target.", "paper_title": "Ligand-Based Virtual Screening Approach Using a New Scoring Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000303038000010"}
