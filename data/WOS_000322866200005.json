This paper considers the optimal standby element sequencing problem (SESP) for such systems. Given the desired cold-standby redundancy level and fixed set of element choices, the objective of the optimal system design is to select the initiation sequence of the system elements so as to minimize the expected system mission cost while meeting a certain level of system reliability constraint. Based on a discrete approximation of time-to-failure distributions of the system elements, the system reliability and expected mission cost are evaluated simultaneously using a numerical method. A genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool for solving the formulated SESP problem for k-out-of-n: G heterogeneous cold-standby systems. Examples are given to illustrate the considered problem and the proposed solution methodology.", "paper_title": "Sequencing Optimization in k-out-of-n Cold-Standby Systems Considering Mission Cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000322866200005"}
