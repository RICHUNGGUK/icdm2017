However, for the application of video semantic annotation in multilabel setting, these methods neglect an important characteristic of video data: The semantic concepts appear correlatively and interact naturally with each other rather than exist in isolation. In this paper, we adapt this semantic correlation into graph-based semisupervised learning and propose a novel method named correlative linear neighborhood propagation to improve annotation performance. Experiments conducted on the Text REtrieval Conference VIDeo retrieval evaluation data set have demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Correlative Linear Neighborhood Propagation for Video Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500009"}
