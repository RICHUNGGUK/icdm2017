Since current CF systems estimate the ratings of not-yet-rated items based on other items' ratings, these CF systems fail to recommend products when users' preferences are not expressed in numbers. In many practical situations, however, users' preferences are represented by ranked lists rather than numbers, such as lists of movies ranked according to users' preferences. Therefore, this study proposes a novel collaborative filtering methodology for product recommendation when the preference of each user is expressed by multiple ranked lists of items. Accordingly, a four-staged methodology is developed to predict the rankings of not-yet-ranked items for the active user. Finally, a series of experiments is performed, and the results indicate that the proposed methodology produces high-quality recommendations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
