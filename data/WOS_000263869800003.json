This leads to the use of conical springs as they are able to telescope. Designers of mechanical systems can call on a large number of tools to assist them though most of these are merely validation tools requiring concomitant trial and error strategies. Optimization strategies can be applied to provide synthesis assistance tools for which the designer simply specifies his requirement. Thus the tool directly indicates the spring best suited to standards and requirements. Recent advances in the study of constant pitch conical springs have provided analytical expressions of their behavior even in the non-linear phase. Considering this, we have used optimization strategies to provide a synthesis tool for conical spring design. An example of application is presented. The tool introduced here is thus a synthesis assistance tool that can be of considerable interest for designers who require a conical spring in their design.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of conical springs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263869800003"}
