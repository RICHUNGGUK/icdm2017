A symbolic fault simulation algorithm is proposed to exploit bit-level parallelism in order to represent the propagation of the output value of faulty cells throughout the circuit, thus accounting for different faulty behaviours in a single simulation step. A satisfiability (SAT)-based test generation procedure is also provided and it early discovers sets of undetectable behaviours. Results for a set of combinational benchmarks show the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Efficient testing of multi-output combinational cells in nano-complementary metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000331699600003"}
