Among them, cluster detection techniques are of major importance. Although these techniques have already been largely explored in the scientific literature, there are at least two important open issues: the existent algorithms are not scalable for large high-dimensional datasets, and the unsupervised nature of traditional data clustering makes it very difficult to generate meaningful clusters. This article presents an overview of the strategies being explored in order to deal more deeply with these issues. Moreover, it describes a new semi-supervised clustering strategy that exemplifies the integration of several approaches and that can be employed with partitioning algorithms, such as PAM and Clarans. The technique addresses an improvement to these types of algorithms, which is obtained by using must-link feedback information provided by the users in an interactive and visual environment.
