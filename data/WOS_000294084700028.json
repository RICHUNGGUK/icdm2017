Firstly, we introduce the basic concepts a VPRS model encompasses, and the approach of VPRS-based GDM. Next, using a mathematical programming approach, we derive the optimal beta(k)-stable interval for DMk. Then. an application in petroleum project investment risk management, including risk-based project selection and risk ranking, is investigated. The results suggest that beta(k)-stable intervals have significant impacts on risk management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
