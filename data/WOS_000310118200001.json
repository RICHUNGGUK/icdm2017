There has been many related work proposed to address the data aggregation. However, very few of them focus on data integrity. An attacker can simply forge data to affect the decision of the base station via compromised nodes. Moreover, previous data aggregation protocols do not consider outlier data. Some emergent events cause outlier data will be ignored. We, therefore, propose a lightweight secure data aggregation protocol to resist attacks and handle outlier data. The detailed security analyses and simulation results will show that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "A LIGHTWEIGHT SECURE DATA AGGREGATION PROTOCOL FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118200001"}
