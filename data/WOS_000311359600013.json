We introduce successive projections onto incoherent manifolds (SPIN), a first-order projected gradient method to recover the signal components. Despite the non-convex nature of the recovery problem and the possibility of underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components, provided that the signal manifolds are incoherent and that the measurement operator satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. SPIN significantly extends the scope of current recovery models and algorithms for low-dimensional linear inverse problems and matches (or exceeds) the current state of the art in terms of performance.", "paper_title": "Signal Recovery on Incoherent Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000311359600013"}
