Even when this is done, the dynamics remain complex. We utilize a Stochastic Cellular Automata model to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary dynamics involved in the origin of new species, specifically focusing on rapid speciation in an island metapopulation environment. The effects of reproductive isolation, mutation, migration, spatial structure, and extinction on the emergence of new species are all studied numerically within this context.", "paper_title": "CA simulation of biological evolution in genetic hyperspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300001"}
