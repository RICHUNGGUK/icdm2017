In such a formula, each variable occurs only a constant number of times, and each subformula computes a multilinear polynomial. Our algorithm runs in time s(O(1)) center dot n(kO(k)), where s denotes the size of the formula, n denotes the number of variables, and k bounds the number of occurrences of each variable. Before our work, no subexponential-time deterministic algorithm was known for this class of formulae. We also present a deterministic algorithm that works in a blackbox fashion and runs in time n(kO(k)+O(k log n)) in general, and time n(kO(k2)+O(kD)) for depth D. Finally, we extend our results and allow the inputs to be replaced with sparse polynomials. Our results encompass recent deterministic identity tests for sums of a constant number of read-once formulae and for multilinear depth-four formulae.", "paper_title": "DETERMINISTIC POLYNOMIAL IDENTITY TESTS FOR MULTILINEAR BOUNDED-READ FORMULAE", "paper_id": "WOS:000368433700001"}
