Recently, two natural advantages of opportunistic routing, i.e., path diversity and the improvement of transmission reliability, are exploited to develop a lifetime-extended opportunistic routing for wireless sensor networks. Besides, asynchronous sleep-wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to reduce energy consumption by appropriately arranging sensor nodes to sleep. Hence, in this paper, we propose a joint design of asynchronous sleep-wake schedules and opportunistic routing, called ASSORT, to maximize the network lifetime. Simulation results show that ASSORT effectively achieves network lifetime extension compared with other routing schemes.", "paper_title": "Joint Design of Asynchronous Sleep-Wake Scheduling and Opportunistic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338511000019"}
