A finite volume method, second-order accurate in space and time, employing non-staggered arrangement of the variables with momentum interpolation for the pressure-velocity coupling is developed. Global mode analysis predicts Re(cr) = 39.9 which confirms the results of earlier studies. Vortex shedding phenomena is found to be similar to the square cylinder with no second bifurcation in the range of Re studied. A discussion on the time-averaged drag coefficient, rms of lift coefficient and Strouhal number is presented. Particle tracking and the instantaneous streaklines provide an excellent means of visualizing the von Karman vortex street.
