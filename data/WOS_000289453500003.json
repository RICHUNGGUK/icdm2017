Although all components of the eye are important to perceive visual information, the retina is a fundamental part of the visual system. In this work we study the spatial relations between neuronal mosaics in the retina. These relations have shown its importance to investigate possible constraints or connectivities between different spatially colocalized populations of neurons, and to explain how visual information spreads along the layers before being sent to the brain. We introduce the V-Proportion, a method based on the Voronoi diagram to study possible spatial interactions between two neuronal mosaics. Results in simulations as well as in real data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to detect spatial relations between neurons in different layers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
