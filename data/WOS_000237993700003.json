We apply these measures to five queries that were monitored daily for two periods of 14 or 21 days each. Rankings of the different search engines (Google, Yahoo! and Teoma for text searches and Google, Yahoo! and Picsearch for image searches) are compared on a daily basis, in addition to longitudinal comparisons of the same engine for the same query over time. The results and rankings of the two periods are compared as well. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
