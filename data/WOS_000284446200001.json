The parametric active membrane evolves in image space and splits into multiple membranes. The shape of the membrane can be constrained according to the shape of the objects present in a scene. We have shown that this active membrane model is also suitable for segmenting images of touching objects. The proposed segmentation technique unifies the membrane evolution and membrane splitting process. The methodology is tested for a number of real images from biomedical and machine vision domains that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
