This hybrid algorithm uses the operators such as mutation, traditional or classical crossover, multiple-crossover, and PSO formula. The selection of these operators in each iteration for each particle or chromosome is based on a fuzzy probability. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm for solving both single and multi-objective optimization problems is challenged by using of some well-known benchmark problems. Obtained numerical results are compared with those of other optimization algorithms. At the end, the proposed multi-objective hybrid algorithm is used for the Pareto optimal design of a five-degree of freedom vehicle vibration model. The comparison of the obtained results with it in the literature demonstrates the superiority of this work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
