The addition of water caused the phen ligands to deviate slightly from the U-2(mu(2)-F)(2) plane, and red-shifts the U-F-terminal and U = O stretching vibrations. Four types of hydrogen bonds are present in the optimized hydrated A center dot (H2O)(n) complexes; their energies were calculated to fall within the range 4.37-6.77 kcal mol(-1), comparable to the typical values of 5.0 kcal mol(-1) reported for hydrogen bonds. An aqueous environment simulated by explicit and/or implicit models lowers and re-arranges the orbitals of the bis-uranyl complex.", "paper_title": "Relativistic theoretical studies on hydrogen bonds and the electronic structure of aqueous solvated bis(uranyl) complex: an insight into explicit and/or implicit solvent effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600038"}
