We study the following extremal problem for geometric graphs: How many arbitrary edges can be removed from a complete geometric graph with n vertices such that the remaining graph still contains a certain non-crossing subgraph. The non-crossing subgraphs that we consider are perfect matchings, subtrees of a given size, and triangulations. In each case, we obtain tight bounds on the maximum number of removable edges.", "paper_title": "Edge-Removal and Non-Crossing Configurations in Geometric Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275225700002"}
