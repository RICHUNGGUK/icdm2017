This paper shows that applying bootstrap to data envelopment analysis (DEA) before performing classification and regression trees (CART) increase the quality of the results. In particular, employing data on the Italian Health System, the paper highlights that bias corrected DEA allows to individuate variables affecting health efficiency which would remain undiscovered when the traditional DEA model is applied.
