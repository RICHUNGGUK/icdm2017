Despite the flurry of recent results on IB key-insulated encryption (IBKIE) and signature (IBKIS), a problem regarding the security and efficiency of practicing IBKIE and IBKIS as a joint IB key-insulated signature/encryption scheme with a common set of parameters and keys remains open. To deal with the above question, we propose an identity-based key-insulated signcryption (IBKISC) scheme. Compared with the Sign-then-Encrypt (StE) and Encrypt-then-Sign (EtS) using IBKIE and IBKIS in the standard model, our proposed IBKISC scheme is the fastest with the shortest ciphertext size.", "paper_title": "Identity-Based Key-Insulated Signcryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000302509500002"}
