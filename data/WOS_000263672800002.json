The estimation accuracy of these changes determines the effectiveness of the resulting zoom control. The existing method of choice for real-time target scale estimation applies structure from motion (SFM) based on the weak perspective projection model. In this paper we propose a target scale estimation algorithm with a linear solution based on the more advanced paraperspective projection model, which improves the accuracy of scale estimation by considering center offset. Another key issue in SFM based algorithms is the separation of target and background features, especially when composite camera (pan/tilt/zoom) and target motions are involved. This paper designs a fast target feature separation/grouping algorithm, the 3D affine shape method. The resulting separation automatically adapts to the target's 3D geometry and motion and is able to accommodate a large amount of off-plane rotation, which most existing separation/grouping algorithms find difficult to achieve. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scale estimation and feature separation algorithms in tracking translating and rotating objects with a PTZ camera while preserving their sizes. In comparison with the leading size preserving tracking algorithm described by Tordoff and Murray, our algorithm is able to reduce the cumulative tracking error significantly from 17.4% to 3.3%.", "paper_title": "3D Target Scale Estimation and Target Feature Separation for Size Preserving Tracking in PTZ Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000263672800002"}
