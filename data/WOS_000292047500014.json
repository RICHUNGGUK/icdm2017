A solution to this problem consists of the mapping of tasks to processors and the scheduling of tasks on each processor. Optimal solution can be obtained by exploring the entire design space of all possible mapping and scheduling choices. Since the problem is NP-hard, scalability becomes the main concern in solving the problem optimally. In this paper, a SAT-based optimization framework is proposed to address this problem, in which SAT solver is enhanced by integrating with a scheduling analysis tool in a branch and bound manner to prune the solution space efficiently. Performance evaluation results show that our technique has average performance improvement in more than an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We further build a cycle-accurate network-on-chip simulator based on SystemC to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique on realistic multiprocessor systems.", "paper_title": "Satisfiability Modulo Graph Theory for Task Mapping and Scheduling on Multiprocessor Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292047500014"}
