Such identification plays a crucial role in service workflow. The success of a service workflow requires the composition of services where requirements must be satisfied. However, the large-scale open environment of today's Internet poses significant challenges for efficient compliance checking algorithms of those requirements. This paper is based on the previous progressive work on Service Workflow Specification language (SWSpec), the uniformed representation of requirements, and the compliance checking algorithms based on Constrained Truth Table (CTT) and Exclusive Disjunctive Normal Form (EDNF). In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed, which significantly reduces the cost of time complexity. In some cases, this algorithm is able to run in polynomial time. Experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms.", "paper_title": "A New Approach for Compliance Checking in Service Workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800059"}
