This problem is known as the constraint satisfaction problem CSP(Gamma) for the template Gamma and has been intensively studied for finite Gamma. We show that - as in the case of finite Gamma - the computational complexity of CSP(Gamma) for countable homogeneous Gamma is determined by the clone of polymorphisms of Gamma. To this end we prove the following theorem, which is of independent interest: the primitive positive definable relations over an omega-categorical structure Gamma are precisely the relations that are preserved by the polymorphisms of Gamma. If the age of Gamma is given by a finite number of finite forbidden induced substructures, then CSP(Gamma) is in NP. We use a classification result by Cherlin and prove that in this case every constraint satisfaction problem for a countable homogeneous digraph is either tractable or NP-complete.", "paper_title": "Constraint satisfaction with countable homogeneous templates", "paper_id": "WOS:000237931300003"}
