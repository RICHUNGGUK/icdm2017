Design/methodology/approach - Forms regarding semi-equivalence classes as primitives, blocks or granules such as tolerance class, join class, meet class, optimist/pessimist selected compatible class, and tolerantly kernel class in an incomplete information system are defined and compared. Different approximations are also introduced. Furthermore, diverse coverings are also suggested. Findings - A tolerance class of an object is proved to be the join of semi-equivalence classes containing it, i.e. a result of acting union operation on some primitive classes. A compatibly kernel class of an object is a meet of semi-equivalence classes including it, i.e. a result of acting intersection operation on some primitive classes. Related coverings can also be regarded as coverings derived from the covering consisting of primitive granules. Several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for a general covering to become a semi-equivalence or complete covering are obtained. Meaningful property and relationship results are also exploited. Practical implications - Constructing diverse granules naturally from an incomplete information system to form a different knowledge expression system looks promising for data mining in the information society. It widens the approach and schema. Originality/value - The paper shows that the formation process of granules is natural, newly defined, and not similar and theoretic to those existing in a neighborhood system. The relationship between diverse granules and coverings is described by mathematical theorems in sufficient or necessary condition form.", "paper_title": "On blocks and coverings based on semi-equivalence relation in pansystems methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257527800004"}
