In this paper, a new methodology for knowledge discovery in geographic portals is presented. Based on the Semantic Web, our approach exploits the Resource Description Framework (RDF) in order to describe the geoportal's information with ontology-based metadata. When users traverse from page to page in the portal, they take advantage of the metadata infrastructure to navigate easily through data of interest. New metadata descriptions are published in the geoportal according to the RDF schemas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
