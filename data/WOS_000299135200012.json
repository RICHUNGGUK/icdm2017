Then, we apply the achieved results to the groups of reciprocal and consistent matrices over divisible Abelian linearly ordered groups; this allows us to deal with the problem of deriving a weighting ranking for the alternatives from a pairwise comparison matrix. The proposed weighting vector has several advantages; it satisfies, for instance, the independence of scale-inversion condition.", "paper_title": "Deriving weights from a pairwise comparison matrix over an alo-group", "paper_id": "WOS:000299135200012"}
