This paper develops a radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN) nonlinear prediction model based adaptive PID controller for SRM. ANN, under certain condition, can approximate any nonlinear function with arbitrary precision. It also has a strong ability of adaptive, self-learning and self-organization. So, combining it with the conventional PID controller, a neural network based adaptive PID controller can be developed. Appling it to the speed control of SRM, a good control performance can be gotten. At the same time, the nonlinear mapping property and high parallel operation ability of ANN make it suitable to be applied to establish nonlinear prediction model performing parameter prediction. In this paper, two ANN - NNC and NNI are employed. The former is a back propagation (BP) ANN with sigmoid activation function. The later is an ANN using RBF as activation function. The former is used to adaptively adjust the parameters of the PID controller on line. The later is used to establish nonlinear prediction model performing parameter prediction. Compared with BP ANN with sigmoid activation function, the RBF ANN has a more fast convergence speed and can avoid getting stuck in a local optimum. Through parameter prediction, response speed of the system can be improved. To increase the convergence speed of ANN, an adaptive learning algorithm is adopted in this paper that is to adjust the leaming rate according to the error. This can increase the convergence speed of ANN and make the system response quick. The experimental results demonstrate that a high control performance is achieved. The system responds quickly with little overshoot. The steady state error is zero. The system shows robust performance to the load torque disturbance.", "paper_title": "RBF ANN Nonlinear prediction model based adaptive PID control of switched reluctance motor drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000069"}
