To significantly increase computational efficiency, the classical isotropic Gaussian filters are first used for quickly estimating an approximate direction along an edge; then our filter is applied to more accurately search edge-line segment direction by a few directional filter masks only near such approximate direction. By comparing the proposed filter with the isotropic Gaussian filters, we analyze two improvement factors associated with the localization and SNR of the proposed filter. Experimental results show that the proposed detector can achieve better performance than several existing edge-detection methods in the sense of noise reduction, good localization, and high edge continuity.
