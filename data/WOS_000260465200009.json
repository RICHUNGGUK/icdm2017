Neighborhoods are modeled as samples of a multivariate Gaussian density that are modulated and rotated according to the values of two hidden random variables, thus allowing the model to adapt to the local amplitude and orientation of the signal. A third hidden variable selects between this oriented process and a nonoriented scale mixture of Gaussians process, thus providing adaptability to the local orientedness of the signal. Based on this model, we develop an optimal Bayesian least squares estimator for denoising images and show through simulations that the resulting method exhibits significant improvement over previously published results obtained with Gaussian scale mixtures.", "paper_title": "Image Modeling and Denoising With Orientation-Adapted Gaussian Scale Mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000260465200009"}
