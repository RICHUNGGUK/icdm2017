In this scenario. FAQ retrieval is the area of study concerned with recovering the most relevant Question/Answer pairs contained in FAQ compilations. Despite the amount of effort that has been devoted to investigate FAQ retrieval methods, how to create an maintain high quality FAQs has received less attention. In this article, we propose an entire framework to use, create and maintain intelligent FAQs. Usage mining techniques have been developed to take advantage of usage information in order to provide FAQ managers with meaningful information to improve their FAQs. Usage mining techniques include weaknesses detection and knowledge gaps discovery. In this way, the management of the FAQ is no longer directed only by expert knowledge but also by users requirements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
