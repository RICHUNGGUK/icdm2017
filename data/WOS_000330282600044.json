Consistency is proven for the composite classifiers that result from a regularization achieved by restricting the 1-norm of the base classifiers' weights. The less restrictive nature of sampling considered here is manifested in the consistency result through a generalized condition on the growth of the regularization parameter. The weaker the sample dependence, the faster the regularization parameter is allowed to grow with increasing sample size. A consistency result is also provided for data-dependent choices of the regularization parameter.", "paper_title": "Convergence and Consistency of Regularized Boosting With Weakly Dependent Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600044"}
