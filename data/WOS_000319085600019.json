A method of recursive second-order cone programming is proposed to design the uniform DFT modulated analysis filter banks, with a small in-band aliasing error and low group delay. Simulation results show that the noise controlling performance is improved with small residual noise power spectra, a high noise attenuation level and fast convergence rate.", "paper_title": "Delayless Subband Adaptive Filter for Active Wideband Noise Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600019"}
