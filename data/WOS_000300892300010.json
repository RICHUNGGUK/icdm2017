Albeit the tradeoff between the size of the set and the success probability is suboptimal compared with probabilistic arguments, we nevertheless are able to apply our construction to a number of problems. In particular, we use it to construct an epsilon-sample (or pseudorandom generator) for linear threshold functions on Sn-1 for epsilon = o(1). We also use it to construct an epsilon-sample for spherical digons in Sn-1 for epsilon = o(1). This construction leads to an efficient oblivious derandomization of the Goemans-Williamson Max-Cut algorithm and similar approximation algorithms (i.e., we construct a small set of hyperplanes such that for any instance we can choose one of them to generate a good solution). Our technique for constructing an epsilon-sample for linear threshold functions on the sphere is considerably different than previous techniques that rely on k-wise independent sample spaces.", "paper_title": "EXPLICIT DIMENSION REDUCTION AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300892300010"}
