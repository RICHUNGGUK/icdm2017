Firstly, based on the iterative method in spatial domain, we introduce soft constraints by some few control points, making the inversion results closer to reality. In this problem, we assume that the density contrast decays with depth according to a parabolic law. Secondly, in order to meet the interface inversion for a wide range large-scale gravity data, we develop GPU program of the 3D interface inversion of basement relief, and give the corresponding optimization strategies and the speedup tests for the calculation results. We demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of this technique by inverting gravity anomalies caused by a synthetic model of a density interface and a set of real field data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
