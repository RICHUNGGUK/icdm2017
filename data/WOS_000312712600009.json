Atmospheric turbulence conditions are modeled using the I-K distribution. Our newly derived expressions provide an efficient tool to assess the spectral efficiency of FSO communication systems. Numerically evaluated and computer simulation results are further provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed mathematical analysis.", "paper_title": "Average Capacity of Optical Wireless Communication Systems Over I-K Atmospheric Turbulence Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000312712600009"}
