The large number of rules generated from the high dimensional gene expression data is one of the main challenges of its applications. In this work, we reveal that the discretization preprocessing is one of the reasons for the association rule number explosion problem. To alleviate this problem, a Regularized Gaussian Mixture Model (RGMM) is proposed to discretize the continuous gene expression data. RGMM explores both the complexity of the discretization model and the information loss of the discretization procedure, under the Minimal Description Length framework. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RGMM on real-life gene expression data sets.", "paper_title": "Regularized Gaussian Mixture Model based discretization for gene expression data association mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000324107400010"}
