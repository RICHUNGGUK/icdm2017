We further propose a mechanism to handle queries with qualitative locations in geospatial information systems. For the realization of the mechanism for QL-based queries, we propose a conceptual framework that takes advantage of models of qualitative spatial reasoning to bridge the gap between conventional metric spatial information systems and the general public's common-sense query of spatial relations in natural language.
