This is a generalization of superimposed families (k = r) and of single-user tracing families (k = 1). The study of such families is motivated by problems in molecular biology and communication. In this correspondence, we study the maximum possible cardinality of such families, denoted by h(n, r, k), and show that there exist absolute constants c(1), c(2), c(3), c(4) > 0 such that min ((c1)/(r), (c3)/(k2)) <= log (h(n,r,k))/(n) <= min (c2)/(r), (c4logk)/(k2) In particular, for all k <= root r, log (h(n,r,k))/(n). This improves an estimate of Laczay and Ruszinko.", "paper_title": "Tracing many users with almost no rate penalty", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600034"}
