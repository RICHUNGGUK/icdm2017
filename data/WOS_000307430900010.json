By employing the topological degree theory in set-valued analysis, differential inclusions theory and Lyapunov-like approach, we perform a thorough analysis of the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the periodic solution for the neural networks. Especially, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point for the autonomous systems corresponding to the non-autonomous neural networks. Furthermore, the global convergence of the output and the convergence in finite time of the state are also discussed. Without assuming the boundedness or monotonicity of the discontinuous neuron activation functions, the obtained results improve and extend previous works on discontinuous or continuous neural network dynamical systems. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
