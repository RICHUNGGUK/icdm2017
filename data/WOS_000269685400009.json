A fuzzy random reliability model is developed to maximize the system reliability. Since the reliability function consists of fuzzy random parameters, classical mathematical programming methods is not applicable to the reliability model. Therefore, in order to solve the model, a fuzzy random simulation method is first proposed to compute the system reliability, and a theorem is proved which ensures the convergence of the fuzzy random simulation. Furthermore, a hybrid binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm incorporating the fuzzy random simulation is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed hybrid algorithm.", "paper_title": "RELIABILITY OPTIMIZATION OF A SERIES-PARALLEL SYSTEM WITH FUZZY RANDOM LIFETIMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400009"}
