This algorithm is applied to two objective functions: the embedded carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the economic cost of reinforced concrete walls at different stages of materials production, transportation, and construction. The problem involved 20 design variables: four geometric variables (thickness of the stem and the base slab; toe and heel lengths), four material types, and 12 variables for the reinforcement setup. Results first indicate that embedded emissions and cost are closely related and that more environmentally friendly solutions than the lowest cost solution are available at a cost increment of less than 1.28%. The analysis also indicated that reducing costs by 1 Euro could save up to 2.28% kg in CO2 emissions. Finally, the cost-optimized walls require approximately 4.8% more concrete than the best environmental ones, which need 1.9% more steel. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000140.
