Under the former condition which we call the weak precondition, we investigate the question whether a polynomial time algorithm for reconstruction exists. As a first step, we provide an algorithm which outputs an approximation of the shape with the correct Betti numbers under a slightly stronger condition than the weak precondition. Unfortunately, even though our algorithm terminates, its time complexity is unbounded. We then identify at the heart of our algorithm a test which requires answering the following question: given 2 two-dimensional simplicial complexes , does there exist a simplicial complex containing and contained in which realizes the persistent homology of into ? We call this problem the homological simplification of the pair and prove that this problem is NP-complete, using a reduction from 3SAT.", "paper_title": "Optimal Reconstruction Might be Hard", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500001"}
