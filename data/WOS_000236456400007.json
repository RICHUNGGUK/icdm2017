This results in an integrodifferential equation with a weakly singular convolution kernel. We discretize in the spatial variable by a standard Galerkin finite element method. We prove stability and regularity estimates which show how the convolution term introduces dissipation into the equation of motion. These are then used to prove a priori error estimates.
