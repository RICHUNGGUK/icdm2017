With the analysis of the degree of freedom (DoF) of a manipulator, we can select the least number of variables to depict the kinematic constraints of each leg of a manipulator. The optimum parameters can be obtained by searching the extreme values of the objective functions with the given adroit workspace. Example is utilized to demonstrate the significant advantages of this method in the dexterous workspace synthesis. In applications, this method can be widely used to synthesize, optimize and create all kinds of new spatial parallel manipulator with a desired dexterous workspace. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
