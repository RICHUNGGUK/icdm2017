However, compared with the extensive research on makespan minimization, research on the total weighted tardiness objective is comparatively scarce, partly because this objective function is more difficult and complex to optimize. In this paper, we focus on the job shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total weighted tardiness. First, we discuss the mathematical programming model and its duality when the processing orders for each machine are fixed. Then, a block-based neighborhood structure is defined and its important properties are shown. Finally, a simulated annealing algorithm is designed which directly utilizes the features of this neighborhood. According to the computational results, the new neighborhood considerably promotes the searching capability of simulated annealing and helps it converge to high-quality solutions.
