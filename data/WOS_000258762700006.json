While advanced algorithms exist to speed these search primitives on network processors and even custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), achieving tight bounds on worst case performance with standard memories often requires a very careful analysis of all possible access patterns. An alternative, and often times more simple solution, is possible if a ternary CAM (TCAM) is used to perform a fully parallel search across the entire data set. Unfortunately, this parallelism means that large portions of the chip are switching during each cycle, causing large amounts of power to be consumed. While researchers at all levels of design (from algorithms to circuits) have begun to explore new ways of managing the power consumption, quantifying design alternatives is difficult due to a lack of available models. In this paper, we examine the structure of a modern TCAM and present a simple, yet accurate, power and delay model. We present techniques to estimate the dynamic power consumption and leakage power of a TCAM structure and validate the model using a combination of industrial TCAM datasheets and prior published works. Such a model is a critical first step in bridging the intellectual divide between circuit-level and algorithm-level optimizations. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we present an extensive analysis of the model by varying various architectural parameters and describe how our model can be easily extended to handle several circuit optimizations in the TCAM structure. In addition, we present a comparative study of SRAM and TCAM energy consumption to directly quantify the many design options which will be very useful for network designers to explore various power management schemes.", "paper_title": "Ternary CAM power and delay model: Extensions and uses", "paper_id": "WOS:000258762700006"}
