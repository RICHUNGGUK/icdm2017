In particular, it takes a fresh look at a number of familiar ideas including the problem of interference. Some subtle issues of observability including granularity - are explored. Based on these points, the paper sets out some requirements for an approach to developing systems by \"splitting atoms safely\". (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
