In the proposed architecture, a prime length DFT module with the one-point-per-cycle (OPPC) property is implemented by the parallel distributed arithmetic (DA), and a cyclic convolution feature is exploited to simplify the structure of the DA cells. Based on the proposed architecture, a real-time 65-point PFFT processor is designed, and the synthesis results show that it saves over 8% gates compared to the existing real-time 64-point DFT designs.", "paper_title": "An Area Efficient Real-Time PFFT Architecture Using Parallel Distributed Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000022"}
