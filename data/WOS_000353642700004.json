The GBNN associative memory model has recently been proposed as a new class of recurrent clustered neural network that presents higher efficiency than the classical models. In this article, we propose computational simplifications and architectural optimizations of the original GBNN. This work leads to significant complexity and area reduction without affecting neither memorizing nor retrieving performance. The obtained results open new perspectives in the design of neuromorphic hardware to support large-scale general-purpose neural algorithms.", "paper_title": "Fully Binary Neural Network Model and Optimized Hardware Architectures for Associative Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000353642700004"}
