In order to load fluid quantities between time-stepping into smoothed particles, kernel shapes are elongated according to the directions and magnitudes of velocities. The use of these deformable kernels allows us to efficiently simulate fast moving fluids without increasing computational cost. The experiments demonstrate that our method can reproduce the detailed movement of fast fluids by reducing numerical diffusion.", "paper_title": "A new SPH fluid simulation method using ellipsoidal kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000297131800010"}
