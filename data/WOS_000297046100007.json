We say that two binary sequences x and y of the same length have a skewincidence if there is a coordinatei for which x(i) = y(i+1) = 1 or vice versa. We give relatively close bounds on the maximum number of binary sequences of length n any pair of which has a skewincidence. A systematic study of these problems helps to understand the mathematical difficulties to solve zero-error problems in information theory.", "paper_title": "Skewincidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100007"}
