Given an invertible element d is an element of D, we present three families of unital nonassociative algebras over L boolean AND F defined on the direct sum of n copies of D. Two of these families appear either explicitly or implicitly in the designs of fast-decodable space-time block codes in papers by Srinath, Rajan, Markin, Oggier, and the authors. We present conditions for the algebras to be division and propose a construction for fully diverse fast decodable spacetime block codes of rate-m for nm transmit and m receive antennas. We present a DMT-optimal rate-3 code for 6 transmit and 3 receive antennas which is fastdecodable, with ML-decoding complexity at most O(M-15).", "paper_title": "THE NONASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS USED TO BUILD FAST-DECODABLE SPACE-TIME BLOCK CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000367402000004"}
