The proposed input stage is fabricated with two different opamp architectures in pure digital 0.12 mu m CMOS technology for experimental verification. At +/- 0.5 V supply, the small-signal behavior variation is 5.45% across the supply rail. The large-signal behavior is constant at different input common-mode levels. The maximum current needed for the signal behavior regulation is only 90 mu A.", "paper_title": "A rail-to-rail input stage with constant signal behavior in 0.12 mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261965500004"}
