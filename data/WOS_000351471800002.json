This partly answers a question of Dudek and Frieze (Random Struct Algor 42 (2013), 374-385), who used a second moment method to show that tight Hamilton cycles exist even for p=(n)/n(r3) where (n) arbitrary slowly, and for p=(e+o(1))/n(r4). The method we develop for proving our result applies to related problems as well. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
