This paper introduces a stable queue-based adaptive proportional-integral (Q-SAPI) controller for AQM and presents an implementation. The starting points of our approach are the recently developed fluid-flow modeling and control theoretic interpretation of the TCP/AQM dynamics, and the recently developed fixed-gain proportional-integral (PI) controller for AQM. Q-SAPI aims to improve the transient performance of the fixed-gain PI controller while maintaining its steady-state performance over a wide range of uncertainties in round-trip time (RTT) and the number of active TCP flows. The robustness of Q-SAPI is studied in detail, which provides guidelines for selecting control parameters. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the ability of Q-SAPI in controlling queue length in both transient and steady states. Q-SAPI achieves this by adapting the controller gains according to the queue length. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
