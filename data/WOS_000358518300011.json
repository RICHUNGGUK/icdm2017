We first motivate this approach under a Gaussian model for the underlying signals, in which case maximizing SNR is equivalent to minimizing the robust hashing error probability. A globally optimal solution can be obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We also develop a multibit per projection algorithm to learn longer hash codes when the number of high-SNR projections is limited. The proposed algorithms are tested on both synthetic and real data sets, showing significant performance gains over existing hashing algorithms.", "paper_title": "SNR Maximization Hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358518300011"}
