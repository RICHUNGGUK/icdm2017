At each instant of time, only two consecutive frames are processed as input data of a joint estimator that fully exploits second-order information of the corresponding optimization problem and effectively copes with the non-convexity due to both the imaging geometry and the manifold of motion parameters. Additionally, carefully designed Gaussian approximations enable probabilistic inference based on locally varying confidence and globally varying sensitivity due to the epipolar geometry, with respect to the high-dimensional depth map estimation. Embedding the resulting joint estimator in an online recursive framework achieves a pronounced spatio-temporal filtering effect and robustness. We evaluate hundreds of images taken from a car moving at speed up to 100 km/h and being part of a publicly available benchmark data set. The results compare favorably with two alternative settings: stereo based scene reconstruction and camera motion estimation in batch mode using multiple frames. They, however, require a calibrated camera pair or storage for more than two frames, which is less attractive from a technical viewpoint than the proposed monocular and recursive approach. In addition to real data, a synthetic sequence is considered which provides reliable ground truth.", "paper_title": "Variational Recursive Joint Estimation of Dense Scene Structure and Camera Motion from Monocular High Speed Traffic Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000323659900005"}
