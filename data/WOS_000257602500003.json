This paper, based on error-correcting codes, one-way hashing function and symmetric key cryptography, proposes a new authentication scheme for integrated 3G/WLAN networks. The new scheme provides better anonymity because it does not expose users' identifiers on the air even they are authenticated for the first time while EAP-AKA will expose users' real identities when they visit new domains. Additionally, it greatly improves the communication performance.", "paper_title": "An efficient authentication protocol with anonymity for 3G/WLAN interworking", "paper_id": "WOS:000257602500003"}
