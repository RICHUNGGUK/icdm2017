Results are also included to demonstrate that a new search approach, when considered alongside existing well-known search methods, compares favorably in its application to real elevator dispatching problems.", "paper_title": "ELEVATOR DISPATCHING USING HEURISTIC SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111400007"}
