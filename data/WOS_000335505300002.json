One feature of VR systems that is essential for use in clinical evaluation and to warrant presence is the lack of behavioral distortion from real-world execution. Herein, we present a technical description of our VR and its validation to evaluate rhythmic motor patterns when experimental subjects perform a finger tapping test. Execution of the test was performed at different rates in the VR system, and compared to the gold-standard real-world testing. The VR system proved to be as valid and reliable as real-world testing to characterize arrythmokinetic profiles present in Parkinsonian and elderly subjects (compared to young subjects), at the different rates of execution. VR served as a complementary tool in a research setting to isolate subjects from unnaturalistic environments during clinical evaluation, such as labrooms or brain scans, since it did not bias behavior from real-world evaluation in a basic clinical test.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Virtual Reality System in Evaluation of Rhythmic Motor Patterns in Elderly and Parkinson's Disease Patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000335505300002"}
