The problem which is governed by a dynamical system consisting of a semi-linear parabolic equation and an ordinary differential equation is discretized using the finite element method. A posteriori error estimates are derived and an adaptive algorithm is formulated. The numerical experiments justify the theoretical results obtained. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
