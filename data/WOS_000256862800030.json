However, the estimation of its model parameters using the Simplex method can easily trap the final solution at a local optimum. This study proposes an estimation scheme based on the genetic algorithm (GA) to overcome this difficulty. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme yields estimates that more closely match the experimental data statistics.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Markov model parameters for asynchronous impulsive noise over broadband power line communication network", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800030"}
