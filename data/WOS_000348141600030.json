This method magnifies the contrast of colors and spatially sharpens textures in images. The contrast magnification ratio is adaptively controlled. We show by experiments that this method enhances the color tone of photographs while keeping their perceptual scene depth.", "paper_title": "Hue-Preserving Unsharp-Masking for Color Image Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141600030"}
