In the paper, security returns are regarded as fuzzy variables. Based on credibility measure and the expected value operator and variance operator based on credibility, two new types of fuzzy mean-variance models are proposed. A hybrid intelligent algorithm is provided to give a general solution of the optimization problems. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the optimization idea and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Portfolio selection with fuzzy returns", "paper_id": "WOS:000249386900005"}
