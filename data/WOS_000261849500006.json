We propose a natural notion of logical relations that is able to deal with the monadic types of Moggi's computational lambda calculus. The treatment is categorical, and is based on notions of subsconing, mono factorisation systems and monad morphisms. Our approach has a number of interesting applications, including cases for lambda calculi with non-determinism (where being in a logical relation means being bisimilar), dynamic name creation and probabilistic systems.", "paper_title": "Logical relations for monadic types", "paper_id": "WOS:000261849500006"}
