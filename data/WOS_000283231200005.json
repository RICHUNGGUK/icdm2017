Since its inception, a distinctive goal has been to dig out the deep relationships among their components. This paper considers two wide families of SC models. On the one hand, the regime-switching autoregressive paradigm is a recent development in statistical time series modeling, and it includes a set of models closely related to artificial neural networks. On the other hand, we consider fuzzy rule-based systems in the framework of time series analysis. This paper discloses original results establishing functional equivalences between models of these two classes, and hence opens the door to a productive line of research where results and techniques from one area can be applied in the other. As a consequence of the equivalences presented in this paper, we prove the asymptotic stationarity of a class of fuzzy rule-based systems. Simulations based on information criteria show the importance of the selection of the proper membership function.", "paper_title": "Equivalences Between Neural-Autoregressive Time Series Models and Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283231200005"}
