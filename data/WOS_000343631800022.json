Three heterobond pathways B-C, B-N and N-C including two regioisomers for each one are considered by different approaches. All studied reactions have normal electron demand nature and corresponding regioisomers are produced via asynchronous processes. Predicted regioselectivities using electronic and energetic results are in complete agreement with each other and show that B-C heterobond pathway is more active than others and regioisomer 16 is the major. The local reactivity difference values (R-k) show that all reaction sites at C48B6N6 present ambiphilic activation while reaction sites at 2-methyl-1,3 butadiene show nucleophilic activation. Therefore, it is predictable that C48B6N6 should present electrophilic nature. Plotting of Delta R-k and Delta s values of six studied channels toward corresponding activation Gibbs free energies showed that the regioisomeric channel with lower Delta R-k and Delta s values is faster and vice versa.
