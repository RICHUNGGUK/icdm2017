Fault-tolerant routing algorithms in such systems aim at providing continuous operations in the presence of one or more failures by allowing the graceful degradation of system. The Software-Based fault-tolerant routing scheme has been suggested as an efficient routing algorithm to preserve both communication performance and fault-tolerant demands in parallel computer systems. To study network performance, a number of different analytical models for fault-free routing algorithms have been proposed in the past literature. However, there has not been reported any similar analytical model of fault-tolerant routing in the presence of faulty components. This paper presents a new analytical modeling approach for determining the effects of failures in wormhole-switched 2-D tori using the fault-tolerant Software-Based scheme. More specifically, we describe a general model to derive mathematical expressions to investigate the performance behavior of routing algorithms confronting convex (I-shaped, square-shaped) or concave (U-shaped, +-shaped, T-shaped, H-shaped) faulty regions. The model is validated through comprehensive simulation experiments for different types of failures.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of fault-tolerant routing algorithm in wormhole-switched interconnections", "paper_id": "WOS:000248054000002"}
