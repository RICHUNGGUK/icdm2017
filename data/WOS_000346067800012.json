The probability of a satisfactory item is then eta(L) := P(X >= L), called conforming rate. In industrial companies, however, the lifetime performance index, proposed by Montgomery and denoted by C-L, is widely used as a process capability index instead of the conforming rate. Assuming a parametric model for the random variable X, we show that there is a connection between the conforming rate and the lifetime performance index. Consequently, the statistical inferences about eta(L) and C-L are equivalent. Hence, we restrict ourselves to statistical inference for C-L based on generalised order statistics, which contains several ordered data models such as usual order statistics, progressively Type-II censored data and records. Various point and interval estimators for the parameter C-L are obtained and optimal critical regions for the hypothesis testing problems concerning C-L are proposed. Finally, two real data-sets on the lifetimes of insulating fluid and ball bearings, due to Nelson (1982) and Caroni (2002), respectively, and a simulated sample are analysed.", "paper_title": "Statistical inference for the lifetime performance index based on generalised order statistics from exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000346067800012"}
