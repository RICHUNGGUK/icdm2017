The fuel cell (FC) is a promising clean energy source and a reliable technology for niche applications providing high conversion efficiency. In this paper, a digitally controlled FC system is documented based on the boost-inverter topology that achieves both boosting and inversion functions in a single-stage. A digital signal processor TMS320F28335 is used to implement the control of the FC system in order to provide a number of benefits including low-cost, good performance, an easy implementation of a relatively complicated algorithm, and user friendly interface. The control design, analysis, simulation and experimental results are presented in the paper to confirm the performance of the digitally controlled FC system.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Digital Control in a Fuel Cell System", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700060"}
