In this algorithm, we use the low cost and high sensitive magnetic sensors to measure the magnetic field distortion when vehicle crosses the sensors and detect vehicle via an adaptive threshold. The vehicle length is estimated with the geometrical characteristics of the proximity sensor networks, and finally identifies vehicle type from an intelligent neural network classifier. Simulation and on-road experiment obtains high recognition rate over 90%. It verified that this algorithm enhances the vehicle surveillance with high accuracy and solid robustness.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Threshold Algorithm for Vehicle Classification Based on Binary Proximity Sensors and Intelligent Neuron Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000278399600004"}
