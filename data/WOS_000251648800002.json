Its focus is on how to handle sparse and noisy sensor data, such as PSD infrared sensors with limited range and limited number, in order to develop a low-cost navigation system. It has been applied to a vacuum cleaning robot in our research. In order to meet the real-time objective with low computing power, we develop an efficient line feature extraction algorithm based upon an iterative end point fit (IEPF) technique assisted by our constrained version of the Hough transform. It uses a geometric constraint that every line is orthogonal or parallel to each other because in a general indoor setting, most furniture and walls satisfy this constraint. By adding this constraint to the measurement model of EKF, we build a geometrically constrained EKF framework which can estimate line feature positions more accurately as well as allow their covariance matrices to converge more rapidly when compared to the case of an unconstrained EKF. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness to the presence of sensor noise and errors in an actual indoor environment.", "paper_title": "A line feature based SLAM with low grade range sensors using geometric constraints and active exploration for mobile robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000251648800002"}
