Specifically, IEEE 802.11a systems which operate around 5 GHz and overlap the band of UWB signals may interfere with UWB systems significantly. In this paper, we suggest a novel NBI suppression technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm in time hopping UWB (TH-UWB) systems. SVD is used to approximate the interference which then is subtracted from the received signals. The algorithm precision and closed-form bit error rate (BER) expression are derived in the wireless multipath channel. Comparing with the conventional suppression methods such as a notch filter and a RAKE receiver, the proposed method is simple and robust and especially suitable for UWB systems.", "paper_title": "Suppression of IEEE 802.11a interference in TH-UWB systems using singular value decomposition in wireless multipath channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000254805800009"}
