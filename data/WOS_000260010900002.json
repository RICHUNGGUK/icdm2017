These principles are inherently enforced by the bond graph modeling formalism. Often, however, physical components may be best modeled as piecewise continuous with discrete mode changes, which leads to a violation of continuity principles. To support such hybrid models, bond graphs can be extended by facilitating a dynamic model structure, resulting in hybrid bond graphs. Behavior generation then requires computing continuous-time evolution, detecting the occurrence of events, executing the discrete state changes and re-initializing the continuous-time state. This paper presents a comprehensive representation of these different aspects of behavior using hybrid process algebra. The behavior of a hybrid bond graph can then be studied using a uniform representation while a direct correspondence with the elements of the bond graph is maintained. Additionally, non-determinism can be included in hybrid bond graph semantics which may alleviate the modeling task without being detrimental to the required analyses.", "paper_title": "Constitutive Hybrid Processes: a Process-Algebraic Semantics for Hybrid Bond Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000260010900002"}
