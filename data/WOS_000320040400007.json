Using the terminology of parameterized complexity we say that k-Vertex Cover has a kernel with 2k vertices. There is complexity-theoretic evidence that both 2k vertices and I similar to(k (2)) edges are optimal for the kernel size. In this paper we consider the Vertex Cover problem with a different parameter, the size of a minimum feedback vertex set for G. This refined parameter is structurally smaller than the parameter k associated to the vertex covering number since and the difference can be arbitrarily large. We give a kernel for Vertex Cover with a number of vertices that is cubic in : an instance (G,X,k) of Vertex Cover, where X is a feedback vertex set for G, can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent instance (G',X',k') such that |V(G')|a parts per thousand currency sign2k and . A similar result holds when the feedback vertex set X is not given along with the input. In sharp contrast we show that the Weighted Vertex Cover problem does not have a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the cardinality of a given vertex cover of the graph unless NP aS dagger coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.", "paper_title": "Vertex Cover Kernelization Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000320040400007"}
