This model has shown to be useful in reliability and lifetime data modelling, especially when the hazard rate function has a bathtub shape. Simulation studies are also carried out to show that the maximum-likelihood estimator is better than the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) and that the UMVUE is better than others.", "paper_title": "Evaluation and comparison of estimations in the generalized exponential-Poisson distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000005"}
