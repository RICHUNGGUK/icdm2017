To reach this goal, the algorithm needs to estimate the coordinates of the global minimum and then steer the new point toward it. In this paper, the estimation of the global minimum is calculated by weighted mean coordination of individuals (WMP), and then a road is mapped between the coordinates of the parents and the WMP. In the proposed method, fuzzy logic is used for deciding on the road and the best coordination to breed offspring. The proposed algorithm is tested on 65 well-known cost functions and is compared with five algorithms inside the EP family. In the next section of the paper, the algorithm is tested on the high-dimensional problem of modeling ozone layer data, which includes almost 26,000 unknown parameters. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in having acceptable speed and accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
