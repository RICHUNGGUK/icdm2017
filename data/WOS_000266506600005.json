The difficulties in obtaining the non-similar solutions at the starting point of the streamwise coordinate, at the edges of the slot and at the point of separation are overcome by applying an implicit finite difference scheme with the quasi-linearization technique and an appropriate selection of the finer step sizes along the streamwise direction. It is observed that the separation can be delayed by non-uniform slot suction and also by moving the slot downstream but the effect of non-uniform slot injection is just reverse.
