For an online optimization scheme to be of practical value in a distributed setting, however, it must successfully tackle the curses of dimensionality and modeling. This paper develops a hierarchical control framework to solve performance management problems in distributed computing systems operating in a data center. Concepts from approximation theory are used to reduce the computational burden of controlling such large-scale systems. The relevant approximations are made in the construction of the dynamical models to predict system behavior and in the solution of the associated control equations. Using a dynamic resource-provisioning problem as a case study, we show that a computing system managed by the proposed control framework with approximation models realizes profit gains that are, in the best case, within 1% of a controller using an explicit model of the system.", "paper_title": "Approximation modeling for the online performance management of distributed computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191900004"}
