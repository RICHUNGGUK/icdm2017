Therefore, a RBDO solution that reduces the structural weight in uncritical regions does not only provide an improved design but also a higher level of confidence in the design. In this paper, we present recent developments for the RBDO model relative to two points of view: reliability and optimization. Next, we develop several distributions for the hybrid method and the optimum safety factor methods (linear and nonlinear RBDO). Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our safety factor approach extended to nonlinear RBDO with application to a tri-material structure.", "paper_title": "Extension of optimum safety factor method to nonlinear reliability-based design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249803900001"}
