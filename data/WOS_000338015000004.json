However, most existing works about minimal exposure path are based on omnidirectional sensors. In contrast, this paper studies the minimal exposure path problem for two different types of directional sensing models: the binary sector model and directional sensitivity model. For the binary sector model, we construct a special Voronoi diagram, called sector centroids-based Voronoi diagram, to transform the minimal exposure path problem from a continuous geometric problem into a discrete geometric problem. By using the sector centroids-based Voronoi diagram, we develop an approximate algorithm to find the minimal exposure path in the sensors deployment field. For the directional sensitive model, we formulate the minimal exposure path problem by using two sensing intensity functions: all-sensor intensity function and maximum-sensor intensity function and then generate two weighted grids to convert the minimal exposure path problem into two discrete geometric problems. On the basis of the aforementioned weighted grids, we also develop two approximation algorithms to find the minimal exposure path for the directional sensitive model. We conduct extensive experiment simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed models and algorithms.
