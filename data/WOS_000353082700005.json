This paper presents metric-based techniques for real-time kidnap detection, utilising either linear or SVM classifiers to identify all kidnapping events during the autonomous operation of a mobile robot. In contrast, existing techniques either solve specific cases of kidnapping, such as elevator motion, without addressing the general case or remove dependence on local pose estimation entirely, an inefficient and computationally expensive approach. Three metrics that measured the quality of a pose estimate were evaluated and a joint classifier was constructed by combining the most discriminative quality metric with a fourth metric that measured the discrepancy between two independent pose estimates. A multi-class Support Vector Machine classifier was also trained using all four metrics and produced better classification results than the simpler joint classifier, at the cost of requiring a larger training dataset. While metrics specific to 3D point clouds were used, the approach can be generalised to other forms of data, including, visual, provided that two independent ways of estimating pose are available.
