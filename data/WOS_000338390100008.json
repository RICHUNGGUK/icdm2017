In particular, (I) the secret shadow given by the dealer or some player can be verifiable and (2) t or more players can cooperate to reveal the k secrets, while less than t players cannot reveal any secret. VMSS can be used in many applications, such as access control. However, the existing VMSS schemes either require costly computation, or miss some important properties of VMSS. These two weaknesses make the VMSS scheme not so good as expected. In this paper, we propose a novel VMSS scheme which does not need any costly computation, while holds all properties of VMSS.
