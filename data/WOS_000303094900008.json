It introduces the principles of packet switching and interconnection network into SoC design, and achieves much better performance for its high bandwidth, scalability, reliability, etc. However, thermal problem, such as regional temperature differential and hotspot, is still one of the main designing constraints. This paper proposes a dynamic thermal-balance routing (DTBR) algorithm for Network-on-Chip, which can solve both of the two thermal problems. DTBR is a minimal adaptive routing algorithm based on an architectural thermal model. An efficient thermal-aware router is designed to implement the DTBR algorithm. According to the simulation results, the proposed DTBR algorithm can make the network thermal distribution more uniform and hotspot temperature is cut down about 20% in different traffic patterns. Moreover, DTBR will bring a profit for the performance of packet delay and network throughput compared with other routing algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
