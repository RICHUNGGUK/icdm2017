The constrained independent component analysis (cICA) is extended to incorporate the reference signals that carry some information of the sources as additional constraints into the ICA contrast function. A neural algorithm is then proposed using a Newton-like approach to obtain an optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem. Stability of the convergence and selection of parameters in the learning algorithm are analyzed. Experiments with synthetic signals and real fMRI data demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
