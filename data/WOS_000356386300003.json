We also propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based weights-learning algorithm to automatically learn the optimal weights of the antecedent variables of fuzzy rules for weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning. We apply the proposed weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning method using the proposed PSO-based weights-learning algorithm to deal with the computer activity prediction problem, the multivariate regression problems, and the time series prediction problems. The experimental results show that the proposed weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning method using the proposed PSO-based weights-learning algorithm outperforms the existing methods for dealing with the computer activity prediction problem, the multivariate regression problems, and the time series prediction problems.", "paper_title": "Weighted Fuzzy Interpolative Reasoning Based on the Slopes of Fuzzy Sets and Particle Swarm Optimization Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000356386300003"}
