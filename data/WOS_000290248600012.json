We develop a parallel algorithm for the VRP that combines a heuristic local search improvement procedure with integer programming. We run our parallel algorithm with as many as 129 processors and are able to quickly find high-quality solutions to standard benchmark problems. We assess the impact of parallelism by analyzing our procedure's performance under a number of different scenarios.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000290248600012"}
