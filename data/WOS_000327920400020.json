In this way, the number of citations received by a scientific journal can be considered as a measure of the total production of the journal. In this paper, in order to obtain measures of the efficiency in the production process, the approach provided by stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is considered, and econometric models are proposed. These models estimate a frontier production, which is the maximum achievable number of citations to the journal based on its resources. The efficiency can then be measured by considering the difference between the actual production and the estimated frontier. This approach is applied to the measurement of the productive efficiency of the journals of the JCR social sciences edition database, which belong simultaneously to the areas of \"economics\" and \"social sciences, mathematical methods\".
