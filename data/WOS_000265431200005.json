We use an approach which is totally different from those used traditionally with Bluetooth (probabilistic collision models). We show how it is possible to obtain an interference-free Bluetooth environment in some conditions, for certain kinds of Bluetooth devices, using the properties of the Bluetooth frequency hopping system.
