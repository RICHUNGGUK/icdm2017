The proposed method can be seen as a preprocessing step of SRC and LRC. By maximizing the inter-class reconstruction error and minimizing the intra-class reconstruction error simultaneously, the proposed method significantly improves the performances of SRC and LRC. Compared with linear discriminant analysis, the proposed method avoids the small sample size problem and can extract more features. Moreover, we extend LRC to overcome the potential singular problem. The experimental results on the extended Yale B (YALE-B), AR, PolyU finger knuckle print and the CENPARMI handwritten numeral databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Feature Extraction Based on Maximum Nearest Subspace Margin Criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000319016400007"}
