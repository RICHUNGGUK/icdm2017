In particular, we focus on the study of the computability of the entangled value omega*. We show that the value omega* can be efficiently approximated up to a multiplicative factor of 4. We also study the behavior of omega* under the parallel repetition of rank-one quantum games, showing that it does not verify a perfect parallel repetition theorem. To obtain these results, we first connect rank-one games with the mathematical theory of operator spaces. We also reprove with these new tools essentially known results about the entangled value of rank-one games with one-way communication omega (qow) . In particular, we show that omega (qow) can be computed efficiently and it satisfies a perfect parallel repetition theorem.", "paper_title": "Rank-one quantum games", "paper_id": "WOS:000351224100005"}
