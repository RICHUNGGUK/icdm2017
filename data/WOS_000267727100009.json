In this summary we particularly focus Our attention on the description of a special system built to support large scale data access. The work comes from the need to develop a special purpose skimming control system; this system has been designed as a collaboration between the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC, USA), and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleate (INFN, National Istitute of Nuclear Physic, Padua, Italy). The goal was to provide the handle of more than 107 files, representing Physics data collected by the BaBar experiment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
