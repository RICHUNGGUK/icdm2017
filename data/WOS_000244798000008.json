We assume that the rates of returns on securities are approximated as LR-fuzzy numbers of the same shape, and that the expected return and risk are evaluated by interval-valued means. We establish the relationship between those mean-interval definitions for a given fuzzy portfolio by using suitable ordering relations. Finally, we formulate the portfolio selection problem as a linear program when the returns on the assets are of trapezoidal form. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
