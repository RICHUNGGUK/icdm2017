This paper introduces a mobile agent-based middleware that supports both point-to-point messaging and hierarchical data-streaming. Two infrastructure technologies (Mockets and FlexFeed) are introduced as service providers for messaging and publish-subscriber models for data streaming. Opportunistic resource allocation and monitoring are handled by distributed coordination algorithms, implemented here through two complementary technologies: Stand-in Agents and Acquaintance models.", "paper_title": "A mobile agent-based middleware for opportunistic resource allocation and communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237044300010"}
