In this case we deal with the well-known space 2* described as a spatial locale of finite and infinite strings of binary bits in [12] in which we prove from a classical point of view and based on a result in [9] that only finitely many elements in its Scott topology can be distinguished. Further, we offer a nonstandard (IST) version of indiscernibility in 2*(omega) by means of an approximate equality and consequently of the topological halos of its standard points based on a relevant work by T.
