Fusion at feature level is considered here for the purpose of recognition. The biometrics considered for fusion are face and iris. Here, new face images along with iris images are generated, and they are included in the training set. Feature-level fusion is incorporated. The recognition rates of the classification algorithm thus obtained are statistically found to be significantly better than the existing feature-level fusion and classification techniques.", "paper_title": "Generation of new points for training set and feature-level fusion in multimodal biometric identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000330648500012"}
