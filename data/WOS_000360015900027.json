We prove in particular, for C = D, that if the square of the code C has minimum distance at least 2, and (C, C) is a PMDS pair, then either C is a generalized Reed-Solomon code, or C is a direct sum of self-dual codes. In passing we establish coding-theory analogues of classical theorems of additive combinatorics.", "paper_title": "Critical Pairs for the Product Singleton Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900027"}
