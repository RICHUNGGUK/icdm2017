Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the uncertainty in the mechanical system. The desirable system performance is deterministic (assuring the bottom line) and also fuzzy (enhancing the cost consideration). The proposed control is deterministic and is not the usual if-then rules-based. The resulting controlled system is uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded proved via the Lyapunov minimax approach. A performance index (the combined cost, which includes average fuzzy system performance and control effort) is proposed based on the fuzzy information. The optimal design problem associated with the control can then be solved by minimizing the performance index. The unique closed-form optimal gain and the cost are explicitly shown. The resulting control design is systematic and is able to guarantee the deterministic performance as well as minimizing the cost. In the end, an example is chosen for demonstration.", "paper_title": "Theory and Application of a Novel Optimal Robust Control: A Fuzzy Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000356335400007"}
