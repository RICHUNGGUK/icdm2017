These recurrence relations are over v (the degrees of freedom), and starting from the known results for nu = 1 and nu = 2, they will allow for the recursive evaluation of the distribution function for any other positive integral value of nu. Then, we consider a linear combination of order statistics from a bivariate t distribution with an arbitrary mean vector and show that its cdf is a mixture of cdf's of the extended skew-t distributions. This mixture form, along with the explicit expressions of the cdf's of the extended skew-t distributions, enables us to derive explicit expressions for the cdf of the linear combination for any positive integral value of nu.
