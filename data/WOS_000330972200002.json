A theorem of Yao and Yao states that N (d) (1)a parts per thousand currency sign2 (d) . Among other results, we obtain the bounds N (d) (2)a parts per thousand currency sign3a <...2 (d-1) and N (d) (1)a parts per thousand yenCa <...2 (d/2) for some constant C. We then apply these results to a problem on the separation of points and hyperplanes.", "paper_title": "An Extension of a Theorem of Yao and Yao", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972200002"}
