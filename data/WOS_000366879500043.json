The emulator is based on a reconfigurable hardware-software architecture, which enables accurate representation of various NAND Flash technologies, focusing especially on MLC cases. The presented architecture can be used for emulating memories at the chip and channel level, while the proposed hardware platform can be used as a valuable tool for developing and evaluating memory-related algorithms and techniques. In this paper, we analyze the architecture of the NAND Flash memory emulator and we present details about its internal functionality. Using experimental results, we demonstrate the high accuracy achieved when it is used to emulate specific MLC and TLC NAND Flash chips and we describe how this custom hardware can be used to emulate a complete NAND Flash channel, which consists of multiple NAND Flash chips that share a common data path and support the execution of pipelined commands.
