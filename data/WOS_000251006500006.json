Each job is characterized by its size and processing time. The processing time of a batch is given by the longest processing time among all jobs in the batch. Based on developing heuristic approaches, we proposed a hybrid genetic heuristic (HGH) to minimize makespan objective. To verify the performance of our algorithm, comparisons are made through using a simulated annealing (SA) approach addressed in the literature as a comparator algorithm. Computational experiments reveal that affording the knowledge of problem through using heuristic procedures, gives HGH the ability of finding optimal or near optimal solutions in a reasonable time.
