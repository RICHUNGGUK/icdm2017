Furthermore, a novel validity condition is proposed to justify these transformations. The method has been implemented in the CONFRES tool and applied to a number of case studies. The experimental results show that the combined framework enlarges the design space and allows for better exploration of the speed/area tradeoff.", "paper_title": "Resolution of Encoding Conflicts by Signal Insertion and Concurrency Reduction Based on STG Unfoldings", "paper_id": "WOS:000262367600004"}
