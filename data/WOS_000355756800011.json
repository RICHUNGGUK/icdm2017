Traditionally, these two technologies have been addressed separately. In this paper we show that integrating wireless network virtualization with ICN techniques can significantly improve the end-to-end network performance. In particular, we propose an information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture for integrating wireless network virtualization with ICN. We develop the key components of this architecture: radio spectrum resource, wireless network infrastructure, virtual resources (including content-level slicing, network-level slicing, and flow-level slicing), and information-centric wireless virtualization controller. Then we formulate the virtual resource allocation and in-network caching strategy as an optimization problem, considering the gain of not only virtualization but also in-network caching in our proposed information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture. The obtained simulation results show that our proposed information-centric wireless network virtualization architecture and the related schemes significantly outperform the other existing schemes.", "paper_title": "Information-Centric Network Function Virtualization over 5G Mobile Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355756800011"}
