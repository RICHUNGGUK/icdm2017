In this paper a specific approach to fully automatic three-dimensional mesh generation is presented. An approach to moving the generated mesh is also outlined. In particular, the simulation of a diesel injector needle movement is sought. The movement of the needle was calculated on the basis of injection rate experimental data and injection rate predicted data with steady state boundaries and geometry. The simulation was performed using the commercial code STAR-CD version 4.06. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
