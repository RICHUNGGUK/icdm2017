Goals, kernel theory, and artifacts inform an inter-related prototyping cycle of design, evaluation, and appropriation / generation to produce strategic design theory. The paper identifies DSR project types to provide signposts for starting and ending the cycle, artifact and evaluation iteration to facilitate the process and provide a chain of evidence, a simplified format for representing design theory iterations, and stopping rules to end the cycle. We use a detailed example to illustrate the ideas, discuss related work, and identify limitations and future research opportunities.", "paper_title": "Generating and Justifying Design Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000357681900001"}
