We initiate a more refined analysis of the throughput competitive ratio of admission and scheduling policies in the Competitive Network Throughput model [Aiello et al. 2005], taking into account not only the network size but also the buffer size and the injection rate of the traffic. We specifically consider the problem of information gathering on the line, with limited buffer space, under adversarial traffic. We examine how the buffer size and the injection rate of the traffic affect the performance of the greedy protocol for this problem. We establish upper bounds on the competitive ratio of the greedy protocol in terms of the network size, the buffer size, and the adversary's rate, and present lower bounds which are tight up to constant factors. These results show, for example, that provisioning the network with sufficiently large buffers may substantially improve the performance of the greedy protocol in some cases, whereas for some high-rate adversaries, using larger buffers does not have any effect on the competitive ratio of the protocol.", "paper_title": "Rate vs. Buffer Size-Greedy Information Gathering on the Line", "paper_id": "WOS:000293799400005"}
