The major motivations to adopt Cloud services include no upfront investment on infrastructure and transferring responsibility of maintenance, backups, and license management to Cloud Providers. However, one of the key challenges that holds businesses from adopting Cloud computing services is that, by migrating to Cloud, they move some of their information and services out of their direct control. Their main concern is how well the Cloud providers keep their information (security) and deliver their services (performance). To cope with this challenge, several service level agreement management systems have been proposed. However, monitoring service deployment as a major responsibility of those systems have not been deeply investigated yet. Therefore, this paper shows how monitoring services have to be described, deployed (discovered and ranked), and then how they have to be executed to enforce accurate penalties by eliminating service level agreement failure cascading effects on violation detection.
