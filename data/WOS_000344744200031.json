In this article, we describe our application of visualization to a three-dimensional simulation model for tissue growth. We review the different components of the model where cellular automata is used to model populations of cells that execute persistent random walks, collide, and proliferate until they reach confluence. We then describe the system architecture of the developed visualization tool, the employed rendering techniques, and the related prototyping interfaces. We also discuss some of the visualization results obtained thus far that are pertinent to enhancing the validity of the computational model. This visualization tool could be useful in facilitating the research of scientists by providing them with meaningful means to interpret and analyze simulation data and to compare them to experimental results. Our objective in this work is to develop computer-aided design solutions that support the simulation of tissue growth and its design exploration.", "paper_title": "A visualization tool of 3-D time-varying data for the simulation of tissue growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200031"}
