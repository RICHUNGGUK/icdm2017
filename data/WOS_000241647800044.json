Post-processing of mined results is one of the key processes in a data mining process. However, it is difficult for human experts to completely evaluate several thousands of rules from a large dataset with noises. To reduce the costs in such rule evaluation task, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models which learn from a dataset. This dataset comprises objective indices for mined classification rules and evaluations by a human expert for each rule. To evaluate performances of learning algorithms for constructing the rule evaluation models, we have done a case study on the meningitis data mining as an actual problem. Furthermore, we have also evaluated our method with five rule sets obtained from five UCI datasets.", "paper_title": "Evaluating learning algorithms for a rule evaluation support method based on objective rule evaluation indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800044"}
