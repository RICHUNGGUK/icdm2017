To analyze the shape difference between two groups of the hippocampus, initially we extract quantitative shape features from input images, and then perform statistical shape analysis using parametric representation and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learning algorithm. Results suggest that the presented shape representation and a polynomial kernel based SVMs algorithm can effectively discriminate between normal controls and epilepsy patients. To provide a more immersive and realistic environment in analysis, we combined a stereoscopic display and a 6-DOF force-feedback haptic device. The presented multi-sensory environment improves space and depth perception, and provides users with sense of touch feedback while making it easier to manipulate 3D objects.", "paper_title": "Intelligent analysis of anatomical shape using multi-sensory interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300118"}
