Most conventional active queue management is based on the first stochastic moment. In stochastic theory, the first moment is not efficient for non-Gaussian systems that are the same as the network queue size. We propose a new stochastic active queue management technique, based on stochastic control and B-spline window observer, called intelligent probability density function AQM (IPDF-AQM). The IPDF-AQM is based on a PDF control and particle swarm optimization, which not only considers the average queue length at the current time slot, but also takes into consideration the PDF of queue lengths within a round-trip time. We provide a guideline for the selection of the probability of dropping as control input for TCP/AQM system to make the PDF of queue length converge at a certain PDF target based on B-spline approximation and improve the network performance. Simulation results show that the proposed stochastic AQM scheme does improve the end-to-end performance.", "paper_title": "Stochastic controller as an active queue management based on B-spline kernel observer via particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500008"}
