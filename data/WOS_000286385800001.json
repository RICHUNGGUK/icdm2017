RAMGs can ensure the required product ratios as demanded by production planners. Since the deadlock of such a system can be attributed to improper acquisition of finite shared resources, a supervisor is introduced such that they are properly allocated. This paper proves that ratio and supervisory controllers for an RAMG can be separately designed. Their design methods are presented. Examples are given to illustrate them.", "paper_title": "Supervisor Design to Enforce Production Ratio and Absence of Deadlock in Automated Manufacturing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286385800001"}
