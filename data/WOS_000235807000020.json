Providing a user interface specially crafted for each context of use (< user, platform, environment) is costly, may result in inconsistent behaviors [5] and above all is limited to the contexts of use that have been envisioned at design time. Opportunistic interaction in a changing environment requires enabling approaches and techniques for gracefully adapting the interactive system to its context of use. In Human-Computer Interaction, this ability of an interactive system to withstand variations of context of use while preserving its quality in use is called plasticity [7]. This paper shows how Model Driven Engineering is suited for supporting plasticity both at design time and run time.", "paper_title": "Towards model driven engineering of plastic user interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000020"}
