With the growing cost of energy, the importance of reducing power consumption in server systems is now well-known and has become a major research topic. However, most existing research focused solely on homogeneous clusters. This paper addresses the challenge of power management in Heterogeneous Multi-tier Web Clusters. We apply Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) to decompose the global optimization problem into small sub-problems. This algorithm achieves the optimal solution in an iterative fashion. The evaluation results show that our algorithm achieves more energy conservation than the previous work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
