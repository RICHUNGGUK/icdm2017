The proposed scheme can accurately adapt to wireless communication environments by integrating new approaches of bandwidth estimation, loss detection, and error recovery techniques while differentiating data losses due to physical bit error characteristics of error-prone wireless regions from those due to network congestion. From the simulations, it has been verified that the proposed scheme shows better throughput performances than the existing major transmission control schemes such as New Reno, Vegas, and Westwood+, while achieving satisfied levels of fairness and friendliness with them.", "paper_title": "Transmission Control for Future Internet including Error-prone Wireless Region", "paper_id": "WOS:000308334500014"}
