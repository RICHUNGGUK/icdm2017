The essence of the method consists of slicing the data until the dimensions of the slices are reduced to n = 4 and then \"unfold\" the data into 3D space. Specifically, we map a visual representation of y onto the boundaries of a hypercube or other polytope and unfold those boundaries into 3D space. The display of the data provides a structural representation of 2D slices which can be adjusted and manipulated, allowing geometric properties like connectivity to be easily studied.", "paper_title": "Visualization of data on unfolded hypercubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313711900012"}
