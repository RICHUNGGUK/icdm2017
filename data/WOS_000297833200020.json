When k = vertical bar D vertical bar, we get the Directed Steiner Forest (DSF) problem. The best known approximation ratios for these problems are: (O) over tilde (k(2/3)) for k-DSF by Charikar et al. (1999)[6], and O(k(1/2+epsilon)) for DSF by Chekuri et al. (2008)[7]. Our main result is achieving the first sub-linear in terms of n = vertical bar V vertical bar approximation ratio for DSF. Specifically, we give an O(n(epsilon).min{n(4/5), m(2/3)})-approximation scheme for DSF. For k-DSF we give a simple greedy O(k(1/2+epsilon))-approximation algorithm. This improves upon the best known ratio (O) over tilde (k(2/3)) by Charikar et al. (1999) [6], and (almost) matches, in terms of k, the best ratio known for the undirected variant (Gupta et al., 2010 [18]). This algorithm uses a new structure called start-junction tree which may be of independent interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
