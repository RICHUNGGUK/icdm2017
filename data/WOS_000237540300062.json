Its heterogeneous and dynamic nature demands a more flexible and intelligent framework than Internet does. We propose an adaptive middleware solution to address this issue. The system responds to the condition of the network to offer extensibility and efficiency. Furthermore, we propose an active controlling scheme, in which the multimedia delivery is able to adapt to the environment variation in a timely fashion. In addition, we describe an application scenario of our framework, which opens out a wide prospect.", "paper_title": "Context-aware adaptation for media delivery in pervasive computing environmente", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300062"}
