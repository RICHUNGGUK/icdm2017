How to select a reliable path becomes a critical issue in designing routing protocol. The metric for routing selection in terms of path availability which is based on link availability can be used to select reliable paths. Based on the random walk-based mobility model, we propose a prediction method for calculating the link availability at any time (LA(t)) on the basis of the duration T during which two nodes keep their movement status unchanged for the first time. Meanwhile, a general method to calculate the average LET ((tau) over bar) is developed as well as the general expression of LA(t) is given. Simulation results show that the results of our method are more approximate to the practical results as compared with those of other methods.", "paper_title": "Link availability at any time in MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200016"}
