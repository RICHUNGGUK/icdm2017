Methods: Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006. Results: Current research in the field of health and clinical management analyses impact and patient outcome of both established and recently presented approaches. Usability and effects of extracting data from computerized medical records for preventive core and surveillance issues are a topic as well as strategies or detecting adverse event. Conclusions: The best paper selection in the field of health and clinical management shows examples of excellent research on assessment, strategies and concepts far computerized health information management approaches. The articles emphasize the necessity of carefully considering health information systems regarding their outcome and compatibility with clinical routine. A concerted management of knowledge about evaluated health information management approaches will advance this trend and should lead to a more evidence-based design of the underlying systems.", "paper_title": "Health and clinical management - Comparing the clinical outcome of computerized strategies - Findings from the section on health and clinical management", "paper_id": "WOS:000242775200007"}
