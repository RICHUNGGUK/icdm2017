The Exner equation is written assuming that bed load transport is governed by a power law of the flow velocity and by a flow/sediment interaction parameter variable in time and space. The complete system is formed by four coupled partial differential equations and a genuinely Roe-type first order scheme has been used to solve it on triangular unstructured meshes. Exact solutions have been derived for the particular case of initial value Riemann problems with variable bed level and depending on particular forms of the solid discharge formula. The model, supplied with the corresponding solid transport formulae, is tested by comparing with the exact solutions. The model is validated against laboratory experimental data of different unsteady problems over erodible bed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
