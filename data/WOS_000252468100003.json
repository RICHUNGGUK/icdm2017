Nearest-neighbor CF is based either on similarities between users or between items, to form a neighborhood of users or items, respectively. Recent research has tried to combine the two aforementioned approaches to improve effectiveness. Traditional clustering approaches (k-means or hierarchical clustering) has been also used to speed up the recommendation process. In this paper, we use biclustering to disclose this duality between users and items, by grouping them in both dimensions simultaneously. We propose a novel nearest-biclusters algorithm, which uses a new similarity measure that achieves partial matching of users' preferences. We apply nearest-biclusters in combination with two different types of biclustering algorithms-Bimax and xMotif-for constant and coherent biclustering, respectively. Extensive performance evaluation results in three real-life data sets are provided, which show that the proposed method improves substantially the performance of the CF process.", "paper_title": "Nearest-biclusters collaborative filtering based on constant and coherent values", "paper_id": "WOS:000252468100003"}
