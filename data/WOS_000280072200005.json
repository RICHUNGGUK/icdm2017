This article improves on the existing Plotkin bound derived in an earlier paper (Greferath and O'Sullivan, Discr Math 289:11-24, 2004) and suggests a version of a Singleton bound. We also present some families of codes meeting these new bounds.", "paper_title": "New bounds for codes over finite Frobenius rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000280072200005"}
