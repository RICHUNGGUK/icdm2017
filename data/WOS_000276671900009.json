We show that even a single linear filter can be sensitive to a symmetry, in the sense that specific responses of the filter can rule it out. We state and prove a necessary and sufficient, readily computable, criterion for filter symmetry-sensitivity. We use it to show that the six filters in a second order DtG family have patterns of joint sensitivity which are distinct for 12 different classes of symmetry. This rich symmetry-sensitivity adds to the properties that make DtG filters well-suited for probing local image structure, and provides a set of landmark responses suitable to be the foundation of a nonarbitrary system of feature categories.", "paper_title": "Symmetry Sensitivities of Derivative-of-Gaussian Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000276671900009"}
