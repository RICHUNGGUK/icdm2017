And then, wavelet nu-support vector machine (W nu-SVM) with wavelet kernel is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of W nu-SVM, embedded chaotic particle swarm optimization (ECPSO) is also proposed to optimize parameters of W nu-SVM. The results of application in car sale estimation show that the estimation approach based on the W nu-SVM and ECPSO is effective and feasible. Compared with the traditional model, W nu-SVM method requires fewer samples and has better estimating precision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
