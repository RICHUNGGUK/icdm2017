To alleviate this problem, we present a simple middlebox model that succinctly describes how different middleboxes process packets and illustrate it by representing four common middleboxes. We set up a pilot online repository of middlebox models and prototyped model inference and validation tools.", "paper_title": "Modeling middleboxes", "paper_id": "WOS:000259540900005"}
