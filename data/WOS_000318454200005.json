To improve speed, the proposed priority scheme improves extremely unbalanced delays between the highest and lowest weight by integrating the multiplexer-based date selector with the priority encoder. Balanced propagation paths are analyzed based on the gate-level evaluation and demonstrated by post-layout simulation. In terms of scalability, this design is suitable for extending width and has a latency of only O(log m) for m requests. The proposed design also improves the critical path by using delayed-precharge technology for dynamic logic and transmission gate at transistor level. The simulation results show that, for 8-128 requests cases, this approach achieves balanced propagation paths from fastest to lowest path. The proposed design achieves a 4.5 speedup and a 57.2% decrease in power dissipation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
