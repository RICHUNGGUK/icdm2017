Grid realizes coordinated resource sharing across multiple management domains. VO is defined as a key concept for operation and management of grid services. Due to the fact that VO focuses on dynamic, cross-organizational sharing relationships, one of the central challenges in the construction of scalable VO is that protocol specified by VO may have process of parallel running. To solve this problem, we present a formal definition of non-honest participants' malicious coordination operations which are necessary for parallel attack counterexample in VO. Based on that, we present the two-level dynamic authorization policy deploying scheme in VO for eliminating parallel attacks.
