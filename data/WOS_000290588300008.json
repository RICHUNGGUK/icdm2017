The scalar product < v, w > is an element of [0,1] is the identity degree of v and w. Building on MV-sets and continuous functions and relations defined on them, we construct a compact [ 0,1]-valued first-order Lukasiewicz logic, whose set of unsatisfiable formulas is recursively enumerable. In the particular case when X is an orthonormal basis of E we recover classical Skolem first-order logic with identity, constants, functions and relations. Our main tools are the Kolmogorov dilation theorem for positive semidefinite kernels, and the Tarski-Seidenberg decision method for elementary algebra and geometry.", "paper_title": "A Compact [0,1]-valued First-order Lukasiewicz Logic with Identity on Hilbert Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000290588300008"}
