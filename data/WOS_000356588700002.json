For example, characters are redesigned to have better machine-readability even under various geometric distortions by embedding a geometric invariant into each character image to represent class label of the character. Another example is to embed various information into handwriting trajectory by using a new pen device, called a data-embedding pen. An experimental result showed that we can embed 32-bit information into a handwritten line of 5 cm length by using the pen device. In addition to those applications, we also discuss the relationship between data-embedding and pattern recognition in a theoretical point of view. Several theories tell that if we have appropriate supplementary information by data-embedding, we can enhance pattern recognition performance up to 100%.", "paper_title": "Data Embedding into Characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000356588700002"}
