Recently, the certificateless public key cryptography received wide attention since it could solve the certificate management problem in the traditional public key cryptography and solve the key escrow problem in the identity-based public key cryptography. In this paper, we present a strongly secure certificateless authenticated key agreement (CLAKA) protocol without pairing suitable for smart media and mobile environments, which is provably secure in the extended Canetti-Krawczyk (eCK) model and is secure as long as each party has at least one uncompromised secret. Compared with previous CLAKA protocols, our protocol has advantages over them in security or efficiency.", "paper_title": "A strongly secure pairing-free certificateless authenticated key agreement protocol suitable for smart media and mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700016"}
