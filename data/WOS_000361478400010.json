NMF aims to decompose a data matrix into the product of two matrices (respectively denoted as the basis vectors and the encoding vectors), whose entries are constrained to be nonnegative. Unlike the ordinary NMF, we propose a novel NMF, denoted as MMNMF, which considers both geometrical information and discriminative information hidden in the data. The geometrical information is discovered by minimizing the distance among the encoding vectors, while the discriminative information is uncovered by maximizing the distance among base vectors. Clustering experiments are performed on the real-world data sets of faces, images, and documents to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Nonnegative matrix factorization with manifold regularization and maximum discriminant information", "paper_id": "WOS:000361478400010"}
