Such initial value problems arise in certain astrophysical issues, like the polytropic models, applied to polytropic stars, and the general-relativistic polytropic models, applied to neutron stars. Comparison with similar codes is made by applying to these models.", "paper_title": "A RUNGE-KUTTA-FEHLBERG CODE FOR THE COMPLEX PLANE: COMPARING WITH SIMILAR CODES BY APPLYING TO POLYTROPIC MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304886400006"}
