However, the weight decay effect decreases linearly as the number of learning epochs increases. Although we can modify the original RLS algorithm to maintain a constant weight decay effect, the computational and space complexities of the modified RLS algorithm are very high. This paper first presents a set of more compact RLS equations for this modified RLS algorithm. Afterwards, to reduce the computational and space complexities, we propose a decoupled version for this algorithm. The effectiveness of this decoupled algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Decouple implementation of weight decay for recursive least square", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000020"}
