Based on the idea of delay fractioning, a new method is proposed for the delay-dependent stability analysis of fuzzy time-delay systems. Due to the instrumental idea of delay partitioning, the proposed stability condition is much less conservative than most of the existing results. The conservatism reduction becomes more obvious with the partitioning getting thinner. Based on this, the problem of stabilization via the so-called parallel distributed compensation scheme is also solved. Both the stability and stabilization results are further extended to time-delay fuzzy systems with time-varying parameter uncertainties. All the results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. The advantage of the results proposed in this paper lies in their reduced conservatism, as shown via detailed illustrative examples. The idea of delay partitioning is well demonstrated to be efficient for conservatism reduction and could be extended to solving other problems related to fuzzy delay systems.", "paper_title": "Stability and Stabilization of Delayed T-S Fuzzy Systems: A Delay Partitioning Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000268527100002"}
