The novelty of this work lies on the capability of the approach to treat the uncertainty held by the agent performing the diagnosis. To do so, we make use of evidential networks to represent and propagate the uncertain evidence gathered by the agent. Using forward and backward propagation of the information, the impact of the evidence over the different symptoms and causes of failure is quantified. The agent can then make use of this information as additional hints in an iterative diagnosis process until a desired degree of certainty is obtained. The model is compared with a deterministic one in which evidence is represented by binary states, that is, a symptom is either observed or not. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
