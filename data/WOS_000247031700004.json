In this paper, we present a solution for these fundamental problems based on E- Connections. We aim to use E- Connections to provide modelers with suitable means for developing Web ontologies in a modular way and to provide an alternative to the owl: imports construct. With such motivation, we present in this paper a syntactic and semantic extension of the Web Ontology language that covers E- Connections of OWL-DL ontologies. We show how to use such an extension as an alternative to the owl: imports construct in many modeling situations. We investigate different combinations of the logics SHIN( D), SHON( D) and SHIO( D) for which it is possible to design and implement reasoning algorithms, well- suited for optimization. Finally, we provide support for E-Connections in both an ontology editor, SWOOP, and an OWL reasoner, Pellet. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
