In particular, ontologically distinct compositions (called ontological compositions) that are not easily defined by using ISA and PART-OF relations are classified into characterizing, temporal, and spatial compositions (e.g., 'red face' and 'today'). In this paper, we precisely model such ontological compositions by using monadic second-order logic; properties and objects are expressed as predicates, and attributes are expressed as predicates of predicates. The proposed approach provides a novel technique for the classification of attributes as higher-order concepts, and it clarifies illegal compositions of properties and objects and the uniqueness of temporal attributes. Moreover, our composition ontology is described by a set of RDF triples using the metamodeling of concepts in RDF Schema.", "paper_title": "A Logical and Ontological Framework for Compositional Concepts of Objects and Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000352802100003"}
