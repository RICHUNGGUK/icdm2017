Two kinds of models are considered. In one model, the outputs contain time delay, while in another one, the outputs do not. One restriction in this brief is that the state delay and output delay are restricted to be equal. By referring to the algebraic representations of logical dynamics and using the techniques of semitensor product of matrices, some necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the synchronization of delay-coupled BNs. Examples including a practical epigenetic example are given for illustration.", "paper_title": "Synchronization in an Array of Output-Coupled Boolean Networks With Time Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518900014"}
