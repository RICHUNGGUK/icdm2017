CorMut is an R package designed to compute correlated mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. Three classical methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks. CorMut also enables the comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolutionary conditions.", "paper_title": "CorMut: an R/Bioconductor package for computing correlated mutations based on selection pressure", "paper_id": "WOS:000339814300019"}
