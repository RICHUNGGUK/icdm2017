In the first part of the paper, we introduce and study the properties of \"timed symport/antiport systems\". In the second part we introduce several new features for P systems: the association/deassociation of molecules (modeling for example the protein-protein interactions), ion channel rules and gene activation rules. We show that such timed systems are universal. We also prove several properties concerning these systems.", "paper_title": "Counting time in computing with cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800009"}
