This approach greatly improves the scalability of key agreement protocol in distributed environments and provides great user convenience. This article proposes a new password-based 3PEKE scheme that completes its entire job in only a record low four steps, which we prove that it is optimal for password-based 3PEKE protocols. The security of the proposed scheme, as we will detail later, has been proved in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Provably Secure Password-Based Three-Party Key Exchange With Optimal Message Steps", "paper_id": "WOS:000269200300003"}
