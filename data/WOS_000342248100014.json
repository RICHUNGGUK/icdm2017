Both sensor data and control commands are transmitted by the same network. And the packets may be randomly lost according to the Bernoulli distribution. In the infinite horizon expected total cost we derive expressions for computing the corresponding controller gain. And the hold-input compensation strategy is applied to the closed system in which the previous control signal is used when packet dropped. Moreover, illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
