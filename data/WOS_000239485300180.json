According to the principle of expert system and neural networks, Visual C++ 6.0 and SQL Sever 2000 are employed to develop hybrid expert system of pre-splitting blasting design based on BP neural networks. The proposed expert system is a coupling system of engineering database and three-layered BP neural networks, which can be applied into cutting excavation of the expressway. The experiments show that the system can enhance the reliability of in-site pre-splitting blasting design scheme, efficiency and quality of construction.", "paper_title": "An expert system based on BP neural networks for pre-splitting blasting design", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300180"}
