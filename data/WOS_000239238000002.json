Conditions may be imposed to ensure that control functions associated to normal extremals of such problems are Lipschitz continuous functions. Results concerning the degeneracy of the maximum principle for optimal control problems with state constraints and consequent results on normality are also known. Here, results on regularity and degeneracy are presented. Moreover, we analyse how conditions imposed to get regularity of the control function may also contribute to guarantee that the optimal solution is a normal extremal.", "paper_title": "On the regularity of optimal controls for a class of problems with state constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238000002"}
