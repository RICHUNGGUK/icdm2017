It is shown that by reducing the size of the deterministic FE model, a substantial improvement in the overall computational efficiency can be achieved. An implementation exploiting the features of the proposed formulation is presented. In this regard, especially the interaction with the 3rd party FE solvers has been addressed. The suggested method has been tested on a simple grid structure and also on a large building model, where the accuracy and efficiency of the introduced approach have been quantified.
