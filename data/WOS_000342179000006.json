While multiple channels available in WSN technology such as IEEE 802.15.4 can be exploited to mitigate interference, channel allocation can have a significant impact on the performance of multi-channel communication. This paper proposes a set of distributed protocols for channel allocation in WSNs with theoretical bounds. We first consider the problem of minimizing the number of channels needed to remove interference in a WSN, and propose both receiver-based and link-based distributed channel allocation protocols. Then, for WSNs with an insufficient number of channels, we formulate a fair channel allocation problem whose objective is to minimize the maximum interference (MinMax) experienced by any transmission link in the network. We prove that MinMax channel allocation is NP-hard, and propose a distributed link-based MinMax channel allocation protocol. Finally, we propose a distributed protocol for link scheduling based on MinMax channel allocation that creates a conflict-free schedule for transmissions. The proposed decentralized protocols are efficient, scalable, and adaptive to channel condition and network dynamics. Simulations based on the topologies and data traces collected from a WSN testbed of 74 TelosB motes have shown that our channel allocation protocols significantly outperform a state-of-the-art channel allocation protocol.", "paper_title": "Distributed Channel Allocation Protocols for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000006"}
