In order to save the buffer memory between VLD and IDCT and accelerate decoding speed, block-based pipeline buffers are adopted. Inverse scan (IScan) and inverse quantisation (IQ) are also merged into this architecture for cost-effective implementation and for easier system integration. A novel group-based architecture with the optimized look-up table is used for MPEG-2 and a new memory-efficient architecture with mixed memory organization is used for AVS. We use shared modules in both MPEG-2 and AVS as much as possible, such as the flush unit, the buffer controller and the buffers. Moreover, we propose merged IQ scheme and merged RAMs scheme. Based on 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, the proposed design consumes about 11.5 K gates at a clock constrain of 125 MHz. The simulation results show that it can achieve real-time decoding, such as HD1080i (1,920 x 1,088 at 30 MHz) format video of AVS and MPEG-2. Furthermore, we propose an effective design of the buffers between VLD and IDCT according to the IDCT architecture, a cost-efficient IQ architecture with full flexibility and an efficient scheme for accelerating VLC decoding.", "paper_title": "A cost-effective VLD architecture for MPEG-2 and AVS", "paper_id": "WOS:000255742500007"}
