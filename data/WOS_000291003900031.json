The first construction is dedicated to the case of symmetric MIMO-MAC where all the users have the same number of transmit antennas n(t) and transmit at the same level of per-user multiplexing gain r. Furthermore, we assume that the users transmit in an independent fashion and do not cooperate. The construction is systematic for any values of K, n(t) and r. It is proved that this newly proposed construction achieves the optimal MIMO-MAC diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) provided by Tse et al. at high-SNR regime. In the second part of the paper we take a further step to investigate the MAC-DMT of a general MIMO-MAC where the users are allowed to have different numbers of transmit antennas and can transmit at different levels of multiplexing gain. The exact optimal MAC-DMT of such channel is explicitly characterized in this paper. Interestingly, in the general MAC-DMT, some users might not be able to achieve their single-user DMT performance as in the symmetric case, even when the multiplexing gains of the other users are close to 0. Detailed explanations of such unexpected result are provided in this paper. Finally, by generalizing the code construction for the symmetric MIMO-MAC, explicit code constructions are provided for the general MIMO-MAC and are proved to be optimal in terms of the general MAC-DMT.", "paper_title": "DMT Optimal Codes Constructions for Multiple-Access MIMO Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900031"}
