To overcome these disadvantages, this paper investigates the generation of the orthogonal FH sequence and analyzes its multiple accessibility performance based on the CFH frequency division multiple-access (FDMA) network model. By the random mapping and cyclical shift replacement (CSR) scheme, a large family size of orthogonal FH sequence with dynamic frequency slot number is generated. In this case, the external interference could be eliminated by avoiding the interfered frequencies, and blocking mutual interference incurred for the packet by the orthogonal frequencies. Moreover, the theoretical relationships of the throughput and transmission delay with respect to the user number and the packet arrival rate are given, which shows that our proposed orthogonal FH sequence could support high throughput and short packet transmission delay in CFH-FDMA network. The simulation results validate our theoretical analysis of the CFH-FDMA network performance, and show that our proposed sequence outperforms the widely used no hit zone FH sequences in terms of uniformity, randomness, Hamming correlation, complexity and sensitivity, etc.", "paper_title": "Generation and characterization of orthogonal FH sequences for the cognitive network", "paper_id": "WOS:000350534000011"}
