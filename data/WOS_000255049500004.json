The authors proposed a model that links these constructs and empirically tested it in e-service settings. The results showed that satisfaction is a significant predictor of all three post-adoption behaviors: continuance, complaint, and recommendation. Negative affective response to e-service use was found to directly predict complaint behavior, but positive affect and negative affect did not influence customer satisfaction. The implications of these findings for e-service customer retention theory and practice are delineated.", "paper_title": "Post-adoption behaviors of e-service customers: The interplay of cognition and emotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000255049500004"}
