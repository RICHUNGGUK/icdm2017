These artifacts are often hard to suppress without introducing tissue blurring effects. In this paper, we propose to process LDCT images using a novel image-domain algorithm called \"artifact suppressed dictionary learning (ASDL).\" In this ASDL method, orientation and scale information on artifacts is exploited to train artifact atoms, which are then combined with tissue feature atoms to build three discriminative dictionaries. The streak artifacts are cancelled via a discriminative sparse representation operation based on these dictionaries. Then, a general dictionary learning processing is applied to further reduce the noise and residual artifacts. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on a large set of abdominal and mediastinum CT images are carried out and the results show that the proposed method can be efficiently applied in most current CT systems.", "paper_title": "Artifact Suppressed Dictionary Learning for Low-Dose CT Image Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345907400005"}
