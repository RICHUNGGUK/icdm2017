This limits their applicability, due to the motion blur effect. Recent technological advances have lead to adaptive image sensors that can combine several pixels together in real time to form a larger pixel. Larger pixels require shorter exposure times and produce high-frame-rate samples with reduced motion blur. This work proposes combining an FPGA with an adaptive image sensor to produce an output of high resolution both in space and time. The FPGA is responsible for the spatial resolution enhancement of the high-frame-rate samples using super-resolution (SR) techniques in real time. To achieve it, this article proposes utilizing the Iterative Back Projection (IBP) SR algorithm. The original IBP method is modified to account for the presence of noise, leading to an algorithm more robust to noise. An FPGA implementation of this algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture can serve as a general purpose real-time resolution enhancement system, and its performance is evaluated under various noise levels.", "paper_title": "Robust Real-Time Super-Resolution on FPGA and an Application to Video Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000208166700003"}
