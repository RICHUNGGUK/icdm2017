First, by choosing suitable variable substitution, the original system can be transformed into first-order differential equations. Then, we present several sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability of the equilibrium by using matrix measure and Halanay inequality, these criteria are simple in form and easy to verify in practice. Furthermore, when employing an error-feedback control term to the response neural network, parallel criteria regarding to the exponential synchronization of the drive-response neural network are also generated. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate our theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
