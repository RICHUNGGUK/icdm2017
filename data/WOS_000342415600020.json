We show that when sources are colocated, the outer bound is tight and the sets of zero-error achievable and vanishing-error achievable rate-capacity tuples are the same. Then, we extend this paper to networks subject to linear encoding constraints, routing constraints (where some or all nodes can only perform routing), and secrecy constraints. Finally, we show that even for apparently simple networks, design of optimal codes may be difficult. In particular, we prove that for the incremental multicast problem and for the single-source secure network coding problem, characterization of the achievable set can be very hard and linear network codes may not be optimal.", "paper_title": "Network Coding Capacity Regions via Entropy Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600020"}
