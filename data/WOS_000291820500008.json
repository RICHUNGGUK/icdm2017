The underlined HCR-HeNet divides its coverage into three layers: hierarchical cooperative basic layer, homogeneous cooperative enhanced layer, and heterogeneous cooperative extended layer. In the hierarchical cooperative basic layer, highspeed data transmission is enabled using highorder modulation and coding schemes for unicast services, and hierarchical modulation schemes for multicast services. In the homogeneous cooperative enhanced layer, where users may be located near a cell boundary and thus need the help of relay nodes, cooperative homogeneous diversity gain can be achieved. In the heterogeneous cooperative extended layer, heterogeneous cooperative diversity gain guarantees the convergence and interworking of multiradio access networks. The key techniques in the physical and MAC layers are identified. Issues in the application of cognitive radio and self-organized networking techniques in HCR-HeNet are also discussed. Finally, a physical layer testbed for the proposed HCR-HeNet with multicast services is introduced.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL COOPERATIVE RELAY BASED HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291820500008"}
