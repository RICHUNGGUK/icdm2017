We demonstrate the method in several graph-based segmentation approaches as a basic step (which should be followed by some proper approach-specific adaptive procedure) and show its advantage over methods that do not exploit object information and over methods that recompute weights during delineation, which make the user to lose control over the segmentation process. We also validate the method using medical data from two imaging modalities (CT and MRI-T1). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
