Moreover, verification and debugging of exceptions and external interrupts on such processors are nontrivial tasks. Because the exceptions arrival time, the external interrupt arrival time, as well as the microprocessor response time must be precise, verification and debugging require sophisticated hardware and software capabilities. This article proposes techniques for effective verification and debugging of cycle-accurate OOO processors in the event of exceptions and external interrupts. The results show that our te chniques reduce the complexity of the verification and debugging processes by reducing the number of simulation cycles (3.3 x average reduction) and the number of state variables (8.7 x average reduction) to be traced for localizing bugs.", "paper_title": "Formal Verification and Debugging of Precise Interrupts on High Performance Microprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000310163000002"}
