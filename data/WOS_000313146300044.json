In this paper, a novel method for Software FMEA is presented based on co-analysis of system model and software model. The method is hopeful to detect quantitative and dynamic effects by a targeted software failure. A typical application of the method is provided to illustrate the procedure and the applicable scenarios. In addition, a pattern is refined from the application for further reuse.", "paper_title": "Software FMEA for Safety-Critical System Based on Co-analysis of System Model and Software Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146300044"}
