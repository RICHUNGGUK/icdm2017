Explicit closure relations for fluxes and production terms are obtained, including scattering of electrons with acoustic and non polar optical phonons and surface scattering. Numerical simulations of a quantum diode show the feasibility of the model. The importance of the non parabolicity is assessed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
