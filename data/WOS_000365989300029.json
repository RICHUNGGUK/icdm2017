We show that the proposed model naturally gives rise to information granules that are both of higher order and higher type, offering a compelling justification behind their emergence. In a concise way, we can capture the overall architecture of information granules as a hierarchy exhibiting conceptual layers of increasing abstraction: numeric data -> information granules -> information granules of type-2, order-2 -> ... information granules of higher type/order. The elevated type of information granules is reflective of the visible hierarchical facet of processing and the inherent diversity of the individual locally revealed structures in data. While the concept and the methodology deliver some general settings, the detailed algorithmic aspects are discussed in detail when using fuzzy clustering realized by means of fuzzy c-means. Furthermore, for illustrative purposes, we mainly focus on interval-valued fuzzy sets and granular interval fuzzy sets arising at the higher level of the hierarchy. Higher type fuzzy sets are formed with the help of the principle of justifiable granularity. The conceptually sound hierarchy is established in a general way, which makes it equally applicable to various formalisms of representation of information granules. Experiments are reported for synthetic and publicly available datasets.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Granular Clustering: An Emergence of Information Granules of Higher Type and Higher Order", "paper_id": "WOS:000365989300029"}
