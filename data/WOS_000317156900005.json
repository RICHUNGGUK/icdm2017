Although supporting mobility management is one of the key benefits of ID/Locator separation, we believe that it's still an open issue how to implement it in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a network based mobility management scheme supported for ID/Locator separation (NMMIS). The basic idea of NMMIS is to integrate a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain into an edge network of ID/Locator separation architecture. In NMMIS, we design a revised Proxy Mobile IPv6 which split the control plane and data plane of Local Mobility Anchor to achieve distributed mobility management. We present an efficient micro mobility management of NMMIS based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, and a macro mobility management drawing support from ID/Locator separation is also demonstrated. We also evaluate the handover performance of NMMIS and give the comprehensive comparison with some well known existing mobility management protocols supported for ID/Locator separation. A study of one NMMIS domain's capacity is also presented, which benefiting from distributed mobility management is larger than PMIPv6 domain. The prototype of NMMIS has been implemented in our real laboratory test-bed, and the result can be an experimental evidence of NMMIS's handover performance.", "paper_title": "A Network Based Mobility Management Scheme Supported for ID/Locator Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900005"}
