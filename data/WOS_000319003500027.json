However, because of the high dimension of data space and complexity of matching methods, most of the existing approaches cannot return the result in real time. This paper proposes a high level semantic feature in a low dimensional space to represent the essential characteristic of different motion classes. On the basis of the statistic training of Gauss Mixture Model, this feature can effectively achieve motion matching on both global clip level and local frame level. Experiment results show that our approach can retrieve similar motions with rankings from large motion database in real-time and also can make motion annotation automatically on the fly.
