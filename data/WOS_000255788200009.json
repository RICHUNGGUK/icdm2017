The accelerometer consists of (n + m) identical modules: n of them serve as the main device, while the remaining m modules act as the redundancy. The yield model for MEMS redundancy repair is developed by statistical analysis. Based upon the yield model, the yield increase after redundancy repair for different in and n numbers is analyzed. ANSYS Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the yield of BISR/non-BISR MEMS devices with random point-stiction defects. The simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction based on our yield model. The simulation results also show that the SRMEMS leads to effective yield increase compared to non-BISRS design, especially for a moderate initial yield.", "paper_title": "Yield analysis for self-repairable MEMS devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788200009"}
