From the result of software testing, developers can make an assessment about the quality or the acceptability of developed software. It is noted that during testing, the test case is a pair of input and expected output, and a number of test cases will be executed either sequentially or randomly. The techniques of test case prioritization usually schedule test cases for regression testing in an order that attempts to increase the effectiveness. However, the cost of test cases and the severity of faults are usually varied. In this paper, we propose a method of cost-cognizant test case prioritization based on the use of historical records. We gather the historical records from the latest regression testing and then propose a genetic algorithm to determine the most effective order. Some controlled experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed method has improved the fault detection effectiveness. It can also been found that prioritizing test cases based on their historical information can provide high test effectiveness during testing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
