This problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming with an objective function of maximizing the total user bandwidth utilities in the whole network. Such a formulation jointly considers fairness and AP selection. We first propose a centralized algorithm Non-Linear Approximation Optimization for Proportional Fairness (NLAO-PF) to derive the user-AP association via relaxation. Since the relaxation may cause a large integrality gap, a compensation function is introduced to ensure that our algorithm can achieve at least half of the optimal in the worst case. This algorithm is assumed to be adopted periodically for resource management. To handle the case of dynamic user membership, we propose a distributed heuristic Best Performance First (BPF) based on a novel performance revenue function, which provides an AP selection criterion for newcomers. When an existing user leaves the network, the transmission times of other users associated with the same AP can be redistributed easily based on NLAO-PF. Extensive simulation study has been performed to validate our design and to compare the performance of our algorithms to those of the state of the art.", "paper_title": "AP Association for Proportional Fairness in Multirate WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000331966900015"}
