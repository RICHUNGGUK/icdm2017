It was finally shown by Frieze in 1986 that the random graph G(n, p) with p = c/n has a cycle on at all but at most (1+epsilon)ce(-c)n vertices with high probability, where epsilon = epsilon(c) -> 0 as c -> infinity. This estimate on the number of uncovered vertices is essentially tight due to vertices of degree 1. However, for the random digraph D(n, p) no tight result was known and the best estimate was a factor of c/2 away from the corresponding lower bound. In this work we close this gap and show that the random digraph D(n, p) with p = c/n has a cycle containing all but (2 + epsilon)e(-c)n vertices w.h.p., where epsilon = epsilon(c) -> 0 as c -> infinity. This is essentially tight since w.h.p. such a random digraph contains (2e(-c) -o(1))n vertices with zero in-degree or out-degree. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
