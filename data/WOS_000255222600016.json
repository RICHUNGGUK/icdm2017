As for a finite pattern, synthesis for minimizing tile or bond types is equivalent to a minimum graph coloring problem, two greedy algorithms that reduce the number of tiles (PATS-Tile) or bonds (PATS-Bond) in synthesized tile sets are proposed and evaluated. Both algorithms are 0(14) for a square pattern of dimension l. It is shown by simulation that PATS-Tile has a better average performance if both types of reduction must be accomplished.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of tile sets for DNA self-assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000255222600016"}
