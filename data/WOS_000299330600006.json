The first method assumes a partial knowledge on the camera parameters, whereas the second method consists in an auto-calibration method with no assumption on the parameters of the camera. Instead, the auto-calibration is performed by identifying a roughly fronto-parallel pose of the camera w.r.t. the projection surface. The fact that camera calibration is not needed increases the usability of the methods and at the same time eliminates one potential source of inaccuracy, since errors in the camera calibration would otherwise inevitably propagate through the projector calibration. Not using a printed pattern as most existing methods do is another gain in accuracy and ease of use. As depicted by our experiments, both methods enjoy a good stability and give good results when compared against existing methods.", "paper_title": "Methods for geometrical video projector calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330600006"}
