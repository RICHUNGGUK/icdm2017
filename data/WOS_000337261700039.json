An augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional containing a triple integral term and considering more information of activation functions is constructed. Then, Wirtinger-based inequality and two zero-value free-weighting matrix equations are used to deal with the derivative of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Those treatments lead to less conservatism. A numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
