A thin hydrophilic layer with matrix array of circular holes was first fabricated on flat substrate by photolithography. A hydrophobic layer was then imprinted on top of the hydrophilic layer. By filling a very low viscosity prepolymer material into each circular hole via drop-on-demand printing, refractive lens with spherical shape was self assembled by force of surface tension. An integral imaging system using the proposed microlens array was demonstrated by closely placing object to the microlens array. The good image quality indicates that the proposed polymer microlens array has potential applications in three-dimensional displays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
