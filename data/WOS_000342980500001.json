Some types of MMP are overexpressed by malignant tumors, mainly the MMP-2 subtype, and have been associated to cancer invasiveness and metastasis. A receptor-independent (RI) 4D-QSAR formalism was applied, herein, to a set of forty beta-N-biaryl ether sulfonamide hydroxamates, previously reported as potent MMP-2 inhibitors, in order to map 3D-pharmacophore models and predict novel antitumor agents. The best RI 4D-QSAR model was statistically significant (N= 30, r(2) = 0.93, q(2) = 0.88, five occupancy descriptors (GCOD), LSE= 0.04, LOF= 0.11, outliers= 0), robust and not obtained by chance. The external predictability was 75% (test set; N= 8). A different orientation (binding mode) in the MMP-2 catalytic site was suggested regarding the most hydrophobic portion (R-1) of the compounds' structure. Compounds were predicted and their inhibitory activity against MMP-2 was calculated by using the optimum RI 4D-QSAR model. The findings have provided interesting information to drive the designing and synthesis of novel potentially MMP-2 inhibitors against melanoma invasion.", "paper_title": "Predicting Novel Antitumor Agents: 3D-Pharmacophore Mapping of beta-N-biaryl Ether Sulfonamide-Based Hydroxamates as Potentially MMP-2 Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000342980500001"}
