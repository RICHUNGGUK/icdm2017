Those are a programmable RF test attenuator and a reconfigurable low noise amplifier (LNA), optimized with respect to their function and location in the circuit. We discuss their performances in terms of the test- and normal operation mode. The presented application model aims at a transceiver under loopback test with enhanced controllability and detectability. The circuits are designed for 0.35 mu m CMOS process. Simulation results of the receiver frontend operating in 2.4 GHz band are presented showing tradeoffs between the performance and test functionality.", "paper_title": "CMOS blocks for on-chip RF test", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500008"}
