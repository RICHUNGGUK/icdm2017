We assume that the active recipients in such a system (i.e. those who pay for the current transmission) obtain a key necessary for decoding the transmission. If the set of recipients changes, the system has to update the key and inform the legitimate users about the change. Communication medium we consider here is an ad hoc network of users organized in the same way as GSM or UMTS: the service area is divided into cells, each cell serves a limited number of users. Communication with the users in a cell is through a shared communication channel of this cell. We present a procedure for distributing a new key to a new set of active users. We pursue three goals: communication volume related to a change of the encryption key should be kept as small as possible, the energy cost for each legitimate user should be low, the update process should not reveal any information about users behavior. Our scheme is based on balanced allocation algorithms. It is simple, easy to implement, preserves anonymity. It has small communication overhead and low energy cost for the users. It works very well for a practical parameter size.", "paper_title": "Anonymous distribution of encryption keys in cellular broadcast systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240059200008"}
