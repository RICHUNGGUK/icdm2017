Although various methods have been proposed for detecting FFSNs, these mechanisms have low detection accuracy and protracted detection time. This study presents a novel detection scheme, designated as the Genetic-based ReAl-time DEtection (GRADE) system, to identify FFSNs in real time. GRADE differentiates between FFSNs and benign services by employing two new characteristics: the entropy of domains of preceding nodes for all A records and the standard deviation of round trip time to all A records. By applying genetic algorithms, GRADE is able to find the best strategy to detect current FFSN trends. Empirical results show GRADE has very high detection accuracy (similar to 98%) and gives results within a few seconds. It provides considerable improvement over existing reference schemes such Flux-Score [9], FFBD [13] and SSFD [14]. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
