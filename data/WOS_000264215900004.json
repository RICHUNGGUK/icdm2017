Given a polygon with n edges and m concave regions, the algorithm decides in time O(n(2) + nm(2) + m(4)) whether the polygon can be cleared by the two 1-searches, and if so, constructs a search schedule. The pursuers are allowed to move on the boundary and in the interior of the polygon. They are not required to maintain mutual visibility throughout the pursuit.", "paper_title": "CLEARING A POLYGON WITH TWO 1-SEARCHERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264215900004"}
