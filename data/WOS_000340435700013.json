We derive the properties and relationships of fundamental operations on IVHFSs for Algebraic t-norm and t-conorm. Furthermore, we present the operations based on Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm and investigate their properties. The results obtained using the two types of t-norms and t-conorms could be useful for applications of IVHFSs in information aggregation and decision making.", "paper_title": "Properties of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700013"}
