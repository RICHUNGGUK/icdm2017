Its backbone is formed by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) multi-criteria method and our earlier research on the popularity and impact of redesign:best practices. Using (AHP) we derive a classification of most suitable best practices for the process being redesigned. Criteria such as the popularity, the impact, the goals and the risks of BPR implementation are taken into account. A case study of a municipality in the Netherlands is included. It discusses which best practices should be applied to redesign the invoicing process at the municipality.", "paper_title": "BPR implementation: A decision-making strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100034"}
