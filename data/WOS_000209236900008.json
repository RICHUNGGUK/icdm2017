Seeking the principles behind those interactions have consequences potentially related to any type of interpersonal function, far beyond the so-called \"motor\" processes typically associated with the study of movements, be it perceptive, cognitive, affective, pragmatic, or epistemic. Here, we present the way the framework of coordination dynamics define and addresses the interactive actions in a dyad. We first introduce the basics of pattern formation as the roots of the theoretical approach of coordination dynamics, and then the way this framework may contribute to establish a solution to classify behaviors. Thereafter we review promising empirical results on the dynamics of interpersonal coordination, and finally discuss were to go next to decipher the way the coordination between two people and the way each individual contribute may be disentangled.", "paper_title": "Challenges for the understanding of the dynamics of social coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000209236900008"}
