The aim of this article is to present a novel algorithm - denominated as \"Ordered Paired-Comparisons Algorithm\" (OPCA), which addresses this decision-making problem in a relatively simple and practical way. The OPCA is organized into three main phases: (i) turning multi-agent preference orderings into sets of paired comparisons, (ii) synthesizing the paired-comparison sets, and (iii) constructing a fused (or consensus) ordering. Particularly interesting is phase two, which introduces a new aggregation process based on a priority sequence, obtained from the agents' importance rank-ordering. A detailed description of the new algorithm is supported by practical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
