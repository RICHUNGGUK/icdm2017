In this study, a CFD-DEM model for complex geometries is developed, where DEM code is coupled with ANSYS/Fluent software through its User Defined Function. The Fluent Eulerian multiphase model is employed to couple with DEM, whose secondary phase acts as a ghost phase but just an image copy of DEM field. The proposed procedure preserves phase conservation and ensures the Fluent phase-coupled SIMPLE solver work stable. The model is used to simulate four typical fluidization cases, respectively, a single pulsed jet fluidized bed, fluidized bed with an immersed tube, fluidization regime transition from bubbling to fast, and a simplified two-dimensional circulating fluidized bed loop. The simulation results are satisfactory. The present approach provides an easily implemented and reliable method for CFD-DEM model on complex geometries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
