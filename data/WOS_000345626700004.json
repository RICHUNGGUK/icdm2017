The DFT/B3LYP/HuzIII-su3 level of theory was employed. The C-13 shielding constants of guest molecules are close to available experimental data. In two cases (the ethane in 5(12) and the propane in 5(12)6(2) cages) the C-13 shielding constants are reported for the first time. Inversion of the methyl/methylene C-13 and H-1 shielding constants order is found for propane in the 5(12)6(2) cage. Topological criteria are used to interpret the changes of values of NMR parameters of water molecules and they establish a connection between single cages and bulk crystal.", "paper_title": "Calculations of NMR properties for sI and sII clathrate hydrates of methane, ethane and propane", "paper_id": "WOS:000345626700004"}
