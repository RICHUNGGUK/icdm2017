Firstly, by using the Choquet integral with respect to the capacity mu, we introduce the concept of ambiguous risk premium rho(u)(X) of a risk asset X for risk aversive individuals whose utility function is u, and we investigate some properties of the ambiguous risk premium under some assumptions. Then to illustrate our theoretical results, we give an example and empirical results.", "paper_title": "AMBIGUOUS RISK AVERSION UNDER CAPACITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000306184900009"}
