If the computer systems of an enterprise are modeled with CySeMoL, this inference engine can assess the probability that attacks on the systems will succeed. The theory used for the attack-probability calculations in CySeMoL is a compilation of research results on a number of security domains and covers a range of attacks and countermeasures. The theory has previously been validated on a component level. In this paper, the theory is also validated on a system level. A test indicates that the reasonableness and correctness of CySeMoL assessments compare with the reasonableness and correctness of the assessments of a security professional. CySeMoL's utility has been tested in case studies.", "paper_title": "The Cyber Security Modeling Language: A Tool for Assessing the Vulnerability of Enterprise System Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000321641800003"}
