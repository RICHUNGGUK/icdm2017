First, we apply CTMMID to discretize both space and time variables. The initial and boundary conditions could be incorporated efficiently with full CTMMID. Furthermore, we introduce the Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) in space and the block-marching technique in time for problems defined in large interval and long time computing. The numerical results are more accurate and with less computational effort than some existing studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
