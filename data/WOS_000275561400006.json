The Hamiltonian system approach is employed to analyze the propagation of shear wave. In this system, critical torsional loads and buckling modes are reduced to a problem of eigenvalues and eigensolutions of increasing orders. Buckling modes are divided into two types, the local torsional buckling modes and the helical buckling modes. For short-time shear wave propagation, local torsional buckling occurs easily. On the contrary, the helical buckling modes appear when the wave propagates for a longer time and these modes correspond to the first-order eigensolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
