It relaxes the special conditions on the reference model that is required by some of the approaches described in the literature, as well as covering a more general class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) systems. The stability of the proposed method is proved using a proper Lyapunov function. In addition, the effects of modeling errors on the proposed controller are considered, and a robust modification algorithm to alleviate this problem is introduced and analyzed. The proposed method is then simulated on a flexible joint robot in a feedback linearization form and on Chua's chaotic electrical circuit. Finally, it is implemented and tested on a nonlinear dc motor with nonlinear state-dependent disturbance.", "paper_title": "Direct Model Reference Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Control of SISO Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295586600010"}
