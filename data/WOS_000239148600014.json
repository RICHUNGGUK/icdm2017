Key to a truly cognitive system, is the ability to learn: to be able to build and use models constructed autonomously from sensory input. In this paper we overview a number of steps we have taken along the route to the construction of such a system, and discuss some remaining challenges.", "paper_title": "Cognitive vision: Integrating symbolic qualitative representations with computer vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000239148600014"}
