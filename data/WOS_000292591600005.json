HARD relies on recording application resource utilisation and throughput to adaptively change cores for applications during runtime. The authors show that HARD can be configured to achieve both performance and power improvements and compare HARD to an alternative dynamic scheduler and a static scheduler to provide better understanding.", "paper_title": "History-aware, resource-based dynamic scheduling for heterogeneous multi-core processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000292591600005"}
