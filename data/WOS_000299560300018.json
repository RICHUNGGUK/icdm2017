For this, detection conditions that take hazards into consideration need to be used. However, since the occurrence of pulses cannot be predicted accurately based on a gate-level circuit description, the transition fault model becomes more susceptible to pattern-dependent effects, where errors on observed outputs that are predicted by the fault model may not appear in a circuit-under-diagnosis. This paper considers the implications of these pattern-dependent effects on the resolution of fault diagnosis based on transition faults.", "paper_title": "Resolution of Diagnosis Based on Transition Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560300018"}
