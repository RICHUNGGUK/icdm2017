In this paper, we will study a class of nonlinear system with Markovian switching, whose coefficients satisfy the one-sided polynomial growth condition and the local Lipschitz condition. This paper shows that the Brownian motion may suppress the potential explosion of the solution of the deterministic nonlinear system under some conditions. Moreover, another Brownian motion may exponentially stabilize the system. Finally, an example is given to illustrate our results.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Hybrid System with Polynomial Growth Coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000315569800005"}
