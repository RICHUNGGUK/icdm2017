Hardwiring such automata raise surface area and clock frequency constraints, requiring efficient E-transitions-removal techniques. In this paper, we present new bounds on the number of new transitions for several E-transitions-removal problems. We study the case of acyclic WFA. We introduce a new problem, the partial removal of e-transitions while accepting short chains of E-transitions.", "paper_title": "Path-equivalent removals of epsilon-transitions in a genomic weighted finite automaton", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312700004"}
