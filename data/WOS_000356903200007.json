However, a well-known conundrum of SVMs (and other supervised learning methods) is the black box character of their predictions, which makes it difficult to understand why models succeed or fail. Herein we introduce an approach to rationalize the performance of SVM models based upon the Tanimoto kernel compared with the linear kernel. Model comparison and interpretation are facilitated by a visualization technique, making it possible to identify descriptor features that determine compound activity predictions. An implementation of the methodology has been made freely available.", "paper_title": "Visualization and Interpretation of Support Vector Machine Activity Predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000356903200007"}
