This paper presents the development of an ontology for the cooking domain, to be integrated in a dialog system. The ontology comprehends four main modules covering the key concepts of the cooking domain - actions, food, recipes, and utensils - and three auxiliary modules - units and measures, equivalencies and plate types.", "paper_title": "Cooking an ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122400021"}
