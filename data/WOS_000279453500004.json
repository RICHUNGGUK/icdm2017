Results obtained show a lack of performance and scalability on current Multiagent Platforms, but the existing research does not tackle poor efficiency causes. This article is aimed not only at testing the performance of Multiagent Platforms but also the discovery of Multiagent Platform design decisions that can lead to these deficiencies. Therefore, we are able to understand to what extent the internal design of a Multiagent Platform affects its performance. The experiments performed are focused on the features involved in agent communication.", "paper_title": "A performance evaluation of three multiagent platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000279453500004"}
