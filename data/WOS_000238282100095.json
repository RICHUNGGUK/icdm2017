The possible schemes are presented and their performances are illustrated by applying them to the power flow problem of the Klos Kemer 11-busbar system. The performance of the hybrid algorithm in terms of reliability is further improved by applying the optimal Values for both inertia weight and mutation probability which are found through parameter sensitivity analyses.", "paper_title": "A hybrid genetic algorithm/particle swarm approach for evaluation of power flow in electric network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100095"}
