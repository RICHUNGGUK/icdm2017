After data file is outsourced, data owner no longer physical controls over the storage. To efficiently verify these data integrity, several Proof of Retrievability (POR) schemes were proposed to achieve data integrity checking. The existing POR schemes offer decent solutions to address various practical issues, however, they either have a non-trivial (linear or quadratic) communication cost, or only support private verification. And most of the existing POR schemes exist active attack and information leakage problem in the data checking procedure. It remains open to design a secure POR scheme with both public verifiability and constant communication cost. To solve the above problems , we propose a novel preserving-private POR scheme with public verifiability and constant communication cost based on end-to-end aggregation authentication in this paper. To resist information leakage, we include zero-knowledge technique to hide the data in the integrity checking process. Our scheme is shown to be secure and efficient by security analysis and performance analysis. The security of our scheme is related to the Computational Diffie-Helleman Problem and Discrete logarithm problem. Finally, we also extend the POR scheme to support multi-file integrity checking and simulation results show that the verifier only needs less computational cost to achieve data integrity checking in our extended scheme.", "paper_title": "Efficient public verification proof of retrievability scheme in cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400022"}
