However, in Cognitive Ergonomics, individual differences have mainly been interpreted as expertise effects. As can be noted from the literature, this limitation has led to difficulties in explaining differences between experts. Using a case study which identifies significant variations between expert performances [Jouglet, D., Piechowiak, S., Vanderhaegen, F., 2003. A shared workspace to support man-machine reasoning: application to cooperative distant diagnosis. Cognition, Technology & Work 5, 127-139], we attempt to go beyond the traditional approach based on expertise levels. Instead, we refer to the notion of cognitive styles. First, we consider methodological issues raised by a posteriori identification of cognitive styles within this diagnosis task. Second, we present the results of our analysis showing that individual differences are related to a particular dimension of cognitive style in which a balance between task requirements and cognitive resources is managed. Finally, we draw conclusions on the importance of cognitive styles in Cognitive Ergonomics. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
