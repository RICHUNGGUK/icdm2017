Previously, subjective rating (self-assessment) has often been a preferred measure, due to its ease of use and relative sensitivity to the cognitive load variations. However, it can only be feasibly measured in a post-hoc manner with the user's cooperation, and is not available as an online, continuous measurement during the progress of the cognitive task. In this paper, we used a cognitive task inducing seven different levels of workload to investigate workload discrimination using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The entropy, energy, and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients extracted from the segmented EEGs were found to change very consistently in accordance with the induced load, yielding strong significance in statistical tests of ranking accuracy. High accuracy for subject-independent multichannel classification among seven load levels was achieved, across the twelve subjects studied. We compare these results with alternative measures such as performance, subjective ratings, and reaction time (response time) of the subjects and compare their reliability with the EEG-based method introduced. We also investigate test/re-test reliability of the recorded EEG signals to evaluate their stability over time. These findings bring the use of passive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for continuous memory load measurement closer to reality, and suggest EEG as the preferred measure of working memory load.", "paper_title": "Beyond Subjective Self-Rating: EEG Signal Classification of Cognitive Workload", "paper_id": "WOS:000366614800004"}
