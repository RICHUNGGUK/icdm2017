Most of the PC-based music visualization tools employ visual effects such as bars, waves and particle animations. In this work we define a new music visualization scheme that aims to create life-like interactive virtual environment which simulates concert arena by combining different research areas such as crowd animation, facial animation, character modeling and audio analysis.", "paper_title": "Music driven real-time 3D concert simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800049"}
