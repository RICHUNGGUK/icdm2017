A robust estimate of this measure has thus far not been demonstrated. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the underlying parameters which influence the numerical estimates of blood oxygenation. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the estimation performance of venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Y-v) as a function of noise, physiologic and geometric parameters. Furthermore, we present a novel algorithm for estimating Y-v from the temporal decay of an MR signal. The proposed algorithm incorporates prior information about the functional dependence between Y-v and relaxation rates. We compare our algorithm to an existing method in the literature and analyze the estimation performance. We show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient, achieving gains in performance as high as 92 %. We also show how our estimation algorithm takes advantage of signal features that are specific to the underlying physiology and geometry. We argue that optimal acquisition sequences, and corresponding estimation methods, should take into account such features in order to obtain robust estimates of blood oxygenation.", "paper_title": "Efficient and robust estimation of blood oxygenation levels in single cerebral veins", "paper_id": "WOS:000303354700005"}
