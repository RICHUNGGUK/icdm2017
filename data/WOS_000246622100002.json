This paper considers the fault diameter of the product graph G(1) * G(2) of two graphs G(1) and G(2) and proves that Dk1+k2(G(1) * G(2)) <= D-k1 (G(1)) + D-k2(G(2)) + 1 if G(1) is k(1)-connected and G(2) is k(2)-connected. This generalizes some known results such as Banic and Zerovnik [I. Banic, J. Zerovnik, Fault-diameter of Cartesian graph bundles, Inform. Process. Lett. 100 (2) (2006) 47-51]. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
