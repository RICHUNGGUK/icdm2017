Based on the energy model of a solar-powered node, we develop efficient energy-aware topology-control and routing schemes which utilize a backbone network consisting of energy-rich nodes within the WSN. This backbone handles most of the traffic with low latency, while reconfiguring itself dynamically in response to changes in the availability of energy at each node. Simulation results demonstrate that our schemes can achieve a balance between latency and energy consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
