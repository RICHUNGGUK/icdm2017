This feature makes it suitable for e-textile applications. However, with high frequent wear and tear or other faults in use, e-textiles are still prone to be disabled for the destruction of the communication network. In this paper, we introduce dual rings to connect the nodes, instead of the single rings in the original e-textile token grid. The topology and the reliable operations are discussed. And we have also evaluated the uniform load capacity of the new network. Simulation results show that the new communication network can improve the ability of e-textile applications to tolerate faults.", "paper_title": "The e-textile token grid network with dual rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100122"}
