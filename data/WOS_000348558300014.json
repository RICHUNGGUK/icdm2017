For the energy of conservative systems being as close to the initial energy as possible, a modified version of explicit Runge-Kutta methods is presented. The order of the modified Runge-Kutta method is the same as the standard Runge-Kutta method, but it is superior in energy-preserving to the standard one. Comparing the modified Runge-Kutta method with the standard Runge-Kutta method, numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the modified Runge-Kutta method.", "paper_title": "A MODIFIED VERSION OF EXPLICIT RUNGE-KUTTA METHODS FOR ENERGY-PRESERVING", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558300014"}
