This includes both (even complex) Medical devices and all kind of wearable device. In addition, with the increasing use of Cloud technologies to manage and store sensitive data from patients, the problem of assuring data privacy is more and more important in E-Health systems. Privacy requirements in Medical domains are not only defined by service providers or users, but Legal rules regulate the whole management and storage processes of health records. The use of Model Driven techniques for E-Health systems is appealing especially if formal verification of privacy requirements is enacted. In this paper we extend the MetaMORP(h)OSY modelling profile in order to explicitly consider privacy requirements for data. A novel model transformation algorithm is described for the application of Model Checking techniques to privacy verification.", "paper_title": "A model driven approach to data privacy verification in E-Health systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366902200003"}
