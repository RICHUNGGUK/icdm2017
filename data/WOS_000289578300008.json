Normalization of the exponential reduction and confluence of the full one is proved. These results are directed and adjusted to give a translation of Boudol's untyped lambda-calculus with resources extended with a linear-nonlinear reduction a la Ehrhard and Regnier's differential lambda-calculus. Such reduction comes in two flavours: baby-step and giant-step beta-reduction. The translation, based on Girard's encoding A -> B similar to !A (sic) B and as such extending the usual one for lambda-calculus into proof nets, enjoys bisimulation for giant-step beta-reduction. From this result we also derive confluence of both reductions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
