We examine the ways in which tasks with different characteristics affect individuals' use of internal and external knowledge and the outcomes of such behaviors. Our analysis reveals that interdependent and non-routine tasks drive internal knowledge sourcing, while complex tasks motivate external knowledge sourcing. Internal and external knowledge sourcing activities contribute to individuals' cognitive adaptation and innovation, with a negative interaction between them, while cognitive replication benefits only from internal knowledge sourcing. These findings can help managers better satisfy individuals' knowledge needs and achieve intended organizational outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
