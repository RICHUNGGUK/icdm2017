This algorithm is available to both contact types, which are the particle-to-particle contact and the surface-to-particle one. It is employed to determine the actual boundary normal vector and apply the reproducing condition in the cylindrical coordinate. The variational equation based on the virtual work principle is derived and its solution is obtained by the penalty method, which includes both a penetration and a penetration rate. Numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the elasto-plastic contact problem for the case that either both bodies are deformable or one is a rigid wall and the other is deformable. Two colliding bodies can be separated with the expected rebound velocity and the total contact force acting on between them similar to theoretical value. Results of the rod impact analysis are shown to be in agreement with the ones obtained by other solution and experiment. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
