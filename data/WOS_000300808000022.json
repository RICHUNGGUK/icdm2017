The problem contains multiple products, inventory and berth capacity at the loading port and a heterogeneous fleet of ships. The goal is to create an annual delivery program to fulfill the producer's long-term contracts at minimum cost, while maximizing the revenue from selling LNG in the spot market. To solve this problem we have developed a construction and improvement heuristic (CIH). The CIH is a multi-start local search heuristic that constructs a set of solutions using a greedy insertion procedure. The solutions are then improved using either a first-descent neighborhood search, branch-and-bound on a mathematical formulation, or both. Tests on real-life instances show that the CIH provides good solutions in a short amount of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
