We evaluate this schema referred to as non-strict heterogeneous Stacking to a number of baseline methods and to strict heterogeneous Stacking, which uses the same number of models as there are base learning algorithms, built using un-sampled data. We demonstrate that non-strict Stacking for the set of base learning algorithms evaluated, strongly outperformed the baseline methods. In addition the added flexibility of non-strict Stacking, allowed it both to outperform strict Stacking and homogeneous Stacking for the same set of base learning algorithms considered. We discuss the conditions in general where non-strict heterogeneous Stacking is likely to be advantageous. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
