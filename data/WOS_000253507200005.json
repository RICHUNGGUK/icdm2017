It is based on a finite volume method over triangular unstructured grids. A first-order upwind technique, a second order in space and time and an extended first-order method are applied to solve the non-diffusive terms in both the flow and solute equations and a centred implicit discretization is applied to the diffusion terms. The stability constraints are studied and the form to avoid oscillatory results in the solute concentration in the presence of complex flow situations is detailed. Some comparisons are carried out in order to show the performance in terms of accuracy of the different options.
