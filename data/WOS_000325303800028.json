The method is inspired by the well known and highly effective Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) technique. The proposed method is called the CGP-based Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN). The basic idea is to replace each computational node in CGP with an artificial neuron, thus producing an artificial neural network. The capabilities of CGPANN are tested in two diverse problem domains. Firstly, it has been tested on a standard benchmark control problem: single and double pole for both Markovian and non-Markovian cases. Results demonstrate that the method can generate effective neural architectures in substantially fewer evaluations in comparison to previously published neuroevolutionary techniques. In addition, the evolved networks show improved generalization and robustness in comparison with other techniques. Secondly, we have explored the capabilities of CGPANNs for the diagnosis of Breast Cancer from the FNA (Finite Needle Aspiration) data samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm gives 99.5% accurate results, thus making it an excellent choice for pattern recognitions in medical diagnosis, owing to its properties of fast learning and accuracy. The power of a CGP based ANN is its representation which leads to an efficient evolutionary search of suitable topologies. This opens new avenues for applying the proposed technique to other linear/nonlinear and Markovian/non-Markovian control and pattern recognition problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
