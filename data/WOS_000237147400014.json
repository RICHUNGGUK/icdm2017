A new class of ternary monomial regular bent function with the Dillon exponent is discovered. The existence of Dillon bent functions in the general case is an open problem of deciding whether a certain Kloosterman sum can take on the value -1. Also described is the general Gold-like form of a bent function that covers all the previously known monomial quadratic cases. The (weak) regularity of the new as well as of known monomial bent functions is discussed and the first example of a not weakly regular bent function is given. Finally, some criteria for an arbitrary quadratic function to be bent are proven.", "paper_title": "Monomial and quadratic bent functions over the finite fields of odd characteristic", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400014"}
