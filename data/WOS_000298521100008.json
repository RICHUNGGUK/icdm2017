This work was driven by the need to significantly reduce computing resources for vehicle analysis. To achieve this goal the adhesive bond line and adherends are modelled by a relatively 'small' number of shell elements to replace the usual solid element mesh for a reliable analysis. Previous work in Part 1 has provided the necessary background information to develop and verify the new finite element analysis that reduces the solution runtime by a factor of 1000. Although a joint's non-linear stiffness is reliably simulated to failure load, it is recognised by the authors that the coarse shell mesh cannot provide accurate peak stresses or peak strains for the successful application of a numerical failure criterion. Given that the new modelling methodology is very quick to apply to existing shell models of vehicle bodies, it is recommended for use by the stress analyst who requires, say at the preliminary design stage, whole vehicle stiffness performance in a significantly reduced timeframe.
