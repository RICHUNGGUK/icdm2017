These rational splines can exactly reproduce parts of multiple basic shapes, such as cyclides and quadrics, in one by default smoothly-connected structure. The versatility of this new tool for processing exact geometry is illustrated by conceptual design from basic shapes.", "paper_title": "Rational bi-cubic G(2) splines for design with basic shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100003"}
