The structure and the distance between the vertices in Yule recursive trees are investigated in this paper. For arbitrary time t > 0, we first give the probability that a Yule recursive tree Y-t is isomorphic to a given rooted tree gamma; and then prove that the asymptotic distribution of zeta(t,m), the number of the branches of size m, is the Poisson distribution with parameter lambda = 1/m. Finally, two types of distance between vertices in Yule recursive trees are studied, and some limit theorems for them are established.
