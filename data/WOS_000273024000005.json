Active XML is based on XML documents with embedded function calls. The state of a document evolves depending on the result of internal function calls (local computations) or external ones (interactions with users or other services). Function calls return documents that may be active, and so may activate new subtasks. The focus of this article is on the verification of temporal properties of runs of Active XML systems, specified in a tree-pattern-based temporal logic, Tree-LTL, which allows expressing a rich class of semantic properties of the application. The main results establish the boundary of decidability and the complexity of automatic verification of Tree-LTL properties.", "paper_title": "Static Analysis of Active XML Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273024000005"}
