However, performance rankings are usually based on a single criterion, so the performance measure varies according to the criterion used. This paper proposes a multicriterion methodology based on goal programming that simultaneously considers different categories involved in the performance of Microfinance Institutions. The paper is illustrated by a sample of Latin American MFIs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
