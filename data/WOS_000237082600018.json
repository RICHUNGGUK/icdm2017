Our main contribution is a novel algorithm which improves significantly the Computational complexity of reachability analysis. Algorithms to compute over and under-approximations of the reachable sets are proposed as well. These algorithms are riot subject to the wrapping effect and therefore our approximations are tight. We show that these approximations are useful in the context of hybrid systems verification and control synthesis. The performance of a prototype implementation of the algorithm confirms its qualities and gives hope for scaling up verification technology for continuous and hybrid systems.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of reachable sets of linear time-invariant systems with inputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082600018"}
