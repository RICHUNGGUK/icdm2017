Despite its simplicity, the Perona-Malik Anisotropic Diffusion method is among the most employed ones. In this work we study this method in detail and propose a generalization of its diffusion scheme using restricted dissimilarity functions to measure the intensity differences between neighbouring pixels. This generalization permits a better adaptation of the diffusion process to the characteristics of the images.", "paper_title": "A generalization of the Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion method using restricted dissimilarity functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000313101300002"}
