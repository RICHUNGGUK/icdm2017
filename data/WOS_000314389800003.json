Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCPs) is a systematic approach to food product safety as a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection. It has been internationally recognized and accepted as the system for effective food safety management. In this study, a system called Supply-chain Pedigree Interactive Dynamic Explore (SPIDER) is proposed as a platform for the public and governments to explore the information in each part of the food chain and provide easy implementation of HACCP into the food industry. SPIDER is a secure and global platform to verify, inspect and investigate food effectively and efficiently. In this system, some artificial intelligent techniques, Case-based Reasoning, Rule-based Reasoning, Fuzzy logical and Neural Network are used for automatic updating, to analyze data and to manage data. Finally, a simulated case is also studied to show the operation and the results of the system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
