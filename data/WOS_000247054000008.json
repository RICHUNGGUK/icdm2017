This infrastructure may later be deployed for research communities in other neuromedical disorders. SWAN incorporates the full biomedical research knowledge lifecycle in its ontological model, including support for personal data organization, hypothesis generation, experimentation, lab data organization, and digital pre- publication collaboration. Community, laboratory, and personal digital resources may all be organized and interconnected using SWAN's common semantic framework. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
