We construct a set of composable reduced models, or tiles, which capture spatially localized fluid behavior. We then precompute coupling terms so that these models can be rearranged at runtime. To enforce consistency between tiles, we introduce constraint reduction. This technique modifies a reduced model so that a given set of linear constraints can be fulfilled. Because dynamics and constraints can be solved entirely in the reduced space, our method is extremely fast and scales to large domains.", "paper_title": "Modular Bases for Fluid Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000269278000019"}
