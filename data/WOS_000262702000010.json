The approach utilizes the concept of instantaneous Doppler wavenumber and introduces two variants, the sum-range and subtraction-range, to develop the 2D frequency analytical formula. Based on the assumption of plane wavefront, the transmitting and receiving Doppler are separated and formulated via series reversion. And frequency scaling is applied to focus image. The algorithm is with high computational efficiency, and provides well focus for limited scene imaging. Simulation result confirms the validity of the approach.", "paper_title": "Unparallel trajectory bistatic spotlight SAR imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702000010"}
