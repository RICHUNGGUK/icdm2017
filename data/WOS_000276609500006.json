Experimental data show adequate maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) value for the flame arrester. The flow rate characteristics of the flame arrester were measured and compared with theoretical results. It was made clear that the flow impedance of convergent flow is 20% less than that of divergent flow. The experimental data and theoretical data show good agreement. The performance test by an EN12874 as 'in-line stable detonation' flame arrester was examined for a hydrogen-air gas mixture. The experimental data show that the gap was 0.2 times the MESG value in bi-directions for the flame arrester. The quenching and extinguishing processes were visualized by high-speed cameras.", "paper_title": "Visualization of behaviors of a propagating flame quenching for hydrogen-air gas mixture", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500006"}
