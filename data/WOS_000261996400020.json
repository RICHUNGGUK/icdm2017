TriTISA classifies all candidate TISs into three categories based on evolutionary properties, and characterizes them in terms of Markov models. Then, it employs a Bayesian methodology for the selection of true TIS with a non-supervised, iterative procedure. Assessment on experimentally verified TIS data shows that TriTISA is overall better than all other methods of the state-of-the-art for microbial genome TIS prediction. In particular, TriTISA is shown to have a robust accuracy independent of the quality of initial annotation.", "paper_title": "Prediction of translation initiation site for microbial genomes with TriTISA", "paper_id": "WOS:000261996400020"}
