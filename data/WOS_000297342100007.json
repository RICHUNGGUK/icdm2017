By taking advantage of the average dwell time method, two sufficient conditions are developed to ensure the global exponential stability of the considered neural networks, which are delay-dependent and formulated by LMIs. The state decay estimate is explicitly given. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Stability Analysis for Switched Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000297342100007"}
