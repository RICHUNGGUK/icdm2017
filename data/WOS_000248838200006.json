For getting the bigger target market share and the advantage of leading the product price, the plastic injection product manufacture shall control the cost of the product being developed at the development stage to find out how much percentage of the profit can participate in the price competition. Therefore, this study emphasizes to propose a cost estimation model which is based on BPN (back-propagation network) with feature-based models to dramatically simplify the complex conventional cost estimation procedures and computation parameters requested. Finally, the application of this model is illustrated through a case study of a notebook computer product for cost estimation and the results show that its efficiency and effectiveness in solving the cost estimation problem of plastic injection products at the development stage.
