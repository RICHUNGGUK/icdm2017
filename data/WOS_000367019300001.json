By intelligently choosing the weights, the model allows us to improve on the current state of the art higher-order method, total generalized variation, with respect to overall quality and preservation of jumps in the data. In the spirit of recent work by Brezis et al., our formulation also has analytic implications: for a suitable choice of weights it can be shown to converge to classical second-order regularizers, and in fact it allows a novel characterization of higher-order Sobolev and BV spaces.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Application of a Nonlocal Hessian", "paper_id": "WOS:000367019300001"}
