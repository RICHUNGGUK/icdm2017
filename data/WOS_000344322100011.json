To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is little works focusing on attribute-based signcryption (ABSC), especially in the setting of lattice-based cryptography. In this paper, we show that it is possible to construct hidden ABSC schemes based on lattice problems by presenting an ABSC scheme. In the random oracle model, the proposed scheme is proved to be indistinguishable against adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks under the learning with errors assumption and existentially unforgeable against adaptively chosen message attacks under the short integer solution assumption, respectively.
