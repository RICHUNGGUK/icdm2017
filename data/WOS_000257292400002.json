In this paper we postulate that the design and formal specification of algorithms can be translated into a fuzzy framework introducing fuzzy first order logic and assert transformations. Following the classical crisp scheme we first formalize the concepts of a fuzzy algorithm specification and a fuzzy computing state, and then a new fuzzy computational logic is presented, so we can derive a computational reasoning for correctness of algorithms. A proposal for the evaluation and setting of suitable degrees of truth to computing states is also introduced.", "paper_title": "Specification and computing states in fuzzy algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000257292400002"}
