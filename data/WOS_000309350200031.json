This requires a generalized form of communication coalescing where data can be transferred from the external memory even when this memory is not fully up-to-date. Experiments with Altera HLS tools demonstrate that this automatization, based on advanced polyhedral code analysis and code generation techniques, can be used to efficiently map C kernels to FPGA, by generating, entirely at C level, all the necessary glue (the communication processes), which is compiled with the same HLS tool as for the computation kernel.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Remote Accesses for Offloaded Kernels: Application to High-Level Synthesis for FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000309350200031"}
