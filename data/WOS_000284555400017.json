Edge versions of Wiener index was recently introduced by Iranmanesh et al. In this paper, we put forward the generalized Schultz index and also introduce the edge versions of Schultz index. In addition, we establish a relation between first-order edge-Schultz indices and edge versions of Wiener indices of trees. We obtain lower and upper bounds for the first-order edge-Schultz indices in terms of edge-Wiener indices for hexagonal chains.", "paper_title": "Generalized Schultz Index and Its Edge Versions", "paper_id": "WOS:000284555400017"}
