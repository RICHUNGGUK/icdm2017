When such applications are implemented on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, the social graph is distributed on the P2P system: the traversal of the social graph translates into a socially-informed routing in the peer-to-peer layer. In this work we introduce the model of a projection graph that is the result of decentralizing a social graph onto a peer-to-peer network. We focus on three social network metrics: degree, node betweenness and edge betweenness centrality and analytically formulate the relation between metrics in the social graph and in the projection graph. We demonstrate with an application scenario on real social networks the usability of the projection graph properties in designing social search applications and unstructured P2P overlays that exhibit improved performance and reduced overhead over baseline scenarios.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Peer Centrality in the Design of Socially-Informed Peer-to-Peer Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000015"}
