The conventional gradient-based distributed adaptive estimation algorithms exhibit good performance in the presence of Gaussian noise but perform poorly in impulsive noise environments. Therefore, the objective of this article is to propose a robust distributed adaptive algorithm that alleviates the effect of impulsive noise. An error saturation nonlinearity-based robust distributed strategy is proposed in an incremental cooperative network to estimate the desired parameters in impulsive noise. The steady-state analysis of the proposed error saturation nonlinearity incremental leastmean squares (SNILMS) algorithm is carried out by employing the spatial-temporal energy conservation principle. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the presence of the error nonlinearity has made the proposed SNILMS algorithm robust to impulsive noise.", "paper_title": "Error Saturation Nonlinearities for Robust Incremental LMS over Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351443600006"}
