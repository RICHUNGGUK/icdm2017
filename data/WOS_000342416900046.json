Two results are presented. First, motivated by social network applications, the asymptotic behavior of the degree distribution is analyzed. Second, a stochastic approximation algorithm is presented to track empirical degree distribution as it evolves over time. The tracking performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of mean square error and a functional central limit theorem is presented for the asymptotic tracking error. Also, a Hilbert-space-valued stochastic approximation algorithm that tracks a Markov-modulated probability mass function with support on the set of nonnegative integers is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Tracking a Markov-Modulated Stationary Degree Distribution of a Dynamic Random Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900046"}
