The method is based on a new class of surface energies known as higher-order energies as opposed to the conventional energies for problem regularization, which are linear. In employing a quadratic energy functional in the objective of the topology optimization, non-trivial interactions between different points on the structural boundary are introduced, thus favoring a family of shapes with strip-like (or beam) features. In addition, the quadratic energy functional can be seamlessly integrated into the level set framework that represents the geometry of the structure implicitly. The shape gradient of the quadratic energy functional is fully derived in the paper, and it is incorporated in the level set approach for topology optimization. The approach is demonstrated with benchmark examples of structure optimization and compliant mechanism design. The results presented show that this method is capable of generating strip-like (or beam) designs with specified feature width, which have highly desirable characteristics and practical benefits and uniquely distinguish the proposed method.
