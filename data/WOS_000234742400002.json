The proposed algorithm introduces a modification to the Modular Range Reduction algorithm which increases the speed of computation and allows us to design an architecture for the floating-point case. The implementation presented admits as an input argument any representable number of the standard single precision IEEE 754 floating-point representation and provides the maximum accuracy to the final result. This supposes a hardware solution to the problem of having an input argument close to a multiple of the constant. A final comparison with other implementations is presented.", "paper_title": "Double-residue modular range reduction for floating-point hardware implementations", "paper_id": "WOS:000234742400002"}
