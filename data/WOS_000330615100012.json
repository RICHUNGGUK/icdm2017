In this paper, we present a new similarity measure for web service similarity computation and propose a novel collaborative filtering approach, called normal recovery collaborative filtering, for personalized web service recommendation. To evaluate the web service recommendation performance of our approach, we conduct large-scale real-world experiments, involving 5,825 real-world web services in 73 countries and 339 service users in 30 countries. To the best of our knowledge, our experiment is the largest scale experiment in the field of service computing, improving over the previous record by a factor of 100. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better accuracy than other competing approaches.", "paper_title": "Personalized Web Service Recommendation via Normal Recovery Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615100012"}
