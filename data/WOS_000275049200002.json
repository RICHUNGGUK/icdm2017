To achieve this aim, UEML offers a hub through which modelling languages can be connected, thereby paving the way for also connecting the models expressed in those languages. This paper motivates and presents the most central parts of the UEML approach: a structured path to describing enterprise and IS modelling constructs; a common ontology to interrelate construct descriptions at the semantic level; a correspondence analysis approach to estimate semantic construct similarity: a quality framework to aid selection of languages; a meta-meta model to integrate the different parts of the approach; and a set of tools to aid its use and evolution. The paper also discusses the benefits of UEML and points to paths for further work. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
