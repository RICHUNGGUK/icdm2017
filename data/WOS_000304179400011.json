For systems like Petri nets, the classical Karp-Miller coverability tree construction is the basis for algorithms to decide questions related to the capacity of local states. We consider a modification of this construction which would allow one to deal with dynamic behaviour consisting of concurrent steps rather than single occurrences of transitions. This leads to an action-based extension of the notion of coverability, viewing bandwidth as a resource. However, when certain constraints are imposed on the steps, systems may exhibit non-monotonic behaviour. In those cases, new criteria for the termination of the step coverability tree construction are needed. We investigate a general class of Petri nets modelling systems that consist of components communicating through shared buffers and that operate under a maximally concurrent step semantics. Based on the description of their behaviour, we derive a correctly terminating step coverability tree construction for these Petri nets. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
