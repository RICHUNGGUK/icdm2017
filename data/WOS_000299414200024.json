The tool represents the main aspects of translation. Features include a representation of exhaustible tRNA pools, ribosome-ribosome interactions and differential initiation rates for different mRNA species. The tool is written in Java, and is hence portable and can be parameterized for any organism.", "paper_title": "A novel and versatile computational tool to model translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299414200024"}
