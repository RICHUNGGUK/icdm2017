In RFID systems, a reader collision occurs when there is interference in communication between one reader and the tags, due to the signals from other readers. The reader collision problem is considered as the fundamental problem affecting high density RFID reader installations. In this paper, we analyze the existing reader anti-collision algorithms. We also propose a pulse protocol-based reader anti-collision algorithm using slot occupied probability (SOP). The implementation of this improvement is simple, yet it effectively mitigates most reader collisions in dense reader mode, as shown in our simulation. That is, the proposed algorithm reduces the identification time, and increases the system throughput and system efficiency compared with the conventional reader anti-collision algorithms.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Pulse Protocol RFID Reader Anti-collision Algorithm using Slot Occupied Probability in Dense Reader Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933500002"}
