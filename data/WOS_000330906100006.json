For efficient implementation of hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems, it is crucial to have efficient scalar multiplication in the Jacobian groups. For the hyperelliptic curve C-q : v(2) = u(p) - au - b over the field F-q with q a power of an odd prime p, Duursma and Sakurai (2000) presented a scalar multiplication algorithm for q = p, a = 1 and b is an element of F-p. In this paper, by introducing the concept of simple divisors, we prove that a general divisor can be decomposed into the sum of some simple divisors. Based on this fact, we present a formula for p-scalar multiplications for any reduced divisor, then we give two efficient algorithms to speed up scalar multiplications for any parameters a and b over any extension of F-p. Compared with the signed binary method, the computations of our algorithms cost 55% to 76% less.", "paper_title": "Fast Scalar Multiplications on the Curve v(2) = u(p) - au - b over the Finite Field of Characteristic p", "paper_id": "WOS:000330906100006"}
