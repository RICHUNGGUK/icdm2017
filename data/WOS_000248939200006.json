We name it as GENXICC and we test it by comparing its numerical results with those in references. It is written in a PYTHIA-compatible format and it can be easily implemented into PYTHIA. GENXICC is also written in modularization manner, with make, a GNU C compiler, one may apply the generator to various situations or experimental environments very conveniently.", "paper_title": "GENXICC: A generator for hadronic production of the double heavy baryons Xi(cc), Xi(bc), and Xi(bb)", "paper_id": "WOS:000248939200006"}
