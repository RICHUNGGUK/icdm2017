In this hybrid-scheduling paradigm, regions of the application containing large amounts of parallelism visible at compile-time bypass the dynamic scheduling hardware and execute in a low-power static mode. Experiments on several media and scientific benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide significant reduction in energy consumption with negligible performance degradation.", "paper_title": "Hybrid-scheduling for reduced energy consumption in high-performance processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200011"}
