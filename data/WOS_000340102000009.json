Statist Methodol. 2009; 6: 344-362] introduced the generalized gamma-generated distribution with an extra positive parameter. A new three-parameter continuous model called the gamma-linear failure rate (LFR) distribution, which extends the LFR model, is proposed and studied. Various structural properties of the new distribution are derived, including some explicit expressions for ordinary and incomplete moments, generating function, probability-weighted moments, mean deviations and Renyi and Shannon entropies. We estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood and obtain the observed information matrix. The new model is modified to cope with possible long-term survivors in lifetime data. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model by means of two applications to real data.", "paper_title": "The gamma-linear failure rate distribution: theory and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000009"}
