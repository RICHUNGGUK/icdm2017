We strategically project structured light and exploit distortion of the light pattern in the structured light image along depth discontinuities to reliably detect depth edges. In practice, distortion along depth discontinuities may not occur or be large enough to detect depending oil the distance from the camera or projector. We present methods that guarantee the occurrence of the distortion along depth discontinuities for a continuous range of object location. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately detects depth edges of shapes of human hands and bodies as well as general objects. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
