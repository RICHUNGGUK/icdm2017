A three-way decision is made based on a pair of thresholds on conditional probabilities. A positive rule makes a decision of executing, a negative rule makes a decision of non-executing, and a boundary rule makes a decision of deferment. The loss functions are used to calculate the required two thresholds to describe the decision risk with the Bayesian decision procedure. A case study of government petroleum risk investment demonstrates the proposed method.", "paper_title": "THREE-WAY GOVERNMENT DECISION ANALYSIS WITH DECISION-THEORETIC ROUGH SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306184900011"}
