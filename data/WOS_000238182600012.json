To provide integrated service over wireless networks has become a very important issue in the design of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol with scheduling algorithms to provide integrated service for CDMA based wireless networks. This protocol evolves from the distributed queuing random access protocol for CDMA wireless network (DQRAP/CDMA). The proposed protocol has been designed to have an ability to accommodate integrated traffic in the network with effective scheduling schemes. A series of simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol and scheduling algorithms. The results reveal that the proposed protocol with the scheduling performs effectively to the integrated traffic composed of messages with or without time constraints and achieves fairness among different types of traffic.
