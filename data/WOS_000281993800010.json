Design/methodology/approach - The potential to speed up the computer numerical solution of the combined BV-IVPs is addressed using parallel computers. Since the computational bottleneck is associated with the matrix solver, the parallelisation of a direct and an iterative solver has been studied. The creep deformation and rupture of a tension bar has been computed for a range of the number of degrees of freedom (ndf), and the performance of the two solvers is compared and assessed. Findings - The results show the superior scalability of the iterative solver compared to the direct solver, with larger speed-ups gained by the PCG solver for higher degrees of freedom. Also, a new algorithm for the first trial solution of the PCG solver provides additional speed-ups. Research limitations/implications - The results show that the ideal parallel speed-up of the iterative solver of 16, relative to two processors, is achieved when using 32 processors for a mesh of ndf = 153,238. Originality/value - Techniques have been established in this paper for the parallelisation of CDM creep analysis software using an iterative equation solver. The significant computational speed-ups achieved will enable the analysis of failures in weldments of industrial significance.", "paper_title": "Reduced numerical solution times for combined boundary-initial value problems using parallel computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000281993800010"}
