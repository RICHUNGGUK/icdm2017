Common sharing distributed arithmetic (CSDA) combines factor sharing and distributed arithmetic sharing techniques, efficiently reducing the number of adders for high hardware-sharing capability. This achieves a 44.5% reduction in adders in the proposed MST, compared with the direct implementation method. With eight parallel computation paths, the proposed MST core has an eightfold operation frequency throughput rate. Measurements show that the proposed CSDA-MST core achieves a high-throughput rate of 1.28 G-pels/s, supporting the (4928x2048@24 Hz) digital cinema or ultrahigh resolution format. This is possible only with 30k gate counts when implemented in a TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The CSDA-MST core thus achieves a high-throughput rate supporting multistandard transformations at low cost.", "paper_title": "High-Throughput Multistandard Transform Core Supporting MPEG/H.264/VC-1 Using Common Sharing Distributed Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124200002"}
