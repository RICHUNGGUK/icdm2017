BESS is incorporated with wind generation to reduce fluctuation of wind energy output. To verify the suitable storage size for the Australian power grid, a sensitivity analysis is performed with different levels of BESS. Carbon tax is also considered to reduce carbon emissions in the proposed ED scheme. A hybrid computational framework based on quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed to achieve faster and better optimization performance, and its viability demonstrated on a simplified 14-generator model of the Australian power system using a set of case studies. The proposed dispatch model can minimize the generating cost and enhance renewable power consumption capacity.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Dispatch of BESS and Wind Power Generation Considering Carbon Emission Limitation in Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100007"}
