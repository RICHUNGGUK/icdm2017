The statistical power of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling statistics was investigated by varying the null and the alternative distributions, the sample size, the degree of censoring and the significance level. The exponential, Weibull, log-logistic and log-normal lifetime distributions were considered as they are among the most frequently distributions used when modelling censored data. We conclude by giving some general recommendations for testing the distributional assumption of parametric survival models in homogeneous populations when using EDF-based GoF statistics.", "paper_title": "Statistical power of goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical distribution function for type-I right-censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056700004"}
