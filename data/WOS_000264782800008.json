Recently, a growing number of organizations have implemented TQM in order to give them a competitive advantage [Chan, T. H., & Quazi, H. A. (2002). Overview of quality management practices in selected Asian countries. Quality Management Journal, 9(1), 172-180; Nilsson, L., Johnson, M. D., & Gustafsson, A. (2001). The impact of quality practices on customer satisfaction and business results: Product versus service organizations. Journal of Quality Management, 6, 5-27]. Meanwhile, quality related awards are also appearing for examining and identifying whether or not the overall quality of a firm is high. Each award, however, focuses only on examining certain items. It is impossible for a firm to make each examined item perfect. In addition to this, since the overall quality of the technology and products of some Taiwanese biotechnology corporations has been decreasing, the prestige of the Taiwanese biotechnology industry as a whole has decreased in the global market. Thus, in order to solve the above difficulties, this study attempts to find the most suitable measurement model for the biotechnology industry to enact quality improvement. The study first reviews a substantial body of literature on total quality management and categorizes measurement criteria. The study then proceeds with in-depth interviews with relevant background experts in order to extract and verify the most suitable measurement criteria. In addition to this, a FANP is utilized in order to analyze the weights of different measurement dimensions and criteria. The value of this study is its construction of a TQM measurement model for the Taiwanese biotechnology industry that can be used to improve its quality as well as to regain a higher market share of the global market.
