By using this method, the advantages of the original ALE method are used, while the disadvantages are reduced or eliminated. A mesh topology changing algorithm is used to create a computational domain boundary, while still having a smoothly deforming mesh in the remaining part of the mesh. It is shown that at higher Reynolds numbers the newly developed method performs better in terms of spurious oscillations than an immersed boundary method (IBM). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
