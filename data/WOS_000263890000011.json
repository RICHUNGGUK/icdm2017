We deduce a global error estimate which implies that any time-splitting method retains its classical convergence order for linear Schrodinger equations, provided that the exact solution of the considered problem fulfills suitable regularity requirements. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical result.", "paper_title": "On the convergence of splitting methods for linear evolutionary Schrodinger equations involving an unbounded potential", "paper_id": "WOS:000263890000011"}
