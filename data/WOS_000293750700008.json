A novel sliding-mode control (SMC) design approach is developed which is based on individual sliding surface in each local region of the T-S fuzzy systems. Conditions of existence of sliding mode in the associated region are given. The chattering effect around region boundaries is analyzed, and prevention of such chattering is discussed. Two illustrative examples are finally given to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Piecewise Sliding-Mode Control for T-S Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293750700008"}
