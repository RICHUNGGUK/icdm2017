This extra information could be a covariate and this covariate could be a time series. Time dependent covariates are sometimes called markers, and failure rates are sometimes called hazards, intensities or mortalities. It is shown through simulations and a practical example that the fully local linear estimation procedure exhibits an excellent practical performance. Two different bandwidth selection procedures are developed. One is an adaptation of classical cross-validation, and the other one is indirect cross-validation. The simulation study concludes that classical cross-validation works well on continuous data while indirect cross-validation performs only marginally better. However, cross-validation breaks down in the practical data application to old-age mortality. Indirect cross-validation is thus shown to be superior when selecting a fully feasible estimation method for marker dependent hazard estimation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
