The main idea is that locating dense and sparse regions can be exploited to partition the data into homogeneous buckets, preventing dense and sparse regions from being summarized into the same aggregate data. The use of clustering techniques to support the histogram construction is investigated in the context of either static and dynamic data, where the use of incremental clustering strategies is mandatory due to the inefficiency of performing the clusterization task from scratch at each data update.", "paper_title": "Exploiting cluster analysis for constructing multi-dimensional histograms on both static and evolving data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600028"}
