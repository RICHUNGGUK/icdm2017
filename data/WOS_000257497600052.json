BELBIC is a controller based on emotional model of human brain which has been introduced not for so long. This controller has been applied to a nonlinear model of a helicopter. Feedback linearization method has also been applied to the system, and the performance of two controllers has been compared as an intelligent and a classical control method. An Input to State linearization method with some changes has been used to control the system. The performance of the controllers has been justified by the simulation.", "paper_title": "Intelligent autopilot control design for a 2-DOF helicopter model", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600052"}
