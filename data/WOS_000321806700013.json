However, in most of the previously proposed approaches, human experts do not play an active role in the learning process. Once their knowledge is elicited, they do not participate any more. The interactive approach for integrating domain/expert knowledge we propose in this work aims to be more efficient and effective. In contrast to previous approaches, our method performs an active interaction with the expert in order to guide the search based learning process. This method relies on identifying the edges of the graph structure which are more unreliable considering the information present in the learning data. Another contribution of our approach is the integration of domain/expert knowledge at different stages of the learning process of a Bayesian network: while learning the skeleton and when directing the edges of the directed acyclic graph structure.
