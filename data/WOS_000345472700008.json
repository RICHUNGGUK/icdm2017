In particular, we prove the cut-elimination theorem for a calculus involving series-parallel structures over partial orders which is built up from multi-level sequents, an interesting variant of Gentzen-style sequents. More broadly, our purpose is to provide a general, syntactical tool for grasping the combinatorics of non-monotonic processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
