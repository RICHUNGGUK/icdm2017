E-health technologies provide efficient and effective ways to share medical information, but they also raise issues over which medical professionals and consumers have no control. Information security and patient privacy are key impediments that hinder sharing data as sensitive as health information. Additionally, health information interoperability hinders the adoption of available e-health technologies. Here, the authors propose an information accountability solution combining the HL7 interoperability standard and social networks for manipulating personal health records.", "paper_title": "Sharing with Care An Information Accountability Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000292276400006"}
