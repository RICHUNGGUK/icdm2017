The Microsoft (MS) Windows operating systems today support a huge number of software applications. If these commercial applications could be transformed to software components, this may accelerate the construction of new components. This paper proposes an architectural style to support a three-phase process for integrating MS-Windows applications in a distributed system using Java technologies. This style provides a solution with clear documentation and sufficient information that is helpful for the rapid integration of MS-Windows applications. Finally, an exemplary graphical construction part management system that assembles two MS-Windows applications was developed in this study to demonstrate the feasibility of this style.
