The underlying idea behind the solutions proposed is to combine the opinions of several \"experts\" in one of these areas (i.e., anti-spam filters, anti-virus programs, respectively) to a final group decision. Despite the fact that the problems, and thus the applications designed to tackle them, are different, our approach in these solutions is unified, and is based on the same mathematical model, the so-called dichotomous choice model.", "paper_title": "A Decision-Making Approach to the Spam Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000298896400001"}
