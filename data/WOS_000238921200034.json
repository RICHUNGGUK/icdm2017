We first prove that the SU(3) codes are fully diverse if and only if the design parameters P, Q, R, and S are all odd integers, and in addition, are relatively prime. For the type I AB codes, it is shown that full diversity can be achieved if and only if the integers P, Q, R, and S are relatively prime. Finally, we show that such condition is also sufficient for having fully diverse type Pi AB codes.", "paper_title": "On the conjectures of SU(3) and AB unitary space-time codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200034"}
