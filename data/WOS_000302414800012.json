Different studies have proposed methods for mining association rules from databases with crisp values. However, the data in many real-world applications have a certain degree of imprecision. In this paper we address this problem, and propose a new data-mining algorithm for extracting interesting knowledge from databases with imprecise data. The proposed algorithm integrates imprecise data concepts and the fuzzy apriori mining algorithm to find interesting fuzzy association rules in given databases. Experiments for diagnosing dyslexia in early childhood were made to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Mining fuzzy association rules from low-quality data", "paper_id": "WOS:000302414800012"}
