The idea is that each node builds its local minimum spanning tree (MST) based on the energy-aware weighted graph and the network topology is adjusted accordingly. It was proved theoretically that the topology under WDTC algorithm could preserve the network connectivity and a sufficient condition for the degree of no more than 6 was also given. Simulation shows that WDTC algorithm can effectively prolong the network lifetime and has good topological features. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
