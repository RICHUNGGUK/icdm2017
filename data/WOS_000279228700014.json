It starts by introducing different basic control schemes, which employ online trajectory generation. Next, it presents and analyzes the results obtained through two recently developed direct transcription (collocation) methods: the Gauss pseudospec-tral method and the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudosp ectral method. The achieved results are further compared with those found through the Pontryagin's Maximum (Minimum) Principle, and the paper continues by providing another set of direct method simulations incorporating more realistic boundary conditions. Finally, the results obtained using the third direct method, based on inverse dynamics in the virtual domain, are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Computing short-time aircraft maneuvers using direct methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000279228700014"}
