The exact topology of the interconnecting network is obtained by solving a dimensioning problem, and the outcome of this strongly depends on both the expected workload characteristics and Grid scheduling policy. Solving this combined scheduling and dimensioning problem using straightforward ILP modelling is cumbersome; however, for steady-state Grid operation, Divisible Load Theory (DLT) can yield scalable formulations of this problem. In this paper, the on-line hierarchical scheduling on a lambda Grid of workload approaching the Grid's capacity in a two-tier Grid mode of operation is studied. A number of these algorithms are goal-driven, in the sense that target per-resource goals are obtained from the off-line solution to the Divisible Load model. We compare these on-line multiresource scheduling policies for different workloads, Grid interconnection topologies and Grid parameters. We show that these algorithms perform well in the studied scenarios when compared to a fully centralized scheduling algorithm.", "paper_title": "Dimensioning and on-line scheduling in Lambda Grids using divisible load concepts", "paper_id": "WOS:000248906800005"}
