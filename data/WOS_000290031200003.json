The label of an edge uv represents a direction or length constraint between p(u) and p(v). Let G (+) be obtained from G by adding, for each length edge e of G, a direction edge with the same end vertices as e. We show that (G,p) is bounded if and only if (G (+),p) is infinitesimally rigid. This gives a characterization of when (G,p) is bounded in terms of the rank of the rigidity matrix of (G (+),p). We use this to characterize when a mixed graph is generically bounded in a\"e (d) . As an application we deduce that if (G,p) is a globally rigid generic framework with at least two length edges and e is a length edge of G then (Ga-e,p) is bounded.", "paper_title": "Bounded Direction-Length Frameworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290031200003"}
