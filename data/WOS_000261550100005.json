Recently researchers have turned to the more challenging field of emotional body language, i.e. emotion expression through body pose and motion. In this work, we approach recognition of basic emotional categories from a Computational perspective. In keeping with recent Computational models of the visual cortex, we construct a biologically plausible hierarchy of neural detectors, which call discriminate seven basic emotional states from static views of associated body poses. The model is evaluated against human test subjects on a recent set of stimuli manufactured for research on emotional body language. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
