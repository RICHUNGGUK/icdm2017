Clustering has a great impact on the wirelength, timing, and routability of a circuit. Logic duplication is an effective method for improving performance while maintaining the logic equivalence of a circuit. Based on several novel algorithmic contributions, we present an efficient and effective algorithm named SPCD ( simultaneous placement with clustering and duplication) which performs clustering and duplication during placement for wirelength and timing minimization. First, we incorporate a path counting-based net weighting scheme for more effective timing optimization. Secondly, we introduce a novel method of moving a fragment of a cluster ( called a fragment level move) during placement to optimize the clustering structure. To reduce the critical path detour during legalization from a more global perspective, we also introduce the notions of a monotone region and a global monotone region in which improvement to the local/global path detour is guaranteed. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of a constrained gain graph to embed all complex FPGA clustering constraints, and implement an optimal incremental legalization algorithm under such constraints. Finally, in order to reduce the circuit area, we formulate a timing-constrained global redundancy removal problem and propose a heuristic solution. Our SPCD algorithm outperforms a widely used academic FPGA placement flow, T-VPack + VPR, with an average reduction of 31% in the longest path estimate delay and 18% in the routed delay. We also apply our SPCD algorithm to Altera's Stratix architecture in a commercial FPGA implementation flow (Quartus II 4.0). The routed result achieved by our SPCD algorithm outperforms VPR by 20% and outperforms Quartus II 4.0 by 4%.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous placement with clustering and duplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000239055300009"}
