In the proposed method, using a reference point, the domain of fuzzy numbers is divided into two different sets, as small value and large value sets. The location of reference point is determined based on DM's viewpoint. Considering these sets, the desirability index of each fuzzy number is determined. Then the fuzzy numbers are ranked based on their relative desirability indices. To represent completely the DM's viewpoint, the method is also developed by using fuzzy reference set. The experiments conducted show the efficiency and simplicity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy ranking method by desirability index", "paper_id": "WOS:000238595800003"}
