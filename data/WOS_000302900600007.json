Our aim is to propose a mathematical model, which extends the Bayesian problem of pattern recognition by incorporating external context variables. They are implanted as functions, which influence parameters of class distributions. We prove that context variables influence a shape or a position of the optimal class separating surface, without enlarging the dimensionality of a pattern space. Thus, one can treat the proposed extended Bayesian model as a fusion of patterns and external context variables, embedded into the same pattern space. Then, learning algorithms for neural network classifiers are proposed, which take context variables into account.", "paper_title": "Classifiers sensitive to external context - theory and applications to video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000302900600007"}
