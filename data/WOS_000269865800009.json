It is easily seen that the downwards-closed subsets of a partial order form a completely distributive algebraic lattice when ordered by inclusion. The converse also holds; any completely distributive algebraic lattice is isomorphic to such a set of downwards-closed subsets of a partial order. The partial order can be recovered from the lattice as the order of the lattice restricted to its complete primes. Consequently prime algebraic lattices are precisely the completely distributive algebraic lattices. The result extends to Scott domains. Several consequences are explored briefly: the representation of Berry's dl-domains by event structures; a simplified form of information systems for completely distributive Scott domains; and a simple domain theory for concurrency.
