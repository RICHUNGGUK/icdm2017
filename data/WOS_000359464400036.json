In this letter, a multiple relay selection strategy is proposed for the reliability of transmission. The proposed strategy establishes a relaying route to a destination and provides an efficient relay selection process regardless of all channel conditions.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Strategy for Relay Selection in Wireless Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400036"}
