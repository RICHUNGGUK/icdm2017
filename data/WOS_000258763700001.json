This article proposes a new model to describe the nonlinear degradation paths caused by nano-contamination in plasma display panels (PDP): a bi-exponential model with random coefficients. A likelihood ratio test was sequentially executed to select random effects in the nonlinear model. Analysis results indicate that the reliability estimation can be improved substantially by using the nonlinear random-coefficients model to incorporate both inherent degradation characteristics, and contamination effects of impurities for PDP degradation paths.", "paper_title": "Degradation analysis of nano-contamination in plasma display panels", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763700001"}
