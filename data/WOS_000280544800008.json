The algorithm is based on \"stitching\" together local structures by solving an optimization problem requiring the structures to fit together in an \"As-Rigid-As-Possible\" manner, hence the name ARAP. The local structures consist of reference \"patches\" and reference triangles, both obtained from inter-sensor distances. We elaborate on the relationship between the ARAP algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms, and provide experimental results demonstrating that ARAP is significantly less sensitive to sparse connectivity and measurement noise. We also show how ARAP may be distributed.", "paper_title": "An As-Rigid-As-Possible Approach to Sensor Network Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000280544800008"}
