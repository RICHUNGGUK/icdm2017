Lately, Apache Hadoop has attracted strong attention due to its applicability to Big Data processing. Problem: The support of Hadoop by the research community has provided the development of new features to the framework. Recently, the number of publications in journals and conferences about Hadoop has increased consistently, which makes it difficult for researchers to comprehend the full body of research and areas that require further investigation. Solution: We conducted a systematic literature review to assess research contributions to Apache Hadoop. Our objective was to identify gaps, providing motivation for new research, and outline collaborations to Apache Hadoop and its ecosystem, classifying and quantifying the main topics addressed in the literature. Results: Our analysis led to some relevant conclusions: many interesting solutions developed in the studies were never incorporated into the framework; most publications lack sufficient formal documentation of the experiments conducted by authors, hindering their reproducibility; finally, the systematic review presented in this paper demonstrates that Hadoop has evolved into a solid platform to process large datasets, but we were able to spot promising areas and suggest topics for future research within the framework.
