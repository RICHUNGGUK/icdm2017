Original tools in Wordom include a procedure to evaluate significance of sampling for principal component analysis as well as modules for clustering multiple conformations and evaluation of order parameters for folding and aggregation. The program was developed with special emphasis on user-friendliness, effortless addition of new modules and efficient handling of large sets of trajectories.", "paper_title": "Wordom: a program for efficient analysis of molecular dynamics simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000250673800018"}
