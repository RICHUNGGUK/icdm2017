Our previous wholly defined spike-in datasets, the Golden and Platinum Spikes, have provided insights for the analysis of Affymetrix GeneChips. However, a similar dataset, in which all cRNA identities and relative levels are known prospectively, has not been available for two-color platforms. Results: We have generated a wholly defined spike-in dataset for Agilent microarrays consisting of 12 arrays with more than 2000 differentially expressed, and approximately 3600 background, cRNAs. The composition of this 'Ag Spike' dataset is identical to that of our previous Platinum Spike dataset and therefore allows direct cross-platform comparison. We demonstrate here the utility of the Ag Spike dataset for evaluating different analysis methods designed for two-color arrays. Comparison between the Ag Spike and Platinum Spike studies shows high agreement between results obtained using the Affymetrix and Agilent platforms.", "paper_title": "A wholly defined Agilent microarray spike-in dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000290331600013"}
