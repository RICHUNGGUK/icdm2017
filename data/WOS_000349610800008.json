None of the developed skyline search algorithms include the use of a filter to facilitate the search process. This paper proposes a novel modification involving the use of skyline filters to reduce the search space of a skyline problem by removing data points that cannot provide a viable skyline result. Three filters based on the concept of neural networks are proposed in this paper. The result is a reduction in execution time achieved through the reduction of the input tuples. The proposed filters may be used in conjunction with any existing skyline search algorithm. This is the first study to apply neural network technology to the skyline problem. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed skyline filtering system.", "paper_title": "Neural skyline filter for accelerating skyline search algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000349610800008"}
