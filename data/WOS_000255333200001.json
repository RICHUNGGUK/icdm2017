The discrete SISO nonlinear uncertain system is presented by the Takgi-Sugeno type fuzzy model state. We recall the principle of the sliding mode control theory then we combine the fuzzy systems with the sliding mode control technique to compute at each sampling time the control law. The control law comports two terms: equivalent control law and switching control law which has a high frequency. The uncertainty is replaced by its upper bound. Inverted pendulum and mass spring dumper are used to check performance of the proposed fuzzy robust sliding mode control scheme.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy sliding mode controller for discrete nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333200001"}
