J Chem Phys 2006, 124, 224303] have been studied using the quasi-classical trajectory method. Reaction dynamic results of the HF product channel comparing with another channel of HCl with 100,000 trajectories can be accurately resolved. We show the value of the polar p(theta(r)) in the range of 0 degrees <=theta(r)<= 180 degrees, azimuthal p(phi(r)) in the range of 0 degrees <=phi(r)<= 360 degrees, and dihedral p(theta(r), phi(r)) in the ranges of 0 degrees <=theta(r)<= 180 degrees and 0 degrees <=phi(r)<= 360 degrees; the angular distributions of the product molecules HF and HCl at relative E-rel=0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 kcal mol(-1); and four polarization-dependent differential cross sections (PDDCSs) of HF and HCl at E-rel=0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 kcal mol(-1). p(phi(r)) distributions at v=0-5, and j=0, 3, 6, 9 at every E-rel are plotted cylindrically together. The stereo dynamic transformation reaction dependent upon the rovibrational states of the reactant molecule FCl and its relative translational energies around 0.5-5 kcal mol(-1) can be significantly differentiated. Translational and rovibrational enhancements of the title reactions on both early barrier potential energy surfaces have been shown in great detail and clarified. Reaction mechanisms of forward and backward scattering of the product molecules HF and HCl, respectively, have been obtained.", "paper_title": "Product rotational angular momentum polarization of H+FCl (v=0-5; j=0, 3, 6, 9) -> HF plus Cl and HCl+F at E-rel=0.5-20 kcal mol(-1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000366629200019"}
