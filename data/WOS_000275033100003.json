This paper describes a novel fast multicore processor architecture simulation framework called Two-Phase Trace-driven Simulation (TPTS), which splits detailed timing simulation into a trace generation phase and a trace simulation phase Much of the simulation overhead caused by uninteresting architectural events in only incurred once during the cycle-accurate simulation-based trace generation phase and can be omitted in the repeated trace-driven simulations We report out experiences with tsim, and evident-driven multicore processor architecture simulator that models detailed memory hierarchy, interconnect, and coherence protocol based on the TPTS framework By applying aggressive event filtering, tsim achieves an impressive simulation speed of 146 millions of simulated instructions per second, when running 16-thread parallel applications Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "paper_title": "Two-phase trace-driven simulation (TPTS): a fast multicore processor architecture simulation approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000275033100003"}
