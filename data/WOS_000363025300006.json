Many systems for location transparency are built on TCP/IP. We argue that addressing mobile objects in terms of temporary hosts may not be the best design decision. Object migration makes it necessary to use dedicated routing infrastructures, e.g., location servers, to deliver inter-object messages. This incurs high costs in terms of complexity, overhead, and latency. Here, we defer object overlay routing to a networking layer, by replacing TCP/IP with a location-independent routing scheme which directs messages to destinations determined by flat identifiers instead of IP addresses. Consequently, messages are delivered directly to objects, instead of possibly out-of-date locations. We explore the scheme using a small object-based language with asynchronous message passing, similar to Core Erlang. We provide a standard, network-oblivious operational semantics of this language, and a network-aware semantics which accounts for many aspects of distribution and routing. The main result is that program execution on top of an abstract network of processing nodes connected by asynchronous point-to-point communication channels preserves network-oblivious behavior in a sound and fully abstract way, in the sense of contextual equivalence. This is a novel and strong result for such a low-level model. Previous work has addressed distributed implementations only for fully connected TCP underlays, where contextual equivalence is typically too strong, due to the need for locking to resolve preemption arising from mobility.", "paper_title": "Location-independent routing in process network overlays", "paper_id": "WOS:000363025300006"}
