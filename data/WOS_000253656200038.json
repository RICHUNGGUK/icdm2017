The additive noise leads to a decrease in coding performance due to the high frequency components. By incorporating local statistics and quantization parameter into filtering process, the spurious noise is significantly attenuated and coding efficiency is improved for given quantization step size. In order to reduce the complexity of the pre-processing filter, the simplified local statistics and quantization parameter are introduced. The simulation results show the capability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Adaptive pre-processing algorithm to improve coding performance of seriously degraded video sequences for H.264 video coder", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200038"}
