The optimal use of these devices in the system can provide many benefits including power loss reduction, voltage profile enhancement, cost reduction, etc. Therefore, this paper deals with the optimal operation of DGs in the distribution systems considering uncertainty effects. A stochastic framework based on point estimate method (PEM) is suggested to consider the forecast error of active and reactive loads in the analysis. In order to handle all targets suitably, the idea of non-dominated solutions is employed here. The solution procedure uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal operating point of the DGs. The adjusting parameters of the PSO are updated using adaptive techniques. Finally, the IEEE 69-bus system is used to check the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Optimal operation of distributed generation in power systems considering uncertainty effects through probabilistic load flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000341926700036"}
