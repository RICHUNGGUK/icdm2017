At each depth level (or CU size), it enables up to 35 intraprediction modes, including a planar mode, a dc mode, and 33 directional modes. The intraprediction via exhaustive mode search exploited in the test model of HEVC (HM) effectively improves coding efficiency, but results in a very high computational complexity. In this paper, a fast CU size decision algorithm for HEVC intracoding is proposed to speed up the process by reducing the number of candidate CU sizes required to be checked for each treeblock. The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the following two aspects: 1) an early determination of CU size decision with adaptive thresholds is developed based on the texture homogeneity and 2) a novel bypass strategy for intraprediction on large CU size is proposed based on the combination of texture property and coding information from neighboring coded CUs. Experimental results show that the proposed effective CU size decision algorithm achieves a computational complexity reduction up to 67%, while incurring only 0.06-dB loss on peak signal-to-noise ratio or 1.08% increase on bit rate compared with that of the original coding in HM.", "paper_title": "Effective CU Size Decision for HEVC Intracoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000341706700002"}
