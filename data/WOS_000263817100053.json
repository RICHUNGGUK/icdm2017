Owing to the complexity of the data model considered, inconsistent redundancy of tuples may occur when database relations being operated are associated with different resemblance relations on a given domain. This work first demonstrates the inconsistency problem, and then presents the notions of consistency constraints for multi-database design. Under the constraints, the extended possibility-based databases using different resemblance relations can preserve consistent redundancy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
