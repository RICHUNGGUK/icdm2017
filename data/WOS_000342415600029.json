Heegard and Berger's single-letter achievability bound is well known to be optimal for physically degraded side information; however, it is not known whether the bound is optimal for arbitrarily correlated side information (general discrete memoryless sources). In this paper, we consider a new setup where the side information at one receiver is conditionally less noisy than that at the other. The new setup includes degraded side information as a special case, and it is motivated by the literature on degraded and less noisy broadcast channels. Our key contribution is a converse proving the optimality of Heegard and Berger's achievability bound in a new setting, where the side information is conditionally less noisy and one distortion function is deterministic. The less noisy setup is also generalized to two different successive-refinement problems.", "paper_title": "Source Coding Problems With Conditionally Less Noisy Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600029"}
