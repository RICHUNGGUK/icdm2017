The proposed offset algorithm, which is required by IGA, is non-existent in the CAD literature. Using the presented approach, finite element analysis of composite panels can be performed with the only input being the geometry representation of the composite surface. The method proposed provides a bi-directional system in which one can go forward from CAD to analysis and backwards from analysis to CAD. This is believed to facilitate the design of composite structures. Different parts (patches) can be parametrized independently of each other and glued together, in the finite element solver, by a discontinuous Galerkin method. A stress analysis of curved composite panel with stiffeners is provided to demonstrate the proposed framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
