The vertex set is partitioned into layers of vertices drawn in parallel planes. The vertex set is further partitioned into k >= 2 subsets, called walls. The layout consists of a set of parallel walls which are perpendicular to the set of parallel planes of the layers. We also outline a method for computing such layouts and introduce four alternative algorithms for partitioning the vertex set into walls which address different aesthetic requirements(1).", "paper_title": "Hierarchical layouts of directed graphs in three dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300023"}
