It aims to increase their ability to respond appropriately to the player's actions both cognitively and emotionally by integrating two models: the cognitive appraisal-based FAtiMA architecture, and the drives-based PSI model. We discuss the modelling of adaptive affective autonomous characters based on a biologically-inspired theory of human action regulation taking into account perception, motivation, emotions, memory, learning and planning. These agents populate an educational Role Playing Game, ORIENT (Overcoming Refugee Integration with Empathic Novel Technology) dealing with the cultural-awareness problem for children aged 13-14.", "paper_title": "Creating adaptive affective autonomous NPCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000298964600004"}
