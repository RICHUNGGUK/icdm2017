Firstly, we investigate some properties of the partially ordered set of all vectors associated with a tree with respect to majorization. Then these results are used to characterize the trees which minimize the Wiener index among all trees with a given degree sequence. Consequently, all extremal trees with the smallest Wiener index are obtained in the sets of all trees of order n with the maximum degree, the leaf number and the matching number respectively.", "paper_title": "The Wiener index of trees with given degree sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200030"}
