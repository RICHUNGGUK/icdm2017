In the era of 'Big data', the current approaches for clustering trajectory data generally do not apply for excessive costs in both scalability and computing performance for trajectory big data. Aiming at these problems, this study first proposes a new clustering algorithm for trajectory big data, namely Tra-POPTICS by modifying a scalable clustering algorithm for point data (POPTICS). Tra-POPTICS has employed the spatiotemporal distance function and trajectory indexing to support trajectory data. Tra-POPTICS can process the trajectory big data in a distributed manner to meet a great scalability. Towards providing a fast solution to clustering trajectory big data, this study has explored the feasibility to utilize the contemporary general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU). The GPGPU-aided clustering approach parallelized the Tra-POPTICS with the Hyper-Q feature of Kelper GPU and massive GPU threads. The experimental results indicate that (1) the Tra-POPTICS algorithm has a comparable clustering quality with T-OPTICS (the state of art work of clustering trajectories in a centralized fashion) and outperforms T-OPTICS by average four times in terms of scalability, and (2) the G-Tra-POPTICS has a comparable clustering quality with T-POPTICS as well and further gains about 30 speedup on average for clustering trajectories comparing to Tra-POPTICS with eight threads. The proposed algorithms exhibit great scalability and computing performance in clustering trajectory big data.", "paper_title": "A scalable and fast OPTICS for clustering trajectory big data", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400006"}
