It involves a number of techniques. First of all, most likely intracell bridging defects are identified through layout analysis and then converted into equivalent logic models. Next, we use a new defect-oriented formulation to generate test pattern for each candidate defect so as to further enhance the diagnostic resolution. Experimental results indicate that this methodology can remove 90% false defect candidates beyond gate-level diagnosis for four real designs and ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "Layout-Based Defect-Driven Diagnosis for Intracell Bridging Defects", "paper_id": "WOS:000265486900014"}
