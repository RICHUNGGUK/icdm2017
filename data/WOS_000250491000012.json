Map folding and transformation techniques are proposed for the conversion between Boolean and DFRM expansions. However, map techniques can only be used for up to 6 variables. To overcome the limitation, serial tabular technique (STT) and parallel tabular technique (PTT) are proposed. STT deals with one variable at a time while PTT generates terms in parallel. Both tabular techniques outperform significantly published work in terms of conversion time. Methods based on on-set canonical sum-of-products minterms and canonical product-of-sums maxterms are also investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
