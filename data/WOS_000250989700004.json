The device is designed on multi-semiconductor-nanowire branches having a couple of size-controlled nanometer-scale Schottky wrap gates (WPGs). The device selects an exit branch for messenger electrons according to gate voltage as a multiple-valued input variable. The path-switching function is realized by multiple assign of gate threshold voltages and applying complementary gate voltages to the two WPGs. Theoretical investigation based on three-dimensional potential simulation confirms that clear current path switching takes place in the proposed device.", "paper_title": "Multiple path switching device utilizing size-controlled nano-schottky wrap gates for MDD-based logic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989700004"}
