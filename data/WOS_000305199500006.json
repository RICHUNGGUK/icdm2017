Firstly, the fuzzy mapping aggregation rules are introduced and followed by the corresponding fuzzy inference method. Secondly, the rigid inference and the soft inference are discussed in detail. Then the flowchart of the semantic analysis and the bases and the modules in the Chinese word proofing system are illustrated subsequently. The experiment shows that it is feasible and practical method for semantic analysis.", "paper_title": "Chinese Word Semantic Proofing for Special Domain Using Fuzzy Mapping Aggregation Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000305199500006"}
