This article deals with both analytical and numerical analysis of multiple impacts. A three-dimensional computational dynamics code with a continuous contact impact model has been developed to simulate the multiple impacts of a falling rigid body with the ground. Results from the computational model as well as analytic analysis from a discrete contact impact model indicate that subsequent impacts might be larger than the initial impact in some situations. The differential equation based three-dimensional model is shown to be realistic in simulating a multiple-impact sequence and laid a foundation for detailed finite element analysis of the interior impact response of an electronic device.
