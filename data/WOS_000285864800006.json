A Web-based survey was used to collect data empirically from 276 manufacturing organizations. An analysis of the data showed that the effect of technology use in the supply chain on its performance was moderated by process innovation, partnership quality, and competitive uncertainty. In addition, partnership quality was the only variable that had a direct effect on supply chain performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
