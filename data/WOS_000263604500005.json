They are not suitable for handling the new type of attack which is based on the application layer. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to achieve early attack detection and filtering for the application-layer-based DDoS attack. An extended hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the browsing behaviors of web surfers. In order to reduce the computational amount introduced by the model's large state space, a novel forward algorithm is derived for the online implementation of the model based on the M-algorithm. Entropy of the user's HTTP request sequence fitting to the model is used as a criterion to measure the user's normality. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate our model and algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Large-Scale Hidden Semi-Markov Model for Anomaly Detection on User Browsing Behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604500005"}
