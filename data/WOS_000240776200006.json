The proposed model is applied to the segmentation of natural images based on the fusion of colors and textons into Julesz ensembles. The corresponding Exploration/ Selection/Estimation (ESE) procedure for the estimation of the parameters is presented. This method achieves the estimation of the parameters of the Gaussian kernels, the mixture proportions, the region labels, the number of regions, and the Markov hyper-parameter. Meanwhile, we present a new proof of the asymptotic convergence of the ESE procedure, based on original finite time bounds for the rate of convergence.", "paper_title": "Fusion of hidden Markov random field models and its Bayesian estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200006"}
