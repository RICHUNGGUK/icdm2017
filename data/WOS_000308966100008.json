Because many real-world signals are sparse, we deal with NBSS by sparse component analysis. First, a determinant-based sparseness measure, named D-measure, is introduced to gauge the temporal and spatial sparseness of signals. Based on this measure, a new NBSS model is derived, and an iterative sparseness maximization (ISM) approach is proposed to solve this model. In the ISM approach, the NBSS problem can be cast into row-to-row optimizations with respect to the unmixing matrix, and then the quadratic programming (QP) technique is used to optimize each row. Furthermore, we analyze the source identifiability and the computational complexity of the proposed ISM-QP method. The new method requires relatively weak conditions on the sources and the mixing matrix, has high computational efficiency, and is easy to implement. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Nonnegative Blind Source Separation by Sparse Component Analysis Based on Determinant Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000308966100008"}
