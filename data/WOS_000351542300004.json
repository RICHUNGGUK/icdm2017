This paper applies JL search to alpha-beta search, and proposes a JL alpha-beta search (JL-ABS) algorithm based on a best-first search version of MTD(f). The JL-ABS algorithm is demonstrated by using it in an opening book analysis for Chinese chess. The experimental results demonstrated that JL-ABS reached a speed-up of 10.69 when using 16 workers in the JL system.", "paper_title": "Job-Level Alpha-Beta Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000351542300004"}
