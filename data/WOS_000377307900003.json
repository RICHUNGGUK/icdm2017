We study the frame structure for spectrum handoff in the Rayleigh fading channels and formulate the CSS design problem as a sequential decision-making problem. Considering the secondary link maintenance probability during a frame, we design the optimal CSS length to achieve the maximum energy efficiency/throughput or the minimum energy consumption. A dynamic programming approach is proposed to solve the CSS design problems. Finally, the performance of the proposed design is examined and discussed using numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Optimal Channel Sensing Sequence Design for Spectrum Handoff", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900003"}
