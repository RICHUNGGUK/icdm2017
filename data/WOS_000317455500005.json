Random walk has been performed in the two-dimensional space comprising of energy-order parameter and energy-correlation function and the joint density of states (JDOS) were obtained. From the JDOS the order parameter, susceptibility and correlation function are calculated. Agreement between the results obtained from the two algorithms is very good. The work shows that for the purpose of determination of JDOS, the WLTM method is a good alternative to the WL algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
