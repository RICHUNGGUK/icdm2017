The fuzzy-genetic algorithm constructs the automatic fault detection system for monitoring aircraft behaviors. Fuzzy-based classifier is employed to estimates the time of occurrence and types of actuator failure. Genetic algorithms are used to generate an optimal fuzzy rule set for the classifier. The optimization capability of genetic algorithms provides an efficient and effective way to generate optimal fuzzy rules. Different types of actuator failure can be detected online by the fuzzy-genetic algorithm based automatic fault detection system. Simulations with different actuator failures of the nonlinear F-16 aircraft model are reported and discussed.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Automatic Fault Detection for Actuator Failures in Aircraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000264247700006"}
