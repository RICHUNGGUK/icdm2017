Service Provider needs encryption via public communication channel in order that web services can be delivered to Service Requester. Such encryptions can be realized using secure session keys. Traditional approaches which can enable such transactions are based on peer-to-peer architecture or hierarchical group architecture. The former method resides on two-party communications while the latter resides on hierarchical group communications. In this paper, we will use three-party key establishment to enable secure communications for Service Requester and Service Provider. The proposed protocol supports Service Requester, Service Broker, and Service Provider with a shared secret key established among them. Compared with peer-to-peer architecture and hierarchical group architecture, our method aims at reducing communication and computation overheads. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
