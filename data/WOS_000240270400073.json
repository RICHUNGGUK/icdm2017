In this paper we describe how to adapt the alignment templates used in statistical machine translation to the rule-based machine translation framework. The alignment templates are converted into structural transfer rules that are used by a shallow-transfer machine translation engine to produce grammatically correct translations. As the experimental results show there is a considerable improvement in the translation quality as compared to word-for-word translation (when no transfer rules are used), and the translation quality is close to that achieved when hand-coded transfer rules are used. The method presented is entirely unsupervised, and needs only a parallel corpus, two morphological analysers, and two part-of-speech taggers, such as those used by the machine translation system in which the inferred transfer rules are integrated.", "paper_title": "Using alignment templates to infer shallow-transfer machine translation rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400073"}
