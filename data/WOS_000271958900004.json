The proposed Vernier caliper and autofocus approaches reduce the area cost of delay cells by 48.78% relative to pure Vernier delay line structure with a wide measurement range. The counter circuit occupies an area of 19 mu m x 61 mu m in the traditional stepping scan approach. The proposed equivalent-signal sampling technique removes the input jitter transfer path from the sampling clock. The power supply rejection design is incorporated into the delay cell and the judge circuit. The layout implementation, calibration, and test time of the proposed BIJM system are all improved. The core circuit occupies an area of only 0.5 mm x 0.15 mm with the 90-nm CMOS process. The Gaussian and uniform distributions jitter is verified at a 5-ps timing resolution and a 2.5-GHz input clock frequency.", "paper_title": "A 2.5-GHz Built-in Jitter Measurement System in a Serial-Link Transceiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000271958900004"}
