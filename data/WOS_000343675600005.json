In this paper, we study all possible rankings of alternatives produced by applying a set of aggregation functions on a decision matrix. Those possible rankings depend on the aggregation functions that we use and the structures of the decision matrix. The aim of this paper is to investigate structures and properties of decision matrices and aggregation function spaces and give a new view point to understand aggregation spaces and decision matrices.", "paper_title": "Analysis on Aggregation Function Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000343675600005"}
