A distributed control protocol is proposed for each follower using the relative states among neighboring agents. The original problem under the proposed protocol is then converted into an H-infinity control problem by defining an appropriate controlled output function. Based on robust H-infinity control approach, sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived to ensure that all followers asymptotically converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders with the prescribed H-infinity performance. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
