For this purpose, the complete one-loop calculation has been implemented in a generic form in the Mathematica package SARAH. This information is used by SARAH to generate Fortran source code for SPheno for a numerical evaluation of these processes in a given model. We comment also on the possibility to use this setup for non-supersymmetric models.", "paper_title": "Full 1-loop calculation of BR(B-s,d(0) -> l(l)over-bar) in models beyond the MSSM with SARAH and SPheno", "paper_id": "WOS:000324664100026"}
