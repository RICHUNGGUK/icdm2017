Different tests were carried out in order both to check the ability of the data assimilation procedures to improve the initial concentrations and to start building up a benchmark for testing the performance of these procedures on different modern high-speed computers.", "paper_title": "Testing variational data assimilation modules", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400045"}
