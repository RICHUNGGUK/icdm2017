A compatible amplifier module having bidirectional amplification capability was deployed for introducing inside stackable reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers in realizing large-scale CWDM networks. The amplifier module for use in the bidirectional IP transmission confirmed that the insertion losses of the nodes and the losses of the fibers connecting the nodes can be compensated effectively, allowing the network administrator to increase the number of nodes and fiber length of the network. However, the noise generated from the amplification due to amplified spontaneous emission must be considered in network design issues. In this paper, optical power penalties due to the bidirectional amplification were estimated by conducting experimentation on minimum detectable power of optical transceivers. After analyzing the power penalty issue, an IP-over-CWDM ring network was implemented and the performance of network was evaluated by monitoring the power and packet transmissions before and after the amplifier module was turned on.", "paper_title": "Design and performance evaluation of amplifier modules in stackable ROADMs for low-cost CWDM access networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344002500006"}
