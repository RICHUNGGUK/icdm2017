In this semantics program predicates denote sets of ordered tuples, and two predicates are equal iff they are equal as sets. Moreover, every program has a unique minimum Herbrand model which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand models of the program and the least fixed-point of an immediate consequence operator. We also propose an SLD-resolution proof system which is proven sound and complete with respect to the minimum Herbrand model semantics. In other words, we provide a purely extensional theoretical framework for higher-order logic programming which generalizes the familiar theory of classical (first-order) logic programming.", "paper_title": "Extensional Higher-Order Logic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000323892900005"}
