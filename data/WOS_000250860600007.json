It is possible to maintain both structures in time O(1) after a rotation while PST with n elements may require Omega(log n) steps for a single rotation. Therefore the proposed structures can be balanced using a larger class of rebalancing schemes compared to PST. Both structures are also of interest independently of the IP lookup problem and may be used as attractive implementations of priority search queues in other contexts as well.", "paper_title": "Updata-efficient data structures for dynamic IP router tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000250860600007"}
