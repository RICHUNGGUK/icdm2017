In this algorithm, all concepts, definitions and formulations for conventional local outlier detection approach (LOF) are generalized to include uncertainty information. The least squares algorithm on multi-times curve fitting is used to generate an approximate probability density function of distance between two points. An iteration algorithm is proposed to evaluate K-eta-distance and a pruning strategy is adopted to reduce the size of candidate set of nearest-neighbors. The comparison between ULOF algorithm and the state-of-the-art approaches has been made. Results of several experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
