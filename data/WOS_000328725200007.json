For small excitations the averaging appears to be equivalent to the Delta(SCF) approach (differences in the self-consistent energies), which is a consequence of Janak's theorem and has been confirmed numerically. The Gaussian distribution in k-space for electronic excitation has been used (occupation numbers in the Delta(SCF) or eigenenergy sampling in the Delta(EIG)). A systematic behavior of the k-space localization parameter sigma(k) correcting the band-gap has been observed in numerical experiments. On that basis some sampling schemes for band-gap correction have been proposed and tested in the prediction of the band-gap behavior in InxGa(1-x)N semiconducting alloy, and a very good agreement with independent calculations has been obtained. In the context of the work the issue of electron localization in the r-space has been discussed which, as it has been predicted by Mori-Sanchez et al. [P. Mori-Sanchez, A.J. Cohen, W. Yang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 146401], should reduce the effect of the convex behavior of the LDA/GGA functionals and improve the band-gap prediction within DFT/LDA(GGA). A scheme for electron localization in r-space has been suggested. (C). 2013 Elsevier B.V.
