The key idea is that field functions should not only be combined based on their values, but also on their gradients. We implement this idea through a family of C-infinity composition operators evaluated on the GPU for efficiency, and illustrate it by applications to constructive modeling and animation.", "paper_title": "A Gradient-Based Implicit Blend", "paper_id": "WOS:000318485100002"}
