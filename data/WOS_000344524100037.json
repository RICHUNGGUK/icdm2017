Using tools from random matrix theory, we prove that, for sample vectors made of independent entries having some moment conditions, the difference between the sample covariance matrix and (a scaled version of) such robust estimator tends to zero in spectral norm, almost surely. This result can be applied to various statistical methods arising from random matrix theory that can be made robust without altering their first order behavior.", "paper_title": "Robust Estimates of Covariance Matrices in the Large Dimensional Regime", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100037"}
