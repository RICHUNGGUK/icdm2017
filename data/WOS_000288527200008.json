Our work is to give some characterizations of trivial (resp. discrete, T-0-, T-1-, T-D- and R-0-) topological spaces by the null soft set, the absolute soft set, the identical soft set and so on. Our results may be useful in the application research of classical topology.", "paper_title": "TOPOLOGICAL SPACES AND SOFT SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288527200008"}
