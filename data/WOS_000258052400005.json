Various fuzzy generalizations of rough approximations have been made over the years. This paper presents a general framework for the study of T-fuzzy rough approximation operators in which both the constructive and axiomatic approaches are used. By using a pair of dual triangular norms in the constructive approach, some definitions of the upper and lower approximation operators of fuzzy sets are proposed and analyzed by means of arbitrary fuzzy relations. The connections between special fuzzy relations and the T-upper and T-lower approximation operators of fuzzy sets are also examined. In the axiomatic approach, an operator-oriented characterization of rough sets is proposed, that is, T-fuzzy approximation operators are defined by axioms. Different axiom sets of T-upper and T-lower fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of fuzzy relations producing the same operators. The independence of axioms characterizing the T-fuzzy rough approximation operators is examined. Then the minimal sets of axioms for the characterization of the T-fuzzy approximation operators are presented. Based on information theory, the entropy of the generalized fuzzy approximation space, which is similar to Shannon's entropy, is formulated. To measure uncertainty in T-generalized fuzzy rough sets, a notion of fuzziness is introduced. Some basic properties of this measure are examined. For a special triangular norm T = min, it is proved that the measure of fuzziness of the generalized fuzzy rough set is equal to zero if and only if the set is crisp and definable.
