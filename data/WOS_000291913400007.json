Using a Fuzzy location estimator in this technique, mobile users' past movements are used in making future paging decisions by the network. IFOLMS has the potential to lead to massive savings in the number of network signal transactions that must be made to locate users. Performance of the proposed approach has been measured by using several test networks; it shows promising results - around 50% reduction in network cost - when compared to many of the existing location management techniques (including GSM). Results also provide new insights into the mobility management problem and its associated performance issues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
