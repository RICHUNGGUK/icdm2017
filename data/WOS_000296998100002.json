In 2006, Boneh and Waters (BW) presented a fully collusion-resistant trace-and-revoke scheme. However, a decisive drawback of their scheme is to require composite-order groups. In this paper, we present a new trace-and-revoke scheme that works in prime-order groups. Our scheme is fully collusion-resistant and achieves ciphertexts and private keys of size O(root N) for N users. For the same level of security, our scheme is better than the BW scheme in all aspects of efficiency. Some superior features include 8.5 times faster encryption, 12 times faster decryption, and 3.4 times shorter ciphertexts. To achieve our goal, we introduce a novel technique where, by using asymmetric bilinear maps in prime-order groups, the cancellation effect same as in composite-order groups can be obtained.", "paper_title": "Fully Collusion-Resistant Trace-and-Revoke Scheme in Prime-Order Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000296998100002"}
