We argue that itemsets that are not self-sufficient will often be of little interest to the data analyst, as their frequency should be expected once that of the itemsets on which their frequency depends is known. We present tests for statistically sound discovery of self-sufficient itemsets, and computational techniques that allow those tests to be applied as a post-processing step for any itemset discovery algorithm. We also present a measure for assessing the degree of potential interest in an itemset that complements these statistical measures.", "paper_title": "Self-Sufficient Itemsets: An Approach to Screening Potentially Interesting Associations Between Items", "paper_id": "WOS:000208168600003"}
