Two different numerical methods for solving the set of conservative equations for the continuity, momentum and energy have been applied. The major difference between the results using the two methods occurs in the temperature distribution in arc fringes within the discharge chamber. This fact influences the potential drop, overpressure, reabsorption of radiation and arc efficiency. It is shown that the radial profiles of temperature at the exit nozzle are less influenced by different temperature distribution within the discharge chamber. Comparison with chosen experimental temperature profiles shows very good agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
