Ousterhout's assertion that scripting can provide higher-level programming for the 21st Century. That scripting has developed in the shadow of object-oriented programming explains part of the problem. The two can be compatible, but one philosophy has received the most attention, with scripting appearing language by language. Ousterhout declared scripting on the rise, but perhaps so too are programming language pragmatics.", "paper_title": "In praise of scripting: Real programming pragmatism", "paper_id": "WOS:000257372700008"}
