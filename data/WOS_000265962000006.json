It is becoming increasingly vital in service oriented architectures (SOAs), where services from various administration domains are deployed. Traditional hard security mechanisms with different techniques of authorization, access control and information security services give a solid foundation, but they fail when cooperating entities act deceitfully. Trust as a soft social security mechanism can protect against such threats and consequently improves the quality of services and reliability of service providers. This paper presents an abstract trust model that applies complementary qualitative methodology which addresses the core of trust as socio-cognitive phenomenon. The model complements existing quantitative methodologies and is applied in the web services environment that enables trust management in SOAs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
