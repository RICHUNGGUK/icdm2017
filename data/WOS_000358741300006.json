Their importance stems from their intimate relation to dynamic programming algorithms. The power of tropical circuits lies somewhere between that of monotone boolean circuits and monotone arithmetic circuits. In this paper we present some lower bounds arguments for tropical circuits, and hence, for dynamic programs.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds for Tropical Circuits and Dynamic Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000358741300006"}
