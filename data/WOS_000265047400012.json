Here, a subgraph is said to be rainbow if all of its edges have different colours. It is an immediate consequence of the Erdos-Rado Canonical Ramsey Theorem that f(S, T) exists if and only if S is a star or T is acyclic. Much work has been done to determine the rate of growth of f(S, T) for various types of parameters. When S and T are both trees having s and t edges respectively, Jamison, Jiang and Ling showed that f (S, T) <= O(st(2)) and conjectured that it is always at most O(st). They also mentioned that one of the most interesting open special cases is when T is a path. In this paper, we study this case and show that f (S, P(t)) = O(st log t), which differs only by a logarithmic factor from the conjecture. This substantially improves the previous bounds for most values of s and t.", "paper_title": "Constrained Ramsey Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000265047400012"}
