The armed forces of major nations use modeling and simulation techniques for new weapons systems from the conceptual stage to design, production, deployment and training stages to shorten the development cycle and guarantee their effectiveness. Failure in the development cycle carries too much loss in time and money. Therefore, computer-based modeling and simulation techniques are applied from the conceptual stage to gauge the efficacy of new weapons systems. The objective of this study is to develop a modeling and simulation methodology for small scale engagement using the DEVS formalism. The entities required for modeling and simulation are divided into three categories: combat, logical, and environmental entities. Combat entities represent the military hardware or combatants; logical entities represent the judgment and decision entities for the interaction between various entities; and environmental entities emulate the constituents of real combat environment. The combat entities are further modeled into Shell and Core Parts to maximize their reusability under various combat scenarios. The proposed framework is verified using a one-on-one combat engagement simulation (written in C++) between two submarines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
