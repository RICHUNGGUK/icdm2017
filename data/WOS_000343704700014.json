We combine a complex-valued spatiotemporal neural network with power-inversion adaptive-array scheme for null-steering DoA estimation. Simulation and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method shows an estimation accuracy higher than that of conventional multiple signal classification method and a spectrum floor lower than that of real-valued neural network. These results suggest that the CVNN deals with signals more properly as wave information in the null synthesis in UWB systems.", "paper_title": "Ultrawideband Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Using Complex-Valued Spatiotemporal Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343704700014"}
