It is known that if a planar graph G has maximum degree Delta >= 9, then chi ''(G) = Delta + 1. Recently Hou et al. (Graphs and Combinatorics 24 (2008) 91-100) proved that if G is a planar graph with maximum degree 8 and with either no 5-cycles or no 6-cycles, then chi ''(G) = 9. In this Note, we strengthen this result and prove that if G is a planar graph with maximum degree 8, and for each vertex x, there is an integer k(x) is an element of {3, 4. 5, 6, 7,8} such that there is no k(x)-cycle which contains x, then chi ''(G)= 9.
