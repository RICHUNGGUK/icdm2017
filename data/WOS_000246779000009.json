Design/methodology/approach - The method of global optimization (called Alienor) is used for solving problems involving integer or mixed variables. A reducing transformation using a-dense curves allows to transforms a n-variables problem into a problem of a single variable. Findings - Extends the basic method valid for continuous variables to problems involving integer, Boolean or mixed variables. All problems of operational research, linear or nonlinear, may be easily solved by or technique based on a-dense curves (filling a n-dimensional space). Industrial problems can be quickly solved by this technique obtaining the best solutions. Originality/value - This method is deduced from the original works of Y. Cherruault and colleagues about global optimization and alpha-dense curves. It proposes new techniques for solving operational research problems.", "paper_title": "A new universal method for solving all problems of operational research", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000009"}
