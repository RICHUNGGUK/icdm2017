Service oriented architecture is a computational paradigm where users interact using services to increase the integration between systems. The presented abstract architecture is formed by loosely coupled, highly configurable and language-independent services. As an example of an implementation of this architecture, a complete process development using a specific service oriented technology is explained. With this implementation, less effort than classical development in integration, distribution mechanisms and execution time management has been attained. In addition, steps, ideas, advantages and disadvantages, and guidelines to create service oriented evolutionary algorithms are presented. Using existing software, or from scratch, researchers can create services to increase the interoperability in this area.", "paper_title": "Service oriented evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000319018500012"}
