It depends on various natural and social factors. The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific method for optimization of bridge construction plan. Design/methodology/approach - Grey relational analysis (GRA) is completely new analysis method has been proposed in the grey system theory. Grey relational order can be used to describe the relation between the related factors based on data series rather than lineal relation and typical distribution. First, this paper describes the basic steps and formulae of GRA Then provides an example to show how to select best bridge construction plan with the method Specially discusses significant influence of weight selection on decision making for a bridge plan Findings - The optimization of bridge construction plan will be selected more reasonable and more objective with the method GRA. Research limitations/implications - This paper will be further studied on how to quantify Indicators more objectively and how to decide weight factor more reasonably Practical implications - It has significant practical value to apply GRA to optimization of bridge plans and other engineering projects. Originality/value - A scientific method-GRA has been applied to the selection of bridge plans for seeking the best comprehensive result", "paper_title": "Grey correlation method in the decision of bridge design plans", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500020"}
