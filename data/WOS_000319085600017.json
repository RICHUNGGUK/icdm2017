In the visual Driver Assistance System (DAS), RS detection is one of the most important factors. The system provides drivers with important information on driving safety. Different color combinations of RS indicate different functionalities; hence a robust color detector should be designed to address color changes in natural surroundings. The CBH model is constructed with barycenter distribution in the created color triangle, which represents RS colors in a more compact way. For detecting RS, the CBH model is used to segment color information at the initial step. Furthermore, a judgment process is applied to verify each RS candidate through the size, aspect ratio, and color ratio. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to detect RS with robust, accurate performance and is invariant to light and scale in more complex surroundings.", "paper_title": "A Novel Color Descriptor for Road-Sign Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600017"}
