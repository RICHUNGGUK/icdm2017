Users want to make use of these services to execute a workflow application, within a certain deadline and budget. The problem considered in this paper is to find a feasible plan for the execution of the workflow which would allow providers to decide whether they can agree with the specific constraints set by the user. If they agree to admit the workflow, providers can allocate services for its execution in a way that both deadline and budget constraints are met while account is also taken of the existing load in the provider's environment (confirmed reservations from other users whose requests have been accepted). A novel heuristic is proposed and evaluated using simulation with four different real-world workflow applications.", "paper_title": "Budget-Deadline Constrained Workflow Planning for Admission Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000326838800002"}
