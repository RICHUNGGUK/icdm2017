A two-input/one-output neuro-fuzzy system composed of these circuits is implemented and testified for non-linear function approximating. All the circuits have been fabricated in SMIC 0.18-mu m Mixed-signal CMOS technology. Experiment results show that all the proposed circuits provide characteristics of high operation capacity, high speed, and simple structures. They are very suitable for rapid implementation of high-speed complex neuro-fuzzy system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
