It facilitates cluster-based retrieval by assessing the similarity between a query and the cluster themes' probability distribution. In this paper, we assess a relevance feedback mechanism, based on query refinement, that modifies the query's probability distribution using a small number of documents that have been judged relevant to the query. We demonstrate that by providing only one relevance judgment, a performance improvement of 33% was obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
