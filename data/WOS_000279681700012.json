Radial drawings are one of well-known drawing conventions in social network analysis and visualization, in particular, displaying centrality indices of actors (Wasserman and Faust, Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994). The main problem in this paper is called the one-sided radial crossing minimization, if the positions of vertices in the outer orbit are fixed. The problem is known to be NP-hard (Bachmaier, IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph. 13, 583-594, 2007), and a number of heuristics are available (Bachmaier, IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph. 13, 583-594, 2007). However, there is no approximation algorithm for the crossing minimization problem in radial drawings. We present the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm for the one-sided radial crossing minimization problem.", "paper_title": "Approximation Algorithms for Minimizing Edge Crossings in Radial Drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000279681700012"}
