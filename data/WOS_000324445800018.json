Nevertheless, when submitted to the fabrication process, the magnetic core properties are negatively impacted and may be subject to variability during the process. This variability can be of such importance that the performances of the final device (electrical machine) will also present a noticeable variability. The aim of this research is to develop a stochastic model of the magnetic behaviour law of slinky stators used in claw pole generators. The proposed methodology is general and can be applied to other physical properties of electrical devices. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on a methodology that uses experimental data and a statistical description of the magnetic properties. To that end, a set of samples issued from the same chain of assembly is considered. The hysteresis model is then developed by accounting for the parameter correlation structure. Findings - It is found that the magnetic hysteresis properties of the studied samples can be modelled by means of statistical tools applied to the parameters of the hysteresis model. The dependency of the parameters can also be accounted for a more accurate modelling. Originality/value - The paper proposes a statistical approach and a methodology that are applied to the hysteresis modelling accounting for the variability of the magnetic properties. The developed model can be further used in a numerical tool to represent the impact on the performances of electrical devices that are subject to the fabrication process variability.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Jiles-Atherton model accounting for soft magnetic material variability", "paper_id": "WOS:000324445800018"}
