In biomedical CT/micro-CT, this assumption is often violated. To produce high-resolution images, such as for our recently proposed clinical micro-CT (CMCT) prototype, it is desirable to develop a precise motion estimation and image reconstruction scheme. In this paper, we first extend the Helgason-Ludwig! consistency condition (HLCC) from parallel-beam to fan-beam geometry when an object is subject to a translation. Then, we propose a novel method to estimate the motion parameters only from sinograms; based on the HLCC. To reconstruct the moving object, we formulate two. generalized fan-beam reconstruction methods, which are in filtered backprojection and backprojection filtering formats, respectively. Furthermore, we present numerical simulation results to show that our approach is accurate and robust.", "paper_title": "Data consistency based translational motion artifact reduction in fan-beam CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000237980700011"}
