It has o oil variables and v vinegar variables. UOV has m equations and n variables, where m = o and n = v + o. In this paper, we define the weak key of UOV and study how to find the weak key from the public key. Second, we study the security when m > o. And our result shows that the security strengths of the current version of TTS, TRMS, Rainbow and MFE are 2(59) similar to 2(67.6) 3DES operations.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of variants of UOV", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800012"}
