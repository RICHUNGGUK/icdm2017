In this field study we generate a grounded theory of how people manage the process of software development. The main concern of engineers involved in the process of software development is getting the job done. To get the job done, people engage in a four-stage process of Reconciling Perspectives. Reconciling Perspectives represents an attempt to converge individuals' points of view or perspectives about a software project. The process emphasizes the importance of individuals' abilities to both reach out and engage in negotiations and create shelter from environmental noise to bring a software project to fruition.
