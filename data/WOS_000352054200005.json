Under normal circumstances, hBFT uses speculation, i.e., replicas directly adopt the order from the primary and send replies to the clients. As in prior work such as Zyzzyva, when replicas are out of order, clients can detect the inconsistency and help replicas converge on the total ordering. However, we take a different approach than previous work that has four distinct benefits: it requires many fewer cryptographic operations, it moves critical jobs to the clients with no additional costs, faulty clients can be detected and identified, and performance in the presence of client participation will not degrade as long as the primary is correct. The correctness is guaranteed by a three-phase checkpoint subprotocol similar to PBFT, which is tailored to our needs. The protocol is triggered by the primary when a certain number of requests are executed or by clients when they detect an inconsistency.", "paper_title": "hBFT: Speculative Byzantine Fault Tolerance with Minimum Cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000352054200005"}
