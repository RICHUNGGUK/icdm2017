DC reformulation techniques and exact penalty in DC programming are developed to build an appropriate equivalent DC program of the block clustering problem. They lead to an elegant and explicit DCA scheme for the resulting DC program. Computational experiments show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over standard algorithms such as two-mode K-means, two-mode fuzzy clustering, and block classification EM.", "paper_title": "Block Clustering Based on Difference of Convex Functions (DC) Programming and DC Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000323822800008"}
