Two integral approaches using the Green dyadic formalism are considered. Design/methodology/approach - The surface integral model (SEW) is dedicated to ideal cracks, whereas the volume integral method is adapted to general volumetric defects. Findings - The authors observed that SEA provides satisfactory results, except in some critical transmitting/receiving (T/R) configurations. This led us to propose a hybrid method based on the combination of the two previous ones. Originality/value - This method enables to simulate ECNDT on planar structures implying defects with a small opening using T/R probes.", "paper_title": "Hybridization of volumetric and surface models for the computation of the T/R EC probe response due to a thin opening flaw", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300029"}
