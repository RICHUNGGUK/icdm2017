However, only a small percentage of applications is static and remains unchanged since its first deployment. Most of the applications change with newly coming user requirements and changing environment. In this paper we describe a framework and a methodology for management of evolution and change propagation throughout XML applications. We also describe its proof-of-concept implementation called eXolutio, which has been developed and improved in our research group during last few years. The text should help the reader to get acquainted with the target area of XML evolution and the approach we have proposed and implemented.", "paper_title": "eXolutio: Methodology for Design and Evolution of XML Schemas Using Conceptual Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700006"}
