In order to remedy this limitation, a novel DNMF method is presented that uses projected gradients. The proposed algorithm employs some extra modifications that make the method more suitable for classification tasks. The usefulness of the proposed technique to frontal face verification and facial expression recognition problems is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "A novel discriminant non-negative matrix, factorization algorithm with applications to facial image characterization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248832500010"}
