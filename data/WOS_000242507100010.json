Foveated video originates from visual entropy reduction by removing undetectable high visual frequencies that occur at a distance from the fixation point. In this paper, compression gain is defined and measured to quantify the enhanced performance when the visual throughput of the regions of interest (ROI) is increased over a capacity-limited channel.", "paper_title": "Compression gain measurements using ROI-based data reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100010"}
