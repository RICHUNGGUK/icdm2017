The reason lies in that functional data are functions and most algorithms are designed to work with low dimensional vectors In this paper we propose a functional analysis technique to obtain finite-dimensional representations of functional data The key idea is to consider each functional datum as a point in a general function space and then to project these points onto a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with the aid of a support vector machine We show some theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its performance in some classification examples (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
