One such opportunity is the possibility to apply genotype networks analysis to population genetics data. Genotype networks are a representation of the set of genotypes associated with a single phenotype, and they allow one to estimate properties such as the robustness of the phenotype to mutations, and the ability of its associated genotypes to evolve new adaptations. So far, though, genotype networks analysis has rarely been applied to population genetics data. To help fill this gap, here we present VCF2Networks, a tool to determine and study genotype network structure from single-nucleotide variant data.", "paper_title": "VCF2Networks: applying genotype networks to single-nucleotide variants data", "paper_id": "WOS:000350058800026"}
