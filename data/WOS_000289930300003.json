It is characterised when an r.e. set W is the domain of a universal plain machine in terms of the description complexity of the spectrum function s(W) mapping each non-negative integer n to the number of all strings of length n in W; furthermore, a characterisation of the same style is given for supersets of domains of universal plain machines. Similarly the prefix-free sets which are domains or supersets of domains of universal prefix-free machines are characterised. Furthermore, it is shown that the halting probability Omega(V) of an re. prefix-free set V containing the domain of a universal prefix-free machine is Martin-Lof random, while V may not be the domain of any universal prefix-free machine itself. Based on these investigations, the question whether every domain of a universal plain machine is the superset of the domain of some universal prefix-free machine is discussed. A negative answer to this question had been presented at CiE 2010 by Mikhail Andreev, Ilya Razenshteyn and Alexander Shen, while this paper was under review. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
