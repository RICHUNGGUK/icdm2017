Two fuzzy models are developed. In the first model the input parameters are fuzzified, while the decision variables are treated as crisp variables. In the second model, not only the input parameters but also the decision variables are fuzzified. For each fuzzy model, a method of defuzzification, namely the graded mean integration method, is employed to find the estimate of the profit function in the fuzzy sense, and then the optimal policy for the each model is determined. The optimal policy for the second model is determined by using the Kuhn-Tucker conditions after the defuzzification of the profit function. Numerical examples are provided in order to ascertain the sensitiveness in the decision variables with respect to fuzziness in the components. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
