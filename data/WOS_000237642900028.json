When a sequence of images are filmed from a side-looking video camera passing far-range areas, the ghost effect in which same objects appear repeatedly occurs. To suppress such ghost effect, the far-range areas are detected by using the distance between the image frame and the 3D coordinate of tracked optical flows. The ghost effects are suppressed by projecting the part of image frames onto 3D multiple planes utilizing vectors passing the focal point of frames and a vertical slit. The vertical slit is calculated by utilizing the first and last frames of the far-range areas. We demonstrated algorithm that creates efficient 3D panoramic mosaics without the ghost effect at the far-range area.", "paper_title": "3D panoramic mosaicking to suppress the ghost effect at far-range scene for urban area visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900028"}
