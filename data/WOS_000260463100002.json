This paper presents an algorithm for finding an optimal and global per-commodity max-min fair rate vector in a polynomial number of steps. In addition, we present a fast and novel distributed algorithm where each source router can find the routing and the fair rate allocation for its commodities while keeping the locally optimal max-min fair allocation criteria. The distributed algorithm is a fully polynomial epsilon-approximation (FPTAS) algorithm and is based on a primal-dual alternation technique. We implemented these algorithms to demonstrate its correctness, efficiency, and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Centralized and Distributed Algorithms for Routing and Weighted Max-Min Fair Bandwidth Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260463100002"}
