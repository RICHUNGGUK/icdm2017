First, H.264 SME is analyzed and the impact of its functionalities on coding performance is investigated. Then, design space of SME algorithms is explored representing design problems, approaches, and recent advanced algorithms. Besides, design challenges and strategies of SME hardware architectures are discussed and promising architectures are surveyed. Further perspectives and future prospects are also presented to highlight emerging trends and outlook of SME designs.", "paper_title": "A SURVEY OF ALGORITHMS AND ARCHITECTURES FOR H.264 SUB-PIXEL MOTION ESTIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071900002"}
