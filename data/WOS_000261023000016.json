[Z.-J. Tan, D.V. Le, K.M. Lim, B.C. Khoo, An Immersed Interface Method for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Discontinuous Viscosity Across the Interface, submitted for publication] focussing mainly on the fixed interface problems. In this work, we introduce the velocity components at the membrane as two augmented unknown interface variables to decouple the originally coupled jump conditions for the velocity and pressure. Three forms of augmented equation are derived to determine the augmented variables to satisfy the continuous condition of the velocity. The velocity at the membrane, which determine the motion of the membrane, is then solved by the GMRES iterative method. The forces calculated from the configuration of the flexible elastic membrane and the augmented variables are interpolated using cubic splines and applied to the fluid through the jump conditions. The position of the flexible elastic membrane is updated implicitly using a quasi-Newton method (BFGS) within each time step. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a staggered Cartesian grid using a second order accurate projection method with the incorporation of spatial and temporal jump conditions. In addition, we also show that the inclusion of the temporal jump contributions has non-negligible effect on the simulation results when the grids are crossed by the membrane. Using the above method, we assess the effect of different viscosities on the flow solution and membrane motion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
