The method consists of two phases. In the first phase, the nodes are moved based on an explicit formulation. A constraint has also been implemented to prevent the deterioration of elements associated with the node being moved. The second phase of the method is optismoothing based on the Nelder-Mead simplex method. The summation of the Jacobian of all the elements sharing a node has been taken as the function to be maximized. The method has been tested on meshes up to 18,305 hexahedral elements and was found to be stable and improved the mesh in about 112.6 s on an Intel Centrino(A (R)) 1.6 GHz, 1 GB RAM machine. The method thus has the advantage of being effective as well as being computationally efficient.", "paper_title": "DARSS: a hybrid mesh smoother for all hexahedral meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302327900007"}
