The two core characteristics of the recommended algorithm are parallel processing mode and chaotic behaviors. Moreover in this paper, an algorithm for one way hash function construction based on chaos theory is introduced. The proposed algorithm contains variable parameters dynamically obtained from the position index of the corresponding message blocks. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that the algorithm can assure all performance requirements of hash function in an efficient and flexible style and secure against birthday attacks or meet-in-the-middle attacks, which is good choice for data integrity or authentication.", "paper_title": "The Parallel One-way Hash Function Based on Chebyshev-Halley Methods with Variable Parameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000329600000003"}
