Building information modeling (BIM), which is a technology that allows for the consistent management of information, is regarded as a necessary tool for managing the process of building construction from beginning to end. However, the information provided by BIM is rarely applied to on-site construction planning and scheduling. In this paper, we describe a BIM-based structural framework optimization and simulation system for managing construction planning and scheduling. Moreover we conduct a dynamic visualization of the construction process according to the optimized schedules by applying a predefined calculation formula and logic along with 3D geometry data and process data to determine the amount of work required for major construction processes. In addition, if more than two different construction schedules are fed into the system, it is able to compare construction schedules using its comparison simulation function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
