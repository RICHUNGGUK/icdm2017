The minimum WCDS (MWCDS) problem is known to be NP-hard, and several approximation algorithms have been proposed for solving MWCDS in deterministic graphs. However, to the best of our knowledge no work has been done on finding the WCDS in stochastic graphs. In this paper, a definition of the MWCDS problem in a stochastic graph is first presented and then several learning automata-based algorithms are proposed for solving the stochastic MWCDS problem where the probability distribution function of the weight associated with the graph vertices is unknown. The proposed algorithms significantly reduce the number of samples needs to be taken from the vertices of the stochastic graph. It is shown that by a proper choice of the parameters of the proposed algorithms, the probability of finding the MWCDS is as close to unity as possible. Experimental results show the major superiority of the proposed algorithms over the standard sampling method in terms of the sampling rate.", "paper_title": "LEARNING AUTOMATA-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR FINDING MINIMUM WEAKLY CONNECTED DOMINATING SET IN STOCHASTIC GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284614000003"}
