Since the mobile collector can traverse the transmission range of each sensor, the energy of nodes may be saved near maximally. However, for directly receiving data packet from every node, the length of mobile collector route should be very long. Hence it may significantly increase the data gathering latency. To solve this problem, several algorithms have been proposed. One of them called BRH-MDG found that data gathering latency can be effectively shortened by performing proper local aggregation via multihop transmissions and then uploading the aggregated data to the mobile collector. But, the BRH-MDG algorithm did not carefully analyze and optimize the energy consumption of the entire network. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the energy consumption of the LNs and present a new algorithm called EEBRHM. The simulation results show that under the premise of bounded relay hop, compared with BRH-MDG, EEBRHM can prolong the networks lifetime by 730%.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient and Relay Hop Bounded Mobile Data Gathering Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355484000001"}
