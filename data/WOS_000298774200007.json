The major topics that the task of data replication covers include the replica creation, placement, relocation and retirement, replica consistency and replica access. In a business context a number of constraints exists which are set by the infrastructure, network and application capabilities in combination with the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that hinder the effectiveness of data replication schemes. In this paper, we examine how this combination affects the replication lifecycle in Data Grids and we introduce a set of interoperable novel file replication algorithms that take into account the infrastructural constraints as well as the 'importance' of the data. The latter is approximated through a multi-parametric factor that encapsulates a set of data-specific parameters, such as popularity and content significance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
