This problem has been shown to be NP-complete, even when all messages have the same length. For the CDMD problem, we present an efficient approximation algorithm to construct a message-routing schedule with a total communication time of at most 3.5d, where d is the total length of the messages that each processor needs to send or receive. The algorithm takes O(qn) time, where n is the number of processors and q is the total number of messages that the processors receive.", "paper_title": "Continuous Delivery Message Dissemination problems under the multicasting communication mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000257018400003"}
