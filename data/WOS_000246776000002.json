One example is the Vehicle Information System (VIS), in which several components gather vehicle information such as RPM and fuel tank level, and are tightly coupled with the embedded hardware. Several projects have been started by commercial software companies or passionate open source developers to meet the needs for entertainment, gathering vehicle information, and traffic information in vehicle. We design and implement a software integration framework for such systems and a vehicle safety box component for VIS. The framework allows the users and developers to integrate independently developed software components into one system and provides a unified GUI In addition, it eliminates the efforts for re-designing or re-compiling the system for software upgrades.", "paper_title": "Vehicle information systems integration framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776000002"}
