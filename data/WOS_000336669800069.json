However, one of the key technologies for implementing CMfg is how to realize manufacturing resource intelligent perception and access. In order to achieve intelligent perception and access of various manufacturing resources, the applications of IoT technologies in CMfg has been investigated in this paper. The classification of manufacturing resources and services, as well as their relationships, are presented. A five-layered structure (i.e., resource layer, perception layer, network layer, service layer, and application layer) resource intelligent perception and access system based on IoT is designed and presented. The key technologies for intelligent perception and access of various resources (i.e., hard manufacturing resources, computational resources, and intellectual resources) in CMfg are described. A prototype application system is developed to valid the proposed method.", "paper_title": "IoT-Based Intelligent Perception and Access of Manufacturing Resource Toward Cloud Manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800069"}
