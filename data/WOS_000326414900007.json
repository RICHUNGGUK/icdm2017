Towards improved energy-latency trade-offs, we propose a biased, adaptive sink mobility scheme, that adjusts to local network conditions, such as the surrounding density, remaining energy and the number of past visits in each network region. The sink moves probabilistically, favoring less visited areas in order to cover the network area faster, while adaptively stopping more time in network regions that tend to produce more data. We implement and evaluate our mobility scheme via simulation in diverse network settings. Compared to known blind random, non-adaptive schemes, our method achieves significantly reduced latency, especially in networks with non-uniform sensor distribution, without compromising the energy efficiency and delivery success.
