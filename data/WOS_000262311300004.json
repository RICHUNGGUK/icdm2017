We introduce cut sets of the fuzzy concepts and fuzzy roles as atomic concepts and atomic roles, and inherit concept constructors of the description logics to support a new logic system for fuzzy knowledge representation. We define the syntax, semantics and knowledge base of the extended fuzzy description logic, and focus on sat-domain and consistency as main reasoning tasks. We also present sound and complete tableau algorithms for these reasoning tasks, and prove the complexity of them is PSPACE-complete. Compared with the other fuzzy description logics, the extended fuzzy description logic can express more wide fuzzy information. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
