This algorithm is applicable for cases in which the outlier rate is over 85%. If the outlier rate of optical flows is over 45%, then discarding outliers with conventional algorithms in real-time applications is very difficult. The proposed algorithm overcomes conventional difficulties by using a three-step algorithm: 1) construct a two-dimensional histogram with two axes having the lengths and directions of the optical flows; 2) sort the number of optical flows in each bin of the two-dimensional histogram in descending order, and remove bins having a lower number of optical flows than the given threshold: 3) increase the resolution of the two-dimensional histogram if the number of optical flows grouped in a specific bin is over 20%, and decrease the resolution if the number of optical flows is less than 10%. This process is repeated until the number of optical flows falls into a range of 10%-20%. The proposed algorithm works well on different kinds of images having many outliers.
