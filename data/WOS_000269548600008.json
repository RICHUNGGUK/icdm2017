This paper is devoted to formulation of assembly mating graphs from legacy computer-aided design models. Mating relationships are classified as direct, indirect, and interference relationships. Direct mating relationships are identified using geometric methods while a ray-firing algorithm is used to identify indirect and interference type mating relationships. The effectiveness of the developed methodology is demonstrated using illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Extracting Assembly Mating Graphs for Assembly Variant Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000269548600008"}
