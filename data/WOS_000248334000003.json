The proposed approach is motivated by the dynamic behaviour analogy between a mechanical and a manufacturing system. The main hypothesis is that the flexibility of a manufacturing system can be calculated in the same manner as the damping factor of a mechanical system. In order for the validity of the proposed method to be tested and discussed, a set of experiments has been designed and executed, initially for a simple production system. An industrial production system has also been studied using the same approach. The results prove that this method can be used for the estimation of a manufacturing system's flexibility.", "paper_title": "Quantifying the flexibility of a manufacturing system by applying the transfer function", "paper_id": "WOS:000248334000003"}
