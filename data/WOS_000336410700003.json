This paper suggests a new use of quality function deployment (QFD) for facility location selection problem instead of applying it to traditional product quality promotion. Fuzzy sets concept is also incorporated to deal with imprecise nature of the linguistic judgments of decision makers. First, fuzzy QFD as a stand-alone approach is presented to address international facility location selection decision. To consider resource limitations and operational constraints, fuzzy goal programming is combined with fuzzy quality function deployment to present a developed approach to deal with global facility location-allocation decision. A demonstration of the applicability of proposed methodologies in a real-world problem is presented.", "paper_title": "An integrated fuzzy QFD and fuzzy goal programming approach for global facility location-allocation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000336410700003"}
