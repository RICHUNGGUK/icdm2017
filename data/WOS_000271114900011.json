This paper presents two novel fast synchronizers, both based on two-phase protocols: a two-flip-flop synchronizer which reduces the data cycle from 6-12 down to 2-4 clock cycles, and a LDL synchronizer which strives for maximum throughput and 'sub-cycle latency,' namely data transfers that incur no extra penalty due to synchronization. These synchronizers are useful for data transfers over long interconnects. Simulations of best- and worst-case scenarios are presented which demonstrate the improved performance of the novel synchronizers. The results are compared to two-clock FIFO and to conventional two-flip-flop synchronizers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
