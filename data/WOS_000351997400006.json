In particular, most large enterprises intend to reduce management cost and improve productivity via cloud computing technologies. In order to provide uninterrupted services to client customers and reduce the maintenance cost of cloud services, how to dynamically allocate precious resources efficiently among individual clouds has become a critical issue. In this study, how to support dynamic allocation on computing resources across multiple cloud environments is considered. We proposed an efficient computing resource allocation mechanism based on the inter-trust relationship model, which allows one cloud to borrow extra computing resources from other clouds via cloud federation architecture when it is necessary. Simulation experiments are conducted and the results show the practicability and feasibility of our proposed mechanism in cloud federation environments.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme for Cloud Federations", "paper_id": "WOS:000351997400006"}
