Analysis of structural parameters, determination of CHELPG (charge electrostatic potential grid) intermolecular charge transfer, interpretation of infrared stretching modes, and Bader's atoms in molecules (AIM) theory calculations was carried out in order to characterize the hydrogen bonds in each isomer of the C(2)H(4)O center dot center dot center dot 2HF complex. The most stable structure was determined through the identification of hydrogen bonds between C(2)H(4)O and HF, (O center dot center dot center dot H), as well as in the hydrofluoric acid dimer, (HF(D-R)center dot center dot center dot HF(D)). However, the existence of a tertiary interaction (F(lambda)center dot center dot center dot H(alpha)) between the fluoride of the second hydrofluoric acid and the axial hydrogen atoms of C(2)H(4)O was decisive in the identification of the preferred configuration of the C(2)H(4)O center dot center dot center dot 2HF system.", "paper_title": "The electronic structure of the C(2)H(4)O center dot center dot center dot 2HF tri-molecular heterocyclic hydrogen-bonded complex: a theoretical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000258611500008"}
