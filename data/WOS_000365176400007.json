We provide notions of (bi)simulations for XPath logics containing the child, parent, ancestor and descendant axes to navigate the tree. We show that these notions precisely characterize the equivalence relation associated with each logic. We study formula complexity measures consisting of the number of nested axes and nested subformulas in a formula; these notions are akin to the notion of quantifier rank in first-order logic. We show characterization results for fine grained notions of equivalence and (bi)simulation that take into account these complexity measures. We also prove that positive fragments of these logics correspond to the formulas preserved under (non-symmetric) simulations. We show that the logic including the child axis is equivalent to the fragment of first-order logic invariant under the corresponding notion of bisimulation. If upward navigation is allowed the characterization fails but a weaker result can still be established. These results hold both over the class of possibly infinite data trees and over the class of finite data trees. Besides their intrinsic theoretical value, we argue that bisimulations are useful tools to prove (non)expressivity results for the logics studied here, and we substantiate this claim with examples.", "paper_title": "Model Theory of XPath on Data Trees.
