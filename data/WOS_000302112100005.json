Design/methodology/approach - The magnitude and distribution of the heat transfer coefficient are the variables in an optimisation problem. The objective is to minimise the difference between experimentally measured temperatures and temperatures obtained using a 3D finite element model. The optimisation problem is solved using a gradient based optimisation method. This approach yields optimal values for the magnitude and distribution of the heat transfer coefficient. Findings - It is found that the heat transfer coefficient between the workpiece and the backingplate is non-uniform and takes its maximum value in a region below the welding tool. Four different parameterisations of the spatial distribution of the heat transfer coefficient are analysed and a simple, two parameter distribution is found to give good results. Originality/value - The heat transfer from workpiece to backingplate is important for the temperature field in the workpiece, and in turn the mechanical properties of the welded plate. Accurate modelling of the magnitude and distribution of the heat transfer coefficient is therefore an essential step towards improved models of the process. This is the first study using a gradient based optimisation method and a non-uniform parameterisation of the heat transfer coefficient in an inverse modeling approach to determine the heat transfer coefficient in friction stir welding.", "paper_title": "Estimating the workpiece-backing plate heat transfer coefficient in friction stirwelding", "paper_id": "WOS:000302112100005"}
