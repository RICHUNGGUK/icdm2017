One of the main issues of knowledge discovery is knowledge reduction. The objective of this paper is to investigate the knowledge reduction in FCA and propose a method based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for addressing the issue. Experiments on real world and benchmark datasets offer the evidence for the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2014 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).
