This study aims to construct a model which will classify companies according to internet activities undertaken and then to explore whether different adoption can be interpreted by business demographics and a limited number of perceived barriers. Design/methodology/approach - This empirical research was carried out by the means of survey focussing on the Greek jewellery industry. Data were submitted to a sequence of statistical analyses resulting to a model of Internet adoption. The model was then bench marked to representative domestic and international adoption patterns. Findings - Firms can be classified into three groups, ranging from non-adopters to relatively mature adopters, similarly to previous patterns of international B2B small to medium enterprises. Business size and type, international cooperation and knowledge with regards to internet proved to be significantly correlated to adoption status. Research limitations/implications - The paper focusses on one Greek business sector and thus the applicability of its results to cross-type international micro-businesses remains questionable. Practical implications - The findings of this study can assist company owners to plan their internet strategy, software vendors to target firms by offering tailored solutions and governmental authorities to implement initiatives aiming to confront the highlighted internet adoption disablers. Originality/value - This is one of a few information and communication technology studies that focus on very small companies and perhaps the only one providing an empirical classification model of internet adoption for this business size.", "paper_title": "Micro firms internet adoption patterns: the case of the Greek jewellery industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000357393800002"}
