One candidate to deal with this problem is robust receding horizon control (RRHC) schemes, which can be formulated as a differential game. Our focus concerns numerically solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Issac (HJI) equations derived from RRHC schemes for uncertain fuzzy systems. The developed finite difference approximation scheme with sigmoidal transformation is a stable and convergent algorithm for HJI equations. Accelerated procedures with boundary value iteration are developed to increase the calculation accuracy with less time consumption. Then, the state-feedback RRHC controller is designed for some class of uncertain fuzzy systems with constraints. The value function calculated by numerical methods acts as the design parameter. The closed-loop system is proven to be asymptotically stable. An engineering implementation of the controller is discussed.", "paper_title": "Robust receding horizon control of uncertain fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600006"}
