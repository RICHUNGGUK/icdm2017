Simulation by Cellular Interactive Automata of the Rheology of Aetnean lava flows (SCIARA) is a Cellular Automata model for simulating lava flows; its release gamma 2 introduces innovations to the empirical method for modelling macroscopic phenomena that was utilized in the previous releases. The lava flows are described as \"blocks\", individuated by their barycentre co-ordinates and velocities. This approach is different from the previous releases of SCIARA and from cellular automata derived models for fluid-dynamical phenomena such as lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann models. Block specifications permit to obtain a more physical description of the phenomenon and a more accurate control of its development. SCIARA gamma 2 was applied to the 2002 Etnean lava flows with satisfying results, obtaining better simulations in comparison with the previous releases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
