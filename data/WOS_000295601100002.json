CD-STA is a method that transmits uncorrelated signals from different transducers simultaneously to achieve highspeed and high-resolution acoustic imaging. In CD-STA, autocorrelations and cross-correlations in transmitted signals must be suppressed because they cause artifacts in the resulting images, which narrow the dynamic range as a consequence. To suppress the correlation noise, we had proposed to use multicarrier signals optimized by a genetic algorithm. Because the evaluation of our proposed method was very limited in the previous reports, we analyzed it more deeply in this paper. We optimized three pairs of multicarrier waveforms of various lengths, which correspond to 5th-, 6th-and 7th-order M-sequence signals, respectively. We built a CD-STA imaging system that operates in air. Using the system, we conducted imaging experiments to evaluate the image quality and resolution of the multicarrier signals. We also investigated the ability of the proposed method to resolve both positions and velocities of target scatterers. For that purpose, we carried out an experiment, in which both moving and fixed targets were visualized by our system. As a result of the experiments, we confirmed that the multicarrier signals have lower artifact levels, better axial resolution, and greater tolerance to velocity mismatch than M-sequence signals, particularly for short signals.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Acoustic Imaging System Using Correlation Division in Synthetic Transmit Aperture with Multicarrier Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100002"}
