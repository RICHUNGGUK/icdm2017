The knowledge of crowd dynamics is very useful in developing different facilities. The article contains a description of a model of passengers flow in public transport vehicles. The model is created on the basis of tram NCT-6, used by MPK SA in Krakow (Public Transport Company). The model proposed is based on Cellular Automata Technology combined with Multi-Agent theory. The interactions among passengers (agents) are included. The dimensions and the shape of an agent make it possible to take into account the real behavior of a passenger.", "paper_title": "Modeling of people flow in public transport vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100040"}
