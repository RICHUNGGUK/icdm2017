We show that most minor-closed properties-those that cannot be characterized by a finite set of forbidden subgraphs-have quantum query complexity Theta(n(3/2)). To establish this, we prove an adversary lower bound using a detailed analysis of the structure of minor-closed properties with respect to forbidden topological minors and forbidden subgraphs. On the other hand, we show that minor-closed properties (and more generally, sparse graph properties) that can be characterized by finitely many forbidden subgraphs can be solved strictly faster, in o(n(3/2)) queries. Our algorithms are a novel application of the quantum walk search framework and give improved upper bounds for several subgraph-finding problems.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM QUERY COMPLEXITY OF MINOR-CLOSED GRAPH PROPERTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000312600700003"}
