The flows are supposed to be laminar, viscous, incompressible and steady or unsteady with prescribed pressure variation at the outlet. The model used for non-Newtonian fluids is a variant of power law. Governing equations in this model are incompressible Navier Stokes equations. For numerical solution we use artificial compressibility method with three stage Runge-Kutta method and finite volume method in cell centered formulation for discretization of space derivatives. The following cases of flows are solved: steady Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow through a bypass connected to main channel in 2D, steady Newtonian flow in angular bypass in 3D and unsteady non-Newtonian flow through bypass in 2D. Some 2D and 3D results that could have application in the area of biomedicine are presented. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
