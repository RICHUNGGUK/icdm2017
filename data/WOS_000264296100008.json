The main contribution of this paper is the design and development of an SOA-equipped content delivery system based on a context-driven, access-controlled, profile-favored, and history-maintained (CAPH) model. We embody the generic model-view-controller (MVC) model to support a dynamic content adaptation technique based on mobile users' contextual environments. Self-adaptable presentation objects and modules are modeled as universal Web services resources, so that their interactions are formalized into Web services operations for high interoperability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SOA-based model makes it easy to configure and construct a flexible Web content delivery system on the mobile Internet.", "paper_title": "SOA-BASED CONTENT DELIVERY MODEL FOR MOBILE INTERNET NAVIGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264296100008"}
