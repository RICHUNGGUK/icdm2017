The LSB matching method proposed by Mielikaien utilizes a binary function to reduce the number of changed pixel values. However, his method still has room for improvement. A tier-score system is proposed in this paper to assess the performance of different orders for LSB matching. An immune programming approach is adopted to search for a near-optimal solution among all the permutation orders. The proposed method can reduce the distortion of the stego image, improve the visual quality, and decrease the probability of detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than Mielikainen's pair-wise LSB matching method in terms of distortion and survival probability against steganalysis.
