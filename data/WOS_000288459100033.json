As an application of the generic method to sequence Family, a new optimal quaternary sequence family with length 2(2(n) - 1), family size 2(n) + 1, and maximal nontrivial correlation value 2(n+1/2) + 2, where n is an odd integer, is obtained. Most notably, unlike all the known optimal quaternary sequence families, the new family has a unique property that the odd integers 1, 3 and the even integers 0, 2 are allocated alternatively in all the sequences.", "paper_title": "Generic Construction of Quaternary Sequences of Period 2N With Low Correlation From Quaternary Sequences of Odd Period N", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100033"}
