Four lane changing regulations are studied, which reveals effect of lane changing ban, symmetric and asymmetric lane changing rules on traffic flow characteristics (flow rate, carry capability, lane changing frequency, and lane usage). We expect that our results could be useful for traffic management.", "paper_title": "TRAFFIC DYNAMICS IN A TWO-LANE MIXED TRAFFIC SYSTEM: EFFECT OF FOUR LANE CHANGING REGULATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261382900007"}
