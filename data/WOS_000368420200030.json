Leveraging recent results from its analysis, we extend the remit and utility of the framework to the quantification of the computational security of multi-user systems. In particular, assume that V users independently select strings stochastically from a finite, but potentially large, list. An inquisitor who does not know which strings have been selected wishes to identify U of them. The inquisitor knows the selection probabilities of each user and is equipped with a method that enables the testing of each (user, string) pair, one at a time, for whether that string had been selected by that user. Here, we establish that, unless U = V, there is no general strategy that minimizes the distribution of the number of guesses, but in the asymptote as the strings become long we prove the following: by construction, there is an asymptotically optimal class of strategies; the number of guesses required in an asymptotically optimal strategy satisfies a large deviation principle with a rate function, which is not necessarily convex, that can be determined from the rate functions of optimally guessing individual users' strings; if all users' selection statistics are identical, the exponential growth rate of the average guesswork as the string-length increases is determined by the specific Renyi entropy of the string-source with parameter (V - U + 1)/(V - U + 2), generalizing the known V = U = 1 case; and that the Shannon entropy of the source is a lower bound on the average guesswork growth rate for all U and V, thus providing a bound on computational security for multi-user systems. Examples are presented to illustrate these results and their ramifications for systems design.", "paper_title": "Multi-User Guesswork and Brute Force Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200030"}
