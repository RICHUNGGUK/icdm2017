In this paper, multi-model adaptive control (MMAC) based on fuzzy neural networks (FNN) is suggested to identify and control discrete-time nonlinear systems in such environment. Stable learning algorithms for fuzzy neural networks which are robust to any bounded uncertainty are applied during the identification and adaptive control. The procedure of MMAC based on different model sets and index function is given, and the stability of MMAC is proved. This kind of MMAC based on FNN can improve the transient response greatly in case of the stability of training process is guaranteed. The simulation results show that the control performance is better than traditional adaptive controllers when the system parameters have changed abruptly.", "paper_title": "Multi-model adaptive control based on fuzzy neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800037"}
