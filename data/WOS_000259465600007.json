The speciality of the Class A matrix causes the Class A Bezier to possess two properties, which are sufficient conditions for the proof of the curvature and torsion monotonicity. In this paper, we discover that, in Farin (2006), the conditions Class A matrix satisfied cannot guarantee one of the two properties of the Class A Bezier curves, then the proof of the curvature and torsion monotonicity becomes incomplete. Furthermore, we modified the conditions for the Class A matrices to complete the proof.. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
