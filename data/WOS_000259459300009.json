Design/methodology/approach - Survey and analysis methods are employed. Findings - Survey results reveal that female readers have a stronger preference for paper as a reading medium than male readers, whereas male readers exhibit a greater degree of satisfaction with online reading than females. Additionally, males and females differ significantly on the dimension of selective reading and sustained attention. Originality/value - Understanding gender differences would enable a better understanding of the changing reading behavior in the online environment, and to develop more effective digital reading devices. Factors affecting gender differences in the online reading environment are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.", "paper_title": "Gender differences in the online reading environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259459300009"}
