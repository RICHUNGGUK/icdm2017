How to efficiently find out target objects (i.e., data, file, etc.) distributed in a P2P network is the remarkable process for resource sharing. The searching efficiency highly depends on the popularity of the target object. However, the popularity varies since peer joining or leaving a P2P network is very dynamic. Many researches aimed at finding a good searching scheme in such a variable environment with a better trade-off among long searching time, a large amount of duplicated query messages and a low successful search hit rate. In this paper, we propose a Cloning Random Walker assisted by Weakly Connected Dominating Set (CloneRW+WCDS) method to adaptively locate the target object in a P2P network. Our simulation results also depict that our proposed scheme can perform a better trade-off among the search delay, message overhead per hit and success rate while conducting resource searching in a P2P network.", "paper_title": "P2P resource searching with Cloning Random Walker assisted by Weakly Connected Dominating Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000334577000017"}
