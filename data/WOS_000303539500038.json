The reduction of EGFR-TK activity by small or medium-sized molecules has been proven to be an effective treatment for cancer. There is a widespread belief that Chinese medicinal herbs are active against several diseases, including various types of cancer. In this study, 29,960 compounds from the Chemiebase medicinal compound database were virtually screened against the EGFR-TK using AutoDock4.0, GOLD and GLIDE (XP). The results revealed eight potential hits: CAS nos. 104096-45-9, 112649-21-5, 113866-89-0, 142608-98-8, 142608-99-9, 144761-33-1, 155233-17-3 and 80510-05-0. These compounds have been reported to show anticancer activities in the literature. With the help of SiMMap and MOE interaction analysis, the protein-ligand interaction patterns between the functional groups of these compounds and the binding pocket residues were analyzed. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces are the main components of the interactions of these hits, similar to those observed for the known inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib and AEE. The physicochemical filter indicates that compounds CAS nos. 104096-45-9 and 144761-33-1 are likely to be potential leads in the drug discovery process.", "paper_title": "In silico screening of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the tyrosine kinase domain through a medicinal plant compound database", "paper_id": "WOS:000303539500038"}
