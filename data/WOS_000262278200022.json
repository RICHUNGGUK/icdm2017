How to formalize and verify the behavior of the grid service composition is therefore imperative. A novel process algebra, Cpi-calculus (Conditional Pi-calculus), is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the interactive behavior of composite grid services, we present a grid service composition signature. Based on the signature, we construct Interactive Behavior Model (IABM) for grid service composition and specify the interactive behavior using the Cpi-calculus. The case study shows that the mechanism for grid service specification and verification could be the algebraic foundation to be used afterwards in automatic and dynamic composition.
