Meanwhile, trust provides a new direction for access control in open network environments. Based on the dynamic nature of trust, we study the temporal and spatial characteristics in the security of society and propose the concept of scenario trust in which we consider four factors: access time, place, history behavior and risk control strategy. First, we apply fuzzy clustering method and information entropy theory to the design of an algorithm for allocating weights to the factors of scenario trust and, consequently, quantify scenario trust. Then, we introduce the notion of trust threshold for fine-grained access permission management and describe the rules that map scenario trust values to access permissions. On this basis, we propose a dynamic access control model based on scenario trust. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and can defend joint fraud. The model exhibits good scalability and can meet the need of dynamic access control in open network environments.", "paper_title": "An Access Control Method based on Scenario Trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000018"}
