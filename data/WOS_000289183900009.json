A traceability interface (traceability nc_functions) is defined for the new CNC programming standard ISO STEP-NC. CAM systems will be able to program monitoring and data access activities by inserting traceability nc_function calls in CNC programs. On the shop floor, controllers will automatically interpret these nc_functions to access process data while machining and will relate data records with the corresponding machining operations in a STEP-NC part program. With both types of information-process data and standard machining program (STEP-NC part program)-spread and technologically heterogeneous engineering systems will have full knowledge about what has happened in production. Traceability data access automation will assure data reliability. The paper describes a traceability scenario where standards such as MTConnect and ISA-95 support, rather than interfere with, the STEP-NC traceability proposal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
