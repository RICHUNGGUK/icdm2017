We provide also the template semantics for StateMachines as implemented in three UML CASE tools: Rational Rose RT, Rhapsody, and Bridgepoint. The result succinctly explicates (1) how each of the tools refines the standard's semantics and (2) which tools' semantics deviate from the standard.", "paper_title": "Semantic variations among UML StateMachines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700018"}
