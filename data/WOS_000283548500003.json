In this step, a fault model for diagnosing the observed response is selected. This step allows fault diagnosis to be performed based on a single fault model after identifying the most appropriate one. We describe a specific implementation of this preprocessing step based on what is referred to as the unique output response of a fault model. As an example, we apply it to the diagnosis of multiple stuck-at faults, selecting between single and double stuck-at faults as the fault model for diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate improvements compared to diagnosis based on single stuck-at faults, and compared to diagnosis based on both single and double stuck-at faults. We also discuss the use of a subset of double stuck-at faults for diagnosis, and the application of the proposed preprocessing step with other fault models.", "paper_title": "Selection of a Fault Model for Fault Diagnosis Based on Unique Responses", "paper_id": "WOS:000283548500003"}
