Material and Methods: Two measurements were performed by one investigator on the dry skull by using one digital caliper and in the axial cuts by using software. A 2D object-based image registration process was applied to determine the best affine transformation that maps a 2D input image (CBCT) in a reference image (MSCT). Results: The value of the intraclass correlation coefficient was approximately 0.9%. The results suggest that differences between two scanners did not exist (observation 1, p = 0.964 and observation 2, p = 0.795). With regard to the dry skull and the image, the significance probabilities equaled zero (observation 1, p = 0.002 and observation 2, p = 0.004), therefore, indicating significant differences. Conclusion: Measurements acquired in the images were similar and these findings contribute to stimulate the use of CBCT for evaluation of the maxillary expansion procedure.", "paper_title": "Image assessment of MSCT and CBCT scans for rapid maxillary expansion: a pilot study", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434500009"}
