In this paper, a new algorithm is developed for learning discriminative group-based dictionaries, where the inter-concept (category) visual correlations are leveraged to enhance both the reconstruction quality and the discrimination power of the group-based discriminative dictionaries. A visual concept network is first constructed for determining the groups of visually similar object classes and image concepts automatically. For each group of such visually similar object classes and image concepts, a group-based dictionary is learned for achieving discriminative image representation. A structural learning approach is developed to take advantage of our group-based discriminative dictionaries for classifier training and image classification. The effectiveness and the discrimination power of our group-based discriminative dictionaries have been evaluated on multiple popular visual benchmarks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
