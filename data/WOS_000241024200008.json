However, in so called STIT-logics, this is exactly the main operator: seeing to it that a certain condition is achieved. Here we present an extension of ATL, introducing ideas from STIT-theory, that can express that a group of agents A perform a certain strategy. As a demonstration of the applicability of the formalism, we show how it sheds new light on the problem of modelling 'uniform strategies' in epistemic versions of ATL.", "paper_title": "A STIT-extension of ATL", "paper_id": "WOS:000241024200008"}
