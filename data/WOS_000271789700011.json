This research investigates factors affecting e-government development. Based on the Growth Theory and Human Capital Theory from the economics literature, we hypothesize that Information and Computer Technology, and Human Development are two factors impacting e-government development. The hypotheses were empirically tested using secondary data from the United Nations and the United Nations Development Programme. The results support the two hypotheses. Further analysis was also carried out to compare countries with low, medium, and high human development levels.", "paper_title": "FACTORS IMPACTING E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000271789700011"}
