In the meantime, assessing the capabilities of the educational system for the successful introduction and implementation of e-learning programs - namely, e-learning readiness - is of paramount importance for the goals of the national higher education to be achieved. To serve the above purpose, this survey attempts to propose a proper framework for strengthening the existing capabilities and identifying possible deficits. As such, the first part of the paper elaborates on an appropriate model developed for assessing e-learning readiness of the Iranian higher education institutions based on comparative studies as well as the national experts' views. It is noteworthy that the proposed model has been objectively tailored in accordance with particular features and local characteristics of the country, and has eventually been applied and tested against real situation in one of the most prestigious national universities for complementary studies. Thus, it is assumed flexibly adaptable and safely advisable to be practically applied for assessing e-learning readiness in all of the universities country wide. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
