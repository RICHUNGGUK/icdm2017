In this paper, we consider another type of repetition, called pseudopower, inspired by the Watson-Crick complementarity property of DNA sequences. A DNA single strand can be viewed as a string over the four-letter alphabet {A, C, G, T}, wherein A is the complement of T, while C is the complement of G. Such a DNA single strand will bind to a reverse complement DNA single strand, called its Watson-Crick complement, to form a helical double-stranded DNA molecule. The Watson-Crick complement of a DNA strand is deducible from, and thus informationally equivalent to, the original strand. We use this fact to generalize the notion of the power of a word by relaxing the meaning of \"sameness\" to include the image through an antimorphic involution, the model of DNA Watson-Crick complementarity. Given a finite alphabet Sigma, an antimorphic involution is a function theta : Sigma* -> Sigma* which is an involution, i.e., theta(2) equals the identity, and an antimorphism, i.e., theta(uv) = theta(v)theta(u), for all u is an element of Sigma*. For a positive integer k, we call a word w a pseudo-kth-power with respect to theta if it can be written as w = u(1) ... u(k), where for 1 <= i, j <= k we have either u(i) = u(j) or u(i) = theta(u(j)). The classical kth-power of a word is a special case of a pseudo-kth-power, where all the repeating units are identical. We first classify the alphabets Sigma and the antimorphic involutions theta for which there exist arbitrarily long pseudo-kth-power-free words. Then we present efficient algorithms to test whether a finite word w is pseudo-kth-power-free.", "paper_title": "Pseudopower Avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000301293400003"}
