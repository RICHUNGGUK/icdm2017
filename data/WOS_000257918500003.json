We model an fMRI image as a spatial object with varying density, and measure the distance between two fMRl images using a novel fixed-radius, distribution-based Earth Mover's Distance that is computable in polynomial time. We also present two simplified formulations for the distance computation whose complexity is better than linear programming. The algorithms are robust in the presence of noise, and by varying the radius of the distance measures, can tolerate different degrees of within-class deformation. Empirical evaluation of the algorithms on a clataset of 430 IMRI images in a content-based image retrieval application demonstrates the power and robustness of the distance measures.
