Such mode switches can be smoothly done in software using a general purpose processor or a digital signal processor. However hardware cores only can cope with both throughput and power consumption constraints. Reconfigurable hardware platforms provided by FPGA devices offer partial reconfiguration at runtime. However they require too long reconfiguration times and they cannot satisfy mobile device power consumption requirements. In this article we propose a methodology to map selected groups of DSP tasks to multi-mode cores using conventional hardware technologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
