To improve this user experience, we propose Stroke+ +, a novel Chinese input method for touch screen mobile devices. More specifically, Stroke+ + provides efficient keypad layout, a friendly user interface and a intelligent character/phrase candidate set generation algorithms. Stroke+ + splits a Chinese character into multiple radicals. By leveraging hieroglyphic properties of Chinese characters, our method requires users to only input a subset of the radicals to identify the target character, making it much faster and easier to input Chinese on mobile phones. Our user study results show that Stroke+ + outperforms most major Chinese input methods on mobile devices, including Stroke, Pinyin and Hand Writing Recognition (HWR), in terms of the input efficiency and usability. Moreover, we also demonstrate that Stroke+ + offers a low entry barrier for Chinese-input novices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
