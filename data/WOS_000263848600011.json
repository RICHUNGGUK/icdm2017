We propose a new protocol called localized energy-efficient multicast algorithm (LEMA). By using a function to locally estimate file energy due to retransmissions. LEMA is able to deal with the inherent errors of WSN. This allows LEMA to find energy-efficient paths to multiple destinations. Our simulation results show that LEMA is able to outperform even well-known centralized heuristics Such as minimum incremental power (MIP) and shortest path tree (SPT) based on energy, while still achieving a high packet delivery ratio (PDR).
