P2P networks are usually divided into two types, structured and unstructured, based on their content discovery strategy. Unstructured networks use controlled flooding, while structured networks use distributed indexes. This article evaluates the performance of these two approaches over MANETs and proposes modifications to improve their performance. Results show that unstructured protocols are extremely resilient, however they are not scalable and present high energy consumption and delay. Structured protocols are more energy-efficient, however they have a poor performance in dynamic environments due to the frequent loss of query messages. Based on those observations, we employ selective forwarding to decrease the bandwidth consumption in unstructured networks, and introduce redundant query messages in structured P2P networks to increase their Success ratio.
