In this paper, a probabilistic tracking method is proposed to detect blood vessels in retinal images. During the tracking process, vessel edge points are detected iteratively using local grey level statistics and vessel's continuity properties. At a given step, a statistic sampling scheme is adopted to select a number of vessel edge points candidates in a local studying area. Local vessel's sectional intensity profiles are estimated by a Gaussian shaped curve. A Bayesian method with the Maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability criterion is then used to identify local vessel's structure and find out the edge points from these candidates. Evaluation is performed on both simulated vascular and real retinal images. Different geometric shapes and noise levels are used for computer simulated images, whereas real retinal images from the REVIEW database are tested. Evaluation performance is done using the Segmentation Matching Factor (SMF) as a quality parameter. Our approach performed better when comparing it with Sun's and Chaudhuri's methods. ROC curves are also plotted, showing effective detection of retinal blood vessels (true positive rate) with less false detection (false positive rate) than Sun's method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
