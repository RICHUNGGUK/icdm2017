We extend our multicast approach with spatial reuse from a currently single-channel RPR to WDM-upgraded multichannel RPR networks, where each node can transmit packets on all wavelengths and receive on one wavelength, and analyze their multicast capacity. Our analysis provides a convenient method for evaluating the multicast and reception capacities of WDM-upgraded RPR networks for a wide range of uniform unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic scenarios.
