Some of the existing interpolation schemes only require point data, whereas others, require higher order information, such as tangents or curvature values, in the data points. Since measured data usually lack this information, estimation of these quantities becomes necessary. Several tangent estimation methods for planar data points exist, usually yielding different results for the same given point data. The present paper thoroughly analyses some of these methods with respect to their approximation order. Among the considered methods are the classical schemes FMILL, Bessel, and Akima as well as a recently presented conic precision tangent estimator. The approximation order for each of the methods is theoretically derived by distinguishing purely convex point configurations and configurations with inflections. The approximation orders vary between one and four for the different methods. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
