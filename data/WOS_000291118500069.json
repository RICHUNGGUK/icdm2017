Successful trading operations should occur near the reversal points of price trends. Traditional technical analysis, which usually appears as various trading rules, does aim to look for peaks and bottoms of trends and is widely used in stock market. Unfortunately, it is not convenient to directly apply technical analysis since it depends on person's experience to select appropriate rules for individual share. In this paper, we enhance conventional technical analysis with Genetic Algorithms by learning trading rules from history for individual stock and then combine different rules together with Echo State Network to provide trading suggestions. Numerous experiments on S&P 500 components demonstrate that whether in bull or bear market, our system significantly outperforms buy-and-hold strategy. Especially in bear market where S&P 500 index declines a lot, our system still profits. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
