Key transceiver parameters, such as the maximum achievable transmission capacity and the digital-to-analog/analog-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) effects are explored thoroughly. It is shown that, similarly to conventional OFDM, the least complex and bandwidth efficient FOFDM can support up to similar to 20 Gb/s over 500 m worst-case multimode fiber (MMF) links having 3 dB effective bandwidths of similar to 200 MHz X km. For compensation of the DAC/ADC roll-off, a power-loading (PL) algorithm is adopted, leading to an FOFDM system improvement of similar to 4 dB. FOFDM and conventional OFDM give similar optimum DAC/ADC parameters over 500 m worst-case MMF, while over 50 km single-mode fiber a maximum deviation of only similar to 1 dB in clipping ratio is observed due to the imperfect chromatic dispersion compensation caused by one-tap equalizers.", "paper_title": "Extensive Comparisons of Optical Fast-OFDM and Conventional Optical OFDM for Local and Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310369200003"}
