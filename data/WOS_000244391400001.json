In this paper, some simple, low cost error control techniques for ARQ protocols used with binary unidirectional channels are described. The proposed schemes can correct up to [t/2] unidirectional errors using t-unidirectional error detecting codes and code combining with a much smaller number of retransmissions. First, we show how to do code combining for unidirectional errors. To use code combining with unidirectional codes, we need to identify the type of error (0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0) from the received word. We show how this can be done for various unidirectional codes.", "paper_title": "ARQ protocols and unidirectional codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244391400001"}
