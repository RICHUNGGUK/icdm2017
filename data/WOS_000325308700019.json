This scheme can achieve the security goal of protecting data and prevent the adversary from snooping the encrypted data or the user's private key. However, our analyses show that their scheme is still incorrect and has a deadlock problem, because the user cannot carry out the encryption process as expected because it is required for the user to own the key authentication center's private information which is designed to be secret to users. A solution to the deadlock problem is given and an improved scheme is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
