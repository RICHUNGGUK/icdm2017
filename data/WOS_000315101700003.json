Since sensor nodes are battery powered and placed outdoor, there will be failures due to energy exhaustion or environmental influence, resulting in coverage-loss. In literature, a number of studies developed robot repairing algorithms that aim at maintaining full coverage. However, they did not consider the time constraint for network maintenance. Furthermore, they did not consider the existence of obstacles and the constraint of limited energy of the robot. This paper presents a novel tracking mechanism and robot repairing algorithm for maintaining the coverage quality of the given WSN. Without support of location information, the tracking mechanism leaves robot's footmark on sensors so that they can learn better routes for sending repairing requests to the robot. Upon receiving several repairing request messages, the robot applies the proposed repairing algorithm to establish an efficient route that passes through all failure regions with low overhead in terms of the required time and the power consumption. In addition, the proposed repairing algorithm also considers the remaining energy of the robot so that the robot can move back to home for recharging energy and overcome the unpredicted obstacles. Performance results reveal that the developed protocol can efficiently maintain the coverage quality while the required time and energy consumption are significantly reduced.
