We define computational and statistical relaxations of the existing notion of perfect consistency, show that the scheme of Boneh et al. (Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2004, ed. by C. Cachin, J. Camenisch, pp. 506-522, 2004) is computationally consistent, and provide a new scheme that is statistically consistent. We also provide a transform of an anonymous identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme to a secure PEKS scheme that, unlike the previous one, guarantees consistency. Finally, we suggest three extensions of the basic notions considered here, namely anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption, public-key encryption with temporary keyword search, and identity-based encryption with keyword search.", "paper_title": "Searchable encryption revisited: Consistency properties, relation to anonymous IBE, and extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000254259600002"}
