This article describes functions that allow the exploration and inspection of the grobs and viewports in a grid scene, including several functions that are available in a new package called gridDebug. The ability to explore the grobs and viewports in a grid scene is useful for adding more drawing to a scene that was produced using grid and for understanding and debugging the grid code that produced a scene.", "paper_title": "Debugging grid Graphics", "paper_id": "WOS:000313198000004"}
