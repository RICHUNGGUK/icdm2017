In this paper, we first propose a kind of media delivery network and particularly introduce its system design and implementation. Then, we develop a novel dynamic model to characterize the behaviors of MDN systems. States of the dynamic model are defined and used to describe the interaction among the Peer-Nodes (PNs) in systems. Based on this model, some important policies, such as peer selection policy and bandwidth allocation policy, are clearly proposed. We improve these policies and call them state-based policies. Finally, to verify the validity and reasonability of the model, some experiments are designed to compare the general policies with the state-based policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
