For the time-variant BCNs, a necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability is given, and a control design algorithm is presented. For a BCN with finite memories, an equivalent transformation to a time-variant BON is constructed. Then a necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability and a control design algorithm are obtained.", "paper_title": "Controllability of time-variant Boolean control networks and its application to Boolean control networks with finite memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500021"}
