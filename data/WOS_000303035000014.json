A two-sided nonparametric Phase II exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart, based on the exceedance statistics (EWMA-EX), is proposed for detecting a shift in the location parameter of a continuous distribution. The nonparametric EWMA chart combines the advantages of a nonparametric control chart (known and robust in-control performance) with the better shift detection properties of an EWMA chart. Guidance and recommendations are provided for practical implementation of the chart along with illustrative examples. A performance comparison is made with the traditional (normal theory) EWMA chart for subgroup averages and a recently proposed nonparametric EWMA chart based on the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistics. A summary and some concluding remarks are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
