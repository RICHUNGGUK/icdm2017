In a previous study we used an HMM to identify similar data patterns from the historical data and then used a weighted average to generate a 'one-day-ahead' forecast. This paper uses a similar approach to identify data patterns by using the HMM and then uses fuzzy logic to obtain a forecast Value. The HMM's log-likelihood for each of the input data vectors is used to partition the dataspace. Each of the divided dataspaces is then used to generate a fuzzy rule. The fuzzy model developed from this approach is tested on stock market data drawn from different sectors. Experimental results clearly show an improved forecasting accuracy compared to other forecasting models such as, ARIMA, artificial neural network (ANN) and another HMM-based forecasting model.
