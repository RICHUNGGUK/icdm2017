The approach taken here is based on nonparametric scoring and ROC curve optimization in the sense of the AUC criterion. In this problem, aggregation is used to increase the performance of scoring rules produced by ranking trees, as those developed in Clemencon and Vayatis (2009c). The present work describes the principles for building median scoring rules based on concepts from rank aggregation. Consistency results are derived for these aggregated scoring rules and an algorithm called RANKING FOREST is presented. Furthermore, various strategies for feature randomization are explored through a series of numerical experiments on artificial data sets.", "paper_title": "Ranking Forests", "paper_id": "WOS:000314530200002"}
