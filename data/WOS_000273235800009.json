Our structure, called SkipTree, is fully decentralized with each node being connected to O(log n) other nodes. We propose modifications to the structures, so that the memory usage for maintaining the link structure at each node is reduced from the worst case of O(n) to O(log n log log n) on the average and O(log(2)n) in the worst case. It is also shown that the load balancing is guaranteed to be within a constant factor. Our experimental results verify our theoretical proofs. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
