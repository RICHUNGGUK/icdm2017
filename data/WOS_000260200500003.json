We give an analytical basis and the mathematical details regarding the model, and we test the flexibility of the proposed modeling approach with real traffic traces related to common Internet services with strong differences in terms of both applications/users and protocol behavior: SMTP, HTTP, a network game, and an instant messaging platform. The presented experimental analysis shows that, even maintaining a simple structure, the model is able to achieve good results in terms of estimation of statistical parameters and synthetic series generation, taking into account marginal distributions, mutual, and temporal dependencies. Moreover we show how, by exploiting such temporal dependencies, the model is able to perform short-term prediction by observing traffic from real sources. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
