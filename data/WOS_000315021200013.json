However, the packet delivery rate is generally low in existing VANET broadcast routing protocols. Therefore, the design of an appropriate broadcast protocol based on the features of VANET has become a crucial part of the development of VANET. This paper analyzes the disadvantage of existing broadcast routing protocols in VANETs, and proposes an improved algorithm (namely ODAM-C) based on the ODAM (Optimized Dissemination of Alarm Messages) protocol. The ODAM-C algorithm improves the packet delivery rate by two mechanisms based on the forwarding features of ODAM. The first distance-based mechanism reduces the possibility of packet loss by considering the angles between source nodes, forwarding nodes and receiving nodes. The second mechanism increases the redundancy of forwarding nodes to guarantee the packet success delivery ratio. We show by analysis and simulations that the proposed algorithm can improve packet delivery rate for vehicular networks compared against two widely-used existing protocols.", "paper_title": "An Optimal ODAM-Based Broadcast Algorithm for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315021200013"}
