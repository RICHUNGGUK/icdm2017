Here, three major improvements are made to OWO-HWO. First, a desired net function is derived. Second, using the classical mean square error, a weighted hidden layer error function is derived which de-emphasizes net function errors that correspond to saturated activation function values. Third, an adaptive learning factor based on the local shape of the error surface is used in hidden layer training. Faster learning convergence is experimentally verified, using three training data sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
