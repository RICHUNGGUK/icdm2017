Intelligently discovering how these Web resources are related in order to enable effective Web surfing is a current challenge in Internet development. The XML Link Language (XLink), which is a W3C recommendation for describing the relationships among Web resources, is a potential solution to this problem. However, XLink is still short of knowledge representation in handling computer-interpretable effects, such as dynamic link generations. This study attempts to integrate knowledge into XLink by defining a multi-layered semantic framework. The proposed framework is across four layers of the semantic Web stack, including the URI layer, XML (XLink) layer, ontology layer and rule layer, to facilitate machine understanding. The ontology, which is based on description logics, provides sound reasoning, while the rule is a logic program built on top of an ontology to support complementary inference capabilities. Based on the multi-layered semantic framework, an intelligent XLink shell, called XLinker, is also developed to facilitate three semantic approaches of linking associations, i.e. XLink-based metadata, ontology-based reasoning and rule-based inference. To demonstrate the feasibility of XLinker, an XLink Transcoding Web Server is also implemented to reveal smart hyperlink generation for Web navigations.
