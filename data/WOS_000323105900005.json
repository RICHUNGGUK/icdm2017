Previously, it was an open question whether this problem on sensors with arbitrary sensing ranges is solvable in polynomial time. We settle this open question positively by giving an time algorithm. For the special case when all sensors have the same-size sensing range, the previously best solution takes time. We present an time algorithm for this case; further, if all sensors are initially located on the coverage segment, our algorithm takes time. Also, we extend our techniques to the cycle version of the problem where the barrier coverage is for a simple cycle and the sensors are allowed to move only along the cycle. For sensors with the same-size sensing range, we solve the cycle version in time, improving the previously best time solution.", "paper_title": "Algorithms on Minimizing the Maximum Sensor Movement for Barrier Coverage of a Linear Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000323105900005"}
