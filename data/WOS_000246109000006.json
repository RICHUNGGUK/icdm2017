Wavelength conversion technology and wavelength converters play an important role in enhancing fiber utilization and in reducing the overall call blocking probability of the network. In this paper, we develop a new analytical model to calculate the average blocking probability in multifiber link networks using limited-range wavelength conversion. Based on the results obtained, we conclude that the proposed analytical model is simple and yet can effectively analyze the impact of wavelength conversion ranges and number of fibers on network performance. Also a new heuristic approach for placement of wavelength converters to reduce blocking probabilities is explored. Finally, we analyze network performance with the proposed scheme. It can be observed from numerical simulations that limited-range converters placed at a few nodes can provide almost the same blocking probability as full range wavelength converters placed at all the nodes. We also show that being equipped with a multifiber per-link has the same effect as being equipped with the capability of limited-range wavelength conversion. So a multi-fiber per-link network using limited-range wavelength conversion has similar blocking performance as a full wavelength convertible network.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of multi-fiber WDM network with limited-range wavelength conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000246109000006"}
