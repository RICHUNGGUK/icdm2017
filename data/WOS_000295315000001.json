The power of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to generate an encoding of the full lambda calculus in the pi-calculus. The encoding is proved to preserve and reflect beta reduction, and is shown to be fully abstract with respect to Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity.", "paper_title": "The lambda-calculus in the pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000295315000001"}
