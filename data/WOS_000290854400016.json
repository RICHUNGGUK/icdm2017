There are numerous methods that limit the impact of both factors, such as expanding the use of renewable energy or participating in automated demand-response programs. To take advantage of these methods, servers and applications must gracefully handle intermittent constraints in their power supply. In this paper, we propose blinking-metered transitions between a high-power active state and a low-power inactive state-as the primary abstraction for conforming to intermittent power constraints. We design Blink, an application-independent hardware-software platform for developing and evaluating blinking applications, and define multiple types of blinking policies. We then use Blink to design BlinkCache, a blinking version of memcached, to demonstrate the effect of blinking on an example application. Our results show that a load-proportional blinking policy combines the advantages of both activation and synchronous blinking for realistic Zipf-like popularity distributions and wind/solar power signals by achieving near optimal hit rates (within 15% of an activation policy), while also providing fairer access to the cache (within 2% of a synchronous policy) for equally popular objects.", "paper_title": "Blink: Managing Server Clusters on Intermittent Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000290854400016"}
