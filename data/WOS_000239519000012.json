By making use of ontologies, improved user interaction with personal information management system is possible for these people. An ontology using semantic web technology is proposed which formally describes the mapping information about user's impairments, and the available interface characteristics. Effort is made to enhance accessibility at a generic level by making it possible to enrich the ontology for a diverse range of users. Consequently users with all types of special needs are able to get already customized interfaces. Especially, the possible adaptation to our prototype Personal Information Management System SemanticLIFE [1] is the trigger for this investigation.", "paper_title": "Towards the use of ontologies for improving user interaction for people with special needs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000012"}
