Comparing the weight distribution obtained using this method with that using another scheme demonstrates that the former is effective and accurate for estimating the weight distribution P(w) of coupled oscillator networks in a broad coupling strength region. This method enables the topological properties of underlying networks to be determined from only a time series of measurements because it depends on no prior information about the dynamical system. In addition, the method is rather robust against noise.", "paper_title": "ESTIMATING WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IN COUPLED OSCILLATOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088500008"}
