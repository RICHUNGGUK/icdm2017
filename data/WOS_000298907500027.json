The street lighting system is composed by an urban network, where delivery rate (with priority related to other aspects), latency, energy efficiency, and fault tolerance are the non-functional requirements. Based on these requirements, this work presents a new network routing mechanism with acknowledgment, named GGPSR. The main purpose is to provide new means to reach high delivery rates in urban networks, with tolerated end-to-end delay values for this type of network. The mechanism consists of selecting nodes from neighbors others than the previously selected in order to find a path towards the destination. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm fulfills the mentioned requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
