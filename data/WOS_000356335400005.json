Further, the convergence times of chaos control and chaos synchronization are shorten about 18.03-29.56 and 40.19-43.65 % that are compare with full states control, respectively. The system reduces the number of controllers, so it can cost down of the control system. The single-state controller and two states controllers are presented in the simulation results to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our new design rule.", "paper_title": "Reduced Fuzzy Controllers for Lorenz-Stenflo System Control and Synchronization", "paper_id": "WOS:000356335400005"}
