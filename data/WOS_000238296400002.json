We show a Kleene theorem for existentially bounded communicating automata, namely the equivalence between communicating automata, globally cooperative compositional message sequence graphs, and monadic second order logic. Our characterization extends results for universally bounded models, where for each and every possible scheduling of communication events, the number of messages in transit is uniformly bounded. As a consequence, we give solutions in spirit of Madhusudan (2001) for various model checking problems on networks of communicating automata that satisfy our optimistic restriction.
