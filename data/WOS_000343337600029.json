First, multivariate time series are modeled by using gamma echo state network (gamma ESN). Then, by using squared root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF), we update parameters of gamma ESN and predict future observations online. Furthermore, we add a robust outlier detection algorithm to SCKF to protect SCKF-gamma ESN from divergence caused by outliers. Finally, two numerical examples, by using a multivariate benchmark dataset and a real-world dataset, are conducted to substantiate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed SCKF-gamma ESN.
