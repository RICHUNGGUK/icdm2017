We outline our approach of design for emergence: to provide just enough of a game context and challenge for people to be creative, to extend and enrich the experience of play through their interaction in the real world. CitiTag is our mixed reality testbed, a wireless location-based multiplayer game based on the concept of playground 'tag'. We describe the design and implementation of CitiTag and discuss results from two user studies.", "paper_title": "Design for emergence: experiments with a mixed reality urban playground game", "paper_id": "WOS:000246339500005"}
