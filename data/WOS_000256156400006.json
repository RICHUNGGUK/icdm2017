Diode and jumper insertions are the most effective techniques to fix the antenna effect. However, due to the increasing design complexity and the limited routing resource, applying diode or jumper insertion alone cannot achieve a high antenna fixing rate. In this paper, we give a polynomial-time antenna violation detection/fixing algorithm by simultaneous diode and jumper insertion with minimum cost, which is based on a minimum-cost network-flow formulation. Experimental. results show that our algorithm consistently achieves much higher antenna fixing rates than the state-of-the-art jumper and diode insertion algorithms alone.", "paper_title": "An optimal network-flow-based simultaneous diode and jumper insertion algorithm for antenna fixing", "paper_id": "WOS:000256156400006"}
