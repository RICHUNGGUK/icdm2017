[Drawing curves onto a cloud of points for point-based modelling. Computer-Aided Design 2005; 37(1): 109-22]. The new method operates directly on the point cloud without any explicit or implicit surface reconstruction procedure. The presented method uses a simple, robust, and efficient algorithm: least-squares projection (LSP), which projects points onto the point cloud in a least-squares sense without any specification of the projection vector. The main contribution of this novel method is the automatic computation of the projection vector. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a number of application examples including thinning a point cloud, point normal estimation, projecting curves onto a point cloud and others.
