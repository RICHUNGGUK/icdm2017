We propose an energy of infinitesimal deformations of continuous 1- and 2-dimensional shapes that is based on the elastic energy of deformed objects. This energy defines a shape metric which is inherently invariant with respect to Euclidean transformations and yields very natural deformations which preserve details. We compute shortest paths between planar shapes based on elastic deformations and apply our approach to the modeling of 2-dimensional shapes.", "paper_title": "Shape Metrics Based on Elastic Deformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000267340900006"}
