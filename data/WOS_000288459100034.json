The proposed family is constructed by the addition of cyclic shifts of an M-ary Sidel'nikov sequence and its reverse sequence. The number of sequences contained in this family is about (M - 1)(2) times of their period and the maximum magnitude of their correlation values is upper bounded by 4 root p(n) + 5.", "paper_title": "A Construction of a New Family of M-ary Sequences With Low Correlation From Sidel'nikov Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100034"}
