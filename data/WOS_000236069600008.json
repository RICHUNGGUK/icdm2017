Based on a dual-and-configurable-multiplier structure, our proposed method devises a multiplication instruction set for low-power ASIPs. Our method exploits the execution sequences of multiplication instructions and effective bit widths of variables to reduce power consumed by redundant multiplication bits while minimizing the multiplication execution time. Experimental results on a set of DSP programs demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant power reduction (up to 18.53%) and execution time improvement (up to 10.43%) with 18% area overhead.", "paper_title": "A power-driven multiplication instruction-set design method for ASIPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000236069600008"}
