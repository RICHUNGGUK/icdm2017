Individual companies may specify their process models in Petri nets and exchange the Petri nets with other companies in PNML This paper aims to demonstrate the capabilities of PNML in the development of applications instead of an industrial interchange format only. In this paper, we apply PNML to develop context-aware workflow systems. In existing literature, different methodologies for the design of context-aware systems have been proposed. However, workflow models have not been considered in these methodologies. Our interests in this paper are to propose a methodology to automatically generate context-aware action lists for users and effectively control resource allocation based on the state of the workflow systems. To achieve these objectives, we first propose Petri net models to describe the workflows. Next, we propose models to capture resource activities. Finally, the interactions between workflows and resources are combined to obtain a model for the whole processes. Based on the combined model, we propose architecture to automatically generate context-aware graphical user interface to guide the users and control resource allocation in workflow systems. We demonstrate our design methodology using a health care example. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
