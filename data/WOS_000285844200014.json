We note that this method also allows a new type of two-pattern scan-based tests to be applied. We refer to these tests as fixed-state tests. These tests have several properties that make them effective as complements to skewed-load and broadside tests, and also allows them to be computed efficiently. We discuss these properties in the context of transition faults. We describe procedures for selecting the constant vector for the state inputs during a scan operation, and for generating fixed-state tests. We present experimental results to demonstrate the transition fault coverage improvements possible with these tests.", "paper_title": "Fixed-State Tests for Delay Faults in Scan Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844200014"}
