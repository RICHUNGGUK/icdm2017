We consider two approaches for ordering heuristics. The first approach is solution-focused and is inspired by adversarial search: on existential variables we prefer values that maximise the chances of leading to a solution, while on universal variables we prefer values that minimise those chances. The second approach is verification-focused, where we prefer values that are easier to verify whether or not they lead to a solution. In particular, we give instantiations of this approach using QCSP-Solve's pure-value rule Gent et al. (QCSP-solve: A solver for quantified constraint satisfaction problems. In Proceedings of IJCAI, pp. 138-143, 2005). We show that on dense 3-block problems, using QCSP-Solve, the solution-focused adversarial heuristics are up to 50% faster than lexicographic ordering, while on sparse loose interleaved problems, the verification-focused pure-value heuristics are up to 50% faster. Both types are up to 50% faster on dense interleaved problems, with one pure-value heuristic approaching an order of magnitude improvement.", "paper_title": "Value ordering for quantified CSPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262544100003"}
