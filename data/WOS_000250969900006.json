In this paper, a novel scheme of implementing high-speed high-probability-resolution digital AWGN generator is proposed based on a derived universal algorithm for any white f(x)-distributed noise generation. The precision and the hardware complexity of the proposed AWGN generator are discussed in detail. Implemented with FPGA, the presented AWGN generator is utilized to test a high- speed UWB communication system and performs well with excellent precision in noise probability distribution. The proposed novel scheme of implementing digital noise generators is important and helpful in building communication channel emulators to test and verify communication systems.", "paper_title": "A novel scheme of implementing high-speed high-probability-resolution digital awgn generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000250969900006"}
