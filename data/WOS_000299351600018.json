Docking to an ensemble of protein structures has proven its utility for docking, but using a large ensemble of structures can reduce the efficiency of docking and can increase the number of false positives in virtual screening. In this paper, we describe the application of our new methodology, Limoc, to generate an ensemble of holo-like protein structures in combination with the relaxed complex scheme (RCS), to virtual screening. We describe different schemes to reduce the ensemble of protein structures to increase efficiency and enrichment quality. Utilizing experimental knowledge about actives for a target protein allows the reduction of ensemble members to a minimum of three protein structures, increasing enrichment quality and efficiency simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Utilizing Experimental Data for Reducing Ensemble Size in Flexible-Protein Docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000299351600018"}
