It brings us great convenience, but the current RFID system lack the efficient enforcement on security and privacy. In supply chains applications, an item attached with a tag may change or share the ownership during the transport process. For example, an item can be identified by its previous owner and the carrier before it goes to the new owner. The carrier's right is temporary and must be shared with the owner. Once the item goes to the new owner, both the previous owner and the carrier's right must be transferred to the new owner. In this article, we focus on the ownership sharing problem and propose a novel scheme to support it. To beat the target, A Trusted Device Issuer (TDI) who issue tags and trusted readers is employed in our approach.", "paper_title": "Temporary Ownership Sharing in RFID Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900018"}
