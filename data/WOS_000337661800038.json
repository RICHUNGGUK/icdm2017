Various studies in this field have been conducted. However, they are either too rigid or too fragile to efficiently utilize such information. In this paper, we propose to model the distribution of objects' local appearance patterns by using their co-occurrence at different spatial locations. In order to represent such a distribution, we propose a flexible framework called spatial feature co-pooling, with which the relations between patterns are discovered. As the final representation resulted from our framework is of high dimensionality, we propose a semi-greedy (SG) grafting algorithm to select the most discriminative features. Experimental results on the CIFAR 10, UIUC Sports and VOC 2007 datasets show that our method is effective and comparable with the state-of-art algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
