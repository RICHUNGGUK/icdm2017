This concept is of interest because k is a constant for all but a few of the current benchmark domains in planning, and is known to have implications for tractability. In this paper, we present an algorithm for solving planning problems in P(k), the class of k-dependent planning problems with binary variables and polytree causal graphs. We prove that our algorithm runs in polynomial time when k is a fixed constant. If, in addition, the causal graph has bounded depth, we show that plan generation is linear in the size of the input. Although these contributions are theoretical due to the limited scope of the class P(k), suitable reductions from more complex planning problems to P(k) could potentially give rise to fast domain-independent heuristics.
