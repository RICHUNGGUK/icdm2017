However, in real-world lots of information systems are based on dominance relation in stead of the classical equivalence relation because of various factors. The ordering properties of attributes play a crucial role in those systems. To acquire brief decision rules from the systems, attribute reductions are needed. This paper deals with attribute reduction in ordered information systems based on evidence theory. The concepts of plausibility and belief consistent sets as well as plausibility and belief reducts in ordered information systems are introduced. It is proved that a plausibility consistent set must be a consistent set and an attribute set is a belief reduct if and only if it is a classical reduction in ordered information system.", "paper_title": "Attribute reduction in ordered information systems based on evidence theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000282514300008"}
