First, we shortly describe the currently available acquisition systems and databases of iris images, which were used for our tests. Next, we concentrate on the feature extraction and coding with the execution time analysis. Results of the average execution time of loading the image, segmentation, normalization, and feature encoding, are presented. Finally, DET plots illustrate the recognition accuracy for IrisBath database.", "paper_title": "Selection of parameters in iris recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000329243600012"}
