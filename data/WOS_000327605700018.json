They are intended for the estimation of linearity requirements for circuit blocks typically found in the error signal paths of envelope feedback amplifiers in the context of computer-aided design and test of Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) PAs. A system of nonlinear equations for computing IMD levels is derived and an algorithm is given in the Appendix. They facilitate implementation within a computer-aided IMD test setup based on the methodology presented in the earlier paper.", "paper_title": "Formulations for the Estimation of IMD Levels in an Envelope Feedback RFIC Amplifier: An Extension to Dynamic AM and PM Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000327605700018"}
