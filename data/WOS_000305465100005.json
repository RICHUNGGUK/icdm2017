Existing services must be replaced with new services without impairing operations. The problem of scheduling such replacement is of critical importance for the success of the operation. We analyze this problem from a quantitative point of view, underlining the trade-off nature of its solutions. We formalize this multiobjective optimization problem as a mathematical programming formulation. We discuss its theoretical properties and show that real-world instances can be solved by standard off-the-shelf tools.", "paper_title": "Technological architecture evolutions of information systems: Trade-off and optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305465100005"}
