The model is applied to typical concrete in various loading conditions. The model's parameters are determined from conventional triaxial tests. The comparison between experimental data and numerical simulations shows the performance of the model in predicting basic mechanical behaviour of concrete for a large range of stress. In the second part, an extension of the model is proposed by including a non-local damage formulation. The extended model is applied to the analysis of failure process zone in concrete related to material softening behaviour. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
