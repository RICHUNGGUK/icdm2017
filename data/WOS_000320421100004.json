First, the system structure based on cloud computing is designed. Then, to meet the requirements of the practical hoisting, the complex hoisting algorithms based on cloud computing are put forward, which involve collision detection, hoisting path planning, and so on. Finally, web publishing and complex computing in the background are realized by employing Browse/Server (B/S) structure and software Hadoop. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the real-time calculation in the complex algorithms and achieve a smooth process of simulation.", "paper_title": "A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION SYSTEM FOR TRUCK CRANE HOISTING BASED ON CLOUD COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100004"}
