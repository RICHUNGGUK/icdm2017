For this purpose, we proposed a computational model of the cognitive processing in the brain of multi-scale perception, which incorporates two different roles of high- and low-spatial scales in face recognition. This model was based on the multi-scale correspondence between the sizes of the filters and images in the Gabor pyramid. Multi-scale correspondence with relatively small Gabor kernels demonstrated that the scale similarity curves were qualitatively consistent with the gain functions for spatial frequency in the Gaussian filters. Locally high-scale similarities for both the low- and the high-pass filtered images indicated that the face in the HI was misrecognized as the face in the counterpart filtered image. Smaller-scale similarity differences with greater spatial frequency overlap of the low- and high-pass filters of the HI demonstrated that human observers fail to employ appropriate combinations of high- and low-scale representations to distinguish extremely similar faces. The larger Gabor kernels suggested that human observers fail to identify the face in the HI at the low resolution.", "paper_title": "The Cognitive Mechanisms of Multi-scale Perception for the Recognition of Extremely Similar Faces", "paper_id": "WOS:000360995300001"}
