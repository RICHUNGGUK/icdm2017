Two semantics for DTGs are presented and motivated. We consider timed versions of CTL where subscripts put quantitative constraints on the time it takes before a property is satisfied. We exhibit an important gap between logics where subscripts of the form \"= c\" (exact duration) are allowed, and simpler logics that only allow subscripts of the form \"<= c\" or \">= c\" (bounded duration). Without exact durations, model checking can be done in polynomial time, but with exact durations, it becomes Delta(p)(2)-complete or PSPACE-complete depending on the considered semantics.
