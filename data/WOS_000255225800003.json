This work presents a new shear stress function in the form of the exponential function, to predict the mechanical behaviour of multi-layered laminated composite structures. As a case study, the mechanical behaviour of a laminated composite beam (90 degrees/0 degrees/0 degrees/90 degrees) is examined. The results are compared with the model \"Sinus\" and 2D finite element method studied. Results show that this new model is more precise than older ones as compared to the results obtained by the finite element analysis [Abaqus]. To introduce continuity on the interfaces of each layer, the kinematics defined by Ossadzow is used with the new exponential model. The equilibrium equations and natural boundary conditions are derived by the principle of virtual power. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
