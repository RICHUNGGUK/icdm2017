These systems are evolve in the continuous-time space against a wide class of parametric uncertain ties which belong to a convex bounded polytopic domain. The objective is to device tractable synthesis conditions for the robust feedback design. Two design Methods are established: the first uses bounds on the delay pattern and the second utilizes instantaneous delay measurements. All the developed results are cast in the format of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and numerical examples are presented.", "paper_title": "ROBUST H(2) OUTPUT FEEDBACK CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800015"}
