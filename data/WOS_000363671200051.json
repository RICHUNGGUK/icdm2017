In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning and packing of 3D models under the multi-phase level set framework. We first construct analysis tools to evaluate the qualities of a partitioning using six metrics: stress load, surface details, interface area, packed size, printability, and assembling. Based on this analysis, we then formulate level set methods to improve the qualities of the partitioning according to the metrics. These methods are integrated into an automatic system, which repetitively and locally optimizes the partitioning. Given the optimized partitioning result, we further provide a container structure modeling algorithm to facilitate the packing process of the printed pieces. Our experiment shows that the system can generate quality partitioning of various 3D models for space saving and fast production purposes.", "paper_title": "Level-Set-Based Partitioning and Packing Optimization of a Printable Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200051"}
