Moreover, for achieving readily implementable design solutions, it is highly important to consider interactions in structural and material behavior (e.g., thermo-elastic mismatches) together with thermo-mechanical and manufacturing aspects simultaneously. For the latter, response surface approximations are utilized which are also based on quantification of qualitative knowledge via fuzzy set rules. From a series of practical applications solved by Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms general conclusions for hybrid material component optimization and design are derived.", "paper_title": "Design optimization of hybrid material structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000257332600007"}
