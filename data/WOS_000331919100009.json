With the non-smooth mapping functions from Calhoun et al. (2008), we can tackle many astrophysieal problems which were out of scope with the standard grids in numerical astrophysics. We describe the difficulties occurring when implementing curvilinear coordinates into our WENO code, and how we overcome them. We illustrate the theoretical results with numerical data. The WENO finite difference scheme works only for high Mach number flows and smooth mapping functions, whereas the finite volume scheme gives accurate results even for low Mach number flows and on non-smooth grids.
