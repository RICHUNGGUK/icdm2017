The DSF method, which involves two stages, first reduces the dimension of the document vector space by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and then applies a Robust linear Discriminant analysis Model (RDM), which improves the classical LDA by a energy-adaptive regularization criteria, to extract the discriminative semantic feature with enhanced discrimination power. As a result, DSF method can not only uncover latent semantic structure but also capture the discriminative feature. Comparative experiments on various state-of-art dimension reduction schemes such as our DSF, LSI, orthogonal centroid, two-stage LSI+LDA, LDA/QR and LDA/GSVD, are also performed. Experiments using the Reuters-21578 text collection show the proposed method performs better than other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Robust discriminant analysis of latent semantic feature for text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000046"}
