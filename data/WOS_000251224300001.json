I demonstrate the feasibility of i-HON by proposing a single wavelength optical header encoder and self-routing binary-encoded optical header address processing. I then develop dynamic hybrid routing heuristics and adapt these to the novel dynamic reconfiguration and routing algorithms suited for asynchronous bufferless optical networks that incorporate optical routing logic. I compare the performance of the presented algorithms. I use simulation results to show that i-HON provides overall system throughput performance improvements of up to 40% with similar to 50% reduction in network latency.
