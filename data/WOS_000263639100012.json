While nature and computer vision have explored a wide range of imaging techniques, wearables have mostly viewed the world through conventional narrow-view passive cameras designed for nonwearable applications, which are attached to the wearer's head. The rationale presented here for sensor selection and the novel methodology developed for objectively studying sensor placement have informed the development of a number of visual wearables.", "paper_title": "On the Choice and Placement of Wearable Vision Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000263639100012"}
