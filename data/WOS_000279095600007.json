In this new model structure, different noise levels of process variables have been considered. Afterward, the developed mixture factor analysis model is utilized for process monitoring. To enhance the monitoring performance, a soft combination strategy is then proposed to integrate different local monitoring results into a single monitoring chart, which is based on the Bayesian inference method. To test the modeling and monitoring performance of the proposed mixture factor analysis method, a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark case studies are provided.
