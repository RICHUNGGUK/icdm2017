In this article, the authors present two recently developed vision-based methods to estimate the heading angle of the vehicle. The authors propose a real-time guidance application based on edge and color information using an omnidirectional image. First, line segments were extracted. Second, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) curve fitting method was implemented. Third, the set of intersection points for each pair of curves was extracted. Finally, by implementing the Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms, the heading angle was computed. The main contribution of this work is in the evaluation of the methods applied, which included the \"edge-based extraction in road scenes\" method, which uses the spatial density information around the vehicle (curbs, barrier, gutters, side strip areas), and the \"edge-based lane marking segmentation.\" Both of these methods were evaluated in terms of the performance assessment of the length of the line segments in relation to the heading angle measurement. In that sense, the experiments were conducted for the purpose of testing the processing time and the number of extracted line segments. The preliminary results were gathered and tested on a group of consecutive frames to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Vehicle Control Systems Based on Multiple Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000351767400008"}
