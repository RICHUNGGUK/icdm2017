Numerical results indicate that these analytical solutions can provide accurate estimation of bit error rate and outage probability in large signal-to-noise ratio regimes. The analytical results reveal some important insights into the performance characteristics of equal gain combining and selection combining diversity operating over equally correlated Rician fading channels.
