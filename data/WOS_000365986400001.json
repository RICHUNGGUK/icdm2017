Our contribution presents the state of the art of distance-based methods employed in economic geography and which are also used in ecology. Topographic functions such as Ripley's K, absolute functions such as Duranton and Overman's K-d and relative functions such as Marcon and Puech's M are implemented. Their confidence envelopes (including global ones) and tests against counterfactuals are included in the package.", "paper_title": "Tools to Characterize Point Patterns: dbmss for R", "paper_id": "WOS:000365986400001"}
