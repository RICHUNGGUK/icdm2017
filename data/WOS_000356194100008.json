Based on this property, given two meshes with different connectivities, one can use coupled quasi-harmonic technique to transfer the pose of one mesh onto the other by exchanging the low-frequency coefficients in their spectral representations. However, directly synthesizing the new low frequencies with old high frequencies usually exhibits two vital artifacts: one is detail shearing and shape collapsing, and the other is medium-scale pose missing. This paper reformulates the pose transfer as a deformation problem with low-frequency coefficients as handles. It finally leads to a non-linear optimization with the coefficients as data constraint and Laplacian coordinates as regularity term for preserving details. Meanwhile, a hierarchical pose transfer framework is introduced to capture the medium-frequency poses. To reduce the computation complexity and enhance the stability we further solve the problem in a subspace defined by mean-value coordinates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
