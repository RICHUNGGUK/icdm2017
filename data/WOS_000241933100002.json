In each iteration of a decomposition method, a small number of variables are selected and a QP problem with only the selected variables is solved. Since large matrix computations are not required,. decomposition methods are applicable to large QP problems. In this paper,. We will make a rigorous analysis of the global convergence of general decomposition methods for SVMs. We first introduce a relaxed version of the optimality condition for the QP problems and then prove that a decomposition method reaches a solution satisfying this relaxed optimality condition within a finite number of iterations under a very mild condition on how to select variables.", "paper_title": "Global convergence of decomposition learning methods for support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100002"}
