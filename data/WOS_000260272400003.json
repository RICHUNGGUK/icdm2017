The review spans a large spectrum of KM research ranging from the 'soft' (socio-organizational) to technical dimensions of KM, published in the academic and trade literature. An interpretive stance is adopted so as to provide a holistic understanding and interpretation of organizational KM research and models. Value creation is grounded in the appropriate combination of human network, social capital, intellectual capital, and technology assets, facilitated by a culture of change. It is argued that to be effective organizations need not only to negotiate their migration from a knowledge sharing to a knowledge creation culture, but also to create sustained organizational and societal values. The latter form the foundation of the proposed 'knowledge value creation' concept and represent key organizational and societal challenges faced by modern organizations.", "paper_title": "Value creation: the future of knowledge management", "paper_id": "WOS:000260272400003"}
