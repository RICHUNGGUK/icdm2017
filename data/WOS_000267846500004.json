The meshes in the methods do not need to fit the interfaces. New error indicators are introduced to control the error due to non-body-fitted meshes. Flexible h-adaptive strategies are developed, which can be systematically extended to a large class of interface problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to support the theoretical results and to show the competitive behavior of the adaptive algorithm even for interfaces involving corner or tip singularities.
