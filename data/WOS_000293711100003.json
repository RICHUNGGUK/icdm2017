Both MSE and mutual information (MI) based extrinsic information transfer (MSE-EXIT and MI-EXIT) chart techniques reveal the same asymptotic and convergence behaviours. An improved low complexity version of the soft interference cancellation MMSE (SIC-MMSE) detection scheme is also proposed for CDMA systems utilizing BPSK modulation. Herein, under fixed-point data representation and computation constraint a real time DSP implementation (using TMS320C6416) is suggested. EXIT charts reveal that fixed-point implementation is feasible at possibly no performance degradation. Based on the measured number of cycles of different constituent sub-functions of the proposed receiver, a data transmission rate of up to 186 Kb/s can be reached for a 5-users load and a processing gain of 7 in an AWGN channel.", "paper_title": "On MSE Exit Chart Analysis and Real Time DSP Implementation for Iterative (Turbo) Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711100003"}
