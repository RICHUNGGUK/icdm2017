However, this property is generally proven for continuous systems. Most industrial systems are hybrid systems (e.g., piecewise continuous), which is a significant limitation for real applications. Recently, many identification methods have been proposed for hybrid system approximation; however, these methods only operate in linear hybrid systems. In this paper, the progressive learning machine a new learning algorithm based on multi-NNs is proposed for general hybrid nonlinear/linear system approximation. This algorithm classifies hybrid systems into several continuous systems and can approximate any hybrid system with zero output error. The performance of the proposed learning method is demonstrated via numerical examples and with experimental data from real applications.", "paper_title": "Progressive Learning Machine: A New Approach for General Hybrid System Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360437300002"}
