By machine breakdown condition we mean that the machine may not always be available during the scheduling period. Machine failure may occur with a known probability after completing a job. Probability of machine failure depends on the previous processed job. The problem to be studied has one machine at the first stage and M parallel identical machines at the second stage. The objective is to find the optimal job combinations and the optimal job schedule such that the makespan is minimized. The proposed problem is compatible with a large scope of real world situations. To solve the problem, first, we introduce one optimal approach for job precedence when there is one machine in both stages and then provide a heuristic algorithm when there are M machines in stage two. To examine the performance of the heuristic, some experiments used are provided as well.", "paper_title": "A two-stage hybrid flowshop scheduling problem in machine breakdown condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800015"}
