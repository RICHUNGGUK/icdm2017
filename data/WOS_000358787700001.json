With new and diverse information sources emerging as well as rates of generated data continuously increasing, a persistent challenge becomes more pressing: To make the information existing in multiple heterogeneous resources readily available. The widespread use of the XML data-exchange format has enabled the rapid accumulation of semi-structured metadata for Earth-Science data. In this paper, we exploit this popular use of XML and present the means for querying metadata emanating from multiple sources in a succinct and effective way. Thereby, we release the user from the very tedious and time consuming task of examining individual XML descriptions one by one. Our approach, termed Meta-Array Data Search (MAD Search), brings together diverse data sources while enhancing the user-friendliness of the underlying information sources. We gather metadata using different standards and construct an amalgamated service with the help of tools that discover and harvest such metadata; this service facilitates the end-user by offering easy and timely access to all metadata. The main contribution of our work is a novel query language termed xWCPS, that builds on top of two widely-adopted standards: XQuery and the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS). xWCPS furnishes a rich set of features regarding the way scientific data can be queried with. Our proposed unified language allows for requesting metadata while also giving processing directives. Consequently, the xWCPS-enabled MAD Search helps in both retrieval and processing of large data sets hosted in an heterogeneous infrastructure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through diverse use-cases that provide insights into the syntactic power and overall expressiveness of xWCPS. We evaluate MAD Search in a distributed environment that comprises five high-volume array-databases whose sizes range between 20 and 100 GB and so, we ascertain the applicability and potential of our proposal.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Infrastructure for Earth-Science Big Data Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000358787700001"}
