Their number is sufficiently large to describe the overall state of the system by a suitable probability distribution over the microscopic state. The first part of the paper is devoted to the derivation of mathematical structures which can be properly used to model a variety of models in different fields of applied sciences. Then, some research perspectives are focused on applications to biological systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
