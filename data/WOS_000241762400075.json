To reach the QoS goals, the proportional fairness scheduling strategy is proposed for layered media flows, including I-frame, P-frame and B-frame flows, to determine the approximate reserved bandwidth. Additionally, the DSMRouter system dynamically changes the sending rates of various service queues to ensure that layered media packets with higher priority are always sent before those with lower priority. The results reveal that DSMRouter dynamically modify layered media's sending rates among different service classes according to the network situation. The experimental results of the DSMRouter system on DiffServ networks also reveal that layered media with higher priority have less packet loss.", "paper_title": "DSMRouter: A DiffServ-based multicast router", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400075"}
