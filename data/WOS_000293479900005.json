In particular, these techniques can be used previously to K-Best tree search algorithms, and they are known to achieve successful results. Throughout this work, the performance and complexity of two preprocessing techniques (VBLAST ZF-DFE ordering and LLL lattice-reduction) are evaluated and compared. The LLL algorithm and a recently proposed fixed-complexity version of it are tested. In addition, a low-complexity implementation of the VBLAST ZF-DFE method is proposed. Results show that the LLL preprocessing is less costly than the VBLAST ZF-DFE ordering in average. Also, the BER curves of the K-Best detector in a 4 x 4 MIMO system reveal that the LLL method can only present better detection performance than the VBLAST ZF-DFE ordering for high SNRs and low values of K.
