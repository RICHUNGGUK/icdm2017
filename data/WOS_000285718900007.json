Here G is any finite graph and K(2) consists of two vertices {0, 1} connected by an edge. Every edge in G x K(2) is present with probability p independent of other edges. The bunkbed conjecture states that for all G and p, the probability that (u, 0) is in the same component as (v, 0) is greater than or equal to the probability that (u, 0) is in the same component as (v, 1) for every pair of vertices u, v is an element of G. We generalize this conjecture and formulate and prove similar statements for randomly directed graphs. The methods lead to a proof of the original conjecture for special classes of graphs G, in particular outerplanar graphs.", "paper_title": "On Percolation and the Bunkbed Conjecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000285718900007"}
