A fixed number N of customers cycle through this network. We determine the joint sojourn time distribution of a tagged customer in, first, the general queue and, then, the exponential queue. Subsequently, we indicate how the approach toward this closed system also allows us to study the joint sojourn time distribution of a tagged customer in the equivalent open two-queue system, consisting of FCFS single server queues with general and exponential service times, respectively, in the case that the input process to the first queue is a Poisson process.", "paper_title": "The cyclic queue and the tandem queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000338649100001"}
