The entanglement of cavity atoms induced by entangled pair of photons is investigated. Both entanglement sudden death and entanglement sudden birth phenomena are shown to exist and are analyzed in detail. We also propose a strategy to enhance the entanglement between the atom in one cavity and the photon in another cavity by using quantum Zeno effect.", "paper_title": "PHOTON INDUCED ENTANGLEMENT IN ATOM-CAVITY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288715700002"}
