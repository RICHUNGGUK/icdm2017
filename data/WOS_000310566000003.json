This paper focuses on the error analysis of range-based localisation algorithms in WSNs. The error of range-based localisation algorithms is mainly derived from the measurement error. As seen through prior literature, researchers often assume similar measuring noise, which is not rational in practice. However, the attempt in this process is to locate the error characteristic when the measurement noise is different. By a large number of simulation experiments, this paper has obtained the quantitative relationship between the location accuracy and the measurement errors occurring when all measurement data meets the same noise conditions. In addition, we provide analysis of the different effects of distance measurement error on the location estimation error of unknown sensor nodes. Users are able to recognise the effect of the measurement error characteristic on the localisation accuracy, and to design localisation algorithms more effectively.", "paper_title": "Error analysis of range-based localisation algorithms in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310566000003"}
