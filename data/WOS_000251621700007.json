Actors and dancers at different places are captured by multiple cameras and their images are rendered in 3D form in such a way that they can play and dance together on the same place in real-time. Our Quanticum Man is an allegory of the time of the General Relativity and the matter of the Quantum Mechanics. The new type of interactive theatre enables social networking by supporting simultaneous participants in human-to-human social manner. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
