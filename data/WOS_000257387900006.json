In this paper, we extend previous research and present a new decision tree classification algorithm that uses a rough set theory to produce classification rules. Our algorithm is based on core attributes and on comparing the values of attributes between objects. Our experiments compared the performance of the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm, C4.5, and the proposed decision tree algorithm to demonstrate its accuracy and ability to simplify rules.", "paper_title": "Rough set-based decision tree using a core attribute", "paper_id": "WOS:000257387900006"}
