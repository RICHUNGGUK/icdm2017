It brings new opportunities to tackling issues in relevant fields more efficiently by engaging together the individual technologies. It will also bring about symbiosis and symbionts that combine advantages from the corresponding constituent systems. In this editorial, we briefly introduce the concept of agent mining, the main areas of research, and challenges and opportunities in agent mining. Finally, we give an overview of the papers in this special issue.", "paper_title": "A brief introduction to agent mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000304395400001"}
