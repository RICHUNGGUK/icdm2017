Compared with the existing neural networks for quadratic programming, the proposed neural network in this paper has lower model complexity with only one-layer structure. Moreover, the global exponential stability of the neural network can be guaranteed under some mild conditions. Simulation results with some applications show the performance and characteristic of the proposed neural network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
