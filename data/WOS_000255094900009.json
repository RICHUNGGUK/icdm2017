Our novel index, which is related to the h-index, provides a metric which removes the size dependence. We discuss its mathematical properties such as merging rules of two sets of papers and analyze the relations between the underlying rank/citation-frequency law and the h-index. The proposed index should be seen as a complement to the h-index, to compare the scientific production of institutions (universities, laboratories or journals) that could be of disparate sizes.", "paper_title": "Mathematical aspects of a new criterion for ranking scientific institutions based on the h-index", "paper_id": "WOS:000255094900009"}
