This study reexamines the question in the context of e-commerce maturity. Based on the more general service quality framework, it proposes e-commerce service quality as a broader construct that covers technical service quality, content service quality, and customer service quality. The empirical results based on the survey observations collected from USA and China suggest that online shoppers emphasize different quality aspects at different stages of e-commerce development. When e-conzmerce gets mature, customer service becomes more salient.", "paper_title": "RETHINKING E-COMMERCE SERVICE QUALITY: DOES WEBSITE QUALITY STILL SUFFICE?", "paper_id": "WOS:000358338700008"}
