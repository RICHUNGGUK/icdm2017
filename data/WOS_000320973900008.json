We consider the covering objective, that is we are interested in maximizing the minimum completion time of a machine. This problem falls into the class of problems where the optimal allocation can be truthfully implemented. A major open issue for this class is whether truthfulness affects the polynomial-time implementation. We provide the first constant factor approximation for deterministic truthful mechanisms. In particular we come up with an approximation guarantee of 2 + epsilon, significantly improving on the previous upper bound of min(m, (2 + epsilon)s(m)/s(1)). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
