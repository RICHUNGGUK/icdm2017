One way to deal with this problem is to schedule sensor nodes in such a way that a node is activated only at the times a target point is in its sensing region. In this paper we propose SALA, a scheduling algorithm based on learning automata, to deal with the problem of dynamic point coverage. In SALA each node in the network is equipped with a set of learning automata. The learning automata residing in each node try to learn the maximum sleep duration for the node in such a way that the detection rate of target points by the node does not degrade dramatically. This is done using the information obtained about the movement patterns of target points while passing throughout the sensing region of the nodes. We consider two types of target points; events and moving objects. Events are assumed to occur periodically or based on a Poisson distribution and moving objects are assumed to have a static movement path which is repeated periodically with a randomly selected velocity. In order to show the performance of SALA, some experiments have been conducted. The experimental results show that SALA outperforms the existing methods such as LEACH, GAF, PEAS and PW in terms of energy consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
