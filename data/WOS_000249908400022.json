We report the first results of adding up the behaviour of particular brain circuits to Artificial Neural Networks. A new hybrid learning method has emerged. In order to find the best solution to a given problem, this method combines the use of Genetic Algorithms with particular changes to connection weights based on this behaviour. We show this combination in feed-forward multilayer architectures initially created to solve classification problems and we illustrate the benefits obtained with this new method.
