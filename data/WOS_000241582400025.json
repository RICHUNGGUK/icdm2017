Unfortunately, it also places significant conceptual and implementation burden on programmers. This paper aims at addressing this challenge for constraint-based local search (CBLS), whose search procedures typically exhibit inherent parallelism stemming from multistart, restart, or population-based techniques whose benefits have been demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically. The,paper presents abstractions that allows distributed CBLS programs to be close to their sequential and parallel counterparts, keeping the conceptual and implementation overhead of distributed computing minimal. A preliminary implementation in COMET exhibits significant speed-ups in constraint satisfaction and optimization applications. The implementation also scales well with the number of machines. Of particular interest is the observation that generic abstractions of CBLS and CP, such as models and solutions, and advanced control structures such as events and closures, play a fundamental role to keep the distance between sequential and distributed CBLS programs small. As a result, the abstractions directly apply to CP programs using multistarts or restarts procedures.", "paper_title": "Distributed constraint-based local search", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400025"}
