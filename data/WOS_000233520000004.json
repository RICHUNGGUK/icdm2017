On the basis of these results, we define level sets of solutions to fuzzy differential equations by the solutions of set differential equations, and then we obtain the corresponding results for the large solutions of the fuzzy initial value problem (FIVP). Finally, discuss the relationship between small solutions and large solutions of FIVP. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
