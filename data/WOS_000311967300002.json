Several definitions of privacy have been proposed over the years, from traditional syntactic privacy definitions, which capture the protection degree enjoyed by data respondents with a numerical value, to more recent semantic privacy definitions, which take into consideration the mechanism chosen for releasing the data. In this paper, we illustrate the evolution of the definitions of privacy, and we survey some data protection techniques devised for enforcing such definitions. We also illustrate some well-known application scenarios in which the discussed data protection techniques have been successfully used, and present some open issues.", "paper_title": "DATA PRIVACY: DEFINITIONS AND TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000311967300002"}
