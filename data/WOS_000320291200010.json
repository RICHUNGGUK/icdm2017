The cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN) can solve this issue of interference and it can provide better services within the domain of the WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel joint sensor node selection and channel allocation scheme to improve the performance of the CRSNs. We consider the cluster oriented sensor network and form clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. The node selection scheme is formulated using the knapsack problem where each cluster head selects the optimal number of sensor nodes (SNs). Later on, the Hungarian algorithm is employed to allocate the best channels among SNs for their reporting process. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of prolonging the network life, selecting the more reliable SNs and allocating the optimal channels among SNs for their data transmission during the reporting process.", "paper_title": "Joint Sensor-Node Selection and Channel Allocation Scheme for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320291200010"}
