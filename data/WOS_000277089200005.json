To this end, the article focuses on the users of these technologies, not on the technologies themselves. The technologies are explained only very briefly, and then the article emphasizes two demography-related case studies: demographic research and higher education in demography. The article uses the findings from a recent investigation on how these technologies are used in other scientific disciplines to argue for their more extensive use in demography.", "paper_title": "Imagine Using New Web Technologies in Demography", "paper_id": "WOS:000277089200005"}
