This method is an efficient approach for network modelling of sensor data transmission. In this framework, clusters of neighbouring nodes are formed. Collectively, these clusters can significantly improve the transmission of information. The method is based on network clustering and the coherent addition of transmission fields from closely spaced wireless nodes. MHCTI can improve the data transmission distance range and be used to address the problem of low network connectivity in cases of non-uniform wireless node density, consequently increasing the lifetime of the sensor network. To analyse the effectiveness of the proposed method, the network lifetime and connectivity of the MHCTI method were compared with those of previous approaches. Moreover, a simple adaptive algorithm was investigated. In this algorithm, phase shifts in the radiator are randomly selected, and the zone covering the sending cluster is controlled, resulting in improved network connectivity.", "paper_title": "THE MULTI-HOP CLUSTER TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION METHOD FOR SOLVING THE LOW CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS WITH NON-UNIFORM DENSITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500008"}
