We look back on a series of experiments showing that vividness is a key factor in creating emotional risk responses and fostering attitude change through systematic information processing. However, the effects were modest even when vivid and concrete images and texts were used in combination with ominous sounds and music. The next step therefore is to explore and make use of the possibilities of multimedia techniques and augmented reality to provide people with a simulated risk experience. This paper concludes with a preview of this work, the focus of which is on the sense of presence.", "paper_title": "The persuasive power of mediated risk experiences", "paper_id": "WOS:000238092800008"}
