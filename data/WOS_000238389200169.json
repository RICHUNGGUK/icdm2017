Some experiments about pipelining I/O are implemented in the Heter-RAID. These results show that I/O pipelining scheduling can take advantage of pipelining features to achieve high performance I/O over network storage system.", "paper_title": "Pipelining network storage I/O", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200169"}
