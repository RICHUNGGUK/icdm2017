Firstly some stable feature points are detected from the original image using the proposed multiresolution feature point detection filter. Then, image normalization is applied to the disks centered at these feature points. The watermark is embedded in the subband coefficients of DFT domain of each disk separately. And the watermark detection uses the correlation between the watermark embedding coefficients and the original watermark, and does not need the original image. The proposed scheme combines the advantages of feature point detection and image normalization, which can achieve strong robustness to signal processing and geometrical distortions. The experimental results also demonstrate good performance of the proposed scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
