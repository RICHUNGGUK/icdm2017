They are often developed in parallel to the development of adaptive learning systems and thus, linked to the system's development. The adaptive learning systems literature reports numerous accounts of learner model development, but there are no reports on the methodological aspects of developing learner models and the relation between the development of the learner model component and the rest of the system. This paper presents the Participatory Learner Modelling Design methodology, which outlines the steps for learner model development and their relation to the development of the system. The methodology is illustrated with a case study of an adaptive educational system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
