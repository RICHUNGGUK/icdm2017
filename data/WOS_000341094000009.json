GF algorithm uses a linear sequence of numbers of genes structurally organized in integer numbers, separated with dots. The encoded chromosomes in the population are evaluated using a fitness function. The fittest chromosome survives and is subjected to modification by genetic operators. The creation of these encoded chromosomes, with the fitness functions and the genetic operators, allows the algorithm to perform with high efficiency in the genetic folding life cycle. Multi-classification problems have been chosen to illustrate the power and versatility of GF. In classification problems, the kernel function is important to construct binary and multi classifier for support vector machines. Different types of standard kernel functions have been compared with our proposed algorithm. Promising results have been shown in comparison to other published works.", "paper_title": "Genetic folding for solving multiclass SVM problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341094000009"}
