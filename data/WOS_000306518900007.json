In contrast to prior work, we consider the pre-bond test-pin-count constraint during optimization since these pins occupy large silicon area that cannot be used in functional mode. In addition, the proposed test-architecture design takes the SoC layout into consideration and facilitates the sharing of test wires between pre-bond tests and post-bond test, which significantly reduces the routing cost for test-access mechanisms. In addition, a thermal-aware test scheduling algorithm is proposed to eliminate hot spots during manufacturing test. Experimental results for the ITC'02 SoC benchmarks circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.", "paper_title": "Integrated Test-Architecture Optimization and Thermal-Aware Test Scheduling for 3-D SoCs Under Pre-Bond Test-Pin-Count Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900007"}
