The crucial property for the proof is a so-called intersection property that transfers inequalities between two distribution functions (resp. of their Laplace transforms) from one level to the next. It is conjectured that such intersection properties hold in a much more general context. If this property is verified convergence to a travelling wave follows almost automatically.", "paper_title": "The random multisection problem, travelling waves and the distribution of the height of m-ary search trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500004"}
