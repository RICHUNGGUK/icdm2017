The derived numerical scheme adds numerical diffusion which is strictly restricted to a high wavenumber region in order to control numerical instabilities, as well as to achieve de-aliasing ability. More importantly, the derived numerical scheme has excellent dispersion relation preserving (DRP) property. The applicability of the proposed scheme in simulating real flow problems has been demonstrated by solving flow inside a lid driven cavity, a transitional flow past AG24 aerofoil and a two-dimensional decaying turbulence flow.
