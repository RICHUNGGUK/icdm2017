The new sequence allows a nice description of the optimal one-point codes correcting generic errors and to compare them with standard codes and with the Feng-Rao improved codes. The relation between the tau sequence and the nu sequence gives a new characterization of Arf semigroups and it is shown that the tau sequence of a numerical semigroup unequivocally determines it.", "paper_title": "On numerical semigroups and the redundancy of improved codes correcting generic errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000269531600004"}
