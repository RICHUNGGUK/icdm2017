However, traditional temperature and stress sensor designs require large calibration overhead to improve accuracy, which incurs significant cost for massive production. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel temperature-stress cosensor design for 3-D ICs. By exploring the inherent reciprocity of temperature and stress mechanisms, it achieves runtime self-calibration such that no dedicated calibration effort is needed. Simulation results show that the cosensor achieves 0.26 degrees C and 0.43 MPa accuracy on average in temperature and stress measurements, respectively, when evaluated in [-60 degrees C, 140 degrees C]. In addition, the accuracy of self-calibrated sensors remains within 1.1 degrees C and 2.3 MPa when there exists up to 5% measurement noise, which shows that the self-calibration process is relatively insensitive to various noises.", "paper_title": "Runtime Self-Calibrated Temperature-Stress Cosensor for 3-D Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000344483200017"}
