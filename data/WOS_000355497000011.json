A context-based adaptation environment should learn from the dynamism of the context as well as the decisions made, and continuously identify new unforeseen situations. Data mining is a possibility to maintain the analysis of the processes updated. This paper presents a method that infers the need to learn new situations that influence a business process execution. The method is based on the results of the Apriori algorithm application. Case studies were conducted to evaluate the proposal. We observed evidences of context changes over time and the potential to learn with this dynamics through the method proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
