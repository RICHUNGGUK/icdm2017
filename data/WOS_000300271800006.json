The proposed solution has three major components: encoding, uncorrelation and transmission along carefully selected node disjoint paths. All three modules are necessary to achieve secure message transmission. Two sets of experimental results were conducted. The first set of experimental results on a network simulator demonstrates the high level of security that the proposed module provides and the second set of experiments shows its low power and area characteristics.
