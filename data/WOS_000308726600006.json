The scheme, based on the definition of an ad hoc Riemann problem at solid boundaries, is simple to implement and it is formally second order accurate. Error convergence rates with respect to several exact test cases are investigated and examples of flow solutions in one, two and three dimensions are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
