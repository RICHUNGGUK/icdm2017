In this paper, a forecasting model based on chaotic mapping, firefly algorithm, and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to predict stock market price. The forecasting model has three stages. In the first stage, a delay coordinate embedding method is used to reconstruct unseen phase space dynamics. In the second stage, a chaotic firefly algorithm is employed to optimize SVR hyperparameters. Finally in the third stage, the optimized SVR is used to forecast stock market price. The significance of the proposed algorithm is 3-fold. First, it integrates both chaos theory and the firefly algorithm to optimize SVR hyperparameters, whereas previous studies employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize these parameters. Second, it uses a delay coordinate embedding method to reconstruct phase space dynamics. Third, it has high prediction accuracy due to its implementation of structural risk minimization (SRM). To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed algorithm, we selected the three most challenging stock market time series data from NASDAQ historical quotes, namely Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily closed (last) stock price, and applied the proposed algorithm to these data. Compared with genetic algorithm-based SVR (SVR-GA), chaotic genetic algorithm-based SVR (SVR-CGA), firefly-based SVR (SVR-FA), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), the proposed model performs best based on two error measures, namely mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE).
