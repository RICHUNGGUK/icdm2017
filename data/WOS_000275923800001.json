However, most of these standards and models focus on individual web services and do not consider the security issues in composite services. In this article, the authors propose an enhanced security model to control the information flow in service chains. It extends the basic web service security models by introducing the concepts of delegation and pass-on. Based on these concepts, new certificates, certificate chains, delegation and pass-on policies, and how they are used to control the information flow are discussed. The authors also introduce a case study from a healthcare information system to illustrate the protocols.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Security Modeling for Web Services Using Delegation and Pass-On", "paper_id": "WOS:000275923800001"}
