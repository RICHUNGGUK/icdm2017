A particularity of these databases is that they are made of images with different, but known, resolutions. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme allowing us to compare and index images with different resolutions. This scheme relies on a simplified acquisition model of satellite images and uses continuous wavelet decompositions. We establish a correspondence between scales which permits us to compare wavelet decompositions of images having different resolutions. We validate the approach through several matching and classification experiments, and we show that taking the acquisition process into account yields better results than just using scaling properties of wavelet features.", "paper_title": "Indexing of satellite images with different resolutions by wavelet features", "paper_id": "WOS:000258030500020"}
