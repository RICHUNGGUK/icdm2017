Before proving the main theorem, a more generalized convex combination inequality is proposed. A new stability criterion for Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with multiple time-varying delays is obtained by the employed general inequality technique. Two examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented results.", "paper_title": "New delay-dependent stability criteria for cohen-grossberg neural networks with multiple time-varying mixed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822900007"}
