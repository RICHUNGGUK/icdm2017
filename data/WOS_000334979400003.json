The major aspects governing this problem are discussed in this paper. Structural models representative of common buildings were loaded with two dynamic load models, and an evaluation of their behaviour focusing on the numerically predicted peak accelerations carried out. Their critical analysis and comparison to limiting values proposed in the literature allowed to establish conclusions concerning the suitability of this structural solution, and the influence of the span and load pattern when the issue of annoying vibrations is dealt with.
