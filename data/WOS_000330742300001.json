It guarantees that the secret key reveals nothing to malicious adversary, beyond the unavoidable minimal information such as the length of ciphertext. They constructed a function private identity-based encryption that contains equality functionality. In this work we construct a new function private attribute-based encryption which supports more complex functionality. And we transform it to a searchable encryption. In searchable encryption, the trapdoor of searching keywords can be seen as the secret key. Hence, using this system can efficiently resist keyword guessing attack.", "paper_title": "A Function Private Attribute-Based Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000330742300001"}
