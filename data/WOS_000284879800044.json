Existing TE methods require manual configuration of link weights or tunnels, which is difficult to get right, or prior knowledge of traffic demands and hence may not be robust to link failures or traffic fluctuations. We present a self-configuring TE scheme, SculpTE, which automatically adapts the network-layer topology to changing traffic demands. SculpTE is responsive, stable, and achieves excellent load balancing.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Traffic Engineering With Self-Configuring Topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800044"}
