In a very general manner (i.e., working on arbitrary objects as strings, arrays, graphs, etc.), these tissue P systems equipped with the sequential derivation mode allow for the representation of hybrid co-operating grammar systems using the classic basic derivation modes *, t and <= k, = k, >= k, for k >= 1, as well as the internally hybrid modes (>= k boolean AND <= l), for k, l, is an element of N, k <= l and (t boolean AND <= k), (t boolean AND = k), (t boolean AND >= k), for k >= 1. Moreover, we also show how these tissue P systems working in the sequential mode allow for the simulation of random context grammars, too.", "paper_title": "Modelling grammar systems by tissue P systems working in the sequential mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000245937200007"}
