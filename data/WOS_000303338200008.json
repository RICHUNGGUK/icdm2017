Among various knockout phenotypes, lethality is of great interest because those involved genes play essential roles. With the availability of large-scale genomic data, we aimed to assess how well the integration of various genomic features can predict the lethal phenotype of single-gene knockout mice. Results: We first assembled a comprehensive list of 491 candidate genomic features derived from diverse data sources. Using mouse genes with a known phenotype as the training set, we integrated the informative genomic features to predict the knockout lethality through three machine learning methods. Based on cross-validation, our models could achieve a good performance (accuracy = 73% and recall = 63%). Our results serve as a valuable practical resource in the mouse genetics research community, and also accelerate the translation of the knowledge of mouse genes into better strategies for studying human disease.", "paper_title": "Predicting the lethal phenotype of the knockout mouse by integrating comprehensive genomic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200008"}
