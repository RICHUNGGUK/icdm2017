Distributed schedulers are preferred due to better scalability, smaller setup delays, smaller management overheads, no single point of failure, and for avoiding bottlenecks. Based on the sequence in which nodes access the shared medium, repetitiveness, and determinism, distributed schedulers that are supported by wireless mesh standards can be classified as either random, pseudo-random, or cyclic schemes. We performed qualitative and quantitative studies that show the strengths and weaknesses of each category, and how the schemes complement each other. We discuss how wireless standards with mesh definitions have evolved by incorporating and enhancing one or more of these schemes. Emerging trends and research problems remaining for future research also have been identified.", "paper_title": "Distributed Scheduling Schemes for Wireless Mesh Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000327453300014"}
