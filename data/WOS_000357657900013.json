In this paper, we use simplicial homology in order to not only compute the topology of a cellular network, but also to discover the clusters of nodes still with no location information. We propose three algorithms for the management of future cellular networks. The first one is a frequency auto-planning algorithm for the self-configuration of future cellular networks. It aims at minimizing the number of planned frequencies while maximizing the usage of each one. Then, our energy conservation algorithm falls into the self-optimization feature of future cellular networks. It optimizes the energy consumption of the cellular network during off-peak hours while taking into account both coverage and user traffic. Finally, we present and discuss the performance of a disaster recovery algorithm using determinantal point processes to patch coverage holes.", "paper_title": "Simplicial Homology for Future Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357657900013"}
