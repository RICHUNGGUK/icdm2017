A rotational scanning using an abdominal probe was employed. To reduce the distortion produced when the rotational axis is not collinear with the central beam of the probe, a new 3D reconstruction algorithm using 360 degrees scanning is derived. Then, a fast 3D needle segmentation algorithm is used to find the electrode direction and determine the tip of electrode. Experiments with a water phantom demonstrated the feasibility of our 3D US image based guidance system.", "paper_title": "3D US imaging system for the guidance of uterine adenoma and uterine bleeding RF ablation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500027"}
