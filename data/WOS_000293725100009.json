The analyses were performed using mean discontinuity set orientations for each rock mass region under gravitational loading to calculate the maximum safe slope angles (MSSA) for different cut slope directions. Results show that final MSSAs obtained from kinematic analysis are less than or equal to that obtained from block theory analysis. The following conclusions have been made based on the block theory analysis results, which are closer to the reality: (1) The final MSSA range between 30 degrees and 47 degrees, 44 degrees and 70 degrees, 47 degrees and 69 degrees for cut slope dip directions of 20-30 degrees, 105-210 degrees, and 270-355 degrees, respectively; (2) For cut slope dip directions of 20-30 degrees, 200-210 degrees and 275-315 degrees, wide ranges of values have been obtained for the final MSSA reflecting the influence of variability of fracture orientations on MSSA; (3) Apart from the region R-d-1 for slope dip directions in the range 20-30 degrees, rest of the regions at the dam site seem to be stable for slope angles less than 40 degrees. Detailed comparisons are given between the kinematic and block theory analyses covering both the theoretical concepts and application results. Also a brief comparison is included between the laboratory and in situ discontinuity shear strength results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
