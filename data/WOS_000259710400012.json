Daily stress data can be considered as observations of a single variable for a subject, carried out repeatedly at different time points (functional data). In this study, we propose a functional logistic regression model with the aim of predicting the probability of lupus flare (binary response variable) from a functional predictor variable (stress level). This method differs from the classical approach, in which longitudinal data are considered as observations of different correlated variables. The estimation of this functional model may be inaccurate due to multicollinearity, and so a principal component based solution is proposed. In addition, a new interpretation is made of the parameter function of the model, which enables the relationship between the response and the predictor variables to be evaluated. Finally, the results provided by different logit approaches (functional and longitudinal) are compared, using a sample of Lupus patients. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
