HealthAgents is a European Union funded research project, which aims to enhance the classification of brain tumors using such a decision support system based on intelligent agents to securely connect a network of clinical centers. The HealthAgents system is implementing novel pattern recognition discrimination methods, in order to analyze in vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and ex vivo/in vitro High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HR-MAS) and DNA micro-array data. HealthAgents intends not only to apply forefront agent technology to the biomedical field, but also develop the HealthAgents network, a globally distributed information and knowledge repository for brain tumor diagnosis and prognosis.", "paper_title": "HealthAgents: distributed multi-agent brain tumor diagnosis and prognosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000266072000002"}
