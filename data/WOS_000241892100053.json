By combining the transmission matrix method and the particles swarm optimization algorithm, we obtain a novel method for the inverse problem of the synthesizing fiber gratings. With adjusting the parameters of the PSO algorithm we can get the demand index modulation for the target reflection spectrums including the phase response. Compared with other synthesis methods, the PSO algorithm characteristics are simple and faster convergence, especially by using the improved local PSO (LPSO) algorithm, we obtained the better results for the same problem.", "paper_title": "Using of intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm to synthesis the index modulation profile of narrow ban fiber Bragg grating filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100053"}
