Two nonlinear filters, quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (QBEKF) and gyroscope-based extended Kalman filter (GBEKF) are utilized in the proposed IMM-based orientation estimator for sensor motion state estimation. In the QBEKF, measurements from gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer are processed; while in the GBEKF, sole measurements from gyroscope are processed. The interacting multiple model algorithm is used for fusing the estimated states via adaptive model weighting. Simulation results validate the proposed design concept, and the scheme is capable of reducing overall estimation errors in sensor motion tracking.", "paper_title": "Orientation Estimation for Sensor Motion Tracking Using Interacting Multiple Model Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100022"}
