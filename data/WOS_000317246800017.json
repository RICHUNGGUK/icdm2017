Two main factors make power control optimization very essential for CA-MIMO radio link: the different channel characteristics in multiple CCs, and multiple power constraint conditions (per-CC, per-antenna and per-transmitter power constraints) in the actual CA system deployment. This paper firstly derives the degenerate conditions of optimal power allocation for a single-transmitter CA-MIMO system. Stemming from the derived degenerate conditions, we propose a modified hybrid gradient optimal power allocation(MHGOPA) algorithm to maximize the system performance. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed resource allocation approach by comparing with baseline average power allocation algorithm. Finally, we extend the MHGOPA algorithm into a heterogeneous CA network with multiple transmitters working simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Optimal power allocation for homogeneous and heterogeneous CA-MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317246800017"}
