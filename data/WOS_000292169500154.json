The proposed AFPSO-cf algorithm adaptively adjusts the accelerating coefficients of PSO by using the fuzzy set theory to improve global searching ability of controller parameters. Compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO), the PSO with a constriction factor (PSO-cf), the Quadratic Interpolation PSO (QIPSO), the unified PSO (UPSO), the fully informed particle swarm (FIPS) and the comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) algorithms, the experiment results show that the proposed method significantly performs better than those algorithms.
