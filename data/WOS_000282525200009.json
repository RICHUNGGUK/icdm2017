In this CALL system, a strategy of retrieval learning, a method of learning memory cycle, and a method of repeated learning are applied for effective vocabulary memorization. The system is designed to offer personalized learning based on cognitive abilities related to the human language process. For this, the proposed CALL system has a cognitive diagnosis module which can measure five types of cognitive abilities. The results of this diagnosis are used to create dynamic learning scenarios for personalized learning and to evaluate user performance in the learning. This system is also designed in order to have users be able to create learning word lists and to share them simply with various functions based on open APIs. Additionally, through experiments, it has shown that this system helps students to learn English vocabulary effectively and enhances their foreign language skills.", "paper_title": "A Personalized English Vocabulary Learning System Based on Cognitive Abilities Related to Foreign Language Proficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000282525200009"}
