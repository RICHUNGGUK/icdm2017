Using this model, a procedure that compacts T compacts all the sequences in S simultaneously. This enhances the ability of the procedure to compact the set compared with procedures that consider the sequences in the set individually. It also allows the test sequences in S to be redefined. If different sequences in S have substantially different lengths, repartitioning T allows new sequences with more uniform lengths to be obtained. After repartitioning, additional test compaction can be achieved. This paper describes a test compaction procedure that includes these operations based on the modeling of a set as a single sequence.", "paper_title": "Modeling a Set of Functional Test Sequences as a Single Sequence for Test Compaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000024"}
