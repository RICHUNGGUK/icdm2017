However, fault-tolerance related issues have not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a CC-based scheme to achieve more efficient fault-tolerant topology control. We first define k-connectivity under the CC model and then design a distributed scheme for building a t-spanner with k-connectivity of an arbitrary communication network. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can tolerate node failures as well as exploit the advantage of CC to achieve path energy-efficiency and lower power consumption of the network.", "paper_title": "Distributed Fault-Tolerant Topology Control in Cooperative Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791400007"}
