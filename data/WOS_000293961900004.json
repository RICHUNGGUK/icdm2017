In this paper, we adopt the ideas of spatiotemporal analysis and the use of local features for motion description. Two methods are proposed. The first one uses temporal templates to capture movement dynamics and then uses texture features to characterize the observed movements. We then extend this idea into a spatiotemporal space and describe human movements with dynamic texture features. Following recent trends in computer vision, the method is designed to work with image data rather than silhouettes. The proposed methods are computationally simple and suitable for various applications. We verify the performance of our methods on the popular Weizmann and KTH datasets, achieving high accuracy.", "paper_title": "Recognition of human actions using texture descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000293961900004"}
