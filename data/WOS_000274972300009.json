Grid computing has matured to currently become one of the most successful initiatives for dealing with these challenging problems, which usually require tackling huge volumes of data. Although the main goal of the grid technology is sharing resources among several virtual organizations. few research works are oriented to increase the performance of grid solutions. MAPFS-Grid is a complete suite of components for providing high performance access to huge volumes of data in a grid environment. MAPFS-Grid is composed of three different services: (i) Parallel Data Access Service, a WSRF-compliant grid service; (ii) MAPFS-DSI, a GridFTP-compliant service; and (iii) MAPFS-DAI, an OGSA-DAI-compliant service. Each one is suitable for different scenarios, which will be described in this article. This paper describes and evaluates the performance of MAPFS-Grid, showing the main advantages of MAPFS-Grid vs other proposals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
