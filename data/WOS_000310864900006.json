First, Ghostburster neuron model under external electrical stimulation is introduced. Then, the synchronization of general master-slave chaotic systems is formulated and an adaptive controller based on dynamic compensation is designed to drive the slave neuron to track the behaviors of the master neuron. The construction of synchronization controller is easy to achieve and the exact knowledge of the systems is not necessarily required. Asymptotic synchronization can be achieved by choosing proper controller parameters. Simulation results confirm that the adaptive control approach employed in this paper is valid in the synchronization of two Ghostburster neurons. As a promising synchronization approach, it is expected to realize the synchronization of other neural systems effectively. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
