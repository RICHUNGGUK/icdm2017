Recent clinical investigations have observed simultaneous structural and hemodynamic variations in the aortic valve and coronary arteries due to regional pathologies of the aortic valve. The goal of the present study is to elucidate this observed and yet unexplained phenomenon, in which a local pathology in the aortic valve region could potentially lead to the initiation or progression of coronary artery disease. Results revealed a considerable impact on the coronary flow, velocity profile, and consequently shear stress due to an increase in the aortic wall or aortic leaflet stiffness and thickness which concur with clinical observations. The cutoff value of 0.75 for fractional flow reserve was reached when the values of leaflet thickness and aortic wall stiffness were approximately twice and three times their normal value, respectively. Variations observed in coronary velocity profiles as well as wall shear stress suggest a possible link for the initiation of coronary artery disease.", "paper_title": "The effect of aortic wall and aortic leaflet stiffening on coronary hemodynamic: a fluid-structure interaction study", "paper_id": "WOS:000321770500009"}
