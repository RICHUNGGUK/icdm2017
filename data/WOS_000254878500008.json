The ultimate goal of inferred modeling is to obtain expressions that quantitatively understand every detail and principle of biological systems. To infer a realizable S-system structure, most articles have applied sums of magnitude of kinetic orders as a penalty term in the fitness evaluation. How to tune a penalty weight to yield a realizable model structure is the main issue for the inverse problem. No guideline has been published for tuning a suitable penalty weight to infer a suitable model structure of biochemical networks. Results: We introduce an interactive inference algorithm to infer a realizable S-system structure for biochemical networks. The inference problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem to minimize simultaneously the concentration error, slope error and interaction measure in order to find a suitable S-system model structure and its corresponding model parameters. The multiobjective optimization problem is solved by the -constraint method to minimize the interaction measure subject to the expectation constraints for the concentration and slope error criteria. The theorems serve to guarantee the minimum solution for the -constrained problem to achieve the minimum interaction network for the inference problem. The approach could avoid assigning a penalty weight for sums of magnitude of kinetic orders.", "paper_title": "Inference of biochemical network models in S-system using multiobjective optimization approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254878500008"}
