The latter was later reformulated by Danos and Joinet as a proper subsystem of linear logic, whose proofs satisfy a certain structural condition. We extend this approach to polytime computation, finding two solutions: the first is obtained by a simple extension of Danos and Joinet's condition, closely resembles Asperti's Light Affine Logic and enjoys polystep strong normalisation (the polynomial bound does not depend on the reduction strategy); the second, which needs more complex conditions, exactly corresponds to Girard's Light Linear Logic.", "paper_title": "Linear logic and polynomial time", "paper_id": "WOS:000243643500001"}
