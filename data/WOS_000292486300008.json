Solutions to the descriptive equations are obtained using a finite-volume method, combined with an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, applied in both physical and compositional space. The effects of intermittency on the flow field are accommodated using intermittency-modified eddy viscosity and second-moment turbulence closures, as well as through modifications to the mixing model embodied within the transported PDF equation. Predictions of the model are validated against data on the velocity and scalar fields in jets, as well as against measurements of scalar PDFs and intermittency profiles, with reasonable agreement obtained. From the cases examined, predictions of the second-moment closure are superior, although both approaches provide realistic predictions of the bimodal features to the measured PDFs.
