In this method, all distributed primary parameters of the line are expanded in Fourier series and also a periodic NTL is made from cascading infinite number of desired NTL. The ABCD parameters of desired NTL are obtained after finding the propagation constant and the characteristic impedances of its periodic model. The validity of the method is verified using analysis of some special types of lines.
