Up to round-off error, these schemes preserve the discrete version of the mass of the continuous solution. For time discretization, we use the Crank-Nicolson for linear Schrodinger equations, and the Strang splitting for nonlinear Schrodinger equations, so that numerical mass is still preserved at each time step. The DDG method when applied to linear Schrodinger equations is shown to have the optimal (k + 1) th order of accuracy for polynomial elements of degree k. The numerical tests demonstrate both accuracy and capacity of these methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
