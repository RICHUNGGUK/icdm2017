The nonlinear nature of speech suggests that extra information provided by some nonlinear features could be especially useful when training data are scarce or when the ASR task is very complex. In this paper, the Fractal Dimension of the observed time series is combined with the traditional MFCCs in the feature vector in order to enhance the performance of two different ASR systems. The first is a simple system of digit recognition in Chinese, with very few training examples, and the second is a large vocabulary ASR system for Broadcast News in Spanish.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the Feature Extraction Process for Automatic Speech Recognition with Fractal Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000328221100014"}
