Current 1-D Laplace transformation and z transform can be combined into the new 2-D s-z transform. However, 2-D s-z transformation is not a simple extension of 1-D transform, in 2-D case, we need consider the 2-D boundary conditions which don't occur in 1-D case. The hybrid 2-D definitions and theorems are given in the paper. To verify the results of this paper, we also derived a numerical inverse 2-D Laplace-z transform, applying it to show the 2-D pulse response of a stable 2-D continuous-discrete system.", "paper_title": "2-D Laplace-z transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827500043"}
