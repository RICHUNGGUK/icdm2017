This problem is NP-complete but recently, several parameterized algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we present a number of surprisingly simple search tree algorithms for WEIGHTED CLUSTER EDITING assuming that edge insertion and deletion costs are positive integers. We show that the smallest search tree has size O(1.82(k)) for edit cost k, resulting in the currently fastest parameterized algorithm, both for this problem and its unweighted counterpart. We have implemented and compared our algorithms, and achieved promising results.(1) (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
