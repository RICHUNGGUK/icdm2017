In order to minimize artifacts arising in image interpolation such as image blur and the checkerboard effect, the CIM first evaluates the curvature of the low-resolution image. After interpolating the curvature to the high-resolution image domain, the CIM constructs the high-resolution image by solving a linearized curvature equation, incorporating the interpolated curvature as an explicit driving force. It has been numerically verified that the new zooming method can produce clear images of sharp edges which are already denoised and superior to those obtained from linear methods and PDE-based methods of no curvature information. Various results are given to prove effectiveness and reliability of the new method.", "paper_title": "Curvature Interpolation Method for Image Zooming", "paper_id": "WOS:000291823600010"}
