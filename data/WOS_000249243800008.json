Depending on the balance of depression, facilitation, and the underlying noise, the network displays different behaviors, including associative memory and switching of activity between different attractors. We conclude that synaptic facilitation enhances the attractor instability in a way that (1) intensifies the system adaptability to external stimuli, which is in agreement with experiments, and (2) favors the retrieval of information with less error during short time intervals.", "paper_title": "Competition between synaptic depression and facilitation in attractor neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243800008"}
