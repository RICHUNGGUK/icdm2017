The problem of hybrid learning of RBF network is discussed with the multi-objective optimization methods to improve classification accuracy for medical disease diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a time variant multi-objective particle swarm optimization(TVMOPSO) of radial basis function (RBF) network for diagnosing the medical diseases. This study applied RBF network training to determine whether RBF networks can be developed using TVMOPSO, and the performance is validated based on accuracy and complexity. Our approach is tested on three standard data sets from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that our approach is a viable alternative and provides an effective means to solve multi-objective RBF network for medical disease diagnosis. It is better than RBF network based on MOPSO and NSGA-II, and also competitive with other methods in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
