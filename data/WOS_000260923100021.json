By utilizing a difference inequality and the properties of M-matrix, a new global exponential stability result is presented. The result does not impose the other restrictions on the delay except the boundedness. An example is provided to show the effectiveness of the global exponential stability result given here.", "paper_title": "CONVERGENCE OF DISCRETE-TIME CELLULAR NEURAL NETWORKS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100021"}
