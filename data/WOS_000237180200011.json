In this paper, we analyze the interference for downlink and uplink timeslots in a multicell CDMA/TDD system. We also mathematically formulate an optimal timeslot and channel allocation problem considering capacity fairness among cells, which is to maximize the system capacity under the given traffic unbalance, and propose an efficient algorithm based on the simulated annealing technique. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme yields a good performance, and fairness among cells improves with a decrease in the system capacity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
