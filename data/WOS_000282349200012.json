We particularly explored the Mac-users' social influences, saving technological and other influences for future reports. Results showed Mac users to possess significant connections with other Mac users on the university campus. The Mac users in our study indicated that positive, past exposure, including Apple's advertising of Macs, had sharp influences on their decisions to become and remain Mac users.
