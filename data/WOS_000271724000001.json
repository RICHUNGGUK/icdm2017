We show that a rank-based kd-tree, like an ordinary kd-tree, supports orthogonal range queries in O(n(1-1/d) vertical bar k) time, where k is the output size. The main advantage of rank-based kd-trees is that they can be efficiently kinetized: the kinetic data structure (KDS) processes O(n(2)) events in the worst case, assuming that the points follow constant-degree algebraic trajectories; each event can be handled in O( log n) time, and each point is involved in O( 1) certificates. We also propose a variant of longest-side kd-trees, called rank-based longest-side kd-trees, for sets of points in R(2). Rank-based longest-side kd-trees can be kinetized efficiently as well, and like longest-side kd-trees, they support epsilon-approximate nearest-neighbor, epsilon-approximate farthest-neighbor, and epsilon-approximate range queries with convex ranges in O((1/epsilon)log(2) n) time. The KDS processes O(n(3) log n) events in the worst case, assuming that the points follow constant-degree algebraic trajectories; each event can be handled in O( log(2) n) time, and each point is involved in O( log n) certificates.", "paper_title": "KINETIC kd-TREES AND LONGEST-SIDE kd-TREES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271724000001"}
