The motion regimes were classified into non-oscillatory motion, regular oscillatory motion, and irregular oscillatory motion. The effect of the off-center distance on the particle motion became significant as the Reynolds number increased, resulting in the bifurcation of the motion regime. There was a critical off-center distance beyond which the critical Reynolds numbers corresponding to the limits of the regimes depended on the off-center distance. The mean amplitude of the transverse oscillation decreased as the ratio of the density of the particle to that of the fluid increased, and this was more significant as the off-center distance and Reynolds number increased. Moreover, as the Reynolds number increased, the drag coefficient decreased and eventually converged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
