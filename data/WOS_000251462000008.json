These errors can be reduced, but not completely eliminated. That is why Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can reduce the number, danger and severity of traffic accidents. Several ADAS, which nowadays are being researched for Intelligent vehicles, are based on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics technologies. In this article a research platform for the implementation of systems based on computer vision is presented, and different visual perception modules useful for some ADAS such as Line Keeping System, Adaptive Cruise Control, Pedestrian Protector, or Speed Supervisor, are described.
