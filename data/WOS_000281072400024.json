An integrated index eta(t) which related to network-induced delay, data dropout and error sequence is presented to describe QoS. Then the problem of Network-based Fault Detection Filter (NFDF) design is transformed as an H(infinity) optimization problem for linear systems with interval time-varying delay. A delay-dependent sufficient condition is derived by using Layapunov-Krasovskii approach and an associated solution of the problem can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To avoid the conservatism caused by magnifying eta(t) to eta M in deriving the results, the convexity of the matrix function is employed. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FAULT DETECTION FOR CONTINUOUS-TIME NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH NON-IDEAL QOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400024"}
