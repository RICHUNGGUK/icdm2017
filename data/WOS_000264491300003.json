The existing classification algorithms and single level execution of them are insufficient on web data. Moreover, because of the variety in the context and structure of even common domain Websites, there is a lack of training data for these classification algorithms. In this paper, we present three experiments: (1) use information in domain ontology on the layers of classes to train classifiers (layered classification) with improvement up to 10% on accuracy of classification, (2) experiment on the problem of training dataset and use clustering as a preprocess, (3) use ensembles to benefit from both methods. Beside the improvement of accuracy in these experiments, we found that for the ensemble we can dispense with the algorithm of classification and use a simple classification like Bayes and achieve the accuracy of complex algorithms like SVM.", "paper_title": "WEB PAGES CLASSIFICATION USING DOMAIN ONTOLOGY AND CLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300003"}
