Many research studies used multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve such problems; however, they cannot achieve satisfactory results in both quality and computational speed. This paper proposes a hybrid sampling strategy-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (HSS-MOEA) to deal with the PPS problem. HSS-MOEA tactfully combines the advantages of vector evaluated genetic algorithm (VEGA) and a sampling strategy according to a new Pareto dominating and dominated relationship-based fitness function (PDDR-FF). The sampling strategy of VEGA prefers the edge region of the Pareto front and PDDR-FF-based sampling strategy has the tendency converging toward the central area of the Pareto front. These two mechanisms preserve both the convergence rate and the distribution performance. The numerical comparisons state that the HSS-MOEA is better than a generalized Pareto-based scale-independent fitness function based genetic algorithm combing with VEGA in efficacy (convergence and distribution) performance, while the efficiency is closely equivalent. Moreover, the efficacy performance of HSS-MOEA is also better than NSGA-II and SPEA2, and the efficiency is obviously better than their performance.", "paper_title": "Hybrid sampling strategy-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for process planning and scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800004"}
