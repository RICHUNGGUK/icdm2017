In other words, an adversary that can crash any subset of size at most t can prevent the processes from agreeing on t values. But what about all the other 2(2n-1) - (n + 1) adversaries that are not uniform in this sense and might crash certain combination of processes and not others? This paper presents a precise way to classify all adversaries. We introduce the notion of disagreement power: the biggest integer k for which the adversary can prevent processes from agreeing on k values. We show how to compute the disagreement power of an adversary and derive n equivalence classes of adversaries.", "paper_title": "The disagreement power of an adversary", "paper_id": "WOS:000296516700002"}
