Realization of the RDM approach has benefited greatly from recent developments in semidefinite programming (SDP). We present the actual state of this new application of SDP as well as the formulation of these SDPs, which can be arbitrarily large. Numerical results using parallel computation on high performance computers are given. The RDM method has several advantages including robustness and provision of high accuracy compared to traditional electronic structure methods, although its computational time and memory consumption are still extremely large.", "paper_title": "Large-scale semidefinite programs in electronic structure calculation", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500015"}
