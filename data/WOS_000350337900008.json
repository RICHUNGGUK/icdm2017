In the last years, continuous-time models based on discrete GARCH models have been also proposed to deal with non-equally spaced observations, as COGARCH model based on Levy processes. In this paper, we propose to use the data cloning methodology in order to obtain estimators of GARCH and COGARCH model parameters. Data cloning methodology uses a Bayesian approach to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimators avoiding numerically maximization of the pseudo-likelihood function. After a simulation study for both GARCH and COGARCH models using data cloning, we apply this technique to model the behaviour of some NASDAQ time series.", "paper_title": "Data cloning estimation of GARCH and COGARCH models", "paper_id": "WOS:000350337900008"}
