The algorithm is especially useful in estimating extreme quantiles and can be easily used to construct bootstrap confidence intervals. Empirical results on real and simulated data sets show that the proposed algorithm is not only superior to the uniform resarnpling approach, but may also provide more than an order of magnitude of computational efficiency gains.
