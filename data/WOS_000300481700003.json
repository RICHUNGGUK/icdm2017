Our model is generated from sample pose sequences of the multiple actions, each of which is recorded from real human motion. The sample sequences are connected to each other by synthesizing a variety of possible transitions among the different actions. For kinematically-realistic transitions, our model integrates nonlinear probabilistic latent modeling of the samples and interpolation-based synthesis of the transition paths. While naive interpolation makes unexpected poses, our model rejects them (1) by searching for smooth and short transition paths by employing the good properties of the observation and latent spaces and (2) by avoiding using samples that unexpectedly synthesize the nonsmooth interpolation. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated with real data and its application to human pose tracking. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
