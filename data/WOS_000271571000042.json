With increasing investments in resources for knowledge management implementation in many organizations, measuring knowledge management performance has become an important agenda among researchers and practitioners. However, the current knowledge management performance measurement methods cannot truly report the results of organizations' knowledge management efforts. To address this problem, there is a need of a better approach for measuring knowledge management performance in organizations. This paper presents the authors' recent research in using a K-user satisfaction based approach and evidential reasoning methodology to develop a user-satisfaction-based knowledge management performance measurement system for organizations to identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as enhance continuous learning. A case study in applying the developed system and methodology in primary school education has been conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
