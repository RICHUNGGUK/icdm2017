This work proposes a service-oriented vehicle infotainment dissemination management scheme to ensure the satisfaction of varied requests' service requirements in heterogeneous vehicular communication. A novel group mobility-based clustering algorithm and a service-oriented routing mechanism that fits the distinct characteristics of heterogeneous vehicular networks are proposed to enhance the quality of communication. A series of experiments was conducted and the experimental results exhibit the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed work.", "paper_title": "SERVICE-ORIENTED ROUTING AND CLUSTERING STRATEGIES FOR VEHICLE INFOTAINMENT DISSEMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600035"}
