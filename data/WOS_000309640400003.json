The contribution is threefold. First, the literature on structural results for product form over the number of tokens at the places is surveyed and rephrased completely in terms of T-invariants. Second, based on the underlying concept of group-local-balance, the product form results for stochastic Petri nets are demarcated and an intuitive explanation is provided of these results based on T-invariants, only. Third, a decomposition result is provided that is completely formulated in terms of both T-invariants and P-invariants. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
