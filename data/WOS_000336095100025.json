Unveiling its details is thus crucial to understanding signalling and metabolic pathways. The most common and powerful mechanism of protein-function regulation is allostery, which has been increasingly calling the attention of medicinal chemists due to its potential for the discovery of novel therapeutics. In this context, PARS is a simple and fast method that queries protein dynamics and structural conservation to identify pockets on a protein structure that may exert a regulatory effect on the binding of a small-molecule ligand.", "paper_title": "PARS: a web server for the prediction of Protein Allosteric and Regulatory Sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100025"}
