Although a wide variety of technical solutions and applications have been proposed, they all rely on some means of specifying links from areas within paper pages to digital services where these areas correspond to elements of the document's artwork. Various frameworks and tools are available to support the development of paper-digital applications, but they tend to either require some programming skills or focus on specific application domains. We present an advanced publishing solution that is based on an authoring rather than programming approach to the production of interactive paper documents. Our solution is fully general and we describe how it uses concepts of templates and variable content elements to reduce redundancies and increase the flexibility in developing paper-digital applications.", "paper_title": "Advanced authoring of paper-digital systems Introducing templates and variable content elements for interactive paper publishing", "paper_id": "WOS:000336995900031"}
