First, the rotational motion with an initial small disturbance is computed, and it is found that the rotational motion is unstable for high Reynolds numbers. Second, we show simple ways to control the rotational and translational motion by bending or flapping the tip of the wing.", "paper_title": "FLIGHT SIMULATIONS OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLAPPING WING BY THE IB-LBM", "paper_id": "WOS:000328285900007"}
