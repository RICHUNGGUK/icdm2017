We investigate the use of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithm (IEA) in our system, with the goal of enhancing user's creativity to generate innovative Batik-like patterns. We focus mainly on two crucial aspects of the system. First, a new representation is proposed to capture the features in Batik and create innovative patterns through evolutionary processes. Second, an out-breeding mechanism is applied to our system, in order to sustain user's interest for a longer period. Our system can search a much larger design space than other systems and can avoid being trapped in a local optimum. We describe the system in detail and the methodology we have adopted in the system. Our experimental results have shown that our newly developed system is effective and has great potentials in evolving novel Batik design.", "paper_title": "Innovative Batik Design with an Interactive Evolutionary Art System", "paper_id": "WOS:000271535700006"}
