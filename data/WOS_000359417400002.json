The mathematical model contains several ingredients particularly designed for this problem, namely, a boundary condition to model falling jets on free surfaces, an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation to account for the motion of the free surface because of demand and supply of water, and a coupling of the hydrodynamics with a convection-diffusion-reaction equation modeling the time evolution of chlorine. From the numerical point of view, the equations resulting from the mathematical model are approximated using a finite element formulation, with linear continuous interpolations on tetrahedra for all the unknowns. To make it possible, and also to be able to deal with convection-dominated flows, a stabilized formulation is used. In order to capture the sharp gradients present in the chlorine concentration, particularly near the injection zone, a discontinuity capturing technique is employed.
