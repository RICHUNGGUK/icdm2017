M2M includes a number of technologies that need to be combined in a compatible manner to enable its deployment over a broad market of consumer electronics. In order to provide better understanding for this emerging concept, the correlations among M2M, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and internet of things are first analyzed in this paper. Then, the basic M2M architecture is introduced and the key elements of the architecture are presented. Furthermore, the progress of global M2M standardization is reviewed, and some representative applications (i.e., smart home, smart grid and health care) are given to show that the M2M technologies are gradually utilized to benefit people's life. Finally, a novel M2M system integrating intelligent road with unmanned vehicle is proposed in the form of CPS, and an example of cyber-transportation systems for improving road safety and efficiency are introduced.", "paper_title": "Machine-to-Machine Communications: Architectures, Standards and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000306129700002"}
