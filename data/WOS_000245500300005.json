Especially, the higher the congestion degree in the network is, the higher the burst loss rate becomes. The burst loss performance can be improved by employing an appropriate congestion control. In this paper, to actively avoid contentions, we propose a dynamic load-aware congestion control scheme that operates based on the highest (called 'peak load') of the loads of all links over the path between each pair of ingress and egress nodes in an OBS network. We also propose an algorithm that dynamically determines a load threshold for adjusting burst sending rate, according to the traffic load in a network. Further, a simple signalling method is developed for our proposed congestion control scheme. The proposed scheme aims to (1) reduce the burst loss rate in OBS networks and (2) maintain reasonable throughput and fairness. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the burst loss rate significantly, compared to existing OBS protocols (with and without congestion control), while maintaining reasonable throughput and fairness. Simulation results also show that our scheme keeps signalling overhead due to congestion control at a low level.", "paper_title": "A dynamic load-aware congestion control scheme in optical burst switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245500300005"}
