In this study, an integrated business and engineering framework for synthesis and design of processing networks is presented. The framework employs a systematic approach to manage the complexity while solving simultaneously both the business and the engineering aspects of problems, allowing at the same time, comparison of a large number of alternatives at their optimal points. The results identify the optimal raw material, the product portfolio and select the process technology for a given market scenario together with the optimal material flows through the network and calculate the corresponding performance and sustainability metrics. The framework includes a software infrastructure for integrating different methods and tools needed for problem definition, formulation and solution of the design problem as a MINLP, reducing thereby the time and cost needed to generate and solve the design/synthesis problems and providing efficient data transfer between the tools. A generic structural process model has been implemented within the framework to describe the multidimensional engineering issues allowing thereby fast and flexible model development for various production processes. A case study from vegetable oil industry is used successfully to demonstrate the applicability of the integrated framework for making optimal business and engineering decisions.
