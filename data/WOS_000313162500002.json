It is equipped with optical switching hardware to forward information at hundreds of Gigabits/s rates and above, controlled and managed through modular and flexible procedures according to emerging standards. The possibility to test such costly optical architectures in terms of logical and physical performance, without implementing complex and expensive testbeds, is crucial to speed-up the development process of high-performance routers. To this purpose, this paper introduces the software-based emulation testbed of a programmable optical router, which is here developed and applied to test optical switching fabrics. Accurate characterization of the optical devices and physical layer aspects is implemented with the Click software router environment. Power loss and optical signal-to-noise-ratio evaluation are provided through accurate software representation of the physical characteristics of the optical devices employed. The scalability of the proposed emulation testbed is also assessed on standard PC hardware. All the obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed tool to emulate an optical router at different levels of granularity.", "paper_title": "Optical switch emulation in programmable software router testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000313162500002"}
