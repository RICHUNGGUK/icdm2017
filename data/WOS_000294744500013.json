The existing schemes are not effective when the clients' data access patterns are skewed to some items. It is because the schemes are based on flat broadcast that does not take the popularity of the data items into consideration. In this paper, thus, we propose a data scheduling scheme letting the popular items appear more frequently on the channel, and grid-based distributed index for non-flat broadcast (GDIN) for window query processing. The proposed GDIN allows quick and energy efficient processing of window query, matching the clients' linear channel access pattern and letting the clients access only the queried data items. The simulation results show that the proposed GDIN significantly outperforms the existing schemes in terms of access time, tuning time, and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Novel Air Indexing Scheme for Window Query in Non-Flat Wireless Spatial Data Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000294744500013"}
