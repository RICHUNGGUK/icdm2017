However, most question answering technologies involve in integrating rich specific external knowledge such as syntactic parsers, which are often unavailable for many languages. In this paper, we present a new string pattern matching-based passage ranking algorithm for extending traditional text Q/A toward videoQ/A. Users interact with our videoQ/A system through natural language questions whereas our system returns three sentence-length passages with corresponding video clips as answers. We collect 45 GB Discovery videos and 253 Chinese questions for evaluation. The experimental results showed that our method outperformed six top-performed ranking models. It is 7.39% better than the second best method (language model-based) in relatively MRR score and 6.12% in precision rate. Besides, we also show that the use of a trained Chinese word segmentation tool did decrease the overall videoQ/A performance where most ranking algorithms dropped at least 10% in relatively MRR, precision, and answer pattern recall rates.
