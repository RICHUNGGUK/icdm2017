In this work, we study the transmission characteristics and improve transmission performances of Internet-bound traffic in a MPLS-TP network. Our contributions include 1) differentiating and analyzing multiclass self-similar traffic and its quality of user experience (QoE) requests, 2) studying the influences of payload length of time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuit emulation traffic in the network and proposing a novel length adjustment scheme, and 3) proposing a novel bandwidth-efficient algorithm for scheduling of multiclass self-similar traffic. Our work improves the network transport performance by optimizing two aspects, TDM payload size and scheduling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Packet-Level Optimization for Transmission Performance Improvement of Internet-Bound Traffic in a MPLS-TP Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000285516500012"}
