The dual-mode cavity resonator acting as one resonator for both Rx and Tx filters is developed to generate two resonant modes (TE102 and TE103) at the center frequency of Rx (56.5-58.5 GHz) and Tx (64-66 GHz) channels, separately. Meanwhile, this dual-mode cavity becomes the interconnect between Rx/Tx channels and help to realize good isolation without using conventional T-junction. In the measurement, each filter designed for Rx and Tx channels exhibits excellent performance. Channel-to-channel isolations better than 35 dB across the Rx band and better than 32.5 dB across the Tx band are also obtained. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
