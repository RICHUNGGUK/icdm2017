New protocols now exist that can generate overlapping pair-end reads. By joining the 30 ends of each read pair, one is able to construct longer reads for assembling. However, effectively joining two overlapped pair-end reads remains a challenging task. Result: In this article, we present an efficient tool called Connecting Overlapped Pair-End (COPE) reads, to connect overlapping pair-end reads using k-mer frequencies. We evaluated our tool on 30x simulated pair-end reads from Arabidopsis thaliana with 1% base error. COPE connected over 99% of reads with 98.8% accuracy, which is, respectively, 10 and 2% higher than the recently published tool FLASH. When COPE is applied to real reads for genome assembly, the resulting contigs are found to have fewer errors and give a 14-fold improvement in the N50 measurement when compared with the contigs produced using unconnected reads.", "paper_title": "COPE: an accurate k-mer-based pair-end reads connection tool to facilitate genome assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000311303500002"}
