We succeed in finding a general expression for the number of such permutations in terms of (several) sums of determinants. We then generalize the class of skew Young tableaux under consideration; this allows in particular to recover a formula for Eulerian numbers which is a direct consequence of a result of MacMahon.", "paper_title": "On the enumeration of d-minimal permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327033900003"}
