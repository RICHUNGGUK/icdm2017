We show that any multilinear homogeneous depth-4 arithmetic formula computing the product of d generic matrices of size n x n, IMMn,d, has size n(Omega(root d)) as long as d = n(O(1)). This improves the result of Nisan and Wigderson [Comput. Complexity, 6 (1997), pp. 217-234] for depth-4 set-multilinear formulas. We also study Sigma Pi([O(d/t)])Sigma Pi([t]) formulas, which are depth-4 formulas with the stated bounds on the fanins of the. gates. A recent depth reduction result of Tavenas [Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 8087, 2013, pp. 813-824] shows that any n-variate degree d = n(O(1)) polynomial computable by a circuit of size poly(n)can also be computed by a depth-4 Sigma Pi([O(d/t)])Sigma Pi([t]) formula of top fan-in n(O(d/t)). We show that any such formula computing IMMn,d has top fan-in n(Omega(d/t)), proving the optimality of Tavenas' result. This also strengthens a result of Kayal, Saha, and Saptharishi [Proceedings of STOC, 2014, pp. 146-153], which gives a similar lower bound for an explicit polynomial in VNP.", "paper_title": "LOWER BOUNDS FOR DEPTH-4 FORMULAS COMPUTING ITERATED MATRIX MULTIPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000364454500001"}
