Packets suffer from excessive recirculation through FDLs, and they may be dropped eventually in their routing paths. Because of this, packet scheduling becomes more difficult in FDL buffers than in RAM buffers, and requires additional design considerations for reducing packet loss. We propose a latency-aware scheduling scheme and an analytical model for all-optical packet switching networks with FDL buffers. The latency-aware scheduling scheme is intended to minimize the packet loss rate of the networks by ranking packets in the optimal balance between latency and residual distance. The analytical model is based on non-homogeneous Markovian analysis to study the effect of the proposed scheduling scheme on packet loss rate and average delay. Furthermore, our numerical results show how various network parameters affect the optimal balance. We demonstrate quantitatively how to achieve the proper balance between latency and residual distance so that the network performance can be improved significantly. For instance, we find that under a given latency limit and light traffic load our scheduling scheme achieves a packet loss rate 71% lower than a scheduling scheme that ranks packets simply based on latency.", "paper_title": "A latency-aware scheduling algorithm for all-optical packet switching networks with FDL buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000286471800008"}
