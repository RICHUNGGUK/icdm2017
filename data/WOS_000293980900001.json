We show that asymptotic stability is equivalent to the existence of a vector Lyapunov functional satisfying certain positivity conditions together with its divergence along the system trajectories. We use the behavioral framework and the calculus of quadratic difference forms based on four-variable polynomial algebra.", "paper_title": "Lyapunov stability analysis of higher-order 2-D systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293980900001"}
