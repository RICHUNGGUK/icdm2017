First we show that several versions of the s - t path/trail problem have polynomial Solutions including the shortest path/trail case. We give polynomial algorithms for finding a longest properly edge-colored path/trail between s and t for a particular class of graphs and characterize edge-colored graphs without properly edge-colored closed trails. Next, we prove that deciding whether there exist k pairwise vertex/edge disjoint properly edge-colored s - t paths/trails in a c-edge-colored graph G(c) is NP-complete even for k = 2 and c = Omega(n(2)), where n denotes the number of vertices in G(c). Moreover, we prove that these problems remain NP-complete for c-edge-colored graphs containing no properly edge-colored cycles and c = Omega(n). We obtain some approximation results for those maximization problems together with polynomial results for some particular classes of edge-colored graphs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
