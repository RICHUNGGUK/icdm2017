Both delay-dependent and delay-independent criteria are presented such that the resulting error system is globally asymptotically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance. The desired estimator matrix gain can be characterized in terms of the solution to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical examples are addressed to show the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
