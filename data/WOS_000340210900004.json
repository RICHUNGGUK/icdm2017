Real-world citation data from different countries are studied. It is found that at the country level, a small set of publications generate a disproportionately large amount of citations. Although different countries have different e(2)/h(2) values in different fields, average e(2)/h(2) values are all above 1. The e(2)/h values vary widely between fields, reflecting the general citation density in these fields. For cumulative data e(2)/h(2) and e(2)/h values each converge quickly. Neither a shifted Zipf nor an exponential model could fit the data.", "paper_title": "A Preliminary Study of the Relationship between the h-Index and Excess Citations", "paper_id": "WOS:000340210900004"}
