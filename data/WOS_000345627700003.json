The capacity of a BM can be one or two. Aiming at finding an optimal one-wafer cyclic schedule, this paper explores the effect of two-space BMs on the performance of a multi-cluster tool. A Petri net (PN) model is developed to model it by extending resource-oriented PNs. The dynamic behavior of robot waiting and tasks, process modules, and buffers is well described by the model. This paper shows that there is always a one-wafer cyclic schedule that reaches the lower bound of the cycle time of a process-bound tool. Furthermore, a closed-form algorithm is revealed to find such a schedule for the first time for such multi-cluster tools. Illustrative examples are given to show the application and power of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Optimal One-Wafer Cyclic Scheduling of Single-Arm Multicluster Tools With Two-Space Buffering Modules", "paper_id": "WOS:000345627700003"}
