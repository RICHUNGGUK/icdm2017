From this design space exploration, an innovative TPC decoder architecture without any interleaving resource is presented. This architecture includes a fully-parallel SISO decoder capable of processing n symbols in one clock period. Syntheses results show the better efficiency of such an architecture compared with existing solutions. Considering a six-iteration turbo decoder of a BCH(32,26)(2) product code, synthesized in 90 nm CMOS technology, 10 Gb/s can be achieved with an area of 600 Kgates. Moreover, a second architecture enhancing parallelism rate is described. The throughput is 50 Gb/s while an area estimation gives 2.2 Mgates. Finally, comparisons with existing TPC decoders and existing LDPC decoders are performed. They validate the potential of proposed TPC decoder for Gb/s optical fiber transmission systems.", "paper_title": "Turbo Product Code Decoder Without Interleaving Resource: From Parallelism Exploration to High Efficiency Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000290452300002"}
