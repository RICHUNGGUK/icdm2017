The typical solutions are authenticated key agreement protocols, designed to efficiently implement secure channels for two or more parties communicating via a public network by providing them with a shared secret key, called a session key. In this paper, we propose two key agreement schemes based on elliptic curve cryptosystems suited for mobile environments. The first one is an identity-based remote mutual authentication with key agreement scheme, and it is used to establish a session key between the client and the server. In the second one, we extend the proposed two-party authentication key exchange scheme to develop an efficient three-party authenticated key agreement scheme for establishing a session key between two users with the help of a trusted server. Both our proposed schemes achieve efficiency, practicability, simplicity, and strong notions of security.", "paper_title": "Two ID-based authenticated schemes with key agreement for mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100023"}
