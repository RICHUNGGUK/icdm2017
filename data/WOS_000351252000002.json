The information components and gates are defined in a similar way as components in electrical or mechanical engineering. Such approach enables the creation of complex networks through their serial, parallel or feedback ordering. Taking into account wave probabilistic functions in analogy with quantum physics, we can enrich the system theory with features such as entanglement. It is shown that such approach can explain emergencies and self-organization properties of complex systems.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS COMPLEX SYSTEM THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000351252000002"}
