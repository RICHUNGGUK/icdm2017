The proposed circuit is capable of performing multiplication, squaring, division, and different types of controllable gain amplifiers. The design is based on translinear principle using MOSFETs operating in subthreshold region. The proposed design is compact and operates from +/- 0.6 V DC power supply. The functionality of the design was confirmed using Tanner Tspice with 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the -3 dB frequency is around 1.5 MHz, linearity error of 0.63 %, THD of 0.08 % when configured as an amplifier, and the maximum power consumption is 1.16 mu W.", "paper_title": "A compact CMOS current-mode analog multi-functions circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000359013100013"}
