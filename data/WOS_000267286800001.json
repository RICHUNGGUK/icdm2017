We classify the optimisation problem into five sub-problems: feeder setup, component placement sequencing, nozzle optimisation, component retrieval plan and motion control; and analyse issues relevant to each of these. One of the aims of this article is to provide guidance to other researchers and gain a deeper understanding of the various optimisation issues that arise in this domain. This could lead to the design of improved heuristics, which are more appropriate to the real-world scheduling problem of the SMD placement machine.", "paper_title": "The optimisation of the single surface mount device placement machine in printed circuit board assembly: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000267286800001"}
