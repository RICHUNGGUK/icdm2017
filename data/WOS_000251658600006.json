Personalization allows users to browse programs much more efficiently according to their taste. It also enables to build social networks that can improve the performance of current P2P systems considerably, by increasing content availability, trust and the realization of proper incentives to exchange content. This paper presents a novel scheme, called BuddyCast, that builds such a social network for a user by exchanging user interest profiles using exploitation and exploration principles. Additionally, we show how the interest of a user in TV programs can be predicted from the zapping behavior by the introduced user-item relevance models, thereby avoiding the explicit rating of TV programs. Further, we present how the social network of a user can be used to realize a truly distributed recommendation of TV programs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel user interface for the personalized peer-to-peer television system that encompasses a personalized tag-based navigation to browse the available distributed content. The user interface also visualizes the social network of a user, thereby increasing community feeling which increases trust amongst users and within available content and creates incentives of to exchange content within the community.", "paper_title": "Personalization on a peer-to-peer television system", "paper_id": "WOS:000251658600006"}
