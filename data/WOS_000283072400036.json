First we show that when the first column of a Sylvester Hadamard matrix of order 2(m), m >= 2, a positive integer, is removed, the number of shift distinct row vectors in the matrix is given by 2(m) - m. Then, for m >= 4, we construct an infinite family of Hadamard matrices with a property that when the first column of the Hadamard matrix is removed, all the row vectors of the matrix are shift distinct. These Hadamard matrices are useful in constructing low correlation zone sequences.", "paper_title": "On the Noncyclic Property of Sylvester Hadamard Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400036"}
