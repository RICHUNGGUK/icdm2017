On the other hand, the development of the IEEE 802.21 Standard, which facilitates the interoperability between different access networks, assures further performance improvements. In this scenario, Network Selection is the action of choosing the best Radio Access Network (RAN) among a set of available heterogeneous radio links. Within this topic, the main contribution of this paper is a performance comparison, obtained through a simulator developed by using Network Simulator 2, among different network selection algorithms, within the framework of the 802.21 standard.", "paper_title": "Performance Comparison of Network Selection Algorithms in the Framework of the 802.21 Standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000358594700006"}
