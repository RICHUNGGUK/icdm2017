Usually, it is either under- or overconstrained because design is a progressive process and it is difficult for a designer to specify all involved constraints in a consistent way. This paper presents a priority-based graph-reduction solution, in which each constraint is assigned with a priority to guide the reduction of a geometric constraint graph. The advantage of this method lies in its ability to find the optimal solutions to a geometric constraint system automatically, without requiring interactive intervention from users.", "paper_title": "Priority-based geometric constraint satisfaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000251787300004"}
