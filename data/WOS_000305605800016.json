The proposed DCC consists of a duty-cycle detector, a duty-cycle adjuster, its controller and an output buffer. In order to achieve fast duty-correction with a small die area, a SAR-controller is exploited as a duty-correction controller. The proposed DCC circuit has been implemented and fabricated in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process and occupies 0.048 mm(2). The measured duty-cycle error for the 50% duty-rate is below +/- 1% (or +/- 10 pS) within +/- 320 pS external input duty-cycle error. The duty of output signal is corrected only with 14 cycles. This DCC operates from 312.5 MHz to 1 GHz and dissipates 3.2 mW at 1 GHz.", "paper_title": "A 0.31-1 GHz Fast-Corrected Duty-Cycle Corrector With Successive Approximation Register for DDR DRAM Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000305605800016"}
