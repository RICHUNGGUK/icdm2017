Design/methodology/approach - The induced power distributions are analysed and the main heating parameters are estimated with reference to an infinitely long Al billet 200 mm diameter. The paper refers to the activity developed in the frame of a National Italian Project carried out by research groups of the Universities of Bologna, Padua and Roma \"La Sapienza.\" Findings - The main process parameters have been evaluated for the heating up to 500 degrees C of an Al billet 200 mm diameter. Practical implications - This innovative technology appears to be very promising for improving the efficiency of the through heating of high-conductivity metals (e.g. copper, aluminum) before hot working, by using superconducting magnets. Originality/value - The paper analyses the induction heating of a infinitely long billet rotating in a uniform DC magnetic field.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic and thermal analysis of the induction heating of aluminum billets rotating in DC magnetic field", "paper_id": "WOS:000254663100015"}
