Collaboration is an intrinsic characteristic of CR to improve network performance. For instance, in collaborative spectrum sensing, SU hosts generate sensing outcomes, and collaborate amongst themselves through making final decisions at a decision fusion center in order to improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. The requirement to collaborate has inevitably opened doors to various forms of attacks by malicious SUs, and this critical issue can be addressed using trust and reputation management (TRM), and so this is the focus of this article. Generally speaking, TRM detects malicious SUs, including honest SUs that turn malicious. Hence, TRM is of paramount importance in most kinds of schemes that require collaboration in CR networks. Our contribution in this article is as follows. This article provides an extensive survey on the application of TRM in various schemes in CR networks in order to ameliorate the effects of malicious SUs in collaboration. The discussion is presented with respect to a TRM taxonomy, various approaches to achieve TRM, various attack models, as well as the challenges and characteristics associated with TRM. Because of the significance of TRM in collaboration, this article presents a wide range of open issues to warrant further research in this area.
