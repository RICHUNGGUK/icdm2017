Software packages are available for postprocessing an image stack into the final image, but the stack images are normally shot either with (typically expensive) automated equipment or by a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone procedures. This paper discusses the construction of an autonomous stacker with inexpensive preassembled electronics and a moderate amount of mechanical construction, and its C++ software. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
