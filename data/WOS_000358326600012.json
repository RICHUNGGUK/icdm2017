Our solution presents several desirable features: it preserves the stability of the original filters; is well-conditioned for low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters alike; its cost is linear in the number of samples and is not affected by the size of the filter support. Our method is general and works with any non-uniformly sampled signal and any recursive digital filter defined by a difference equation. Since our formulation directly uses the filter coefficients, it works out-of-the-box with existing methodologies for digital filter design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by filtering non-uniformly sampled signals in various image and video processing tasks including edge-preserving color filtering, noise reduction, stylization, and detail enhancement. Our formulation enables, for the first time, edge-aware evaluation of any recursive infinite impulse response digital filter (not only low-pass), producing high-quality filtering results in real time.", "paper_title": "High-Order Recursive Filtering of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals for Image and Video Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358326600012"}
