Resource allocation, structure optimization and technology management can often apply these functions. In optimization problems the objective functions can be considered by monomials. In this paper, we present monomials geometric programming with fuzzy relation inequalities constraint with max-product composition. Simplification operations have been given to accelerate the resolution of the problem by removing the components having no effect on the solution process. Also, an algorithm and a few practical examples are presented to abbreviate and illustrate the steps of the problem resolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
