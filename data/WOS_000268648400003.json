The algorithm provides an effective reduction of the decomposition of difference polynomials to the decomposition of linear difference polynomials over the same coefficient field. The algorithm is implemented in Maple for the constant coefficient case. Experimental results show that the algorithm is quite effective and can be used to decompose difference polynomials with thousands of terms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
