A model is useless unless it is formulated correctly and feasible. A simple solution procedure of a model also plays an important role in its application. This article highlights an erroneous formulation of an inventory model developed with fixed and variable lead time crash costs under unknown demand distribution, and also demonstrates its infeasibility. To attain feasibility we extend the model to include a constraint. Then, we present an alternative simple solution technique of the modified model and carry out a comparative study on a numerical example to show its potential significance.", "paper_title": "An alternative simple solution algorithm of an inventory model with fixed and variable lead time crash costs under unknown demand distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000268935000003"}
