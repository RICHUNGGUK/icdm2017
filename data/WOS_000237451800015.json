Typically, the forecasting is performed at \"global level,\" by gathering data in a large geographical region and by studying their evolution, thus foreseeing the meteorological situation in a certain place. In this paper a \"local level\" approach, based on time series forecasting using Type-2 Fuzzy Systems, is proposed. In particular temperature forecasting is inspected. The Fuzzy System is trained by means of historical local time series. The algorithm uses a detrend procedure in order to extract the chaotic component to be predicted.", "paper_title": "Short term local meteorological forecasting using type-2 fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800015"}
