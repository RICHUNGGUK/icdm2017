Investigation of the spatial attributes of the mineralization using multifractal methods, integrated within a GIS, provides new information, of potential interest to understand the distribution of VMS deposits. A new probability map was generated from three binary maps by weighting the geological constraints of the VMS deposits using the weights-of-evidence method (WofE). The resulting map can be considered a prospectivity map of the Spanish segment of the IPB. The aim of this study was to simulate the distribution of VMS deposits using a simple multifractal model, a multiplicative scaling cascade, based on the De Wijs scheme of the ore concentration. The application was developed and implemented in a GIS. Multifractal functions such as the generalized dimension (D(q)) and the f(alpha) spectrum are different depending on whether or not the geological constraints are considered. The use of the probability map together with the results from the multifractal analysis has generated realistic simulations of the spatial distribution of VMS mineralization in the Spanish segment of the IPB.
