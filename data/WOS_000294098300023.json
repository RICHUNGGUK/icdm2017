The model used is robust in terms of electrochemical variables prediction rather than only the electrical ones. This enables us to analyze the internal behavior of the battery under different discharge rates. The method of lines (MOL) was used for predicting the behavior from the model without any loss of exactitude for regular geometries. The boundary conditions were modified to achieve a better convergence of the solver. The simulation results were compared to experimental data from the research literature. Some examples of application are also presented that include the simulation for the optimization of design parameters, the evaluation of the behavior of the battery under dynamic discharge rates simulating real simplified conditions of operation and the simulation of the parallel discharge of different capacity pairs of batteries.
