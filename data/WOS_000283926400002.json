The framework generalizes the recently proposed Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)-based framework [34], [35] adapting it to the time-series scenario by utilizing tensor analysis for data transformation. The proposed framework is effective in yielding criteria that can identify both the differentially expressed genes and time-course patterns of interest between two time-series experiments without requiring to explicitly cluster the data. The results, obtained by applying the proposed framework with a linear kernel formulation, on various data sets are found to be both biologically meaningful and consistent with published studies.", "paper_title": "A General Framework for Analyzing Data from Two Short Time-Series Microarray Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000283926400002"}
