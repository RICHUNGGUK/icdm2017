In this case data can be understood as a time series of one feature. It is no exception when the clue for evaluation of such data is related to their development trends as observed in several successive time points. From the qualitative point of view one can distinguish three basic types of behaviour between two neighbouring time points: the value of the feature is stable (remains the same), it grows or it falls. This paper is concerned with identification of typical qualitative development patterns as they appear in the windows of given length in the considered time-stamped data and their utilization for specification of interesting subgroups.", "paper_title": "Visualization of trends using RadViz", "paper_id": "WOS:000299002800005"}
