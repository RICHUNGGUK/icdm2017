The generalized REM (GREM) extends the REM in that it introduces correlations between energy levels in an hierarchical structure. In this paper, we explore some analogies between the behavior of the GREM and that of code ensembles which have parallel hierarchical structures. In particular, in analogy to the fact that the GREM may have different types of phase transition effects, depending on the parameters of the model, then the above-mentioned hierarchical code ensembles behave substantially differently in the various domains of the design parameters of these codes. We make an attempt to explore the insights that can be imported from the statistical mechanics of the GREM and be harnessed to serve for code design considerations and guidelines.", "paper_title": "The Generalized Random Energy Model and its Application to the Statistical Physics of Ensembles of Hierarchical Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600024"}
