To solve such problems, we extend to the interval uncertainty setting the obligation rules from the theory of minimum cost spanning tree problems, and study their cost monotonicity and stability properties. We also present an application to a simulated ad hoc wireless network using a software implementation of an appealing obligation rule, the P-value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
