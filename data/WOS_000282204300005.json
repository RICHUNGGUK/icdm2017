Numerical experiments show that the new method is sufficiently precise and free from singularity and non-convergency, except within 50 km of the geocentre. After one iteration, the maximum error of latitude is less than 10(-8) arc-sec and the relative height error is less than 10(-15) over the range of geodetic heights from -10(6) to 10(12) in. Comparisons of the complexity and performance with some other well-known methods indicate that the algorithm is efficient and accurate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
