Most of the extraction programs use pattern-matching methods which introduces an improvable error factor due to the pattern interpolation, and an intrinsically inescapable error factor from the difference of boundary conditions in the electro-magnetic field solver. Here, we study impact of the intrinsic error on timing and crosstalk noise estimation. We experimentally show that the resulting delay and noise estimation errors show a scatter which is normally distributed. Values of the standard deviations will help designers consider the intrinsic error compared with other variation factors.", "paper_title": "Impact of intrinsic parasitic extraction errors on timing and noise estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600035"}
