Through 2 case studies we show how information and the genres used for communicating that information was perceived and used by the relevant agents involved with the genres. Based on the case studies, we conclude by discussing how the fields of information history and rhetorical genre theory can inform each other.", "paper_title": "Understanding information history from a genre-theoretical perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000361184500007"}
