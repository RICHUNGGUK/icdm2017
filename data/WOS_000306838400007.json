The applicability of current-based synapse model for studying post-transient behavior of neural networks is discussed in terms of average synaptic current strength induced by per spike during one firing cycle of a neuron (or briefly per spike synaptic current strength). It was found that current-based synapse models are applicable in both situations where both the interspike intervals of the neurons and the distribution of firing times of the neurons are uniform, and where the firing of all neurons is synchronized. If neither the interspike intervals nor the distribution of firing times of the neurons is uniform or the reversal potential is between the rest and threshold potentials, current-based synapse models may be oversimplified.", "paper_title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APPLICABILITY OF CURRENT-BASED SYNAPSES AND UNIFORMITY OF FIRING PATTERNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838400007"}
