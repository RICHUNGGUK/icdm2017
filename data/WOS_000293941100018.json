A piston-type wave maker is used to generate the incident solitary wave. Potential flow is assumed in the fluid domain. Close agreement is obtained between numerical predictions and previously published experimental measurements of wave interaction with the obstacle and the inclined bed. A parameter study examines the effect of obstacle height on wave evolution. The results demonstrate that the pseudospectral a-transformation model can simulate accurately the interaction of the nonlinear solitary wave with a submerged obstacle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
