The VBS systems deal with financial streams and this thing make them different from the conventional systems. The success of a VBS system is associated with a valuable set of requirements. The valuable requirements can only be gathered from success critical stakeholders. To select a set of success critical stakeholders, different stakeholders identification and quantification (SIQ) approaches are presented by the researchers. The current approaches cannot be adopted as a standard as different methods and processes are adopted in different approaches. In this study, the aim is to find out the reported evidence based attributes or characteristics of the stakeholders and their usage context in terms of their application in different domains, stakeholders' quantification metrics, the reported stakeholder types and the reported issues of VBS development. The standard systematic literature review guidelines are used as given by Barbara Kitchenham. The literature evidence shows that there is a need to explore all the possible stakeholders' attributes. The stakeholders' metrics can be derived by using the stakeholders' attributes and a new SIQ framework can be proposed for the VBS systems.", "paper_title": "Stakeholder management in value-based software development: systematic review", "paper_id": "WOS:000345710500003"}
