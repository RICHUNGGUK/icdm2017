One model has not been integrated into this framework: the causal trees of Darondeau and Degano. Here we fill this gap. In particular, we show that there is an adjunction from causal trees to event structures, which we bring to light via a mediating model, that of event trees. Further, we achieve an open map characterization of history preserving bisimilarity: the latter is captured by the natural instantiation of the abstract bisimilarity for causal trees.
