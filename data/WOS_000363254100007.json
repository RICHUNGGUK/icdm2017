Particularly, each node in an uplink cellular network injects two types of traffic, confidential and open at rates chosen in order to maximize a global utility function while keeping the data queues stable and meeting a constraint on the secrecy outage probability. The transmitting node only knows the distribution of channel gains. Our scheme is based on Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) transmission with incremental redundancy. We prove that our scheme achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the analytical results and to show the efficacy of the dynamic control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Confidentiality-Preserving Control of Uplink Cellular Wireless Networks Using Hybrid ARQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100007"}
