Existing denoising algorithms typically rely on a single noise model, and do not generalize to the composite noise sources typically found in real-world echocardiograms. Our methods leverage the low-dimensional intrinsic structure of echocardiogram videos. We assume that echocardiogram images are noisy samples from an underlying manifold parametrized by cardiac motion and denoise images via back-projection onto a learned (non-linear) manifold. Our methods incorporate synchronized side information (e.g., electrocardiography), which is often collected alongside the visual data. We evaluate the proposed methods on a synthetic data set and real-world echocardiograms. Quantitative results show improved performance of our methods over recent image de-speckling methods and video denoising methods, and a visual analysis of real-world data shows noticeable image enhancement, even in the challenging case of noise due to dropout artifacts.
