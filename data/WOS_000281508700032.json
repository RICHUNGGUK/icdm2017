The optimization of resource distribution has become a hot topic, when virtual machines substitute the traditional tasks in the cluster. Virtual User Environment (VUE) is our implementation based on the concept of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). This paper describes the ESPM (Expanding, Squeezing, Placement and Migration) policy to increase the resource utilization of the virtual cluster and shorten the response time of users in rush hours in VUE. The expanding policy aims to expand the coverage of service when users flood into the system; the squeezing policy aims to maintain the resource utilization at a high level; the placement and migration policy solve the multi-resource load balancing problem in order to achieve better system performance. Experiments and simulations show the good performance of ESPM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
