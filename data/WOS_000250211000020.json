We first introduce the basis sequence generation procedure in which the chosen patches from the input texture image are stitched on the output frame via blended alpha mattes formed by minimum error cuts. All the frames in the generated basis sequence are toroidal. We then employ the probabilities of similarity and transition links to generate an inexhaustible sequence with quasi-periodic quality. To ensure the smoothness of frame-to-frame transition, we interpolate natural metamorphosis in each transition link using the efficient automatic morphing technique which solves the problem of morphing between chaotic textures with obscure features. In addition, the proposed method allows users to simply and promptly control the motion parameters and interactively render the landscape animations. We combine the proposed approach with the color transfer technique to augment the visual gratification. Several examples including scenes for cloud, fire, and water are presented to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, and controllable for synthesizing temporal textures.
