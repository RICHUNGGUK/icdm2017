The set P determines a Voronoi tiling of R(n). Construct an infinite graph 9 with vertex set P and edges joining vertices when the corresponding Voronoi cells share a (n - 1)-dimensional boundary face. We consider bond percolation models on g obtained by declaring each edge xy of G open independently with probability p(parallel to x - y parallel to), depending only on the Euclidean distance parallel to x - y parallel to between the vertices. We give some sufficient conditions on p(t) that ensures that an infinite connected component (i.e., percolation) occurs, or does not occur. In particular, we show that for p(t) p is a constant, there is a phase transition at a critical probability p = p(c)(n), where 2(-n)(5n log n)(-1) <= p(c)(n) <= C2(-n) root nlog n. We also show that if p(t) = e(-lambda t) then there is a phase transition at a critical parameter lambda = lambda(c)(n), where lambda(c)(n) = (log(e) 2 + o(1))n/2r(n), where r(n) is the radius of the n-dimensional sphere that, on average, contains a single point of P.
