Unlike existing information brokerage schemes, RDRIB guarantees successful data retrieval without using any boundary detection algorithm and the geographic location information acquired by the global positioning system (GPS). In RDRIB, the double-ruling technique is used to replicate and retrieve the data within a constructed virtual boundary, and simulations show that RDRIB has good performance in terms of the replication memory overhead, the replication message overhead, the retrieval message overhead, the retrieval latency, and the construction message overhead.", "paper_title": "GPS-Free, Boundary-Recognition-Free, and Reliable Double-Ruling-Based Information Brokerage Scheme in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303165900011"}
