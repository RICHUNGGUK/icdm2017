Convergence of these methods is shown in the context of solving singular and nonsingular linear systems. These methods are suitable for parallel computation. Experiments related to finding stationary probability distribution of Markov chains are performed. These experiments demonstrate that the parallel implementation of these methods can solve singular systems of linear equations in substantially less time than the sequential counterparts.
