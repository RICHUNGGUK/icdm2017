We specifically address higher order local autocorrelation (HLAC) features, which are used in various applications. The original HLAC features are restricted up to the second order and are represented by 25 mask patterns. We increase their orders up to eight and extract the extended HLAC features using 223 mask patterns. Furthermore, we create large mask patterns and construct multi-resolution features to support large displacement regions. In texture classification and face recognition, the proposed method outperformed Gaussian Markov random fields, Gabor features, and local binary pattern operator.
