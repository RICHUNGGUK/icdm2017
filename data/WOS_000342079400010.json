Several example circuits are studied, where mixing of nonlinear distortion from one harmonic band to another is important. In some circuits the band-to-band mixing can be employed to reduce the overall distortion.", "paper_title": "Analysis of band-to-band mixing distortion contributions in some usual circuit topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400010"}
