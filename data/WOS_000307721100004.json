This paper utilizes the idea of using chaotic systems instead of random processes in the imperialist competitive algorithm. The resulting method is called chaotic imperialist competitive algorithm (CICA) in which chaotic maps are utilized to improve the movement step of the algorithm. Some well-studied truss structures are chosen to evaluate the efficiency of the new algorithm.", "paper_title": "Chaotic imperialist competitive algorithm for optimum design of truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000307721100004"}
