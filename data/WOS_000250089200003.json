Authorities want to determine where to locate the facilities of a social infrastructure network and what should be the capacity of these facilities. Each user must be assigned to its closest facility and, to be economically viable, each facility must serve at least a pre-specified level of demand. The objective is to maximize the accessibility to facilities (i.e., to minimize the distance traveled by users to reach the facilities). A location model that captures the above features is formulated and different solution methods are tested. Among the methods tested, tabu search and a specialized local search heuristic provided the best solutions. The application of the model is illustrated through a case study involving the location of preschools in the municipality of Miranda do Corvo, Portugal.", "paper_title": "Social infrastructure planning: A location model and solution methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000250089200003"}
