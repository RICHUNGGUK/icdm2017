To re-couple these codes, a load surface method is provided here to transfer temperature across the interface of arbitrarily meshed CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and CSM (Computational Structural Mechanics) models. The idea of the method is to transfer temperature by a Bi-cubic B-spline surface, fitted from the CFD temperature results of interfaces in parametric space. The temperature of the CSM nodes of the interface is calculated from the load surface in the same parametric space. An important step in this transfer method is to map the CFD and CSM nodes into the same parametric space. The mapping surface method is detailed for this purpose. In the mapping method, the nodes are mapped onto a structured quad mesh, called a mapping surface, which is additionally generated on the interface surface. Then, the nodes are mapped into the parametric space, which is defined by a parameterization of the mapping surface. To evaluate the accuracy of the method, the temperature of a turbine blade is transferred experimentally. The result indicates that the method is accurate even for coarse meshes.
