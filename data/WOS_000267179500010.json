By utilizing radio frequency identification (RFID), a QAS may be able to detect, and even prevent, quality problems more effectively than the traditional quality assurance system. The proposed framework provides a structure for an RFID-based QAS that allows on-site staff to monitor complicated variations in production process by handling numerous possible abnormalities simultaneously. Two industry applications are provided to demonstrate using of the proposed framework.
