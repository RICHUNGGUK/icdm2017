Lack of discriminative details in the visual appearance of the LR target leads to the matching ambiguity, which confronts most existing tracking methods. Although artificially enhancing the video resolution by superresolution (SR) techniques before analyzing might be an option, the high demand of computational cost can hardly meet the requirements of the tracking scenario. This paper presents a novel solution to track LR targets without explicitly performing SR. This new approach is based on discriminative metric preservation that preserves the data affinity structure in the high-resolution (HR) feature space for effective and efficient matching of LR images. In addition, we substantialize this new approach in a solid case study of differential tracking under metric preservation and derive a closed-form solution to motion estimation for LR video. In addition, this paper extends the basic linear metric preservation method to a more powerful nonlinear kernel metric preservation method. Such a solution to LR target tracking is discriminative, robust, and efficient. Extensive experiments validate the entrustments and effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method in tracking LR targets.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Metric Preservation for Tracking Low-Resolution Targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000300510800031"}
