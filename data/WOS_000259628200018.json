In order to construct the cartoons smoothly, the character's edge distance and motion direction distance are demonstrated to be the factors affecting tire human perception ill similarity evaluation, and utilized in cartoon clips synthesis. When applying the generated cartoons to tire background image, in which tire perspective exists, the size of the character is coordinated according to the scaling factor calculated from tire vanishing lute. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach call synthesize the cartoon: clips more smoothly compared With other single frame reusing strategies. The generated cartoons, which are applied to tire background image, call be accepted by the human perception well.
