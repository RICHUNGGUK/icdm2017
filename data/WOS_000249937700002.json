This is the basic concept that enables the controlled fine soft tissue manipulation that is needed in bypass grafting and valve surgery. In 2005, a total of 2984 cardiac procedures were performed worldwide using the da Vinci system. This includes totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TECAB), mitral valve repair (MVR) procedures, ASD closure and cardiac tissue ablation for atrial fibrillation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
