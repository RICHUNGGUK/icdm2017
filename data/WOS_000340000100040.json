While fully sampling these large spaces is infeasible, we observe that in practical applications, such as gameplay, users explore only a vanishingly small subset of the dynamical state space. In this paper we present a sampling approach that takes advantage of this observation by concentrating precomputation around the states that users are most likely to encounter. We demonstrate our technique in a prototype self-refining game whose dynamics improve with play, ultimately providing realistically rendered, rich fluid dynamics in real time on a mobile device. Our results show that our analytics-driven training approach yields lower model error and fewer visual artifacts than a heuristic training strategy.", "paper_title": "Self-Refining Games using Player Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100040"}
