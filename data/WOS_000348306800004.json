However, the lowest energy Cp2Re2H2 structure by more than 12 kcal mol(-1) has one terminal eta(5)-Cp ring, a bridging eta(3),eta(2)-Cp ring, and two terminal hydride ligands bonded to the same Re atom. The lowest energy hydride-free Cp2Re2 structure is a perpendicular structure with two bridging eta(3),eta(2)-Cp rings. The previously predicted bent singlet Cp2Re2 structure with terminal eta(5)-Cp rings and a formal Re-Re sextuple bond lies similar to 37 kcal mol(-1) above this lowest energy (eta(3),eta(2)-Cp)(2)Re-2 structure. The thermochemistry of the CpReHn and Cp2Re2Hn systems is consistent with the reported synthesis of the permethylated derivatives Cp*ReH6 and Cp-2*Re2H6 (Cp* = eta(5)-Me5C5) as very stable compounds. Additionally, natural bond orbital analysis, atoms-in-molecules and overlap population density-of-state in AOMIX were applied to present the existence of rhenium-rhenium multiple bonds.", "paper_title": "Binuclear cyclopentadienylrhenium hydride chemistry: terminal versus bridging hydride and cyclopentadienyl ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000348306800004"}
