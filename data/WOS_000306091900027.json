CDSC has good ability to capture discriminative features from hand shape and can well deal with the inexact correspondence problem of hand landmark points. Particularly, it can extract features mainly from the contour of fingers. Thus, it is very robust to different hand poses or elastic deformations of finger valleys. In order to verify the effectiveness of CDSC, we create a new hand image database containing 4000 grayscale left hand images of 200 subjects, on which CDSC has achieved the accurate identification rate of 99.60% for identification and the Equal Error Rate of 0.9% for verification, which are comparable with the state-of-the-art hand shape recognition methods.
