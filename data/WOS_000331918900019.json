In this article, we review the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for SD. In particular, we will focus on the suitability and potential of the search performed by EAs in the development of SD algorithms. Future directions in the use of EAs for SD are also presented in order to show the advantages and benefits that this search strategy contribute to this task.
