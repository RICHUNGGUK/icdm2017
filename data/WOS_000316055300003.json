In this study, an EWMA control chart is proposed for efficient and robust monitoring of process dispersion. The proposed chart, namely the MDEWMA chart, is based on estimating the process standard deviation (sigma) using the mean absolute deviations (MD), taken from the sample median. The performance of the proposed chart has been compared with the EWMASR chart (a dispersion EWMA chart based on sample range) and MD chart (a Shewhart-type dispersion chart based on MD), under the existence and violation of normality assumption. It has been observed that the proposed MDEWMA chart is more efficient and robust when compared with both EWMASR and MD charts in terms of run length (RL) characteristics such as average RL, median RL and standard deviation of the RL distribution.", "paper_title": "MDEWMA chart: an efficient and robust alternative to monitor process dispersion", "paper_id": "WOS:000316055300003"}
