Contrary to most of the literature on topology control which focuses on reducing energy consumption, in this paper we tackle the topology control problem with the goal of limiting interference as much as possible, while keeping the communication graph connected with high probability. Our approach is based on the principle of maintaining the number of physical neighbors of every node equal to or slightly below a specific value k. As we will discuss in this paper, having a nontrivially bounded physical node degree allows a network topology with bounded interference to be generated. The proposed approach enforces symmetry on the resulting communication graph, thereby easing the operation of higher layer protocols. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we estimate the value of k that guarantees connectivity of the communication graph with high probability both theoretically and through simulation. We then define k-NEIGH, a fully distributed, asynchronous, and localized protocol that uses distance estimation. k-NEIGH guarantees logarithmically bounded physical degree at every node, is the most efficient known protocol (requiring 2n messages in total, where n is the number of nodes in the network), and relies on simpler assumptions than existing protocols. Furthermore, we verify through simulation that the network topologies produced by k-NEIGH show good performance in terms of node energy consumption and expected interference.", "paper_title": "The k-neighbors approach to interference bounded and symmetric topology control in ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239058200012"}
