So far, the concept of stability in measure for uncertain differential equations has been proposed. This paper presents a concept of stability in mean for uncertain differential equations, and it gives a sufficient condition for an uncertain differential equation being stable in mean. In addition, it discusses the relationship between stability in mean and stability in measure.", "paper_title": "Stability in mean for uncertain differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000359162800006"}
