PTD enables inexpensive, scalable and high quality urban texture documentation. We propose to implement PTD in two steps. At the first step, termed viewpoint selection, a minimum number of viewpoints in the urban environment are selected from which the texture of the entire urban environment (the part visible to cameras) with a desirable quality can be collected/captured. At the second step, called viewpoint assignment, the selected viewpoints are assigned to the participating users such that given a limited number of users with various constraints (e.g., restricted available time) users can collectively capture the maximum amount of texture information within a limited time interval. In this paper, we define each of these steps and prove that both are NP-hard problems. Accordingly, we propose efficient algorithms to implement the viewpoint selection and assignment problems. We study, profile and verify our proposed solutions comparatively by both rigorous analysis and extensive experiments.", "paper_title": "Users plan optimization for participatory urban texture documentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000313367300006"}
