In order to solve these large problems, it is necessary to solve the subproblems efficiently, and for many of them it can be useful to determine the K-best solutions. In this paper, a branch-and-bound method for the unbounded knapsack problem described in the literature is extended to determine the K-best solutions of unbounded and bounded knapsack problems. We show that the proposed extension determines exactly the K-best solutions and we solve important classical instances using high values of K. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
