The method has several advantages including the feasibility to use gradient-based techniques for fast computation of BLC coefficients and to employ powerful likelihood methods without specification of underlying data distributions. Simulation results show that the new method performs well even when the distribution of biomarkers is skewed, a situation commonly met in practice. A data set from a clinical experiment related to atherosclerotic coronary heart disease is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
