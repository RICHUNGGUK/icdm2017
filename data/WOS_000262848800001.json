To this end, we use it non-parametric decision rule (concretely, a nearest-neighbour Strategy) in order to Cluster the state space by means of the action that leads to a Successful Situation. Using an exploration strategy to avoid greedy behaviour, the agent builds clusters of positively-classified States through trial and error learning. In this paper, we implement a 3D synthetic agent which plays all,avoid the asteroid' game that suits our assumptions. Using as the state space 11 feature vector space extracted from a Visual navigation system, we test two exploration strategies using the trial and error learning method. This experiment shows that the agent is a good classifier over the state space, and will therefore show good behaviour in its synthetic world.", "paper_title": "Agent's actions as a classification criteria for the state space in a learning from rewards system", "paper_id": "WOS:000262848800001"}
