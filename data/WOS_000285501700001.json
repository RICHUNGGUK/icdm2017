Such artifacts can be encountered particularly in biological or archive film sequences, and are usually due to inconsistent exposures or sparse time sampling. In order to reduce such local artifacts, we introduce a local stabilization operator, called LStab, which acts as a time filter on image patches and relies on a similarity measure which is robust to contrast changes. Thereby, this operator is able to take motion into account without relying on a sophisticated motion estimation procedure. The efficiency of the stabilization is shown on various sequences. The experimental results compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Stabilization of Flicker-Like Effects in Image Sequences through Local Contrast Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000285501700001"}
