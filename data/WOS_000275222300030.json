In addition to user authentication and key agreement, identity privacy is Very useful for attracting users to share private contents. In three-party environments, both communicating parties can share separately passwords with a trusted third party rather than themselves. This approach can reduce the key management complexity when any two potential users may want to build a secure communication between them. In this pope?,, we propose a robust and efficient three-party password authenticated key agreement scheme using bilinear pairings. The main merits include: (1) there does not need any password or verification table in the server; (2) a user can choose or change his own password freely; : (3) any two users can authenticate each other; (4) it can protect users' privacy; (5) any two users can generate an agreed session key; (6) it does not have a serious synchronization-clock problem; (7) even if the secret information stored in a users smart card is compromised, it can prevent the offline dictionary attack.", "paper_title": "ROBUST AND EFFICIENT THREE-PARTY USER AUTHENTICATION AND KEY AGREEMENT USING BILINEAR PAIRINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300030"}
