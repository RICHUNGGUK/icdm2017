Pure performance analysis of a system tends to be optimistic since it ignores the failure repair behavior of the system. On the other hand, pure availability analysis tends to be too conservative since the behavior of the system is captured by only two states (functioning or failed). To analyze the degradation of a system's performance in consideration with availability metrics, combined measures of performance and availability are essential. This chapter introduces the basics of analytic models for the combined performance and availability analysis of computer systems together with some practical examples.", "paper_title": "Combining Performance and Availability Analysis in Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000303778400002"}
