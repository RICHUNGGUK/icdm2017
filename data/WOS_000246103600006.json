The global EFG equation system is proved to be block-circulant under a corresponding symmetry-adapted coordinate system, and is partitioned into a number of smaller independent sub-problems, which are solved simultaneously on a multiprocessor parallel computer in parallel virtual machine. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the correctness, speedup, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A paralleled element-free Galerkin analysis for structures with cyclic symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000246103600006"}
