Li gave an R- calculus for R- configurations Delta vertical bar Gamma, where Delta is a set of atomic formulas or the negations of atomic formulas, and Gamma is a finite set of formulas. In this paper, two deduction systems for the revision of a theory by another theory are given such that the systems are sound and complete, that is, if Delta|Gamma double right arrow Gamma' is provable then Gamma' superset of Delta is consistent and Gamma' - Delta is a maximal subset of Gamma such that (Gamma' - Delta)boolean OR Delta is consistent; and for any finite theories. and G, there is a finite theory Gamma' such that Gamma' - Delta is a maximal subset of G such that (Gamma' - Delta) boolean OR Delta is consistent, and Delta|Gamma double right arrow Gamma' is provable. Moreover, if Delta vertical bar Gamma double right arrow Gamma' is provable then Gamma' satisfies the AGM and the DP postulates.", "paper_title": "The sound and complete R-calculus for revising propositional theories", "paper_id": "WOS:000359801900014"}
