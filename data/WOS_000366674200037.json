With a wild range of climate conditions and a separate air conditioning structure in campus buildings, it is significant but difficult to assess the energy performance of campus buildings in China. This paper proposes a novel mechanism to assess energy performance of campus buildings, using a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). Six criteria are used as key performance indicators based on climate conditions in China and the air conditioning device deployment structure in campus buildings: 1) building envelope; 2) renewable energy; 3) illumination; 4) thermal comfort; 5) window and door; and 6) occupation status. A simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, analyzing three different rooms in the International School of Software, at Wuhan University. Assessment results are discussed in terms of optimizing future energy performance of campus buildings.", "paper_title": "Assessing Chinese campus building energy performance using fuzzy analytic network approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200037"}
