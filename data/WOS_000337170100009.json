Measuring virtualization performance is thus crucial for running applications efficiently and further improving VM techniques. To address the insufficiencies of existing benchmarking methods, the proposed three-layer strategy fully evaluates VM system performance and includes both a benchmark suite to measure various virtualization scenarios and an automated performance testing toolkit.", "paper_title": "Virt-B: Toward Performance Benchmarking of Virtual Machine Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337170100009"}
