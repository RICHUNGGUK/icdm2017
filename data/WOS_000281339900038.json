The purpose of the paper is to explore the performance evaluation model. This paper develops an evaluation model based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution, fuzzy TOPSIS, to help the industrial practitioners for the performance evaluation in a fuzzy environment where the vagueness and subjectivity are handled with linguistic values parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. The proposed method enables decision analysts to better understand the complete evaluation process and provide a more accurate, effective, and systematic decision support tool. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
