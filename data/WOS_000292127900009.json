Improvements in the transmission data rates over the links in the routing paths are achieved using a two-group resource allocation scheme to minimize the required amount of energy per bit for each path when the energy per symbol and the packet size are fixed. With a novel load-balancing technique, which evenly loads the energy to each routing path, the information bits can be allocated to the path such that the overall amount of energy consumed per bit is minimized. Two novel multi-path routing techniques are proposed to use the minimized energy consumed per bit in discovering the least-required energy routing paths while reducing the computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Bit Energy Consumption Minimization for Multi-path Routing in Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292127900009"}
