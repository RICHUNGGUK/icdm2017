We first use Broyden's method in the context of the domain decomposition: we propose to update the Restricted Additive Schwarz preconditioner from one Newton iteration to another when a Newton-Krylov method is used. We also investigate a time-pipelining method where Broyden's method is used as a solver of the nonlinear problem of each time step. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
