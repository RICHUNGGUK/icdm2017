Many factors such as user ID, user location, service usage conditions and so on, regarded as authorization attributes, are important in making authorization decision in smart home systems. We investigate into the dynamic characteristics of the authorization in smart home systems and propose a new access-control model, SH-CRBAC, which aims to combine the advantages of attribute-based authorization mechanism and role-based access-control mechanism, and imposes attribute and status constraints on the RBAC model and enhances the generality and flexibility of authorization significantly in smart home systems. The status consistency of SH-CRBAC is analysed, and we also analyse the characteristics of SH-CRBAC through comparison with other popular existing authorization models in smart home systems.", "paper_title": "SH-CRBAC: Integrating Attribute and Status Constraints into the RBAC Model in Smart Home Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300002"}
