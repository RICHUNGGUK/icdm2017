We present a generalization of the Brickell-Davenport theorem to the general case, in which non-perfect schemes are also considered. After analyzing that result under a new point of view and identifying its combinatorial nature, we present a characterization of the (not necessarily perfect) secret sharing schemes that are associated with matroids. Some optimality properties of such schemes are discussed.", "paper_title": "Extending Brickell-Davenport theorem to non-perfect secret sharing schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000348340600013"}
