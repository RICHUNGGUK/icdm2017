In this paper, we propose a novel online object tracking algorithm with sparse prototypes, which exploits both classic principal component analysis (PCA) algorithms with recent sparse representation schemes for learning effective appearance models. We introduce l(1) regularization into the PCA reconstruction, and develop a novel algorithm to represent an object by sparse prototypes that account explicitly for data and noise. For tracking, objects are represented by the sparse prototypes learned online with update. In order to reduce tracking drift, we present a method that takes occlusion and motion blur into account rather than simply includes image observations for model update. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Online Object Tracking With Sparse Prototypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000025"}
