In particular, it is of interest to find a preprocessing operation that enables the adoption of conventional signal processing techniques and algorithms developed for the filtering of proper-complex signals and that leads to computationally efficient near-optimal postprocessing. An invertible linear-conjugate linear (LCL) operator named the DT frequency shift (FRESH) properizer is first proposed. It is shown that the DT FRESH properizer converts a DT improper-complex SOCS random process input to an equivalent DT proper-complex SOCS random process output by utilizing the information only about the cycle period of the input. An invertible LCL block processing operator named the asymptotic FRESH properizer is then proposed that mimics the operation of the DT FRESH properizer but processes a finite number of consecutive samples of a DT improper-complex SOCS random process. It is shown that the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer is not proper but asymptotically proper and that its frequency-domain covariance matrix converges to a highly structured block matrix with diagonal blocks as the block size tends to infinity. Two representative estimation and detection problems are presented to demonstrate that asymptotically optimal low-complexity postprocessors can be easily designed by exploiting these asymptotic second-order properties of the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Frequency-Shift Properizer for Block Processing of Improper-Complex Second-Order Cyclostationary Random Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000341982200028"}
