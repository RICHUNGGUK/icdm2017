The two stereo display systems were used in an introductory design and graphics class. Data related to students' subjective perceptions about the two systems and data related to students' objective performance were collected and analyzed. Results of the study reveal that students perceived that the HMD was more effective for completing technical graphics tasks than anaglyphic glasses, while there was no significant difference in students' objective performance with the two display systems.
