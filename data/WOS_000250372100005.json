By treating the consequent part as a function of fuzzy measures, we derive its coefficients. The defuzzified output constructed from both the premise and consequent parts of the GFM rules takes the form of Choquet integral. The computational burden involved with the solution of A-measure is mitigated using Q-measure. This nonadditive fuzzy model is applied on two benchmark applications, and the results are found to be better than those obtained from the additive fuzzy models.", "paper_title": "From a Gaussian mixture model to nonadditive fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250372100005"}
