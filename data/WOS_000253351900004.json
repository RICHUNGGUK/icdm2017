A novel hybrid load forecasting algorithm, which combines the fuzzy support vector regression method and the linear extrapolation based on similar days method with the analysis of temperature sensitivities is presented in this paper. The fuzzy support vector regression method is used to consider the lower load-demands in weekends and Monday than on other weekdays. The normal load in weekdays is forecasted by the linear extrapolation based on similar days method. Moreover, the temperature sensitivities are used to improve the accuracy of the load forecasting in relation to the daily load and temperature. The result demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed load forecasting scheme.", "paper_title": "Implementation of hybrid short-term load forecasting system with analysis of temperature sensitivities", "paper_id": "WOS:000253351900004"}
