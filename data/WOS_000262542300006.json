To this end, we present a novel efficient Gradient Direction Matching (GDM) algorithm that matches gradient directions associated with object edges to pixel gradient directions (as opposed to image edges, which are less reliable). GDM seamlessly integrates information associated with pixel location and orientation in Such a way that the FFT can be exploited for computational efficiency, and it inherently rejects background clutter. The effects of spatial resolution on GDM statistical performance are studied empirically with the goal of gaining insight into how far GDM computational cost can be reduced before matching performance becomes too severely compromised.
