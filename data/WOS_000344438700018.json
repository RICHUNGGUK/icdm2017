The model considers the probabilistic travelling time among customers. This model also considers stochastic demands representing the customers' requirement. Location and inventory-routing decisions are made in strategic and tactical levels, respectively. The customers' uncertain demand follows a normal distribution. Each vehicle can carry all kind of products to meet the customer's demand, and each distribution center holds a certain amount of safety stock. In addition, shortage is not allowed. The considered two objectives aim to minimize the total cost and the maximum mean time for delivering commodities to customers. Because of NP-hardness of the given problem, we apply four multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms, namely multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA), multi-objective parallel simulated annealing (MOPSA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES). A comparative study of the forgoing algorithms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MOICA with respect to four existing performance measures for numerous test problems.
