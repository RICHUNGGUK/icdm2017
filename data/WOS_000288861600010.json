We are hereby reporting a drug design strategy to optimize these ligands and map them in Chemico-Biological Space (CBS) using Ligand Efficiency Indices (LEIs). We use a binding efficiency index (BEI) based on the measured binding affinity related to the molecular weight (MW) of the compound combined with sur-face-binding efficiency index (SEI) based on Polar Surface Area (PSA). We will illustrate the use of these indices, combining three crucial variables (potency, MW and PSA) in a 2D graphical representation of chemical space, to perform a retrospective mapping of SAR data for a current TTR inhibitors database, and we propose prospective strategies to use these efficiency indices and chemico-biological space maps for optimization and drug design efforts for TTR ligands.", "paper_title": "Retrospective Mapping of SAR Data for TTR Protein in Chemico-Biological Space Using Ligand Efficiency Indices as a Guide to Drug Discovery Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000288861600010"}
