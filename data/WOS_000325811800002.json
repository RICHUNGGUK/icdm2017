To adjust objects' positions while keeping the original scene content, we first perform a novel structure dependence analysis on the image to obtain the dependencies between all background regions. To determine the optimal positions for foreground objects, we formulate an optimization problem based on widely used heuristics for aesthetically pleasing pictures. Semantic relations between foreground objects are also taken into account during optimization. The final output is produced by moving foreground objects, together with their dependent regions, to optimal positions. The results show that our approach can effectively optimize photographs with single or multiple foreground objects without compromising the original photograph content.", "paper_title": "Aesthetic Image Enhancement by Dependence-Aware Object Recomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800002"}
