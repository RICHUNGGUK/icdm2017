The proposed method consists of two steps. The first step is a view interpolation to reconstruct an all-in-focus dense light field of the scene. The second step is to synthesize a novel view by a light-field rendering technique from the reconstructed dense light field. The view interpolation in the first step can be achieved simply by linear filters that are designed to shift different object regions separately, without region segmentation. The proposed method can effectively create a dense array of pin-hole cameras (i.e., all-in-focus images), so that the novel view can be synthesized with better quality.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing dense light field from array of multifocus images for novel view synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000243236200026"}
