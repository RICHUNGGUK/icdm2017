The developed model depends on normalizing a gate switching power to that of the unit standard inverter and it accounts for the effect of internodal capacitances. For different loads, gates, sizes and processes, the developed model shows a good agreement with Hspice simulations using BSIM3v3 and BSIM4 models for UMC 0.13 mu m and Predictive high-k 45 nm processes, respectively. The average error introduced by the model for the considered scenarios is about 3.1%. Depending on the normalized switching power model, two power optimization techniques have been proposed in this paper. The first deals with transistor sizing problem and presents a scheme to size transistors according to a specific design goal. The second technique relies on the joint transistor sizing and supply voltage scaling for reducing the switching power dissipation under specific delay requirements. This technique exhibits superiority over the first for the considered technology processes: UMC 0.13 mu m and the Predictive high-k 45 nm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
