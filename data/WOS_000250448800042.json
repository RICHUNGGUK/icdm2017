This is valid even though each channel is' assumed to have the same capacity in both directions. It is shown that irreversible information networks only have solutions that use nonlinear Network Coding. This correspondence argues that this result is more surprising than it might appear at first sight and that it follows using ideas resembling the path integral in Quantum Mechanics.", "paper_title": "Reversible and irreversible information networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800042"}
