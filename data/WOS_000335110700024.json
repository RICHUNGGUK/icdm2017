Despite methodology introduced to enhance the effectiveness of Business Process Management, research on the initial phase of system implementation has typically focused on the accurate execution of processes, not efficiency. The enhancement of process efficiency in various manufacturing applications, however, has received much attention over the past several decades. Unfortunately, due to the dissimilarities between business and manufacturing processes, optimized manufacturing processes cannot be applied directly to business processes. This study introduces a methodology for incorporating business process semantics and alternative paths in the Business Process Management structure. The approach entails mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for a business-process execution plan and a meta-heuristic algorithm to obtain good solutions for multi-activity processes.
