Even in the presence of the dephasing, our analytical results show that the optimal initial state corresponds to a coherent spin state vertical bar theta(0), phi(0)> with the polar angle theta(0) = pi/2. If the dephasing rate gamma << S-1/3, where S is total atomic spin, we find that the smallest value of squeezing parameter (i.e., the strongest squeezing) obeys the same scaling with the ideal one-axis twisting case, namely xi(2) proportional to S-2/3. While for a moderate dephasing, the achievable squeezing obeys the power rule S-2/5, which is slightly worse than the ideal case. When the dephasing rate gamma > S-1/2, we show that the squeezing is weak and neglectable.", "paper_title": "SPIN SQUEEZING OF ONE-AXIS TWISTING MODEL IN THE PRESENCE OF PHASE DEPHASING", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304800007"}
