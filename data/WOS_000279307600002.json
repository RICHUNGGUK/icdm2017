However, until now, there is still much work for the identification of dynamic parameters to be done. In this paper, an overview is given of the existing work on dynamic parameter identification of serial and parallel robots. The methods for estimating the dynamic parameters are summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The model to be identified and the trajectory optimization are reviewed. Further, the methods for validating the estimated model are summarized and the application of dynamic parameter identification is mentioned. The results of this review are useful for manufacturers of robots in selecting proper identification method and also for researchers in determining further research areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
