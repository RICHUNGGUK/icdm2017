Although very often neglected by researchers and practitioners, this correction is particularly important when strains and stresses are computed. Aimed at overcoming the main limitations of existing techniques, a novel dynamic modal acceleration method (DyMAM) is presented and numerically validated. The proposed correction involves a set of additional dummy oscillators, one for each dynamic loading, and can be applied, with a modest computational effort, to discrete and continuous systems under deterministic and random inputs.
