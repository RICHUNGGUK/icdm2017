Currently, the existing view synthesis techniques may introduce visual artifacts such as corona, pinholes and ghosts into pictures, which degrade the visual experience greatly. In this paper, we will introduce an error resilient 3D view synthesis approach, which is able to effectively remove these artifacts. Specifically, we first detect the regions mixed with foreground and background pixels to avoid corona artifacts. Then, we resize images and conduct projection on the resized images to reduce pinhole artifacts. Finally, an improved view blending algorithm is proposed to reduce ghosting artifacts. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms others significantly in removing view artifacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
