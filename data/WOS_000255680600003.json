A subset of UML is extended with timing annotations and given a formal semantics. UML models are translated, via XMI, to the input format of formal tools, to allow timed and non-timed model checking and interactive theorem proving. Moreover, the Play-Engine tool is used to execute and analyze requirements by means of live sequence charts. We apply the approach to a part of an industrial case study, the MARS system, and report about the experiences, results and conclusions.", "paper_title": "Supporting UML-based development of embedded systems by formal techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000255680600003"}
