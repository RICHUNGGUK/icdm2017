However, the validity of the expansion is restricted to regions outside a spherical enclosure of the distribution of charge and, therefore, not suitable for most applications that demand accurate representation at arbitrary positions around the molecule. We propose and demonstrate a distributed multipole expansion approach that resolves this limitation. We also provide a practical algorithm for the computational implementation of this approach. The method allows the partitioning of the charge distribution into subsystems so that the multipole expansion of each component of the partition, and therefore of their superposition, is valid outside an enclosing surface of the molecule of arbitrary shape. The complexity of the resulting coarse-grained model of electrostatic potential is dictated by the area of the molecular surface and therefore, for a typical three-dimensional molecule, it scale as N(2/3) with N, the number of charges in the system. This makes the method especially useful for coarse-grained studies of biological systems consisting of many large macromolecules provided that the configuration of the individual molecules can be approximated as fixed.
