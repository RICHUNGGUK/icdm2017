By considering the human body as an inverted pendulum model, ellipse fitting and contour moments are applied to classify it as being in Stand, Sit, or Lie posture. A convex hull of the silhouette contour is used to determine the locations of SBPs. The particle filter or a motion flow-based method is used to predict SBPs in occlusion. Stick figures of various activities are generated by connecting the SBPs. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation show that the proposed method robustly labels and tracks SBPs in various activities of two different (low and high) resolution data sets.", "paper_title": "Significant Body Point Labeling and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000342227500016"}
