The primitive assures that an entity's signature is verified only by a designated service provider. It also assures that a transcript about a computing task can be produced by both the entity and its service provider independently. Then neither can prove to a third party that an entity is involved in a task. Currently, most SDVS schemes without random oracles have no strong unforgeability and privacy of signer's identity. This paper proposes a systematic method to design SDVS schemes without random oracles. It provides a basic scheme with unforgeability and non-transferability properties. Then provides it an SDVS scheme with strong unforgeability and privacy of signer's identity properties and based on standard assumptions. Finally, a more efficient SDVS scheme is shown based on a non-black box assumption.", "paper_title": "A systematic method to design strong designated verifier signature without random oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400017"}
