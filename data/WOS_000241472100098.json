The approach exploits the relative slow operational speed of the biological system by using fast digital hardware to sequentially sample neurons in a layer and transmit the associated spikes to neurons in other layers. The motivation for this work is to develop minimal area inter-neuron communication hardware. An estimate of the density of on-chip neurons afforded by this approach is presented. The paper verifies the operation of the TMA and investigates pulse transmission errors as a function of the sampling rate. Simulations using the Xilinx System Generator (XSG) package demonstrate that the effect of these errors on the performance of an SNN, pre-trained to solve the XOR problem, is negligible if the sampling frequency is sufficiently high.", "paper_title": "A time multiplexing architecture for inter-neuron communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100098"}
