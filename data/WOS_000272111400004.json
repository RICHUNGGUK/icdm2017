The strategy here proposed consists of two stages: first, the optimal trajectory which satisfies the constraint is calculated off-line; second, a control law based on a generalized Hopfield neural network is employed to assure that the reactor power follows this optimal trajectory. The boundedness for both the weights and the identification error is guaranteed by a new online learning law. Likewise, proposed control law guarantees an upper bound for the tracking error. The effectiveness of this procedure is illustrated by numeric simulation.", "paper_title": "CONTROL OF NUCLEAR RESEARCH REACTORS BASED ON A GENERALIZED HOPFIELD NEURAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111400004"}
