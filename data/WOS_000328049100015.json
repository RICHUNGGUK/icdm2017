The NG function serves as a cluster validity functional in community detection studies. The input data is an undirected weighted graph that represents, e.g., a social network. Clusters correspond to socially similar substructures in the network. We compare our fuzzy modularity with two existing modularity functions using the well-studied Karate Club and American College Football datasets.", "paper_title": "A Soft Modularity Function For Detecting Fuzzy Communities in Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328049100015"}
