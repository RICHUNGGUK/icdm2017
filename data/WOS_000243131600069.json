This includes the general areas of information retrieval, data mining, and natural language processing. Existing approaches have primarily focused on noun to noun synonym comparison. We propose a new technique for the comparison of general expressions that combines web searching with Latent Semantic Analysis. This technique is more general than previous approaches, as it is able to match similarities between multi-word expressions, abbreviations, and alpha-numeric phrases. Consequently, it can be applied to more complex comparison problems such as ontology alignment.", "paper_title": "Combining web-based searching with latent semantic analysis to discover similarity between phrases", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600069"}
