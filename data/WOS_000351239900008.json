One solution to deal with these challenges is to adapt aspect-oriented technology to product family modeling. In this paper, we propose a new language AO-PFA, which adapts the aspect-oriented paradigm to product families. This paradigm enhances the adaptability and evolvability of product families. The proposed language is an extension of the specification language product family algebra (PFA). We discuss the constructs of the proposed language as well as its usage to specify aspects.", "paper_title": "An aspect-oriented language for feature-modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000351239900008"}
