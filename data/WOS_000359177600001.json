Supplementary to our input, we are given classical advice in the form of a pre-computed data structure; this advice can depend on the permutation but not on the input y. Classically, there is a data structure of size (O) over tilde (S) and an algorithm that with the help of the data structure, given f(x), can invert f in time (O) over tilde (T), for every choice of parameters S, T, such that S.T >= N. We prove a quantum lower bound of T-2 . S = (Omega) over tilde(epsilon N) for quantum algorithms that invert a random permutation f on an E fraction of inputs, where T is the number of queries to f and S is the amount of advice. This answers an open question of De et al. We also give a Omega(root N/m) quantum lower bound for the simpler but related Yao's box problem, which is the problem of recovering a bit x(j), given the ability to query an N-bit string x at any index except the j-th, and also given m bits of classical advice that depend on x but not on j.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM LOWER BOUND FOR INVERTING A PERMUTATION WITH ADVICE", "paper_id": "WOS:000359177600001"}
