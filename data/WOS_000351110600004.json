We show that knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focussed on the goal of minimality. Many different view update algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach.", "paper_title": "Comparative study of view update algorithms in rational choice theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000351110600004"}
