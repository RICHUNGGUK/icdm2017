It deals inefficiently with statistical noise, and binsizes are free parameters. In contrast to that, the empirical cumulative distribution function (obtained after sorting the data) is parameter free. But it is a step function, so that its differentiation does not give a smooth probability density. Based on Fourier series expansion and Kolmogorov tests, we introduce a simple method, which overcomes this problem. Error bars on the estimated probability density are calculated using a jackknife method. We give several examples and provide computer code reproducing them. You may want to look at the corresponding figures 4 to 9 first.", "paper_title": "From data to probability densities without histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000259711100011"}
