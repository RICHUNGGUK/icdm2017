However, comprehensive and reliable resources are rare and not often freely available. Handcrafted resources are too costly for being a general solution while automatically-built resources need to be validated by experts or at least thoroughly evaluated. We propose in this paper a picture of the current situation with regard to lexical resources, their building and their evaluation. We give an in-depth description of Wiktionary, a freely available and collaboratively built multilingual dictionary. Wiktionary is presented here as a promising raw resource for NLP. We propose a semi-automatic approach based on random walks for enriching Wiktionary synonymy network that uses both endogenous and exogenous data. We take advantage of the wiki infrastructure to propose a validation \"by crowds\". Finally, we present an implementation called WISIGOTH, which supports our approach.", "paper_title": "Semi-automatic enrichment of crowdsourced synonymy networks: the WISIGOTH system applied to Wiktionary", "paper_id": "WOS:000316004500004"}
