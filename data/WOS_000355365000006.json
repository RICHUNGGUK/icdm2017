Isogeometric elements were developed to unify the representation of geometry and of engineering analysis. We show how matched G(k) constructions for geometry and analysis automatically yield C-k isogeometric elements. This provides a formal framework for the existing and any future isogeometric elements based on geometric continuity. Crown Copyright CD (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
