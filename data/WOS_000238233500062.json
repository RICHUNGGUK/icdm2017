Furthermore, they also pointed out that the protocol does not provide the perfect forward secrecy. Accordingly, they presented an enhanced protocol to strengthen the security. This letter, however, demonstrates an interleaving attack on the Yoon et al.'s improved protocol and also discusses how to defend the protocol from the attack presented here.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis on the robust and simple authentication protocol for secure communication on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500062"}
