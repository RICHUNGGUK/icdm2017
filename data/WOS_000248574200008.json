Both feature tracking and factorization have inspired and motivated many important algorithms in structure from motion, 3D reconstruction and modeling. We then revisit the recent quasi-dense approach to structure from motion. The key advantage of the quasi-dense approach is that it not only delivers the structure from motion in a robust manner for practical modeling purposes, but also it provides a cloud of sufficiently dense 3D points that allows the objects to be explicitly modeled. To structure the available 3D points and registered 2D image information, we argue that a joint segmentation of both 3D and 2D is the fundamental stage for the subsequent modeling. We finally propose a probabilistic framework for the joint segmentation. The optimal solution to such a joint segmentation is still generally intractable, but approximate solutions are developed in this paper. These methods are implemented and validated on real data set.", "paper_title": "Image-based modeling by joint segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248574200008"}
