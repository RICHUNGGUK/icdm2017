Some progress has been made to find a computational alternative to replace these physical tests. In this paper, an innovative computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is presented, where the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is solved through a self-developed code combined with an ANSYS-CFX solver. Then an improved CFD method based on block-iterative coupling is also proposed. This method can be readily used for two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) structure modelling. Detached-Eddy simulation for 3D viscous turbulent incompressible flow is applied to the 3D numerical analysis of bridge deck sections. Firstly, 2D numerical simulations of a thin airfoil demonstrate the accuracy of the present CFD method. Secondly, numerical simulations of a U-shape beam with both 20 and 3D modelling are conducted. The comparisons of aerodynamic force coefficients thus obtained with wind tunnel test results well meet the prediction that 3D CFD simulations are more accurate than 2D CFD simulations. Thirdly, 2D and 3D CFD simulations are performed for two generic bridge deck sections to produce their aerodynamic force coefficients and flutter derivatives. The computed values agree well with the available computational and wind tunnel test results. Once again, this demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed 3D CFD simulations. Finally, the 3D based wake flow vision is captured, which shows another advantage of 3D CFD simulations. All the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3D CFD method has good accuracy and significant benefits for aerodynamic analysis and computational FSI studies of long-span bridges and other slender structures.
