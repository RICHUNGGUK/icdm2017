Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 1042-1055), are now extended to cover aromatic, heterocyclic, anionic, cationic and twitter-ionic molecular fragments, thus encompassing a majority of druggable chemical space. The addition of terms accounting for cavity formation, polarity, hydrophobicity, and resonance allowed us to derive a new equation able to predict accurately free energies of solvation of diverse solutes, interphase transfers, and aqueous solubilities (log S(w)). We thus provide a \"universal solvation equation\" (USE) available for the accurate estimation of desolvation energies in protein-ligand docking, for the prediction of many physical and ADMET properties, and for studying fluid phase equilibria.", "paper_title": "New Developments in Hydrogen Bonding Acidity and Basicity of Small Organic Molecules for the Prediction of Physical and ADMET Properties.
