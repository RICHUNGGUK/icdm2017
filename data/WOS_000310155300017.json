Its presence as an ubiquitous component of genetic architecture of common human diseases has been contemplated. However, the detection of gene-gene interaction is difficult due to combinatorial explosion. Results: We present a novel feature selection method incorporating variable interaction. Three gene expression datasets are analyzed to illustrate our method, although it can also be applied to other types of high-dimensional data. The quality of variables selected is evaluated in two ways: first by classification error rates, then by functional relevance assessed using biological knowledge. We show that the classification error rates can be significantly reduced by considering interactions. Secondly, a sizable portion of genes identified by our method for breast cancer metastasis overlaps with those reported in gene-to-system breast cancer (G2SBC) database as disease associated and some of them have interesting biological implication. In summary, interaction-based methods may lead to substantial gain in biological insights as well as more accurate prediction.", "paper_title": "Interaction-based feature selection and classification for high-dimensional biological data", "paper_id": "WOS:000310155300017"}
