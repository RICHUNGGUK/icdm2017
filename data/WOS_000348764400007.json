This is the convex hull of the points (i, j) such that the monomial (XYj)-Y-i appears in P with a nonzero coefficient. We conjecture that when P is expressed as a sum of products of sparse polynomials, the number of edges of its Newton polygon is polynomially bounded in the size of such an expression. We show that this so-called tau-conjecture for Newton polygons, even in a weak form, implies that the permanent polynomial is not computable by polynomial-size arithmetic circuits. Wemake the same observation for a weak version of an earlier real tau-conjecture. Finally, we make some progress toward the tau-conjecture for Newton polygons using recent results from combinatorial geometry.", "paper_title": "A tau-Conjecture for Newton Polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000348764400007"}
