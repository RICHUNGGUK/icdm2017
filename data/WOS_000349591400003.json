Existing SO algorithms may not be applicable for such SO problems because they often evaluate a large number of solutions with many simulation calls. We propose an integrated solution method for practical SO problems based on a hierarchical stochastic modeling and optimization (HSMO) approach. This method models and optimizes the studied system at increasing levels of accuracy by hierarchical sampling with a selected set of principal parameters. We demonstrate the efficiency of HSMO using the example problem of Brugge oil field development under geological uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
