The research work summarized by this paper discusses two different case studies in the field of portals for collaborative research communities, in particular VectorBase and BGA-Space. VectorBase at its core is a scientific database that focuses on search, data mining and offers multiple integrated bioinformatics tools for analyzing and browsing genomic and related data. BGA-Space focuses on capturing semantics from scientists during processing of scientific experiments as well as preserving the full life cycle of scientific data to enable their reuse. The two case studies involve heavy research and the application of theories, concepts, and knowledge commonly discussed in the targeted field.
