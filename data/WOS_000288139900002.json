As part of a 4-month long ethnographic study, we followed two 12-year-old participants as they learned the programming software Scratch and its associated file-sharing site, scratch.mit.edu, in an after-school club and class. In our discussion, we focus on the role that agency membership, and status played in their joining and participating in local and online communities of programmers.", "paper_title": "Entering the Clubhouse: Case Studies of Young Programmers Joining the Online Scratch Communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000288139900002"}
