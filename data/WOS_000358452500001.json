We prove that if the minimum (k - 1)-degree of H is at least left perpendicular n/k right perpendicular, then H contains a matching with left perpendicular n/k right perpendicular edges. This confirms a conjecture of Rodl, Rucinski and Szemeredi [13], who proved that minimum (k - 1)-degree n/k + O(log n) suffices. More generally, we show that H contains a matching of size d if its minimum codegree is d < n/k, which is also best possible.", "paper_title": "Near Perfect Matchings in k-Uniform Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000358452500001"}
