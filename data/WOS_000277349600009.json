In this paper, we propose LDACLM or Latent Dirichlet Allocation Category Language Model for text categorization and estimate parameters of models by variational inference. As a variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model, LDACLM regards documents of category as Language Model and uses variational parameters to estimate maximum a posteriori of terms. In general, experiments show LDACLM model is effective and outperform Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing and Rocchio algorithm but little inferior to SVM for text categorization.", "paper_title": "Text Categorization Based on Topic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000277349600009"}
