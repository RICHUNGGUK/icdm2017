The model represents user preferences with fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, here understood as a scoring describing user Satisfaction This model can be acquired with explicit of implicit methods. Model-theoretic semantics is based on fuzzy description logic f-epsilon L User preference. Earning is based on our model of fuzzy inductive logic programming Our system works both for English and Slovak resources. The primary application domain are job offers and job search, however we show extension to mutual investment funds :search and a possibility of extension into other application domains Our top-k search is optimized with own heuristics and repository with special indexes Our model was experimentally implemented, the integration was tested and is web accessible. We focus on experiments with several users and measure their satisfaction according to correlation coefficients", "paper_title": "USER PREFERENCE WEB SEARCH - EXPERIMENTS WITH A SYSTEM CONNECTING WEB AND USER", "paper_id": "WOS:000271135500006"}
