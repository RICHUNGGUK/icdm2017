Furthermore an improvement to the method is proposed and its effectiveness is validated. Design/methodology/approach - An adaptive probability factor is used within the framework of lambda optimization. Findings - It is shown that in the framework of lambda optimization (LO) the use of an adaptive probability factor can provide high-quality solutions with small standard deviation on the selected benchmark problem. Research limitations/implications - Although the chosen benchmarks are considered to be representative of typical electromagnetic problems, different test cases may give less satisfactory results. Practical implications - The proposed approach appears to be an efficient general purpose stochastic optimizer for electromagnetic design problems. Originality/value - This paper introduces and validates the use of adaptive probability factor in order to improve the balance between the explorative and exploitative characteristics of the LO algorithm.", "paper_title": "A modified lambda algorithm for optimization in electromagnetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000004"}
