Faced with an increasingly competitive business environment, organizations in the health care industry are applying Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to improve operational efficiency and to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. This research provides a multi-stage analysis on the antecedents that affects the diffusion of RFID in the health care industry. Data collected from 182 health care organizations were analyzed using structural equation modeling analysis. The result shows that variables within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory have different effects on the evaluation, adoption, and routinization stages of RFID diffusion. This is one of few empirical studies on the factors influencing the diffusion of RFID in the health care industry. The results of this study will help decision makers in the health care industry to better understand the diffusion process of RFID, and to formulate strategies for successful diffusion of RFID.
