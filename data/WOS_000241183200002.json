The first approach is based on a standard spectral Galerkin method (SGM) using Hermite functions in the velocity space. The second method which belongs to the family of pseudospectral methods (SCM) uses Gauss-Hermite collocation points for the velocity discretization. The high-dimensional feature of these equations and the suspected presence of small scales in the solution suggested us to employ these methods that provide high order accuracy while considering a \"small\" number of ad hoc basis functions. The scaled Hermite functions allow us to treat the case of unbounded domains and to properly recover Gaussian-type distributions. Some numerical results on usual test cases are shown and prove the good agreement with the theory. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
