Then by establishing an energy equation based on principle of energy equilibrium, the surface temperatures of the infrared scene under various conditions are acquired. We propose a new method to obtain infrared texture from its corresponding visible image. The infrared effect due to different weather conditions such as rain, cloud, fog is accounted for. The infrared shadow with high-reality and the high dynamic range effect of infrared dynamic scene are also simulated, and real-time walkthrough of large-scale infrared dynamic scene is carried out.", "paper_title": "Real-time walkthrough system of large-scale infrared dynamic scene", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300112"}
