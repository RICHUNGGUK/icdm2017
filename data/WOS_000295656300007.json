Tumor growth conditions are obtained for each model type based on the virus infection rate and immune suppressive drug delivery. Equilibrium conditions resulted into quadratic functions for which the tumor radius remained constant during virotherapy. An irrigation tumor model for virotherapy treatment was also proposed. This model consists of irrigation layers distributed radially along the tumor and attached to a common blood circulation compartment. The irrigation model has similar dynamic and steady state characteristics to the diffusion model, which has been supported by experimental results. The irrigation model considers the immune system cell generation and consumption outside the tumor boundary but inside the blood circulation compartment. These characteristics provide a great potential for advanced cancer treatment applications because therapy dose delivery and immune system measurements can be made at the blood compartment level of the irrigation model.
