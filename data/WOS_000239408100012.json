Recently, PCA has been extensively employed for face-recognition algorithms, such as eigenface and fisherface. The encouraging results have been reported and discussed in the literature. Many PCA-based face-recognition systems have also been developed in the last decade. However, existing PCA-based face-recognition systems are hard to scale up because of the computational cost and memory-requirement burden. To overcome this limitation, an incremental approach is usually adopted. Incremental PCA (IPCA) methods have been studied for many years in the machine-learning community. The major limitation of existing IPCA methods is that there is no guarantee on the approximation error. In view of this limitation, this paper proposes a new IPCA method based on the idea of a singular value decomposition (SVD) updating algorithm, namely an SVD updating-based IPCA (SVDU-IPCA) algorithm. In the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm, we have mathematically proved that the approximation error is bounded. A complexity analysis on the proposed method is also presented. Another characteristic of the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm is that it can be easily extended to a kernel version. The proposed method has been evaluated using available public databases, namely FERET, AR, and Yale B, and applied to existing face-recognition algorithms. Experimental results show that the difference of the average recognition accuracy between the proposed incremental method and the batch-mode method is less than 1%. This implies that the proposed SVDU-IPCA method gives a close approximation to the batch-mode PCA method.", "paper_title": "A novel incremental principal component analysis and its application for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408100012"}
