While some approaches are based on the detecting lines, some approaches are based on the Hough transform. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages (e.g., computational load). In this paper, we propose a class of neural networks with a special type of neural junctions for the detection of rectangular objects. The proposed neural networks can be trained in either an unsupervised mode or a batch mode. In contrast to some popular clustering algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means algorithm and the fuzzy c-rectangular shells algorithm, our approach is not based on minimizing an objective function but based on the idea of competitive learning. Based on the idea of competitive learning, the computational load can be decreased. Several data sets were tested to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
