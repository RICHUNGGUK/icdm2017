As recent algorithms focus on the accuracy of contour detection, the entailed time complexity is significantly high. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective contour extraction method based on both local cues from pixels and global cues from saliency. Experimental results demonstrate that a good trade-off between accuracy and speed can be achieved by the proposed approach for contour detection.", "paper_title": "A Holistic Approach for Efficient Contour Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000345382500009"}
