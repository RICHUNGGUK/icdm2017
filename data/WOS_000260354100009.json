The system is described by a state-space Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model with distributed delays and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. The aim is to design a fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller which ensures the robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and guarantees an H-infinity norm bound constraint on disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties. In terms of linear matrix inequalities, a sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is presented. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
