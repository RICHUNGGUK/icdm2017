The extended theories preserve the connection with the counting hierarchy in the sense that the algorithms which the systems prove to halt are exactly the ones in the hierarchy. We show that TCA(2) has the exact strength to develop Riemannian integration for functions with a modulus of uniform continuity.", "paper_title": "The Riemann integral in weak systems of analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257026200007"}
