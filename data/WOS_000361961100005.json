Methods for children's participation have been developed, but a closer link between theory and design has been called for, as well as an examination of various participants influencing children's participation in ICT design. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing the research strategy of nexus analysis as a promising theoretical framework. Especially the concepts of interaction order' and historical body' are utilised in the analysis of six empirical studies on ICT design with children. The analysis shows that through the participating children there were also others' involved, multiple voices to be heard, often invisible but informing design. Some of these others' have already been acknowledged in literature but the issue has not been examined in depth and common vocabulary for this is lacking. Some practical implications will be offered by illustrating how to consider these concepts in different phases of ICT design: when establishing relationships with children, involving children as participant designers and analysing the results of these participative processes.", "paper_title": "Multiple voices in ICT design with children - a nexus analytical enquiry", "paper_id": "WOS:000361961100005"}
