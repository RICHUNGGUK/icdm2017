Such parameterizations enable the tiling of surfaces with nearly regular hexagonal or triangular patterns, and can be used for triangular remeshing. Our framework to construct a hexagonal parameterization, referred to as HEXCOVER, extends the QUADCOVER algorithm and formulates necessary conditions for hexagonal parameterization. We also provide an algorithm to automatically generate a 6-RoSy field that respects directional and singularity features in the surface. We demonstrate the usefulness of our geometry-aware global parameterization with applications such as surface tiling with nearly regular textures and geometry patterns, as well as triangular and hexagonal remeshing.", "paper_title": "Hexagonal Global Parameterization of Arbitrary Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000302729900004"}
