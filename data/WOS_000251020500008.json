Based on it, a recursive algorithm that implements the multi-symbol differential detection in criterion of maximum likelihood is proposed. Simulation results show that its performance can approach to the theoretical boundary of multi-symbol differential detection without increasing the complexity per symbol, and it is effective in practical systems. It is also an optimal algorithm to solve the problems of estimating the state sequence of finite-state Markov process observed in memoryless noise.", "paper_title": "Joint-state differential detection algorithm and its application in UWB wireless communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251020500008"}
