Traditionally, variations are identified through analysis of short DNA sequences, usually shorter than 1000 bp per fragment. Optical maps provide both faster and more cost-efficient means for detecting such differences, because a single map can span over 1 million bp. Optical maps are assembled to cover the whole genome, and the accuracy of assembly is critical. Results: We present a computationally efficient model-based method for improving quality of such assemblies. Our method provides very high accuracy even with moderate coverage (< 20 x). We utilize a hidden Markov model to represent the consensus map and use the expectation-Maximization algorithm to drive the refinement process. We also provide quality scores to assess the quality of the finished map.", "paper_title": "Refinement of optical map assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300011"}
