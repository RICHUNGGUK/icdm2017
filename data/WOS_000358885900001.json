However, the exploiting of VLIW DSPs in sensor-based domain has imposed a heavy challenge on software toolkit design. In this paper, we present our methods and experiences to develop system toolkit flows for a VLIW DSP, which is designed dedicated to sensor-based systems. Our system toolkit includes compiler, assembler, linker, debugger, and simulator. We have presented our experimental results in the compiler framework by incorporating several state-of-the-art optimization techniques for this VLIW DSP. The results indicate that our framework can largely enhance the performance and energy consumption against the code generated without it.", "paper_title": "Implementing and Optimizing of Entire System Toolkit of VLIW DSP Processors for Embedded Sensor-Based Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358885900001"}
