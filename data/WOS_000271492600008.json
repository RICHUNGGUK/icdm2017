The problem is to construct a multicast tree while minimizing its cost, which is known to be NP-complete. Our algorithm, which employs new concepts defined as potential cost and spanning cost, generates a multicast tree more efficiently than the well-known heuristic called Takahashi and Matsuyama (TM) [1] in terms of tree cost. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(kn(2)) for an n-node network with k members in the multicast group and is comparable to the TM. Our empirical performance evaluation comparing the proposed algorithm with TM shows that the enhancement is up to 1.25%similar to 4.23% for each best case.", "paper_title": "On Minimum Cost Multicast Routing Based on Cost Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000271492600008"}
