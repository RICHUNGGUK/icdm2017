AAA and Mobile IPv6 are operated independently. Hence schemes which merge these protocols have been emerged. These schemes enable the mobile node to establish a security association between the mobile node and a home agent, and to perform a home binding update during AAA authentication procedure. But these schemes introduce lots of signal messages and long handover latency during the handover, since Route Optimization mode for Mobile IPv6 is performed using Return Routability procedure. To solve this problem, we propose an optimized scheme which performs Route Optimization mode via the AAA infrastructure between the home agent and a correspondent node instead of Return Routability procedure. For performance evaluation, we analyze handover latency in three scenarios. We then show that the proposed scheme reduces handover latency like the average of 58% compared with the existing scheme.", "paper_title": "An optimized scheme for Mobile IPv6 handover between domains based on AAA", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300114"}
