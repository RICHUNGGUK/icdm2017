But currently method is still lacking for researchers to perform multiple spike train data analysis and those existing techniques either allow people to analyze pairwise neuronal activities only or are seriously subject to the selection of parameters. In this paper, a new measurement of information discrepancy, which is based on the comparisons of subsequence distributions, is applied to deal with a group of spike trains (n > 2) and analyze the synchronization pattern among the neurons, where the analytical result mostly depends on the experimental data and is affected little by subjective interference.", "paper_title": "A new method for multiple spike train analysis based on information discrepancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100004"}
