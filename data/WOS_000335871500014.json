In the case of ibuprofen, in the absence of excipients, the method resulted in an accurate prediction of the enantiopurity of the validation samples (RMSEP <2.0% and practically no bias). On the other hand, the use of \"matrix-matched\" standards, including the most commonly used excipients, allowed to extend the applicability of the approach also to the analysis of commercial drugs (RMSEP = 7.0%). As far as epinephrine is concerned, very accurate results were obtained (RMSEP<2% and bias = 0.5%). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
