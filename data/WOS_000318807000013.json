The results indicate that empirical papers attract more citation success than theoretical studies. However, the pattern over time is very similar. Moreover, among empirical papers it appears that the cross-country studies are more successful than single country studies focusing on North America data or other regions.", "paper_title": "Citation success over time: theory or empirics?", "paper_id": "WOS:000318807000013"}
