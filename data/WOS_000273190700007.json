In the MLEMTC method, a joint likelihood function is formulated by multiplying the set of individual likelihood functions for all test chips. This joint likelihood function is then maximized to extract a unique group of parameter values of a single spatial correlation function, which can be used for statistical circuit analysis and design. Moreover, to deal with the purely random component and measurement error contained in measurement data, the spatial correlation function combined with the correlation of white noise is used in the extraction, which significantly improves the accuracy of the extraction results. Furthermore, an LU decomposition based technique is developed to calculate the log-determinant of the positive definite matrix within the likelihood function. which solves the numerical stability problem encountered in the direct calculation. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method is efficient and practical.", "paper_title": "Intra-Die Spatial Correlation Extraction with Maximum Likelihood Estimation Method for Multiple Test Chips", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700007"}
