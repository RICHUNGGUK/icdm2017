The stresses in the plaque-artery-stent structure appear to be distinctly different for different plaque types in terms of both distribution and magnitude. In this study, a nonlinear finite element simulation was executed to analyze the influence of plaque composition (calcified, cellular, and hypocellular) on plaque, artery layers (intima, media, and adventitia), and stent stresses during implantation of a balloon expandable coronary stent into a stenosed artery. The atherosclerotic artery was assumed to consist of a plaque and normal arterial tissues on its outer side. The results revealed a significant influence of plaque types on the maximum stresses induced within plaque wall and artery layers during stenting, but not when calculating maximum stress on stent. The stress on stiffer calcified plaque wall was in the fracture level (2.21 MPa), whereas cellular and hypocellular plaques play a protective role by displaying less stress on their wall. The highest von Mises stresses were observed on less stiff media layer. The findings of this study suggest a lower risk of arterial vascular injury for calcified plaque, while higher risk of plaque ruptures for cellular and hypocellular plaques.", "paper_title": "A nonlinear finite element simulation of balloon expandable stent for assessment of plaque vulnerability inside a stenotic artery", "paper_id": "WOS:000338201900003"}
