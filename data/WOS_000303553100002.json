The nonlinear total project cost objective function of the proposed MINLP optimization model is subjected to a rigorous system of generalized precedence relationship constraints between project activities, project duration constraints, logical constraints, and a budget constraint. By means of the proposed MINLP optimization model, one can obtain the minimum total project cost, the project schedule with the optimal discrete start times and the optimal discrete durations of the activities, as well as the optimal time-cost curves of the project. The proposed model yields the exact optimum solution of the NDTCTP. Solving the NDTCTP, using the proposed MINLP model, avoids the need for (piece-wise) linear approximation of the nonlinear expressions. The MINLP model handles the discrete variables explicitly and requires no rounding of the continuous solution into an integer solution. The applicability of the proposed optimization model is not limited to weakly NDTCTPs. A numerical example from the literature and an example of the project time-cost trade-off analysis are presented at the end of the paper in order to show the advantages of the proposed model.
