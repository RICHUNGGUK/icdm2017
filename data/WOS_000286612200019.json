We prove that if the same component replies to all queries issued to a cluster in a rewriting step, then non-returning PC grammar systems with 3 clusters and 7 context-free components are able to generate any recursively enumerable language. We also provide open problems and directions for future research.", "paper_title": "PC GRAMMAR SYSTEMS WITH CLUSTERS OF COMPONENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200019"}
