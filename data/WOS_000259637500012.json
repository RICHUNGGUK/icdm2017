The aim of degressive proportionality is to allocate to the smaller States more delegates than would correspond to their population and to the bigger states fewer delegates. A definition of degressive proportionality given in 2007 by the Lisbon Intergovernmental Conference may not generally be applicable, since an allotment according to this definition may not exist for a particular composition of the European Parliament. This paper proposes some properties that a reasonable definition of degressive proportionality should possess and offers a comparative analysis of several allocation methods according to such reasonable definitions with application to the European Parliament.
