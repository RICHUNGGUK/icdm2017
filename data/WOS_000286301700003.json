It is also very useful in coding theory, since it is related to the covering radii of Reed-Muller codes. By investigating the lower bound of the nonlinearity of the derivative of the function f, this paper tightens the lower bound of the second-order nonlinearity of a class of Boolean functions over F(2n) with high nonlinearity in the form f(x) = tr (lambda x(d)), where lambda is an element of F*(2r), d = 2(2r) + 2(r) + 1 and n = 4r.", "paper_title": "The lower bound on the second-order nonlinearity of a class of Boolean functions with high nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000286301700003"}
