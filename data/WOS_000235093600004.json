In the spiral fashion embroidery, a user-designed region is embroidered with a thread along a uniform spiral path whose shape is similar to the region's contours. An approach which can automatically generate this kind of embroidery path is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the region is decomposed into several ring-shaped sub-regions at first. Then these sub-regions are organized into a binary tree and the spiral lines in these sub-regions are connected to form a single path. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
