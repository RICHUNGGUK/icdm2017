Current research on grid resource advance reservation, a well known and effective mechanism to guarantee QoS, fails to adapt to dynamic behavior of grid, and cannot solve imprecise deny of reservation request problem efficiently. For this, enabling system architecture for advance reservation is proposed. Virtual resource container (VRC) is adopted to alleviate a negative effect resulted from dynamic behavior of grid and QoS deviation distance (QDD) based logical resource selection algorithm is put forward to decrease imprecise reject ratio of reservation. At last, this new architecture is deployed to campus grid, and two illustrative experiments are conducted. Experimental results show that system architecture for advance reservation proposed in this paper can alleviate negative influence of grid resource dynamic fluctuation and avoid imprecise reject of advance reservation request effectively.", "paper_title": "Dynamic multi-resource advance reservation in grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463200009"}
