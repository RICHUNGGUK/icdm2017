The resulting data were analysed by different statisticians and ophthalmologists during the last two decades. Most of the analyses were carried out on the baseline data, although there were two follow-up studies on the same population. A Bayesian analysis of the first follow-up data, taken four years after the baseline study, was carried out by Angers and Biswas [Angers, J.-F. and Biswas, A., 2004, A Bayesian analysis of the four-year follow-up data of theWisconsin epidemiologic study of diabetic retinopathy. Statistics in Medicine, 23, 601-615.], where the choice of the best model in terms of the covariate inclusion is done, and estimates of the associated covariate effects were obtained using the baseline data to set the prior for the parameters. In the present article we consider an univariate transformation of the bivariate ordinal data, and a parallel analysis with the much simpler univariate data is carried out. The results are then compared with the results of Angers and Biswas (2004). In conclusion, our analyses suggest that the univariate analysis fails to detect features of the data found by the bivariate analysis. Even an univariate transformation of our data with quite high correlation with both left and right eyes is inadequate.", "paper_title": "Bivariate versus univariate ordinal categorical data with reference to an ophthalmologic study", "paper_id": "WOS:000257030600001"}
