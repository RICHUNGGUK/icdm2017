In the context of systems based on radio frequency identification (RFLD) technology, we present a model that defines the constituents of complexity in this type of system, and discuss how object-oriented techniques can mitigate the complexity. The model, extended from prior models of organizational change and systems development, defines system complexity across three dimensions: architecture, component, and infrastructure. The model explains how changes in the architectural and component knowledge of a system are engendered by the shift from a digital to a physical infrastructure, leading to what is termed a 'radical' change. We link the architectural and component characteristics of a physically distributed object-oriented (PDO) system to the design elements of an object-oriented system, and indicate how an object-oriented approach can mitigate the complexity of the physical system's design and overall control structure.", "paper_title": "MODELING COMPLEXITY IN PHYSICALLY-DISTRIBUTED OBJECT-ORIENTED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271789700008"}
