A strict separation of feature extraction, feature storage, feature comparison, and the user interfaces is suggested. This allows to reuse implemented components in different retrieval algorithms, which improves software quality, shortens the development cycle for applications, and allows to introduce standardized end-user interfaces. Based on the proposed framework, the IRMA engine has been established, which is currently used to evaluate content-based retrieval methods on a collection of 20,000 medical and 135,000 non-medical images.
