Methods: We computed symbolic sequences of the three phases, as they retain important features of the dynamics generated by the underlying control system Then we applied a method based on rank order statistics of symbolic sequences to investigate the profile of different types of dynamics The linguistic distance (range 0-1) between sequences represents a measure of similarity to assess whether the different physiological states are reflected on the dynamics of RR and SAP series Results: The distance between rest and tilt phases is 0.06 +/- 0.02 for RR series, meaning; they are very similar, while it is 0.21 +/- 0 13 for SAP series, showing a difference in the short-term dynamics RR mean decreases during tilt (738 +/- 164 vs. 692 +/- 152 ms, p < 0.05, rest vs. tilt), while mean SAP is not significantly different (101 +/- 20 vs. 104 +/- 14 mmHg, rest vs. tilt). Comparing AF and sinus rhythm, both RR and SAP series result different in terms of the computed distance. Conclusions: SAP short-term dynamics seem to significantly change when comparing rest and tilt phases, while RR series remain unchanged Moreover, RR mean but not SAP series significantly decreases during tilt.", "paper_title": "Heart Rate and Systolic Blood Pressure in Patients with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation A Linguistic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000283707500020"}
