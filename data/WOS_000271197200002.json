They are an extension of multi bottom-up tree transducers by arbitrary, not just shallow, left-hand sides of rules; this includes rules that do not consume input. It is shown that such transducers, even linear ones, can compute all transformations that are computed by linear extended top-down tree transducers, which are a theoretical model for syntax-based machine translation. Moreover, the classical composition results for bottom-up tree transducers are generalized to extended multi bottom-up tree transducers. Finally, characterizations in terms of extended top-down tree transducers and tree bimorphisms are presented.", "paper_title": "Extended multi bottom-up tree transducers", "paper_id": "WOS:000271197200002"}
