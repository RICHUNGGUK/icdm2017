Users hope to get all kinds of network resources they need via wireless networks no matter where they are. In order to support users who are transporting by vehicles, more efforts are on the technology of vehicular networks. The high mobility and topology diversity of vehicular networks, however, are the major challenges to develop \"technology for wireless networks. In addition, in the environment of vehicular networks, it is considerably hard to control and manage the status of connections of wireless network because the number of users changes rapidly with time and position. For the sake of obtaining the status of vehicular networks in real time and estimating the quality of network connections accurately, we propose an available real-time bandwidth estimation mechanism based on the properties of vehicular networks. By detecting the number of users within the transmission range and the mobile information provided by the vehicles, our paper focuses on accurately estimating the efficiency index of network connections; moreover, we propose an cooperative packet forwarding mechanism to improve the transmission quality of network services requested by users and to enhance the overall network utilization. The simulations are done to show the improvement of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Packet Forwarding Mechanism Based on Bandwidth Prediction with Consideration of V2I and V2V Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000347744000005"}
