Motivated by this expectation, CARMEN (CARrier grade MEsh Networks) project focuses on developing a heterogeneous mesh backhaul to provide carrier-grade (voice, video and data) services. This demo presents resource management and abstraction in CARMEN architecture, which allow meeting the challenges of heterogeneous radio access.", "paper_title": "CARMEN: Resource Management and Abstraction in Wireless Heterogeneous Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800076"}
