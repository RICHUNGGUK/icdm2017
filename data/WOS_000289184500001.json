This paper describes a new method for the registration of large Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope sequences (SLO), where the patient has been injected with a fluorescent dye. This allows the measurement of parameters such as the arteriovenous passage time. Due to the long time needed to acquire these sequences, there will inevitably be eye movement, which must be corrected prior to the application of quantitative analysis. The algorithm described here combines mutual information-based registration and landmark-based registration. The former will allow the alignment of the darkest frames of the sequence, where the dye has not still arrived to the retina, because of its ability to work with images without a preprocessing or segmentation, while the latter uses relevant features (the vessels) extracted by means of a robust creaseness operator, to get a very fast and accurate registration. The algorithm only detects rigid transformations but proves to be robust against the slight alterations derived from the eye location perspective during acquisition. Results were validated by expert clinicians. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
