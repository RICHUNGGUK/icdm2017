In contrast to the naive exhaustive search which entails large-scale linear programs, we show that the computational burden can be cut down significantly by a simple two-stage algorithm: (1) projecting the query and database subspaces into lower-dimensional space by random Cauchy matrix and solving small-scale distance evaluations (linear programs) in the projection space to locate the nearest candidates; (2) with few candidates upon independent repetition of (1), getting back to the high-dimensional space and performing exhaustive search. To preserve the identity of the nearest subspace with nontrivial probability, the projection dimension typically is a low-order polynomial of the subspace dimension multiplied by a logarithm of the number of the subspaces (Theorem 2.1). The reduced dimensionality and hence complexity render the proposed algorithm particularly relevant to vision applications such as robust face and object instance recognition that we investigate empirically.", "paper_title": "Efficient Point-to-Subspace Query in l(1) with Application to Robust Object Instance Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000346854900008"}
