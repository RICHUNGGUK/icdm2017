Indeed, such articulation artifacts are typically much larger than the brain signal of interest. Recently, a Blind Source Separation technique based on Canonical Correlation Analysis was proposed to separate tonic muscle artifacts from continuous EEG recordings in epilepsy. In this paper, we show how the same algorithm can be adapted to remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation on every trial. Several analyses indicate that this method accurately attenuates the muscle contamination on the EEG recordings, providing to the neurolinguistic community a powerful tool to investigate the brain processes at play during overt language production.", "paper_title": "Removal of Muscle Artifacts from EEG Recordings of Spoken Language Production", "paper_id": "WOS:000278181000006"}
