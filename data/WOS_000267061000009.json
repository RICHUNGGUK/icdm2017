The model assumes that in the antiferromagnetic nanosystem, the disorder surface spins are frozen at low temperature along magnetic filed direction, forming a ferromagnetic layer. Then this results in an exchange bias. After some proper simplification, we get the magnetization at different applied field by the minimal energy calculation using MATLAB. Our model computerizing indicates the exchange bias shift of the magnetization curve is -48.2 Oe for n = 100 antiferromagentic layers, which matches the observed value very well.", "paper_title": "A FREEZING FERROMAGNETIC MOMENT MODEL FOR EXCHANGE BIAS IN alpha-Fe2O3 NANOLEAVES", "paper_id": "WOS:000267061000009"}
