DSNPE constructs graph and corresponding edge weights simultaneously through sparse representation (SR). DSNPE explicitly takes into account the within-neighboring information and between-neighboring information. Further, by taking the advantage of the maximum margin criterion (MMC), the discriminating power of DSNPE is further boosted. Experiments on the ORL, Yale, AR and FERET face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed DSNPE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
