The design issues, design constraints, and alternative design configurations are discussed and the potential advantages of the HaP-7 are put forward. The kinematic model of the proposed device looks like a simplified human arm kinematic model. The redundant characteristic of the device provides larger workspace and allows for appropriate posture selection for the purposes of maximization of the rigidity, transparency and stability, while minimizing the inertia and power consumption in addition to the singularity and obstacle avoidance optimization.", "paper_title": "7-DOF Haptic device and interface design", "paper_id": "WOS:000322743700013"}
