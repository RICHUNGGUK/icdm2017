A tight lower bound of the system outage probability has been derived, which is in good agreement with the exact outage probability in high SNR. Based on this tight bound, the diversity and coding gains are achieved providing valuable insights into practical system designs. The deducing method, characterized by high efficiency and low-complexity, can easily be extended to evaluate the system performance over other fading channels. Simulation results are finally presented to examine our results.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation for Asymmetric Two-Way AF Relaying in Rician Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700016"}
