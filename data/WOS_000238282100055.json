In a case study using data from a concrete plant in Hong Kong, PSO was compared with the genetic algorithms (GA) in assessing two mechanisms for optimizing stochastic simulation systems, namely, \"steady, averaging\" and \"non-steady, stochastic\". The results show our PSO-based approach could rapidly (5 minutes) converge at the minimum level for an output of the simulation model while GA failed to converge or required a long time (about 1.5 hours) in search of the minimum. In conclusion, the proposed optimization procedures hold the potential to provide a generic, efficient approach to tackling simulation optimization of stochastic, large-scale and complex systems.", "paper_title": "A particle swarm optimization-based approach to tackling simulation optimization of stochastic, large-scale and complex systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100055"}
