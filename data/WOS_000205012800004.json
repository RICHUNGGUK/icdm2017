We also examine the impact of redundancy elimination on the related problem of coverage-boundary detection. We reduce both problems to the computation of Voronoi diagrams, prove and achieve lower bounds on the solution of these problems, and present efficient distributed algorithms for computing and maintaining solutions in cases of sensor failures or insertion of new sensors. We prove the correctness and termination properties of our distributed algorithms, and analytically characterize the time complexity and traffic generated by our algorithms. Using detailed simulations, we also quantify the impact of system parameters such as sensor density, transmission range, and failure rates on network traffic.", "paper_title": "Redundancy and Coverage Detection in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205012800004"}
