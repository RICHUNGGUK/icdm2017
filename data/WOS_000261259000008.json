According to this rationale, one of the main goals of the Quadrantis project has been to investigate how to provide combined quality measurement of services and delivered objects, Such as videos, voice, texts, or images. QoS modelling and management according to users' needs are presented. Users will access services according to QoS Contracts negotiated with service providers, while the streaming content is based on user profiles, to face a more dynamic management of QoS deviations in the Real Time provisioning level. In our approach, applications can request QoS, and react and repair to violations of the terms set forth in contracts or in expected delivery parameters, such as bandwidth or frame rate. To this extent, we present a framework for providing applications and services with QoS adaptation functionality, through the step-wise induction of a monitoring and recovery solutions at both Web-Services and streaming layers. The foundations of the merging between the two layers, which deal with very different aspects and protocols, are based on quality. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
