The discontinuity in the solution of selected harmonic elimination (SHE) problem at certain modulation indices is avoided by optimizing the individual harmonics to allowable limits. While choosing the set of solution leading to minimum THD, the abrupt changes in the switching angles are discarded by limiting the voltage THD within allowable limits. Also the selected higher order harmonics are eliminated by additional switching along with the lower order harmonics. In order to reduce the computational burden for online application, the switching angles computed by the proposed PSO technique for optimum THD at varying modulation indices are stored as a look-up table in the DSP memory. The simulated results are also validated through suitable experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
