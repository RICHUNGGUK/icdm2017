Detection of these attacks rely almost exclusively on the selection of appropriate thresholds. In this work the authors demonstrate that there are additional, previously unconsidered, metrics which also influence DoS detection performance. A method of systematically tuning these metrics to optimal values is proposed which ensures that parameter choices are repeatable and verifiable.", "paper_title": "Impact of Metric Selection on Wireless DeAuthentication DoS Attack Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000027"}
