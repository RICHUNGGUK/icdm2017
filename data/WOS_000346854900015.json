As a consequence, the dynamic range of images encoding real world scenes, which is large, has to be compressed in order for them to be reproduced on a common display, and this technique is called tone mapping. Because there is no ground truth to compare with, evaluation of a tone mapped image has to be done by comparing with the original high dynamic range image. As standard metrics based on pixelwise comparisons are not suitable for comparing images of different dynamic range, nonlocal perceptual based metrics are commonly used. We propose a general method for optimizing tone mapped images with respect to a given nonlocal metric. In particular, if the metric is perceptual, i.e., it involves perceptual concepts, we provide an adequate minimization strategy. Experiments on a particular perceptual metric tested with different tone mapped images provided by several tone mapping operators validate our approach.", "paper_title": "A Nonlocal Variational Formulation for the Improvement of Tone Mapped Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000346854900015"}
