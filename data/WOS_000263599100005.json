In this paper, we show that removing exponential backoff from TCP altogether can be done without inducing any stability side-effects. We introduce the implicit packet conservation principle and show that as long as the endpoints uphold this principle, they can only improve their end-to-end performance relative to the exponential backoff case. By conducting large-scale simulations, modeling, and network experiments in Emulab and the Internet using a kernel-level FreeBSD TCP implementation, realistic traffic distributions, and complex network topologies, we demonstrate that TCP's binary exponential backoff mechanism can be safely removed. Moreover, we show that insuitability of TCP's exponential backoff is fundamental, i.e., independent from the currently-dominant Internet traffic properties or bottleneck capacities. Surprisingly, our results indicate that a path to incrementally deploying the change does exist.", "paper_title": "Removing Exponential Backoff from TCP", "paper_id": "WOS:000263599100005"}
