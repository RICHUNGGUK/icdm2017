The generating companies submit their offers to the demand companies. The demand companies also submit their bids to the generators. Each load or generator's agent wants to match with an opponent, which offers the most valuable proposal. However, the problem of simultaneous decision-making causes decision conflicts among the agents. To overcome this conflict, we assume loads as the leaders and generators as the followers. We use Stackelberg game to match the seller and buyer agents. The negotiation process between a buyer and its potential seller will determine the power price between them. This process is carried out through a proposed combined time-behavioral protocol (TBP). With negligible changes in around the agreed price, this protocol can reduce the negotiation time considerably. After successful negotiation, the seller and buyer agents could sign a bilateral contract of energy if the market conditions allow it. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated through a case study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
