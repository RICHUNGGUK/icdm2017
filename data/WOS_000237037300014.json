Design/methodology/approach - A 3D modelling technique of voltage-forced electromechanical actuator takes into account: motion, magnetic non-linearity and eddy current phenomena. Control problem of closed loop system is described by coupled electro-magneto-mechanical equations and non-linear PID controller equations. Findings - Presented methodology offers a powerful tool for analysis of control systems with distributed parameters models and may contribute to the improvement of the electromechanical performance of electrodynamic devices. Originality/value - As original contribution a position feedback control using conventional PID controller is applied for iterative determining inverse dynamic problem, that is finding input voltage for a given position of an actuator.", "paper_title": "Modelling and position control of voltage forced electromechanical actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000237037300014"}
