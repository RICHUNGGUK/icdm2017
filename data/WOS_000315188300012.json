The tests are based on a weighted integral incorporating the empirical characteristic function of suitably standardized data. Non-standard algorithms are employed for the computation of the maximum-likelihood estimators of the parameters involved in the test statistic, while Monte Carlo results are used in order to compare the new test with some classical goodness-of-fit methods.
