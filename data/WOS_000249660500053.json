The fundamental difference between previous volume illustration algorithms and ours is that our results are shape-aware, as they depend not only on the rendering styles, but also the shape styles. We propose a new data structure that is derived from the input volume and consists of a distance volume and a segmentation volume. The distance volume is used to reconstruct a continuous field around the object boundary, facilitating smooth illustrations of boundaries and silhouettes. The segmentation volume allows us to abstract or remove distracting details and noise, and apply different rendering styles to different objects and components. We also demonstrate how to modify the shape of illustrated objects using a new 2D curve analogy technique. This provides an interactive method for learning shape variations from 2D hand-painted illustrations by drawing several lines. Our experiments on several volume datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve visually appealing and shape-aware illustrations. The feedback from medical illustrators is quite encouraging.", "paper_title": "Shape-aware volume illustration", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500053"}
