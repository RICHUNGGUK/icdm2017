And more importantly, in order to get a most qualified composite service, a selection task needs to be done. And after carefully Study on the special features of composite service, a relatively new QoS model is proposed in this paper based on which we also give the way of how to use this model to select the most appropriate composite service among several potential composite services.", "paper_title": "A dynamic web service composite platform based on QoS of services", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100096"}
