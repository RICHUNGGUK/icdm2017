The proposed method divides a cover image into small sub-blocks and designs key pairs that determine both where the bit is to be embedded and whether it is possible to embed it there. Furthermore, the key pairs are required to extract the secret data from the stego-image. Experimental results demonstrate a higher capacity and less distortion compared with previous methods since almost all data are hidden in the edge areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
