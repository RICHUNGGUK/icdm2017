To get rid of the drawbacks of only finding the convex clusters and being sensitive to the initial points in -means algorithm, a hybrid clustering algorithm based on CPSO is proposed. The difference between the work and the existing ones lies in that CPSO is firstly introduced into -means. Experimental results performing on several data sets illustrate that the proposed clustering algorithm can get completely rid of the shortcomings of -means algorithms, and acquire correct clustering results. The application in image segmentation illustrates that the proposed algorithm gains good performance.", "paper_title": "A hybrid clustering algorithm based on PSO with dynamic crossover", "paper_id": "WOS:000334522300009"}
