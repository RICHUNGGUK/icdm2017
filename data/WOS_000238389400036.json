On the other hand, a number of similar yet more simple and robust techniques apply to 2D image data and are used for texture restoration. In this paper we make an attempt to bring these two-dimensional techniques to the 31) domain due to their obvious advantage of simplicity and controllability. Creating a depth image with the help of a voxelisation algorithm will allow us to apply a variety of image repair algorithms in order to mend a 3D object. The use of three variations of the texture synthesis algorithm is investigated. Constrained texture synthesis and its variations using the Haar wavelet and image decomposition methods are also proposed in order to preserve patterns appearing on the object while trying to maintain its geometry intact.", "paper_title": "3D object repair using 2D algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400036"}
