Consequently, the estimated and predicted software reliability tends to be over-optimistic, which could in turn mislead management in related decision-making. In this paper, we first make an in-depth analysis of real-life software testing process; then a Markovian SRM considering fault correction process is proposed. Parameter estimation method and software reliability prediction method are established. A numerical example is given which shows that by using the proposed model and methods. the results obtained tend to be more appropriate and realistic.", "paper_title": "Software Reliability Modeling Considering Fault Correction Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000274506200022"}
