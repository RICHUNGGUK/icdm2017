In this paper we show that this model reproduces many known empirical aspects of vehicular traffic such as the three states of traffic flow and the backward speed of the downstream front of a traffic jam ( C), without the aid of adjustable parameters. The model is studied for both open and closed single lane traffic systems. Also, we were able to analytically compute the value of C as 15: 37 km/h from a relation that only includes the human reaction time, the mean vehicle length and the effective friction coefficient during the braking process of a vehicle as its main components.", "paper_title": "MINIMAL TRAFFIC MODEL WITH SAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303345000001"}
