We show that PML satisfiability is only PSPACE-complete by designing a Ladner-like algorithm. This extends a well-known and non-trivial PSPACE upper bound for graded modal logic. Furthermore, we provide a detailed comparison with logics that contain Presburger constraints and that are dedicated to query XML documents. As an application, we show that satisfiability for Sheaves Logic SL is PSPACE-complete, improving significantly its best known upper bound.", "paper_title": "Presburger modal logic is PSPACE-complete", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085600044"}
