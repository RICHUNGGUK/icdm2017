We call S (subset of) under bar N a base if f (S) = f (N). We consider the problern of finding, a maximum number of disjoint bases; we denote by m* be this base packing number. A simple upper bound on m* is given by k* = max{k : Sigma(i is an element of N)f(A)(i) >= kfa(N), for all A (subset of) under bar N) where f(A)(S) = f (A boolean OR S) - f (A). This upper bound is a natural generalization of the bound for matroids where it is known that m* = k* For polymatroids, we prove that m* >= (1 - o(1))k*/In f (N) and give a randomized polynomial time algorithm to find (1 - o(1))k*/In f (N) disjoint bases, assuming an oracle for f. We also derandomize the algorithm using minwise independent permutations and give a deterministic algorithm that finds (1 - is an element of)k*/In f(N) disjoint bases. The bound we obtain is almost tight because it is known there are polymatroids for which m* < (1 + o(1))k*/In f(N). Moreover it is known that unless NP <(subset of)under bar> DTIME(n(log log n)), for any is an element of > 0, there is no polynomial time algorithm to obtain a (1 + is an element of)/In f(N)-approximation to m*. Our result generalizes and unifies two results in the literature. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
