If test sequences contain lots of don't cares (Xs), then their flexibility can be used to meet the above requirements. In this paper, we propose methods for finding as many Xs as possible in test sequences for sequential circuits. Given a fully specified test sequence generated by a sequential ATPG, the proposed methods produce a test sequence containing Xs without losing stuck-at fault coverage of the original test sequence. The methods apply an approach based on fault simulation, and they introduce some heuristics for reducing the simulation effort. Experimental results for ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "On finding don't cares in test sequences for sequential circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507400005"}
