The accuracy of the DFT-D method is substantiated by comparison with high level CCSD(T) calculations on a small number of representative complexes. It is found that a correct description of the intermolecular dispersive interactions is essential. Both the PM3-D* method and the GYLCAM06 force field yield interaction energies within 1 kcal mol(-1) of the DFT-D values, whilst those from the MM3 force field are in error by more than 2 kcal mol(-1).
