Image resizing and total variation based filtering are firstly used to pre-process the input image for regularization. Halftone transform based on the error diffusion mechanism is then performed to obtain one binary halftone image that can effectively represent the principle content of the original image. Two kinds of random pattern sequences with uniform and normal distributions are respectively utilized to extract the features of the halftone image. The generated binary feature string is finally scrambled to produce the resulting hash. The security of the scheme completely depends on the secret keys. Experiments are conducted to show that the present scheme has satisfactory robustness performance against perceptually content-preserving manipulations, and has very low anti-collision probability for the hashes of distinct images simultaneously.", "paper_title": "PERCEPTUAL IMAGE HASHING BASED ON THE ERROR DIFFUSION HALFTONE MECHANISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100014"}
