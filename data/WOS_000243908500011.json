We compute these measures for the SDPLIB suite problem instances and measure the sample correlation (CORR) between these measures and IPM iteration counts (solved using the software SDPT3) when these measures have finite values. Our conclusions are roughly as follows: the aggregate geometry measure is highly correlated with IPM iterations (CORR = 0.901), and provides a very good explanation of IPM iterations, particularly for problem instances with solutions of small norm and aspect ratio. The condition measure C(d) is also correlated with IPM iterations, but less so than the aggregate geometry measure (CORR = 0.630). The near-absence of strict complementarity is weakly correlated with IPM iterations (CORR = 0.423). The level of degeneracy of the optimal solution is essentially uncorrelated with IPM iterations.", "paper_title": "Behavioral measures and their correlation with IPM iteration counts on semi-definite programming problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500011"}
