There are numerous intelligent objects with different sensors and communication mechanisms. Today, road vehicles contain many advanced sensors that allow the collection of great amounts of parameters. With an appropriate communication mechanism, vehicles can be converted to intelligent objects capable of forming very useful systems such as road security, vehicle maintenance, urban mobility, traffic congestion, fleet management, CO2 emissions, etc. The problem is that the implementation of a system is not quick or easy. Many subsystems and heterogeneous elements intervene. The lack of speed in the development can be a big inconvenient, especially when the environment is as dynamic as traffic, subject to many variables. Currently, there are several platforms that integrate intelligent objects and the generation of applications, but none of them are focused on road vehicles. In this paper we present Vitruvius, a platform where users with no programming knowledge can design and quickly implement rich web applications based on the data consumption in real time from interconnected vehicles and sensors.
