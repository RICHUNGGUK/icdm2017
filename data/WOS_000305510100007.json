We investigate the possibility to use various multidimensional histograms and probability distributions for decomposition and predictive models. We show how these methods can be used in an example using images of different Skyros wall lizards and demonstrate improved performance in prediction of color morph compared with traditional parameterization techniques of spatial variance.
