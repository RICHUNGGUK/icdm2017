This is different from other volume tracking interface reconstruction methods in which an improper material ordering may result in materials being incorrectly located within the cell. The new method utilizes a type of weighted Voronoi diagram, known as a power diagram, to reconstruct the interface from approximate material locations derived either from a particle model or quadrature formula. It works on structured and general polygonal grids, for an arbitrary number of materials and can be naturally extended to three dimensions.
