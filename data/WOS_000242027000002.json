The new international video coding standard H.264/MPEG-4 part 10 aims at having significant improvements in coding efficiency, and error robustness in comparison with the previous standards such as MPEG-2, H.263, MPEG-4 part 2. This paper describes an overview of H.264/MPEG-4 part 10. We focus on the detailed features like coding algorithm and error resilience of new standard, and compare the coding schemes with the other standards. The performance comparisons show that H.264 can achieve a coding efficiency improvement of about 1.5 times or greater for each test sequence related to multimedia, SDTV and HDTV.
