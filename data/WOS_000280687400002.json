It has been developed as an open-source, multi-platform software, relying on data compression techniques for the storage of large amounts of data in the main memory. The performance of our solution in terms of compression, load time and response time is close to that of the commercial tool of reference, QlikView. Moreover, we provide solutions to some open problems in QlikView published description, which may be beneficial to assist in the development of other open or proprietary tools.
