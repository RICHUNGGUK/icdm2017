The investigation is based around a scenario from clinical work-administration of medicine to patients. Four interaction techniques that match the scenario are identified. We demonstrate how these techniques can be concretized through functional prototypes. The prototypes were tested with health workers in a full-scale model of a section of a hospital ward. The usability issues emerging from the tests were related to required user attention, predictability of system behavior, and integration with the work situation. We found that the usability of the interaction techniques to a large degree depended on specific physical and social conditions of the use situation. This result is an incentive to consider a broad set of sensor-based interaction techniques and devices for such systems, and to select the best few of these for implementation.", "paper_title": "A comparison of location and token-based interaction techniques for point-of-care access to medical information", "paper_id": "WOS:000257124300004"}
