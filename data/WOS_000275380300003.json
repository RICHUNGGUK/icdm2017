In the Dempster-Shafer framework, such issues can be addressed by attempting to design robust combination rules. instead of introducing another rule, we propose to use existing ones as part of a hierarchical and conditional combination scheme. The sources are represented by mass functions which are analysed and labelled regarding unreliability and imprecision. This conditional step divides the problem into specific sub-problems. In each of these sub-problems, the number of constraints is reduced and an appropriate rule is selected and applied. Two functions are thus obtained and analysed, allowing another rule to be chosen for a second (and final) fusion level. This approach provides a fast and robust way to combine disrupted sources using contextual information brought by a particle filter. our experiments demonstrate its efficiency on several visual tracking situations.
