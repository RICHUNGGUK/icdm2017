As intelligent mobile phones and wireless networks become more and more popular, network services for users are no longer limited to the home. Multimedia information can be obtained easily using mobile devices, allowing users to enjoy ubiquitous network services. Considering the limited bandwidth available for mobile streaming and different device requirements, this study presented a network and device-aware Quality of Service (QoS) approach that provides multimedia data suitable for a terminal unit environment via interactive mobile streaming services, further considering the overall network environment and adjusting the interactive transmission frequency and the dynamic multimedia transcoding, to avoid the waste of bandwidth and terminal power. Finally, this study realized a prototype of this architecture to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. According to the experiment, this method could provide efficient self-adaptive multimedia streaming services for varying bandwidth environments.", "paper_title": "A Network and Device Aware QoS Approach for Cloud-Based Mobile Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000319228500004"}
