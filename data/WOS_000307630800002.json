This article presents a complete treatment of a class of RAID-6 codes, called minimum density RAID-6 codes, that have an optimal blend of performance properties. There are two families of minimal density RAID-6 codes: Blaum-Roth codes and Liberation codes, and a separate special-purpose code called the Liber8tion code. The first of these have been known since the late 1990's, while the latter two are new constructions. In this article, we motivate, demonstrate, and evaluate the minimum density codes, comparing them to EVENODD and RDP codes, which represent the state-of-the-art in RAID-6. Following that, we prove that the codes indeed fit the RAID-6 methodology, and cite their implementation in an open-source library.", "paper_title": "Minimum Density RAID-6 Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307630800002"}
