Many works have been carried out to find the efficient algorithms for quality of service (QoS)-aware service selection problem in recent years. In this paper, a negative selection immune algorithm (NSA) is proposed, and as far as we know, this is the first time that NSA is introduced into web service selection problem. Domain terms and operations of NSA are firstly redefined in this paper aiming at QoS-aware service selection problem. NSA is then constructed to demonstrate how to use negative selection principle to solve this question. Thirdly, an inconsistent analysis between local exploitation and global planning is presented, through which a local alteration of a composite service scheme can transfer to the global exploration correctly. It is a general adjusting method and independent to algorithms. Finally, extensive experimental results illustrate that NSA, especially for NSA with consistency weights adjusting strategy (NSA+), significantly outperforms particle swarm optimization and clonal selection algorithm for QoS-aware service selection problem. The superiority of NSA+ over others is more and more evident with the increase of component tasks and related candidate services.", "paper_title": "QoS-aware web service selection with negative selection algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000339883200004"}
