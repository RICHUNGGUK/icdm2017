Despite this clear picture for 2-spin systems, there is little known for multispin systems. We present the first analog of this in approximability results for multispin systems. The main difficulty in previous inapproximability results was analyzing the behavior of the model on random Delta-regular bipartite graphs, which served as the gadget in the reduction. To this end, one needs to understand the moments of the partition function. Our key contribution is connecting: (i) induced matrix norms, (ii) maxima of the expectation of the partition function, and (iii) attractive fixed points of the associated tree recursions (belief propagation). The view through matrix norms allows a simple and generic analysis of the second moment for any spin system on random Delta-regular bipartite graphs. This yields concentration results for any spin system in which one can analyze the maxima of the first moment. The connection to fixed points of the tree recursions enables an analysis of the maxima of the first moment for specific models of interest. For k-colorings we prove that for even k, in a tree nonuniqueness region (which corresponds to k < Delta) there is no FPRAS, unless NP = RP, to approximate the number of colorings for triangle-free Delta-regular graphs. Our proof extends to the antiferromagnetic Potts model, and, in fact, to every antiferromagnetic model under a mild condition.", "paper_title": "Inapproximability for Antiferromagnetic Spin Systems in the Tree Nonuniqueness Region", "paper_id": "WOS:000366430000007"}
