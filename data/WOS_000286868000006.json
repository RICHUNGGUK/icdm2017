First, we construct measurable lower bonds on the purely algebraic bounds of concurrence [F. Mintert et al. (2004), Phys. Rev. lett., 92, 167902]. Then, using the fact that the sum of the square of the algebraic bounds is a lower bound of the squared concurrence, we sum over our measurable bounds to achieve a measurable lower bound on concurrence. With two typical examples, we show that our method can detect more entangled states and also can give sharper lower bonds than the similar ones.", "paper_title": "MEASURABLE LOWER BOUNDS ON CONCURRENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000006"}
