We describe the use of mesh adaptation process to produce a faithful representation of an input image in the Finite Element (FE) space. This can be used, in turn, to generate from the input bitmap continuous material functions required for further FE computations. We propose an agent-based architecture suitable for localized implementation of the PBI operator. Finally, we show how to apply it to an exemplary problem of austenite-ferrite phase transformation.
