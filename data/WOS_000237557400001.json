The motivation is that face patterns can be divided into separated classes across views, and ECOC multi-class method can improve the robustness of multi-view face detection compared with the view-based methods because of its inherent error-tolerant ability. One key issue with ECOC-based multi-class classifier is how to construct effective binary classifiers. Besides applying ECOC to multi-view face detection, this paper emphasizes on designing efficient binary classifiers by learning informative features through minimizing the error rate of the ensemble ECOC multi-class classifier. Aiming at designing efficient binary classifiers, we employ spatial histograms as the representation, which provide an over-complete set of optional features that can be efficiently computed from the original images. In addition, the binary classifier is constructed as a coarse to fine procedure using fast histogram matching followed by accurate Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to multi-view faces, and achieves performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art approaches to multi-view face detection.", "paper_title": "Robust multi-view face detection using Error Correcting Output Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400001"}
