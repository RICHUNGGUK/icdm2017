In three dimensions and above, the problem has natural Axial and Planar versions, both of which are NP-hard. For 3-dimensional Axial random assignment instances of size n, the cost scales as (1/ n), and a main result of the present paper is a linear-time algorithm that, with high probability, finds a solution of cost O(n(-1+o(1))). For 3-dimensional Planar assignment, the lower bound is (n), and we give a new efficient matching-based algorithm that with high probability returns a solution with cost O(n log n).
