Firstly, some operational laws of hesitant triangular fuzzy elements and score function of hesitant fuzzy elements are introduced. Then, we have developed the hesitant triangular fuzzy choquet ordered averaging (HTFCOA) operator. The prominent characteristic of the operators is that they can not only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also reflect the correlation among the elements or their ordered positions. We have applied the HTFCOA operators to multiple attribute decision making for potential evaluation of emerging technology commercialization projects with hesitant triangular fuzzy information. Finally an illustrative example for potential evaluation of emerging technology commercialization projects has been given to show the developed method.", "paper_title": "Models for multiple attribute decision making method in hesitant triangular fuzzy setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500008"}
