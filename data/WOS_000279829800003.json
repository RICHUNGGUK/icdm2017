Agent-based modeling is a proven approach for modeling complex networks of intelligent and distributed actors. In this paper, we will demonstrate how an agent-based model can be used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a global enterprise, considering both the system-level performance as well as the components' behavior. This quantitative model can be very useful for predicting the effects of local and operational activities on plant performance and improving the tactical and strategic decision-making at the enterprise level.", "paper_title": "AGENT-BASED MODELING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT IN A MULTI-PLANT ENTERPRISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800003"}
