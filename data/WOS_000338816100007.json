In this Paper, the Quality of Services of Mobile WiMAX and 3GPP LTE are analyzed and compared. We analyze the LTE and WiMAX performances in downlink employing an analytical approach for estimating the Quality of Services based on its parameters including delay and bit error rate (BER). Our proposed approach consists of two steps. The physical layer is simulated using the finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model to calculate the bit error rate. Then, the data link layer is simulated employing the effective bandwidth model for both constant and variable rate traffics. Our analysis demonstrates that WiMAX provides better QoS in low average signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, by increasing the average signal to noise ratio, both technologies provide almost the same QoS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
