To recover people's trust in digital images, the detection of image splicing is in great need. In this paper, a Markov based approach is proposed to detect this specific artifact. Firstly, the original Markov features generated from the transition probability matrices in DCT domain by Shi et al. is expanded to capture not only the intrablock but also the inter-block correlation between block DCT coefficients. Then, more features are constructed in DWT domain to characterize the three kinds of dependency among wavelet coefficients across positions, scales and orientations. After that, feature selection method SVM-RFE is used to fulfill the task of feature reduction, making the computational cost more manageable. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is exploited to classify the authentic and spliced images using the final dimensionality-reduced feature vector. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform some state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
