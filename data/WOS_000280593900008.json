The frequency of the ring oscillator, 683 MHz, was locked to the on-chip voltage reference by means of a frequency-to-voltage converter, resulting in better than 90 ppm/A degrees C stability. The noise and jitter transfer characteristics of the loop were derived, and simulations were performed to see the effects of different noise types (white and 1/f noise) on the cumulative jitter of the locked ring oscillator. Finally, these results were verified by jitter measurements performed using an integrated time-to-digital converter (TDC) fabricated on the same die (0.18 mu m CMOS process). The cumulative jitter of the on-chip reference-locked ring oscillator was less than 30 ps (sigma value) over a time range of 70 ns, which made it possible to use this oscillator as the heart of a TDC when aiming at centimetre-level precision (1 cm = 67 ps) in laser ranging.", "paper_title": "Jitter characteristics of an on-chip voltage reference-locked time-to-digital converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000280593900008"}
