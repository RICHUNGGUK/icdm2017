Numerical simulation accuracy is affected, among other things, by grid resolution. Increasing the grid resolution requires computational and operating costs depending on the number of nodes and variables processed. The complexity of the management of the model increases when unstructured grids and local refinement are used. In order to improve the management and optimize the activities to update the model, an open source pre-processor has been developed using the open source codes GRASS GIS, SQLite and AMESH. Operations such as domain discretization, rock type assignment and mesh file generation have been automatized. Graphical interfaces allow for a user-friendly utilization. Operating errors and time required by pre-processing activities to generate and update locally refined unstructured grids have been reduced. Productivity in numerical modeling has been substantially increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
