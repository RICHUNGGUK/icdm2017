A recurrent neural network model with parametric bias, which has good generalization ability, is used as a learning model. Since the correspondences between auditory signals and visual signals are too numerous to memorize, the ability to generalize is indispensable. This system was implemented in the \"Keepon\" robot, and the robot was shown horizontal reciprocating or rotating motions with the sound of friction and falling or overturning motion with the sound of collision by manipulating a box object. Keepon behaved appropriately not only from learned events but also from unknown events and generated various sounds in accordance with observed motions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
