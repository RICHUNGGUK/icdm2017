In the coupling model, a rigid object is treated as a special fluid constrained to rigid body motion. To animate the coupling model, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method is used for solving the fluid motion equations. For keeping the rigidity of rigid objects, the total force and total torque exerted on solids is first worked out according to the impulse-momentum theorem, and then the movement of these rigid bodies is restricted to translations and rotations. Moreover, in order to prevent the fluids particles leaking into solids, a detection and correction procedure is presented, and the velocities of fluid particles will be tuned if the penetration is detected in this procedure. The proposed method can be implemented easily by extending the existing fluid solvers, the experimental results show that this method is capable of animating the realistic solid and fluid coupling.
