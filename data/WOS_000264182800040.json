Kansei Engineering as a customer-oriented methodology for product development, often has to analyse imprecise design information inherent with nonlinearity and uncertainty. This paper proposes a systematic approach to Kansei Engineering based on the dominance-based rough set theory. Two novel concepts known as category score and partition quality have been developed and incorporated into the proposed approach. The new approach proposed is able to identify and analyse two types of inconsistencies caused by indiscernibility relations and dominance principles respectively. The result of an illustrative case study shows that the proposed approach can effectively extract Kansei knowledge from imprecise design information, and it can be easily integrated into an expert system for customer-oriented product development.
