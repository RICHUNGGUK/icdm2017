In this paper, a wide-range low-cost all-digital duty-cycle corrector (ADDCC) is presented. The proposed ADDCC uses a delay-recycled half-cycle time delay line to reduce the required length of the delay line to half of the input clock period. Thus, it can extend the operating frequency toward a lower frequency with small area cost as compared with the conventional design. The proposed design is implemented in a standard performance 90-nm CMOS process, and the active area is 170 x 170 mu m(2). The input frequency of the proposed ADDCC ranges from 75 to 734 MHz, and the input duty-cycle ranges from 9% to 86%. The measured output duty-cycle error is less than 1.78%. The proposed ADDCC consumes 4.59 mW at 734 MHz and 0.9 mW at 75 MHz with a 1.0-V power supply.", "paper_title": "A Wide-Range Low-Cost All-Digital Duty-Cycle Corrector", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000012"}
