Analyses of the control flow of functional programs have been formulated in multiple settings and have led to many different approximations, starting with the seminal works of Jones, Shivers, and Sestoft. In this article, we survey control-flow analysis of functional programs by structuring the multitude of formulations and approximations and comparing them.", "paper_title": "Control-Flow Analysis of Functional Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584100001"}
