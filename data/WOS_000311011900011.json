However, a major drawback to the widespread acceptance of OFDM is the high peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of uncoded OFDM signals. Finding methods for construction of sequences with low PMEPR is an active research area. In this paper, by employing some new shortened and extended Golay complementary pairs as the seeds, we enlarge the family size of near-complementary sequences given by Yu and Gong. We also show that the new set of sequences we obtained is just a reversal of the original set. Numerical results show that the enlarged family size is almost twice of the original one. Besides, the Hamming distances of the binary near-complementary sequences are also analyzed.", "paper_title": "Construction of Near-Complementary Sequences with Low PMEPR for Peak Power Control in OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900011"}
