However, researchers must overcome some major hurdles before these benefits can be realized. One is managing RFID data, which is noisy, generated dynamically in very large streams, has a limited active lifespan, and possesses useful contextual characteristics such as temporality, spatiality, and implicit semantics. Deployment of large-scale RFID applications also introduces unique scalability and heterogeneity challenges. Security and privacy concerns also inhibit adoption of the technology.", "paper_title": "Enabling next-generation RFID applications: Solutions and challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000258934500008"}
