The structural components of the contour are of particular importance. To extract the structure from the contour, wavelet decomposition was used as these components tend to locate in the lower frequency sub-bands. Lesion contours were modeled as signatures with scale normalization to give position and frequency resolution invariance. Energy distributions among different wavelet sub-bands were then analyzed to extract those with significant levels and differences to enable maximum discrimination. Based on the coefficients in the significant sub-bands, structural components from the original contours were modeled, and a set of statistical and geometric irregularity descriptors researched that were applied at each of the significant sub-bands. The effectiveness of the descriptors was measured using the Hausdorff distance between sets of data from melanoma and mole contours. The best descriptor outputs were input to a back projection neural network to construct a combined classifier system. Experimental results showed that thirteen features from four sub-bands produced the best discrimination between sets of melanomas and moles, and that a small training set of nine melanomas and nine moles was optimum.
