Our proposed procedure allows us to share computations when adjusting different clique marginals on junction trees. This makes our procedure more efficient than existing procedures for maximum likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian graphical models. Some numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed procedure for maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian graphical models with the number of variables up to the two thousands. We also demonstrate our proposed procedures by two genetic examples.", "paper_title": "An improved Hara-Takamura procedure by sharing computations on junction tree in Gaussian graphical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000305963700011"}
