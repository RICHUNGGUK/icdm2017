The circuit design of major building blocks is described. The performance of this circuit is demonstrated by experimental results. The experimental results confirm the capability of Analog T-switch scheme to fulfill circuit requirements.", "paper_title": "A 0.6-V subthreshold-leakage suppressed fully differential CMOS switched-capacitor amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700010"}
