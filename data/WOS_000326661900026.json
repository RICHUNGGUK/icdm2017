Choosing a cluster head within each cluster is important because cluster heads use additional energy for their responsibilities and that burden needs to be carefully passed around among nodes in a cluster. Many existing protocols either choose cluster heads randomly or use nodes with the highest remaining energy. We present an Energy Constrained minimum Dominating Set based efficient clustering called ECDS to model the problem of optimally choosing cluster heads with energy constraints. Our proposed randomized distributed algorithm for the constrained dominating set runs in O(log n log Delta) rounds with high probability where Delta is the maximum degree of a node in the graph. We provide an approximation ratio for the ECDS algorithm of expected size 8H(Delta)vertical bar OPT vertical bar and with high probability a size of O(vertical bar OPT vertical bar log n) where n is the number of nodes, H is the harmonic function and OPT means the optimal size. We propose multiple extensions to the distributed algorithm for the energy constrained dominating set. We experimentally show that these extensions perform well in terms of energy usage, node lifetime, and clustering time in comparison and, thus, are very suitable for wireless sensor networks.
