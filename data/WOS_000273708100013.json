Each tone level is sequentially designed from highlight to midtone by applying an iterative halftoning algorithm such as direct binary search (DBS). By allowing random seeding followed by swap-only DBS in a predefined core region within each microcell, each level can be designed while satisfying the stacking constraint and guaranteeing a smooth transition between levels. This paper describes a complete design process for the hybrid screen, introduces a number of enhancements to the original hybrid screen, and evaluates their impact on print quality. These enhancements include a multilevel screen design based on either extending a bilevel screen or directly generating a multilevel screen on a high resolution grid, and extending the hybrid screen design procedure to color by jointly optimizing the color screens using color DBS. For the multilevel screen, we show that the best choice for the core size critically depends on the bit depth and screen frequency. For the color hybrid screen, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the highlights over halftones generated by independently designed screens.", "paper_title": "The Hybrid Screen-Improving the Breed", "paper_id": "WOS:000273708100013"}
