This task includes transparent fault tolerance, efficient deployment of resources and support for all the needs of parallel applications: parallel I/O, deterministic behavior and responsiveness. These challenges may seem daunting with commodity hardware and operating systems, since they were not designed to support a global, single management view of a large-scale system. In this paper we propose and demonstrate an abstract network interface in the cluster interconnect to facilitate the implementation of a simple yet powerful global operating system. This system, which can be thought of as a coarse-grain SIMD operating system, can allow commodity clusters to grow to thousands of nodes, while still retaining the usability and performance of the single-node workstation.", "paper_title": "An abstract interface for system software on large-scale clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000238906600006"}
