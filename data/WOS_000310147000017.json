In particular, there is a challenge to measure risk program compliance and maturity to guidelines such as the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum \"Updated Principles for Risk Analysis\" among others. This paper demonstrates a systemic approach to evaluate large-scale risk program maturity with utilization of business process modeling and self-assessment methods. This approach will be helpful to agencies implementing risk guidelines such as those of the OMB, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Defense, and others. This paper will be of interest to risk managers, agencies, and risk and safety analysts engaged in the conception, implementation, and evaluation of risk and safety programs.", "paper_title": "Risk and Safety Program Performance Evaluation and Business Process Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000310147000017"}
