This study delaminated customer value based on previous literature and blended the evolution of the CRM concept to build a customer value model. This work applied a Markov Chain and Bayesian theorem to forecast and recommend appropriate CRM e-services to customers, using Apple iTunes as a case study. Findings revealed that precision was the highest for 52 samples of customer behavior The precision of a typical student or addicted worker can reach 70.6%, 60.4% for an addicted student, and 50% for a typical worker The performance of Bayesian theorem is insignificantly influenced by customer type and sample. The adequacy was as high as 90%. The proposed framework not only revisits the value on needs, but also helps firms recommend appropriate services.", "paper_title": "REVISITING CUSTOMER VALUE BY FORECASTING E-SERVICE USAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000303784700005"}
