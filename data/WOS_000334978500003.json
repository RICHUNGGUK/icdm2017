The inevitability of these interferences demands for interference avoidance schemes to ensure reliability of network operations. This paper proposes a novel Diversified Adaptive Frequency Rolling (DAFR) technique for frequency hopping in Bluetooth piconets. DAFR employs intelligent hopping procedures in order to mitigate self interferences, weeds out the static interferer efficiently and ensures sufficient frequency diversity. We compare the performance of our proposed technique with the widely used existing frequency hopping techniques, namely, Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) and Adaptive Frequency Rolling (AFR). Simulation studies validate the significant improvement in goodput and hopping diversity of our scheme compared to other schemes and demonstrate its potential benefit in real world deployment.
