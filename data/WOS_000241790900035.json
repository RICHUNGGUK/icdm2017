Appearance-based methods are one of the popular solutions to this problem. In this paper we present a novel approach using vector quantization that adds spatial information to the feature set. We compare this with raw, Gabor filtered and Wavelet features using the Carnegie Mellon PIE database. Our approach shows increased performance over the other methods.", "paper_title": "Vector quantization segmentation for head pose estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900035"}
