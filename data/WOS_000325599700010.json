We show in particular that every prime double square tile may be obtained from the unit square by applying successively some invertible operators on double squares. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Provencal and Vuillon (2008) [17] stating that these polyominoes are invariant under rotation by angle pi. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
