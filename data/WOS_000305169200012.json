And for the clinical medical domain of modern medicine, this paper also constructs a concept system with multidimensional model by restructuring and utilizing the generally acknowledged domain knowledge, realizes the automatic construction and acquisition of modern medical knowledge descriptive system. Furthermore, in the ontology evolution, this paper comes up with an automatic method of retrieving attribute values based on Internet, which makes up for the defects of limited information and slow update in the automatic ontology construction based on single text. Our methods have achieved good results, and further provide theoretical foundation and technical support to automatic construction of professional domain ontologies.", "paper_title": "ON AUTOMATIC CONSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL ONTOLOGY CONCEPT'S DESCRIPTION ARCHITECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200012"}
