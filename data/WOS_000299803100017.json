It is generated from interferometry SAR (InSAR) using two co-registered radar Single Look complex (SLC) [1-3]. This work concerns the exploitation of radar images SLC of the Algiers area acquired on 03 January and 04 January 1994. The former is taken as a master image and the latter as a slave image. We have developed an interferometric process starting with the implementation of a co-registration algorithm for our images, then the elimination of flat-earth phase from the interferogram and at the end we developed a filter in order to minimize the existing noise to have good results after the unwrapping step using our own developed method.
