The inputs for the identification is the rate of insulin (mu U/dl/min) applied to the patient, and blood glucose concentration. The output is insulin concentration (mu U/ml) present in the blood stream. Once completed the off-line modeling, this model could be used for on-line monitoring of the insulin concentration for a better treatment. The learning law of the recurrent neural network is inspired by adaptive observer theory, and proven to be convergent in the parameters and stable in the Lyapunov sense, even with only 13 samples available. Simulation results are shown to validate the presented modeling.", "paper_title": "A DISCRETE-TIME RECURRENT NEUROFUZZY NETWORK FOR BLACK-BOX MODELING OF INSULIN DYNAMICS IN DIABETIC TYPE-1 PATIENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276967600005"}
