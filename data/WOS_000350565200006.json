Inspired by the thriving field of smart tools, our handheld device uses 6DOF tracking, augmentation of the airbrush trigger, and a specialized algorithm to restrict the application of paint to a preselected reference image. Our device acts both as a physical spraying device and as an intelligent assistive tool, providing simultaneous manual and computerized control. Unlike prior art, here the virtual simulation guides the physical rendering (inverse rendering), allowing for a new spray painting experience with singular physical results. We present our novel hardware design, control software, and a user study that verifies our research objectives.", "paper_title": "Augmented Airbrush for Computer Aided Painting (CAP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000350565200006"}
