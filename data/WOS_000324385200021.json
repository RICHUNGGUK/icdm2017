A learning based approach is considered to develop the contrast enhancement using human observations and low-level contrast enhancement metrics based on the human vision system. In addition, we provide new low-level metrics based on the physics of the scene to improve the performance of existing contrast enhancement metrics. This paper shows that a contrast enhancement metric can be designed to mimic human preference.", "paper_title": "A No-Reference Perceptual Based Contrast Enhancement Metric for Ocean Scenes in Fog", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200021"}
