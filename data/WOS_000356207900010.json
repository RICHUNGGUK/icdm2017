However, objectively evaluating the quality and the potential of TS is difficult for the TS provider because its milieu differs from that of the customer. This obstructs the progression of TS development and usage. This study therefore provides a model for measuring the presence, magnitude, and form of the perception discrepancy regarding TS. This model can help the TS provider and the customer gauge the pros and cons of investment in TS and shape corresponding strategies by linking the developed model, short/long-term TS strategies, and business activities related to TS.
