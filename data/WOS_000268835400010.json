Design/methodology/approach - The problem of identifying a nonlinear compartmental system appears as badly stated a priori. In fact the problem is not to identify the general behavior law of exchange between compartments, but to assume these laws known such as in Michaelis-Menten systems or in polynomial compartmental systems with coefficients that need to be identified. It has been proved previously that with a linearization method an approximation call be obtained to the identification of these nonlinear systems. To Validate this method, a stability study is necessary. Findings - Sufficient conditions are established for the evolution law of a nonlinear bicompartmental system under which the linearization method is stable, and an upper bound is given on the approximation error - with an application, in the last section to the case of an open Michaelis-Menten system. Originality/value - The paper is of value in establishing sufficient conditions about the evolution law of a nonlinear System in order to show that this method is stable and to give an upper bound on the approximation error.", "paper_title": "Stability of the linearization method in compartmental analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400010"}
