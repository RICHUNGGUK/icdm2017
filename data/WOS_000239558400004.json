By regarding finite metrics as discrete concave functions, Bandelt-Dress' split decomposition can be derived as a special case of more general decomposition of polyhedral/discrete concave functions introduced in this paper. It is shown that the combinatorics of splits discussed in connection with the split decomposition corresponds to the geometric properties of a hyperplane arrangement and a point configuration. Using our approach, the split decomposition of metrics can be naturally extended to distance functions, which may violate the triangle inequality, using partial split distances.", "paper_title": "A geometric study of the split decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239558400004"}
