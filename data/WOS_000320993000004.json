However, this letter provides a new worst-case throughput bound, which is higher than 1/2 network capacity, for odd radix two-dimensional mesh networks. In addition, we propose a routing algorithm called U2TURN that can achieve this worst-case throughput bound. U2TURN considers all routing paths with at most 2 turns and distributes the traffic loads uniformly in both X and Y dimensions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that U2TURN outperforms existing routing algorithms in worst-case throughput. Moreover, U2TURN achieves good average-throughput at the expense of approximately 1.5x minimal average hop count.", "paper_title": "A New Worst-Case Throughput Bound for Oblivious Routing in Odd Radix Mesh Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000320993000004"}
