In this paper, a new type of state feedback controller, namely, interval type-2 regional switching fuzzy controller, is proposed to conceive less-conservative stabilisation conditions, which is switched by basing on the values of system states. To further reduce the conservativeness in the stability analysis, the information of lower and upper membership functions is also considered. Stability conditions for the interval type-2 fuzzy closed-loop systems are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "State feedback control of interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems via interval type-2 regional switching fuzzy controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000357938800007"}
