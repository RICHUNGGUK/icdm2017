This study aims to measure the effect of clinical trials citations on several bibliometric indicators: citations per document (CD); journal impact factor (JIF); relative h-index (RhI) and strike rate index (SRI). We select all the citable documents published in the NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, AIM and BMJ, for the period 2000-2004, and record the citations received by those papers from 2000 to 2005. Our results show that clinical trials have a CD significantly higher than those for conventional papers; JIF is lower when clinical trials are excluded, especially for NEJM, Lancet and JAMA. Finally, both RhI and SRI seem to be unaffected by clinical trials citations.", "paper_title": "Measuring the influence of clinical trials citations on several bibliometric indicators", "paper_id": "WOS:000268881700013"}
