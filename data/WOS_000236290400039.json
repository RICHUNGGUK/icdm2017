Driving behavior signals, such as the use of the accelerator pedal, brake pedal, vehicle velocity, and distance from the vehicle in front, were measured using a driving simulator. We compared the identification rate obtained using different identification models. As a result, we found the Gaussian Mixture Model to be Superior to the Helly model and the optimal velocity model. Also, the driver's operation signals were found to be better than road environment signals and car behavior signals for the Gaussian Mixture Model. The identification rate for thirty driver using actual vehicle driving in a city area was 73%.", "paper_title": "Driver identification using driving behavior signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400039"}
