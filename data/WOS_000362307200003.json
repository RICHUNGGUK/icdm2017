While the existing research on conditional anonymity is limited to the probabilistic setting, in this paper we introduce the notion of set-theoretic conditional anonymity by considering the threat from non-probabilistic adversary. Then we refine the understanding of the relationship between strong anonymity and conditional anonymity. Moreover, in order to quantitatively evaluate system's degree of anonymity, we propose a metric for set-theoretic conditional anonymity and a variant of an existing metric for probabilistic conditional anonymity. We formally show that a system will lose more (at best preserve equal) anonymity when adversary obtains more observable outputs from the system, which confirms the intuition that observations reveal sensitive information.
