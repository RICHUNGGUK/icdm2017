Two versions of the model are presented. The basic model requires only bed topography along a flowline and a yield stress for ice as inputs. The latter can be tuned using 'target ice elevations' derived from geomorphological mapping. A more sophisticated form of the model allows the yield stress to vary along the flowline, and incorporates the effect of valley-side drag on the glacier profile. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
