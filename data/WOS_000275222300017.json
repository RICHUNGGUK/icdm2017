The problems of model uncertainty, atmospheric disturbances and handling qualities specification requirements (as in ADS-33E) are all considered at the same time during the control design phase. Robust I-I,, technique is applied in inner loop ensuring stability of unmanned helicopter system (in case of change of helicopter dynamics and model uncertainty) and the effectively reduces effect of gust disturbance on helicopter states and collective/cyclic inputs. In outer loop, PI control is utilized to improve dynamic and static operation characteristics. Based on the proposed control design method, attitude control and attitude holding (ACAH) flight mode is designed. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that satisfactory command response and decoupling characteristics are achieved in accordance with Level 1 handling requirements, as defined in ADS-33E.", "paper_title": "ROBUST MULTIMODE CONTROL DESIGN FOR AN UNMANNED HELICOPTER WITH MULTILOOP FLIGHT STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300017"}
