Previous algorithms are not able to control the usage of the memory and to deliver the desired accuracy, so it is hard to detect the superpoints on a high speed link in real time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm to detect the superpoints in real time, which uses a flow sample and hold module to reduce the detection of the non-superpoints and to improve the measurement accuracy of the superpoints. We also design a data stream structure to maintain the flow records, which compensates for the flow Hash collisions statistically. An adaptive process based on different sampling probabilities is used to maintain the recorded IP addresses in the limited memory. This algorithm is compared with the other algorithms by analyzing the real network trace data. Experiment results and mathematic analysis show that this algorithm has the advantages of both the limited memory requirement and high measurement accuracy.", "paper_title": "Adaptive sampling algorithm for detection of superpoints", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000012"}
