In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of the problem vc-pm* that decides if a given graph with perfect matching has a vertex cover of size bounded by n/2 + k. We first present an algorithm of running time O*(4(k)) for a variation of the vertex cover problem on Konig graphs with perfect matching. This algorithm combined with the iterative compression technique leads to an algorithm of running time O*(9(k)) for the problem vc-pm*. Our result improves the previous best algorithm of running time O*(15(k)) for the vc-pm* problem, which reduces the problem to the almost 2-sat problem and solves the latter by Razgon and O'Sullivan's recent algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the parameterized vertex cover problem for graphs with perfect matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000337259300007"}
