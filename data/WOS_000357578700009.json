Although IPv6 was built with security in mind, extensive research must be done before deploying IPv6 to ensure the protection of security and privacy. This paper firstly presents the differences between the old and new IP versions (IPv4 and IPv6), and how these differences will affect the attacks, then the paper will show how the attacks on IPv4 and IPv6 will remain mostly the same; furthermore, the use of IPv6 will give rise to new types of attacks and change other types' behavior.", "paper_title": "Ipv6 Change Threats Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578700009"}
