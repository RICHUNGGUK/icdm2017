By compensating for the internal oil pressure of this BPGS, it is possible to improve the vibration suppression capability. In this study, we construct a machine cushion with a pressure-compensated BPGS to observe and investigate the characteristics of both the pressure-compensated BPGS and the machine cushion. The machine cushion reduces the impact force and vibration waves from a machine to the ground and vice versa. Related dynamic equations are derived and the transient responses are conducted. The capability to reduce the impact force and vibration waves from the machine to ground of those machine cushions constructed with and without internal pressure compensation is compared. These are used to evaluate the feasibility and the limitations of using pressure-compensated BPGS in constructing vibration suppression mechanisms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
