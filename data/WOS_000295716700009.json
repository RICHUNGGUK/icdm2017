Then the numerical approximation typically involves three processes: (a) reduction to a finite interval; (b) discretization; (c) application of a numerical eigenvalue solver such as the QR-algorithm. Reduction to a finite interval and discretization typically eliminate the continuous spectrum. However, through round-off error, the continuous spectrum may show up again when the eigenvalue solver is applied. (In some sense, three wrongs make a right.) Interestingly, not all parts of the continuous spectrum show up in the same way, however. We illustrate this observation by numerical examples. A perturbation argument, though non-rigorous, explains the observation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
