It comprises good balance between exploitation (employed bee phase and onlooker bee phase) and exploration (scout bee phase). As nowadays, more researchers are using ABC and its variants as a control group to perform comparisons, it is crucial that comparisons with other algorithms are fair. This paper points to some misapprehensions when comparing meta-heuristic algorithms based on iterations (generations or cycles) with special emphasis on ABC. We hope that through our findings this paper can be treated as a beacon to remind researchers to learn from these mistakes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
