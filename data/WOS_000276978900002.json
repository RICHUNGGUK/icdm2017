In this paper, an abstract architecture is presented, supporting interaction with mobile context aware applications in public digitally augmented spaces. We focus on how this architecture supports personalization of interaction and adaptation. The main goal of the architecture is to allow users to benefit of a uniform and personalized experience across different contexts and spaces. Among the concerns are: to support high interoperability and flexibility and to address issues of privacy and user control. The framework has been tested in typical augmented spaces: a library and a museum. The paper concludes with a set of examples of use of the defined framework that cover typical situations for intra-space and across spaces usage.", "paper_title": "AN ARCHITECTURE TO SUPPORT PERSONALIZED INTERACTION ACROSS MULTIPLE DIGITALLY AUGMENTED SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000276978900002"}
