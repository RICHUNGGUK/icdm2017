To this end, software infrastructure and Web applications have been developed. Experimental results show that the effort required to develop a simple Semantic Web application is reduced in terms of development time and number of required tools. Besides, users report high values of usability and satisfaction concerning the user interface of these applications.", "paper_title": "Simplifying Semantic Web application development and semantic data usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000275821500004"}
