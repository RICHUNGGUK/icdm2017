In the receiver, a wide-input range CMOS multi-mode active rectifier is proposed for a magnetic resonant wireless battery charging system. The configuration is automatically changed with respect to the magnitude of the input AC voltage. The output voltage of the multi-mode rectifier is sensed by a comparator. Furthermore, the configuration of the multi-mode rectifier is automatically selected by switches as original rectifier mode, 1-stage voltage multiplier or 2-stage voltage multiplier mode. As a result, a rectified DC voltage is output from 7.5 to 19 V for an input AC voltage of 5-20 V. In the transmitter, a class-E power amplifier (PA) with an automatic power control loop and load compensation circuit is proposed to improve the power efficiency. The transmitted power is controlled by adjusting the signal applied to the gate of the power control transistor. In addition, a parallel capacitor is also controlled to enhance the efficiency and compensate for the load variation. This chip is implemented using 0.35 mu m BCD technology with an active area of around 5,000 x 2,500 mu m. When the magnitude of the input AC voltage is 10 V, the power conversion efficiency of the multi-mode active rectifier is about 94 %.The maximum power efficiency of the receiver is about 70 %. The transmitter provides an output power control range of 10-30.2 dBm. The maximum power efficiency of the PA is 71.5 %.", "paper_title": "A high efficiency transmitter and receiver for magnetic resonant wireless battery charging system in 0.35 mu m BCD", "paper_id": "WOS:000332102200006"}
