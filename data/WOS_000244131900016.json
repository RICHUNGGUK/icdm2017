However, one issue that has not been looked into is considering human perception in deciding a transmission strategy for three-dimensional (3-D) objects. Several factors, such as the number of vertices and the resolution of texture, can affect the display quality of 3-D objects. When the resources of a graphics system are not sufficient to render the ideal image, degradation is inevitable. It is therefore important to study how individual factors affect the overall quality, and how the degradation can be controlled given limited bandwidth resources and possibility of data loss. In this paper, the essential factors determining the display quality are reviewed. We provide an overview of our research on designing a 3-D perceptual quality metric integrating two important ones, resolution of texture and resolution of mesh, that control the transmission bandwidth requirements. A review of robust mesh transmission considering packet loss is presented, followed by a discussion of the difference of existing literature with our problem and approach. We then suggest alternative strategies for packet transmission of both 3-D texture and mesh. These strategies are then compared with respect to preserving 3-D perceptual quality under packet loss.", "paper_title": "Perceptually optimized 3-D transmission over wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131900016"}
