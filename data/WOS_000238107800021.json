A process ontology and some kernel meta-activities are presented as the fundament for process support, such as modeling, enaction and evolution. In contrast to other process languages that only can evolve process model while encoding meta-process logic within PSEEs, our approach can also evolve meta-process model for adjusting process support mechanism flexibly.", "paper_title": "The design of a flexible software process language", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800021"}
