As in wireless communications systems, exploiting the temporal, spatial, and technological diversities in multiple cooperative MGs could bring about more efficient power generation and distribution. This paper investigates a hierarchical power scheduling approach to optimally manage power trading, storage, and distribution in a smart power grid with a macrogrid and cooperative MGs. We first formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and then decompose it into a two-tier formulation. The first-tier problem jointly considers user utility, transmission cost, and grid load variance, while the second-tier problem minimizes the power generation and transmission cost, and exploits distributed storage in the MGs. We develop an effective online algorithm to solve the first-tier problem and prove its asymptotic optimality, as well as a distributed optimal algorithm for solving the second-tier problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with trace-driven simulations and are shown to outperform several existing schemes with considerable gains.", "paper_title": "On Hierarchical Power Scheduling for the Macrogrid and Cooperative Microgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100031"}
