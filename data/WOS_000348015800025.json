The main aim is to achieve the already-proven properties of segment-based deadlock freedom requiring neither a topology graph as input, nor a centralized algorithm to configure network paths. After introducing the conceptual elements and the execution model of DiSR, we show how the open-source Nanoxim platform has been used to evaluate the proposed approach in the process of discovering irregular network topology while establishing network segments. Comparison against a tree-based approach shows how DiSR still preserves some important properties (coverage, defect tolerance, scalability) while avoiding resource hungry solutions such as virtual channels and hardware redundancy. Finally, we propose a gate-level hardware implementation of the required control logic and storage for DiSR, demonstrating a relatively acceptable impact ranging from 10 to about 20% of the budget of transistors available for each node.
