Such an approach relies on an exhaustive description of the signs and does not take in account the spatial structure of the sentence. In this paper, we will present a general model of sign language sentences that uses the construction of the signing space as a representation of both the meaning and the realisation of the sentence. We will propose a computational model of this construction and explain how it can be attached to a sign language grammar model to help both analysis and generation of sign language utterances.", "paper_title": "Using signing space as a representation for sign language processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600003"}
