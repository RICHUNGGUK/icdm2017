As data gathering is one of the most important operations in many sensor network applications, this paper studies energy-efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks using vMIMO. We define the joint vMIMO and data gathering (vMDG) problem, which is NP-hard. We also propose a distributed method called D-vMDG as an approximation algorithm. This algorithm first constructs a tree-like topology by taking the unique features of vMIMO into account. Then, an energy-efficient routing protocol based on dynamic programming is proposed for each node on the constructed topology. Our theoretical analysis shows that D-vMDG can achieve an approximation ratio of O(1). Our simulations show that D-vMDG decreases the energy consumption by 81 and 36 percent compared to the well-known MDT [26] and MIMO-LEACH [19] algorithms respectively.", "paper_title": "Joint Virtual MIMO and Data Gathering for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000011"}
