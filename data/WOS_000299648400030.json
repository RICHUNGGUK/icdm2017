However, in some ANC applications, secondary path fluctuation will degrade the performance of noise cancellation. This paper proposes a novel average value algorithm with conventional filtered-X lease mean square (FXLMS) method to solve this problem. A method to tune the learning constant in FXLMS method is also presented to speed up the convergence of ANC system. Several computer simulations show that the proposed ANC method can cancel the noise effectively and still perform well with the fluctuation of secondary path.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR SECONDARY PATH FLUCTUATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400030"}
