We solve a multiple criteria optimization problem in which we consider the desired layout already in the stage of searching for salient points of the labeled areas. In the solution we employ fuzzy logic combined with greedy optimization. The method runs on the GPU and achieves interactive rates on medium sized models. The results indicate that the method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art interactive labeling techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
