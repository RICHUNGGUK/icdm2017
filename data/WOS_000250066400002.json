In this scenario, more and more security critical applications are being deployed over platforms which include mobile devices. It is thus crucial that security services be provided to mobile devices as well. Since security functions are typically based on computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms, achieving this goal turns out to be a hard task due to (1) limited computing power, and (2) constraints imposed by peculiarities of the software platforms. This work presents an architecture which allows the provision of digital Time-Stamping services to mobile devices with limited resources. The architecture is described with respect to a case study system, and experimental results are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a high performance architecture for providing digital time stamping services to mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000250066400002"}
