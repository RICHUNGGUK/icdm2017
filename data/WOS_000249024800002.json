In this paper, we propose a new strategy for behaviour acquisition for domestic robots where the behaviours are acquired using multiple differing learning methods that are subsequently incorporated into a common behaviour selection system, enabling them to be performed in appropriate situations. An example of the implementation of this strategy applied to the entertainment humanoid robot QRIO. is introduced and the results are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
