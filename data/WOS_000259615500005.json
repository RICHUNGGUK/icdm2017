The severity parameter is mild and there is no flow separation induced by the blowing. The shear stress transport and temperature energy budget is discussed in detail. The wall shear and flux decreases immediately downstream the slot in a similar manner but the Reynolds analogy does not hold over the slot. The physical process is governed by the production and pressure redistribution over the slot in a complex manner. The turbulent transport and especially the advection play an essential role in the heat transfer mechanism.", "paper_title": "Turbulent passive scalar transport under localized blowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000259615500005"}
