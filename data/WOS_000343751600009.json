The innovation of our algorithm relies on the fact that during the similarity process, it has the ability to combine many attributes together and fulfill lots of preconditions, which are extensively discussed throughout the paper. Our concept is also supported by an efficient and effective indexing scheme, that provides convincing results comparing to other known methods.", "paper_title": "Going over the three dimensional protein structure similarity problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000343751600009"}
