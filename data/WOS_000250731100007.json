This disease affects slowly the circulatory system including that of the retina. As diabetes progresses, the vision of a patient may start to deteriorate and lead to diabetic retinopathy. In this study on different stages of diabetic retinopathy, 124 retinal photographs were analyzed. As a result, four groups were identified, viz., normal retina, moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Classification of the four eye diseases was achieved using a three-layer feedforward neural network. The features are extracted from the raw images using the image processing techniques and fed to the classifier for classification. We demonstrate a sensitivity of more than 90% for the classifier with the specificity of 100%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
