In this paper we prove that computing the minimum number of cops that are guaranteed to catch a robber on a given graph is NP-hard and that the parameterized version of the problem is W[2]-hard; the proof extends to the case where the robber moves s time faster than the cops. We show that on split graphs, the problem is polynomially solvable if s = 1 but is NP-hard if s = 2. We further prove that on graphs of bounded cliquewidth the problem is polynomially solvable for s <= 2. Finally, we show that for planar graphs the minimum number of cops is unbounded if the robber is faster than the cops. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
