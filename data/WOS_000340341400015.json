To achieve this, functional models relating customer preferences to engineering characteristics need to be developed. As information regarding functional relationships between customer preferences are generally subjective or heuristic in nature, development of the customer preference models involve two uncertainties, namely fuzziness and randomness. Existing approaches use only fuzzy-based technologies to address the uncertainty caused by fuzziness. They are not designed to address the randomness of the observed data which is caused by a limited knowledge of the variability of influences between customer preferences and engineering characteristics. In this article, a fuzzy ordinary regression method is proposed to develop the customer preference models which are capable of addressing the two uncertainties of crispness and fuzziness of the customer preferences. A case study of a tea maker design which involves both uncertainties is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
