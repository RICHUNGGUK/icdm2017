As an example, SVDs are used in processing voluminous data sets. Many sequential and parallel algorithms have been proposed to compute SVDs. The best known sequential algorithms take cubic time. This amount of time may not be acceptable especially when the data size is large. Thus parallel algorithms are desirable. In this paper, we present a novel technique for the parallel computation of SVDs. This technique yields impressive speedups. We discuss implementation of our technique on parallel models of computing such as the mesh and the PRAM. We also present an experimental evaluation of our technique.", "paper_title": "A novel scheme for the parallel computation of SVDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300014"}
