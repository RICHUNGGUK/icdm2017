However, both the number and the heterogeneities of computers found in Grid computing are more complex than in HC. Two additional scenarios are included in this study to enhance the completeness of the experiment and to more closely approach real Grid computing situations. This study simulates experiments in a dynamic environment since the nature of Grid computing is dynamic. Min-min heuristic is the benchmark of such kinds of task and computer scheduling problems. In this study, the Min-minII dynamic scheduling heuristic is proposed that utilizes task deadline and task assignment time to testify that Min-minII can outperform Min-min makespan.", "paper_title": "A DEADLINE-BASED TASK SCHEDULING WITH MINIMIZED MAKESPAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400019"}
