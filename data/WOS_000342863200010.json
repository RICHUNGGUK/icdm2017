To properly analyze and operate elastic optical networks with highly dynamic traffic of the intra-data-center, considering the continuity constraint and the contiguity constraint, efficient methods are required for the on-line routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) issue. In this paper, we propose two methods (AFD and CSL) for assessing the status (spectrum fragmentation) of the network, and present two algorithms (BSPR and HSR) which use the proposed assessment value to perform on-line RSA applied to intra-data-center networks which adopt the Software-Defined Network (SDN) control mode. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approaches allow solving the on-line RSA problem more efficiently with lower blocking probability of the networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
