Both co-operation and competition of antibodies are considered in the dynamics. The classical approach of Lyapunov is employed here for the stability analysis of the dynamics. Computer simulations are undertaken to support the results of the analysis. Both temporal behaviors of the antibodies and their phase portraits are given to study their chaotic, limit cyclic and stable behavior. Results of stability analysis of the dynamics are applied in garbage cleaning problem by a mobile robot.", "paper_title": "Behavioral analysis of cooperative/competitive antibody dynamics in garbage cleaning applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264443700005"}
