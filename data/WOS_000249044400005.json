Cross-correlation performance of PC/OCS is analyzed. Compared with PC/PC, the number of wavelengths for PC/OCS is not limited to a prime number. PC/OCS can be constructed flexibly and also can use available wavelengths effectively. When the number of available wavelengths is larger than a prime number, PC/OCS not only has a larger code cardinality than PC/PC, but it also has a better cross-correlation performance. Theoretical analysis shows that PC/OCS can reduce the bit error rate and enhance system throughput of multiple-wavelength (MW) optical code-division multiple access networks. When the number of available wavelengths is 16 and code length is 121, code cardinality of PC/OCS can increase approximately 17% more than that of PC/PC, and the peaked throughput can increase approximately 20%.
