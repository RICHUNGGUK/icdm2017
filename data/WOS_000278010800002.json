The goal of this assistance system is to help disabled persons moving/evolving within a controlled environment in order to provide logistic support in achieving their ADLs. Empirical results of practical tests are presented and interpreted. Some deductions about the key features that represent originalities of the assistance system are drawn and future works are announced.", "paper_title": "DEEPKOVER - AN ADAPTIVE ARTFUL INTELLIGENT ASSISTANCE SYSTEM FOR COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED PEOPLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000278010800002"}
