The geographical heterogeneity of electricity prices motivates us to study the task placement problem over geo-distributed data centers. We exploit the dynamic frequency scaling technique and formulate an optimization problem that minimizes OPEX while guaranteeing the quality-of-service, i.e., the expected response time of tasks. Furthermore, an optimal solution is discovered for this formulated problem. The experimental results show that our proposal achieves much higher cost-efficiency than the traditional resizing scheme, i.e., by activating/deactivating certain servers in data centers.", "paper_title": "Optimal Task Placement with QoS Constraints in Geo-Distributed Data Centers Using DVFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900019"}
