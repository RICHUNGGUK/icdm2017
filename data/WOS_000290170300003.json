The forceps extraction is an obstetric manipulation learned by experience. However, nowadays the training is mainly provided during real childbirths. This kind of training could lead to dramatic consequences due to the lack of experience of some operators. This paper explains the approach that has been used to simulate the dynamic process of a childbirth on the BirthSIM simulator. We especially focus on one procedure that reproduces a difficult instrumental delivery. The recorded tractive force to extract the fetus corresponds to the literature results that confirm the realism of the simulator. The novice results emphasize the need of a childbirth simulator in order to gain initial experience without any risks.", "paper_title": "Simulation of an Instrumental Childbirth for the Training of the Forceps Extraction: Control Algorithm and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290170300003"}
