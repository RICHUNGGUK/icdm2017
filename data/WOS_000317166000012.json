The stream ciphers used for the comparison are ZUC, Snow3g, Grain V1, Mickey V2, Trivium and E0. ZUC, Snow3g and EO have been used for the security part of well known standards, especially wireless communication protocols. In addition, Grain V1, Mickey V2 and Trivium are currently selected as the final portfolio of stream ciphers for Profile 2 (Hardware) by the eStream project. The designs were implemented by using VHDL language and for the hardware implementations a FPGA device was used. The highest throughput has been achieved by Snow3g with 3330 Mbps at 104 MHz and the lowest throughput has been achieved by E0 with 187 Mbps at 187 MHz. Also, the most efficient cipher for hardware implementation in terms of throughput-to-area ratio is Mickey V2 cipher while the worst cipher for hardware implementation is Grain V1.
