We show various algorithm designs via two distinct approaches based on the algorithmic time level consistency theorem, namely, the discrete total energy conservation method, and the classical and normalized time weighted residual methodologies: and therein draw comparisons among the various time-stepping algorithms and features. A simple numerical simulation is shown to demonstrate the pros/cons for the conserving properties of various algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
