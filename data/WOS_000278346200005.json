In the time spectral model, the physical time derivative is approximated using spectral method. The robustness issues associated with implicit solution of time spectral model are analyzed and validated by numerical results. It is found that spectral approximation of the time derivative weakens the diagonal dominance property of the Jacobian matrix, resulting in the deterioration of stability and convergence speed. In this paper we propose to solve the coupled governing equations implicitly using multigrid preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, which demonstrates favorable convergence speed. Also it is demonstrated that the current method is insensitive to the variations of frequency and number of harmonics. Comparison of computation results with dual time step unsteady computation validates the high efficiency of the current method.
