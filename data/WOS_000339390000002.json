In particular, taking into account empirical evidences coming from cognitive psychology, according to which concept representation is not a unitary phenomenon, we suggest that a similar approach to the representation of conceptual knowledge could be useful also in the field of ontology based technologies. Finally we propose, in a linked open data perspective, conceptual spaces as a suitable framework for developing some aspects of the presented proposal.", "paper_title": "Towards an Extended Model of Conceptual Representations in Formal Ontologies: A Typicality-Based Proposal", "paper_id": "WOS:000339390000002"}
