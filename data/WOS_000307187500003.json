There are diverse forms to implement a fuzzy system depending on the desired response time, for which hardware implementations are best suited for high-speed demands. Fuzzy hardware has been exploited since the mid-1980s, and there have been many interesting architecture cases with different functional and performance characteristics that are reviewed in this paper from a categorical and historical point of view.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Hardware: A Retrospective and Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000307187500003"}
