Considering the high reliability expected in these systems, many techniques have been proposed to mitigate these effects. However, traditional protection techniques against soft errors, like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) or EDAC codes (for example Hamming), normally result in a significant area and power overhead. In this paper we propose a specific technique to protect digital finite impulse response (FIR) filters applying the \"system knowledge\". This means to study and use the singularities in their structure in order to provide effective protection with minimal area and power. The results obtained in the experimental process have been compared with the protection offered by TMR and Hamming codes. in order to prove the quality of the proposed solution.
