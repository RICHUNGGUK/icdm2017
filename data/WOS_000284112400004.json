Using this approach, designers can get access to a large number of 3D art shapes that can be modified interactively. This is based on a modified evolutionary algorithm using Fractal Transform (FT) and Iterated Function System (IFS), which provides tunable geometric parameters. Fitness function for measuring the aesthetics of a fractal shape is formulated based on characteristic parameters in fractal theory, including capacity dimension, correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent. The productivity of visually appealing fractal can be enhanced by using the proposed technique. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can be applied to the design of jewelry, light fixture, and decorative patterns.", "paper_title": "Interactive evolutionary 3D fractal modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000284112400004"}
