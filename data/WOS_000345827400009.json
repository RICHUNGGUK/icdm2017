Many computational tools have been developed to predict proteome-wide subcellular location, and abundant experimental data from green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging or mass spectrometry (MS) are available in the model plant, Arabidopsis. None of these approaches is error-free, and thus, results are often contradictory. Results: To help unify these multiple data sources, we have developed the SUBcellular Arabidopsis consensus (SUBAcon) algorithm, a naive Bayes classifier that integrates 22 computational prediction algorithms, experimental GFP and MS localizations, protein-protein interaction and co-expression data to derive a consensus call and probability. SUBAcon classifies protein location in Arabidopsis more accurately than single predictors.", "paper_title": "SUBAcon: a consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular localization data of the Arabidopsis proteome", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400009"}
