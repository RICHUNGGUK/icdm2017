Yet, researchers create safety proofs and counterexamples by hand and build simulators and prototypes to explore protocol dynamics. Similarly, network operators analyze their router configurations manually or using homegrown tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and implementing routing policies, ranging from high-level guidelines to specific router configurations. Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit performs all of these functions from the same algebraic representation of routing policy. We show that routing algebra has a natural translation to both integer constraints (to perform safety analysis with SMT solvers) and declarative programs (to generate distributed implementations). Our extensive experiments with realistic topologies and policies show how FSR can detect problems in an autonomous system's (AS's) iBGP configuration, prove sufficient conditions for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) safety, and empirically evaluate convergence time.", "paper_title": "FSR: Formal Analysis and Implementation Toolkit for Safe Interdomain Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000313661000011"}
