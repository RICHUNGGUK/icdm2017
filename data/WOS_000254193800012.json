The proposed computer simulations do not require numerical solutions of Newton's equations of motion, nor several additional assumptions normally used in discrete element models. The model is also able to predict some physical aspects which could be tested in new experiments of fragmentation of brittle systems.", "paper_title": "Model inspired by population genetics to study fragmentation of brittle plates", "paper_id": "WOS:000254193800012"}
