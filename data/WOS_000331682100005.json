The performance measure considered is the makespan. The hybrid metaheuristic Evolutionary Cluster Search (ECS_NSL) proposed in Nagano et al. (2012) is extended to solve the scheduling problem. The ECS_NSL performance is evaluated and the results are compared with the best method reported in the literature. Experimental tests show superiority of the ECS_NSL regarding the solution quality.
