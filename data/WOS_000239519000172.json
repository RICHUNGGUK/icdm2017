All Mathematical structures that are necessary to perform a correct transcription into Mathematical Braille are recognised and rewritten in a unique way. Additionally Canonical MathML is valid MathML so it can be used with common tools which handle MathML. The Canonical MathML was successfully used to build several transcribers from MathML to Braille national codes.", "paper_title": "Canonical MathML to simplify conversion of MathML to Braille mathematical notations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000172"}
