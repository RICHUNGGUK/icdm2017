The DVC coding efficiency depends mainly on side information and noise modeling. This paper proposes a motion re-estimation technique based on optical flow to improve side information and noise residual frames by taking partially decoded information into account. To improve noise modeling, a noise residual motion re-estimation technique is proposed. Residual motion compensation with motion updating is used to estimate a current residue based on previously decoded frames and correlation between estimated side information frames. In addition, a generalized reconstruction algorithm to optimize a multihypothesis reconstruction is proposed. The proposed techniques using motion and reconstruction re-estimation (MORE) are integrated in the SING TDWZ codec, which uses side information and noise learning. For Wyner-Ziv frames using GOP size 2, the MORE codec significantly improves the TDWZ coding efficiency with an average (Bjontegaard) PSNR improvement of 2.5 dB and up to 6 dB improvement compared with DISCOVER.", "paper_title": "Re-estimation of Motion and Reconstruction for Distributed Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000337141400004"}
