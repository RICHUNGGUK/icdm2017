In a perfect liquid market the option pricing model becomes the well-known linear Black-Scholes problem. Nonlinear models appear when transaction costs or illiquid market effects are taken into account. This paper deals with the numerical analysis of nonlinear Black-Scholes equations modeling illiquid markets when price impact in the underlying asset market affects the replication of a European contingent claim. Numerical analysis of a nonlinear model is necessary because disregarded computations may waste a good mathematical model. In this paper we propose a finite-difference numerical scheme that guarantees positivity of the solution as well as stability and consistency. (c) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
