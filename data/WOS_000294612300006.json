Besides, the uncertainty of the selection and evaluation process increases the difficulty of ICT project selection. Therefore, a fuzzy system in combination with fuzzy integer linear programming, fuzzy entropy, and fuzzy numbers have been developed; it smoothes the process of ICT project selection. This fuzzy system is flexible in the project selection for Iran ICT sectors, especially in (Research and Development) R&D sectors. It enhances the accuracy of the evaluation process as it resolves the uncertainty of ICT project selection.", "paper_title": "THE FUZZY EVALUATION OF THE ICT PROJECTS IN STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT (CASE STUDY: IRAN TELECOMMUNICATION RESEARCH CENTER)", "paper_id": "WOS:000294612300006"}
