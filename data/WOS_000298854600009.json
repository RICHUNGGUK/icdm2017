In this article, we will prove that splitting authentication codes that are multi-fold perfect against spoofing can be characterized in terms of restricted strong partially balanced t-designs. We will also investigate the existence of restricted strong partially balanced 3-designs RSPBD 3-(v, b, 3 x 2; lambda(1), lambda(2), 1, 0)s, and show that there exists an RSPBD 3-(v, b, 3 x 2; lambda(1), lambda(2), 1, 0) for any v = 9 (mod 16). As its application, we obtain a new infinite class of 3-fold perfect splitting authentication codes.", "paper_title": "A new class of 3-fold perfect splitting authentication codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000298854600009"}
