Furthermore, for a given stationary fuzzy metric space with a t-norm without zero divisors, we propose a method for constructing a generalized Hausdorff fuzzy metric on the set of the nonempty bounded closed subsets. Finally we discuss several important properties as completeness, completion and precompactness.", "paper_title": "ON THE HYPERSPACE OF BOUNDED CLOSED SETS UNDER A GENERALIZED HAUSDORFF STATIONARY FUZZY METRIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558300009"}
