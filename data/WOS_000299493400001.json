DSC is needed to convert the polar format data to Cartesian coordinate to make them compatible for the display device. To reduce Moire artifact a new interpolation algorithm is proposed which is a combination of warped distance based adaptive bilinear interpolation method and modified selective sampling technique. This new algorithm is implemented on TMS320C64x + DSP and is capable of processing 640 x 480 size images at the rate of 83 frames per second. Moreover, to reduce speckle noise a modified aggressive region growing filter is implemented on Xilinx XC2VP30 FPGA. It operates at 128.29 MHz frequency, which is equivalent to processing 417 frames per second. With such high frame rate, motion blind detection of the objects may be possible using USG.
