A well-routed message path in such systems may result in a long delay and excessive traffic due to the mismatch between logical and physical networks. In order to solve this problem, we present a family of Peer-exchange Routing Optimization Protocols (PROP) to reconstruct the overlay. It includes two policies: PROP-G for generic condition and PROP-O for optimized one. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that these two protocols greatly reduce the average latency of the overlay and achieve a better logical topology with low overhead. Their overall performance can be further improved if combined with other recent approaches. Specifically, PROP-G can be easily applied to both structured and unstructured systems without the loss of their primary characteristics, such as efficient routing and anonymity. PROP-O, on the other hand, is more efficient, especially in a heterogenous environment where nodes have different processing capabilities.", "paper_title": "Peer-exchange schemes to handle mismatch in peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263686800002"}
