It plays an important underlying role in many extensions, e.g., regularized LSR, weighted LSR, and lasso. Since LSR is a discriminative model, it allows only sampling of the target variables conditioned on observations. In this paper, we present the latent LSR (LLSR), a generative model, which enables LSR to exploit the structural information hidden in the explanatory variables by imposing a sparsity-encouraging prior over the precision matrix of the latent variable. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is applied to obtain a point estimate of the model parameters. Both the toy example and real data tests suggest the effectiveness of LLSR. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
