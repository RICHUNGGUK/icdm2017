We also show a Theta(n(2)) bound on the maximal number of primitively-rooted powers with fractional exponent e, 1 < e < 2, occurring in a string of length n. This result holds obviously for their maximal number of occurrences. The first result contrasts with the linear number of occurrences of maximal repetitions of exponent at least 2.", "paper_title": "NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OF POWERS IN STRINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280773400005"}
