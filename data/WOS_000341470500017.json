This strategy is inspired by the lack of analytical tuning guideline of weighting matrices for state space model based controller design. The strategy consists of two steps. First, a PID controller is designed using a non-minimal state space model through predictive functional control optimization. Then the weighting matrices in the controller design are optimized through GA to achieve the desired closed-loop control performance. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the chamber pressure of an industrial coke furnace and compared with the recent extended non-minimal state space predictive functional control (ENMSSPFC) based PID controller, where results demonstrate that the proposed PID shows better performance than ENMSSPFC based PID control.
