This goal is accomplished by resorting to methods of local influence. The techniques provide to the practitioner a valuable tool that enables to identify potential influential elements and to quantify the effects of perturbations in these elements on results of interest. An illustrative example with a real data set is also reported. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
