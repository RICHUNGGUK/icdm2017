MS-CFB combines the benefits of global-based and local-based feature extraction algorithms, where multiple correlation filters corresponding to different face subregions are jointly designed to optimize the overall correlation outputs. Furthermore, we reduce the computational complexity of MS-CFB by designing the correlation filter bank in the spatial domain and improve its generalization capability by capitalizing on the unconstrained form during the filter bank design process. MS-CFB not only takes the differences among face subregions into account, but also effectively exploits the discriminative information in face subregions. Experimental results on various public face databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a better feature representation for classification and achieves higher recognition rates compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.
