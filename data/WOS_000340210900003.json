Findings show the close relationship between poetry reading and poetry writing and the tight interweaving of poetry throughout the working and personal lives of respondents. Reading and finding out about poetry are also highly social in nature with a clear reliance on the poetry community rather than the public library. Our findings have implications for the roles of reading institutions such as bookstores, libraries, and publishers, as well as for collection development and readers' advisory services to specialized reading communities.", "paper_title": "Pure Delight and Professional Development: The Reading Practices and Library Use of an Active Poetry Community", "paper_id": "WOS:000340210900003"}
