Thus, a designer is able to guarantee that a component will fit into a target system. This paper presents the mapping process of SysML State Machine diagram into a Time Petri Net with energy constraints in order to analyze timing and energy consumption requirements in early phases of the real-time embedded component development life-cycle. The estimates obtained from the model show that the proposed approach is indeed a good approximation to the respective measures obtained from the real hardware platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
