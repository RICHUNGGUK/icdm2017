Significant benefits of this approach include software reuse, simpler and faster construction, enhanced reliability, and dramatic reductions in the complexity of construction of provably correct critical systems, many of which involve real-time concerns. Effective, flexible component composition by itself still poses a challenge today and yet the special nature of real-time constraints makes component-based construction of real-time systems even more demanding. The coordination language Reo supports compositional system construction through connectors that exogenously coordinate the interactions among the constituent components which unawarely comprise a complex system, into a coherent collaboration. The simple, yet surprisingly rich, calculus of channel composition that underlies Reo offers a flexible framework for compositional construction of coordinating component connectors with real-time properties. In this paper, we present an operational semantics for the channel-based component connectors of Reo in terms of Timed Constraint Automata and introduce a temporal-logic for specification and verification of their real-time properties.", "paper_title": "Models and temporal logical specifications for timed component connectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000254667600005"}
