The quality of the teleportation measured by the average fidelity and minimal fidelity can be enhanced in the non-Markovian channel. The memory effects give rise to the revival of the fidelity which is better than that obtained by the Markovian channel.", "paper_title": "ENHANCED QUANTUM TELEPORTATION IN NON-MARKOVIAN ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000308558200003"}
