In this paper, we present a heuristic method to determine whether a webpage is a legitimate or a phishing page. This scheme could detect new phishing pages which black list based anti-phishing tools could not. We first convert a web page into 12 features which are well selected based on the existing normal and fishing pages. A training set of web pages including normal and fishing pages are then input for a support vector machine to do training. A testing set is finally fed into the trained model to do the testing. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that the proposed phishing detector can achieve the high accuracy rate with relatively low false positive and low false negative rates.
