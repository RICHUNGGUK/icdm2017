In this note, we focus on the reciprocity in the aggregation of fuzzy preference relations (that is, the additive reciprocity is not assumed) using the OWA operator. By defining a reciprocity index for measuring the non-reciprocity degree of fuzzy preference relations, we show that a sufficient (but not necessary) condition under which a \"collective\" fuzzy preference relation, obtained by aggregating a set of \"individual\" fuzzy preference relations using an OWA operator guided by a linguistic quantifier with parameter a and h, has a reciprocity index no greater than the largest of the corresponding \"individual\" reciprocity indexes. Our result is helpful to complete Chiclana et al.'s decision model [F. Chiclana, F. Herrera, E.
