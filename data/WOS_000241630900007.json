Traceable signatures, introduced by Kiayias, Tsiounis and Yung (KTY), support an extended set of fairness mechanisms (mechanisms for anonymity management and revocation) when compared with the traditional group signatures. Designing short signatures based on the power of pairing has been a current activity of cryptographic research, and is especially needed for long constructions like that of traceable signatures. The size of a signature in our scheme is less than one third of the size in the KTY scheme and about 40% of the size of the pairing based traceable signature (which has been the shortest till today). The security of our scheme is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We prove the security of our system in random oracle model using the security model given by KTY.", "paper_title": "Short traceable signatures based on bilinear pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900007"}
