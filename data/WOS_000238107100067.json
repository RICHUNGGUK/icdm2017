The metric is coupled with the curvature of the solution surface and it governs the process of mesh generation. The metric values are determined from the discrete data from the current simulation step and are stored in the background mesh with the appropriate interpolation procedure. If the solution is given in the form of a vector field, each component is treated separately and can define different metric. In order to combine these metrics, an intersection procedure is used. Several examples of numerical mesh adaptation are provided to illustrate the potential of the described method.", "paper_title": "Mesh adaptation based on discrete data", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100067"}
