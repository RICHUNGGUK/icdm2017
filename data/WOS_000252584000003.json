Each kind of compound was represented by several calculated structural descriptors involving constitutional, topological, geometrical, electrostatic and quantum-chemical features of the compound. The GEP method produced a nonlinear quantitative model of the five-descriptor with a correlation coefficient and a mean error of 0.91 and 0.41 for the training set, 0.63 and 0.67 for the test set, respectively. It is shown that the GEP predicted results are in good agreement with experimental ones, better than those of the support vector machine. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
