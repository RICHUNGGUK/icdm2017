The physics of diffusion are reviewed and it is described how they are translated into the appropriate model algorithm. Further, the algorithm for recognising solid grain boundaries during the migration step is discussed. The model grid is derived from the analysis of images obtained by optical micro-photography and from autoradiography of hardrock samples impregnated with (14)C-marked resins. Sample calculations for tracer-trans port cases and simple reaction, i.e. precipitation cases are presented. It is envisaged to couple the code with a geochemical speciation code at a later stage.
