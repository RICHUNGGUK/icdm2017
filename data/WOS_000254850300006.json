Existing software quality evaluation models examine multiple characteristics and are characterized by factorial fuzziness. The relevant criteria of this model are derived from the international norm ISO. The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach for addressing uncertainty and imprecision in service evaluation during pre-negotiation stages, where comparative judgments of decision makers are represented as fuzzy triangular numbers. A new fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is proposed. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)-based decision-making method can provide decision makers or buyers with a valuable guideline for evaluating software quality. Importantly, the proposed model can aids users and developers in assessing software quality, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes.", "paper_title": "Integrating fuzzy theory and hierarchy concepts to evaluate software quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000254850300006"}
