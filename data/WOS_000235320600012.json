The model is based on polygonal uncertainty regions, transformation polytopes and their consensus sets. The most important result of this paper is that the RANSAC algorithm can be placed in a broader framework of search algorithms that took for good parameter uncertainty polytopes. To guide the search, each polytope has a consensus set whose size is a measure for its quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
