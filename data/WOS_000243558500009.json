A row selection LFSR randomly selects outputs of multiple scan chains so that unknowns can be tolerated. Column and row parities of selected outputs are observed to solve linear equations for the error positions. Experimental data show that CPRS achieves nearly perfect diagnosis, even in the presence of 1 percent unknowns. CPRS compresses the diagnosis data because only parities of circuit responses, instead of responses themselves, are observed. Two error distribution models ( scattered and clustered) are developed and analyzed to show the effectiveness of CPRS. The analytical results are demonstrated to be accurate by more than 10,000 experiments.", "paper_title": "Column Parity Row Selection (CPRS) BIST diagnosis technique: Modeling and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000243558500009"}
