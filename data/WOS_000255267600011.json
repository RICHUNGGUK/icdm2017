First, \"novelty\" is redefined based oil the proposed information patterns, and several different types of information patterns are given corresponding to different types of users' information needs. Second, a thorough analysis of sentence level information patterns is elaborated using data from the TREC novelty tracks, including sentence lengths, named entities (NEs), and sentence level opinion patterns. Finally, a Unified information-pattern-based approach to novelty detection (ip-BAND) is presented for both specific NE topics and more general topics. Experiments oil novelty detection oil data from the TREC 2002, 2003 and 2004 novelty tracks show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of novelty detection in terms of precision at top ranks. Future research directions are suggested. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "An information-pattern-based approach to novelty detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000255267600011"}
