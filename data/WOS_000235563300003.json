The Solution is sought on a smooth submanifold M subset of Q of dimension 0 <= d(1) <= d, the right-hand side is supposed to be in C-r(Q), the error is measured in the L-infinity(M) norm. We show that the nth minimal error is (Lip to logarithmic factors) of order n(-min((r+2m)/d1. r/d+1/2)). For comparison, in the deterministic setting the nth minimal error is of order n(-r/d), for all d(1.) (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
