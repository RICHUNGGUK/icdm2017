We provide an -approximation algorithm for this multi-guarding problem in simply-connected polygonal regions, with a minimum number () of vertex guards (possibly co-located). Our approximation algorithm is based on a polynomial-time algorithm for building what we call -multinets of size for the instances of Multi-HittingSet associated with our multi-guarding problem. We then apply a now-standard linear-programming technique to build an approximation algorithm from this -multinet finder. This paper corrects, and simplifies the analysis of, the -time -net-finder described in [26], that was used to build an -approximation algorithm for the standard guarding problem in which all points within the gallery are required to be visible to at least one guard.", "paper_title": "An O(lg lg OPT)-Approximation Algorithm for Multi-guarding Galleries", "paper_id": "WOS:000350354400005"}
