Fuzzy modeling and control are introduced into the multiple-model adaptive control in this paper, which facilitates the intelligent behavior of a plant facing with uncertainty. Within the combination of fuzzy sets of state variables, the corresponding combined kernel functions of support vector machine are utilized to describe the unknown nonlinear dynamics. The coefficients of kernel functions are learned online through adaptive laws. The multiple identification models and indirect adaptive controllers are assigned to the plant through fuzzy inferences. The stability of adaptive law corresponding to the fuzzy identification model and the synthetic control input through fuzzy fusion has been proved for the proposed fuzzy multiple-model adaptive control (FMMAC). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FMMAC can achieve favorable control performance for a class of nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy indirect adaptive control using SVM-based multiple models for a class of nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300038"}
