As a generalization, we introduce the problem of packing injections from an m-set, m <= n, sometimes called m-arrangements, relative to Hamming distance. We offer some preliminary coding-theoretic bounds, a few design-theoretic connections, and a short discussion on possible applications.", "paper_title": "Coding with injections", "paper_id": "WOS:000313055300006"}
