By grouping similar patches in the spatiotemporal domain, we formulate the video restoration problem as a joint sparse and low-rank matrix approximation problem. The resulting nuclear norm and l(1) norm related minimization problem can also be efficiently solved by many recently developed numerical methods. The effectiveness of the proposed video restoration scheme is illustrated on two applications: video denoising in the presence of random-valued noise, and video in-painting for archived films. The numerical experiments indicate that the proposed video restoration method compares favorably against many existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Robust Video Restoration by Joint Sparse and Low Rank Matrix Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298370600006"}
