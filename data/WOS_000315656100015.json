It is assumed that each agent can only obtain the information of its positions relative to its neighbours at sampling instants. First, a discrete-time protocol is provided based on velocity estimation, and a sufficient and necessary condition for consensus under this protocol is established in virtue of properties of periodic systems. Second, a continuous-time protocol is presented by the theory of dynamic output feedback control, and a sufficient condition for consensus under this protocol is obtained by applying an input delay approach. Simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous consensus of multiple second-order agents with partial state information", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100015"}
