The configuration of most current tools for controlling agents is, however, implementation specific and not tailored to the needs of authors. Based on literature review, a questionnaire evaluation of authors' preferences for character creation, and a case study of an author's conceptualization of this process, we investigate the different methods of configuration available in current agent architectures, reviewing discrepancies and matches. Given these relations, promising approaches to configuration are identified, based on initial inner states, \"global\" parameters of characters, libraries of stock characters, and selections of backstory experiences.", "paper_title": "AUTHORING VS.
