Some immune mechanisms, selection, receptor editing and vaccination are introduced into the basic PSO to improve its performance. The objective function for damage detection is based on vibration data, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. The feasibility and efficiency of IEPSO are compared with the basic PSO, a differential evolution algorithm and a real-coded genetic algorithm on two examples. Results show that the proposed strategy is efficient on determining the sites and the extents of structure damages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
