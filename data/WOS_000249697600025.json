While curve-fitting techniques can be useful for determining the retention times and relative concentrations of the components of a chromatographic peak, their utility is limited by the lack of unambiguous criteria for determining the number of such components. In this work, we present a computational technique for analyzing chromatograms to estimate the number of components, their retention times, and their relative concentrations. In contrast to Fourier-transform-based techniques, the technique we present does not require manual peak identification. It is based on curve-fitting and uses the Akaike information criterion to estimate the number of components. Application of the technique to chromatograms obtained from size-exclusion and reverse-phase chromatography of test mixtures indicates that it is useful for the characterization of complex mixtures.", "paper_title": "An information-based computational technique for estimation of chromatographic peak purity", "paper_id": "WOS:000249697600025"}
