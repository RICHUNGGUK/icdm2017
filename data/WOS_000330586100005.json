Using a single-period optimization setting, we use various combinations of expected return, variance, liquidity and Conditional Value at Risk criteria. With stocks from Borsa Istanbul, we make computational studies to show the effects of these criteria on objective and decision spaces. We also consider cardinality and weight constraints and study their effects on the results. In general, we observe that considering alternative criteria results in enlarged regions in the effi-cient frontier that may be of interest to the decision maker. We discuss the results of our experiments and provide insights.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE CRITERIA ON PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000330586100005"}
