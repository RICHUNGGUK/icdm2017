By modeling the TV channel with the truncated discrete basis expansion model, a two-step approach is adopted to estimate the TV channel. In addition, the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimation is analyzed, and its closed-form expression is derived, which is a function of the data-to-ST power ratio. Using the developed channel MSE, we case the problem of ST power-allocation by minimizing the lower bound on the average channel capacity. To enhance the performance of channel estimation, a low-complexity decision feedback mechanism is introduced to iteratively mitigate the unknown data interference. Numerical results verify the performances of the proposed approach.
