The COM component particularly addresses the integration of various instrument control mechanisms and the concurrency issue, while the Web application addresses database, security, modularity, and graphic user interface (GUI) issues. Moreover, based on the proposed software architecture and design considerations, a Web-based environmental testing system, called the Web-based Automatic Measurement System (Web AMS), is developed to validate the efficiency of this architecture and address the above issues. The proposed synchronization mechanism, not only enables many experiments to share one Digital Multi-Meter (DMM) simultaneously, but also allows many remote clients to monitor the status of operating devices in a progressing experiment concurrently.
