We implemented this approach as the Graph-based Runtime Adaptation Framework (GRAF), which is particularly tailored to facilitate and simplify the process of evolving and adapting current software towards runtime adaptivity. As a proof of concept, we present case study results that show how to achieve runtime adaptivity with GRAF and sketch the framework's capabilities for facilitating the evolution of real-world applications towards self-adaptive software. The case studies also provide some details of the GRAF implementation and examine the usability and performance of the approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
