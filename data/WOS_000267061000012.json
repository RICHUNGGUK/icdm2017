Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptive controller for the synchronization of two different chaotic systems is designed. This technique is applied to achieve the synchronization between Lorenz and Rossler chaotic systems, and the synchronization of hyperchaotic Rossler and Chen systems. The numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "THE HYBRID FUNCTION PROJECTIVE SYNCHRONIZATION OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267061000012"}
