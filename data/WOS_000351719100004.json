In this paper, we combine them together in a single system and then present a time switching-based network coding relaying (TSNCR) protocol for the two-way relay system, where an energy constrained relay harvests energy from the transmitted radio frequency (RF) signals from two sources, and then helps the two-way relay information exchange between the two sources with the consumption of the harvested energy. To evaluate the system performance, we derive an explicit expression of the outage probability for the proposed TSNCR protocol. In order to explore the system performance limit, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the system outage probability. Since the problem is non-convex and cannot be directly solved, we design a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization algorithm for it. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and show that in such an EH two-way relay system, if NC is applied, the system outage probability can be greatly decreased. Moreover, it is shown that the relay position greatly affects the system performance of TSNCR, where relatively worse outage performance is achieved when the relay is placed in the middle of the two sources. This is the first time to observe such a phenomena in EH two-way relay systems.", "paper_title": "Outage Analysis and Optimization for Time Switching-based Two-Way Relaying with Energy Harvesting Relay Node", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719100004"}
