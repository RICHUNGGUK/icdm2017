While the components commonly apply to CPR for all ages from infant to adult, there are several different suggestions for infant CPR such as two-thumb CPR and two-finger CPR. However, the comprehensive evaluation based on all these components has been difficult in the absence of proper evaluation tool. Here, we developed a new manikin-integrated, digital measuring system that objectively estimates overall performance of infant CPR by evaluating individual CPR components one by one including different hand placements. The system collects and analyzes data to present estimations in digital scores according to a new evaluation index constructed based on the previously verified one. The feasibility of the system was validated through simulations with beginners and experts in first aid, resulting in statistically significant differences between the two groups with the indication of specific weaknesses for each group which may provide a basis for creating customized CPR training strategy in compliance with the personal level. We believe that the system would become a valuable assessment tool not only for infant CPR but also for the CPR technique, in general, by reflecting every component in the evaluation.", "paper_title": "Manikin-Integrated Digital Measuring System for Assessment of Infant Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000341986600017"}
