This paper presents the development of a software tool (SustainPro) and its application to chemical processes operating in batch or continuous modes. The software tool is based on the implementation of an extended systematic methodology for sustainable process design (Carvalho, Matos, & Gani, 2008, 2009). Using process information/data such as the process flowsheet, the associated mass/energy balance data and the cost data, SustainPro guides the user through the necessary steps according to work-flow of the implemented methodology. At the end the design alternatives, are evaluated using environmental impact assessment tools and safety indices. The extended features of the methodology incorporate life cycle assessment analysis and economic analysis. The application and the main features of SustainPro are illustrated through a case study of beta-galactosidase production. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
