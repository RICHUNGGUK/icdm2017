In this paper, based on the new definition of the Adomian polynomials, Rach (2008) 1221, the Adomian decomposition method and the Pade approximants technique, a new algorithm is proposed to construct analytic approximate solutions for nonlinear fractional differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. Furthermore, a MAPLE software package is developed to implement this new algorithm, which is user-friendly and efficient. One only needs to input the system equation, initial or boundary conditions and several necessary parameters, then our package will automatically deliver the analytic approximate solutions within a few seconds. Several different types of examples are given to illustrate the scope and demonstrate the validity of our package, especially for non-smooth initial value problems. Our package provides a helpful and easy-to-use tool in science and engineering simulations.

Computer: PCs. Operating system: Windows XP/7. RAM: 2 Gbytes Classification: 4.3. Nature of problem: Constructing analytic approximate solutions of nonlinear fractional differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. Non-smooth initial value problems can be solved by this program. Solution method: Based on the new definition of the Adomian polynomials [1], the Adomian decomposition method and the Pade approximants technique, a new algorithm is proposed to construct analytic approximate solutions for nonlinear fractional differential equations. Restrictions: The problem PI with some Robin boundary conditions can not be solved by this program. Running time: Seconds at most in routine uses of the program. Special tasks may take up to some minutes. References: [1] Rach, R., Kybernetes 37 (2008) 910. 121 Hon, YC., Southeast Asian Bulletin of Mathematics 3 (1996) 55. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
