Multiple RNA interactions are also believed to be much more complex than pairwise interactions. Recently, multiple RNA interaction prediction has been formulated as a maximization problem. Here we extensively examine this optimization problem under several biologically meaningful interaction models. We present a polynomial time algorithm for the problem when the order of interacting RNAs is known and pseudoknot interactions are allowed; for the general problem without an assumed RNA order, we prove the NP-hardness for both variants (allowing and disallowing pseudoknot interactions), and present a constant ratio approximation algorithm for each of them.
