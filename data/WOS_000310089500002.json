Ligand Efficiency Indices (LEI) are making a great impact on early-stage compound selection and prioritization. Given a target-ligand database with chemical structures and associated biological affinities/activities for a target, the AtlasCBS server generates two-dimensional, dynamical representations of its contents in terms of LEI. These variables allow an effective decoupling of the chemical (angular) and biological (radial) components. BindingDB, PDBBind and ChEMBL databases are currently implemented. Proprietary datasets can also be uploaded and compared. The utility of this atlas-like representation in the future of drug design is highlighted with some examples. The web server can be accessed at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/atlascbs and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/atlaschs.", "paper_title": "AtlasCBS: a web server to map and explore chemico-biological space", "paper_id": "WOS:000310089500002"}
