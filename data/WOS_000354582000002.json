The logic is interpreted over the models for the context restricted reaction systems that generalise standard reaction systems by controlling context sequences. Moreover, a translation from the context restricted reaction systems into boolean functions is defined in order to be used for a symbolic model checking for rsCTL over these systems. The model checking for rsCTL is proved to be pspacs-complete. The proposed approach to model checking was implemented and experimentally evaluated using four benchmarks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
