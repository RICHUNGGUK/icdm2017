As the technology for intelligent optical networks grows, optical groupcast applications (such as grid computing, distributed interactive simulations, multimedia-rich interactive services, virtual private network services, personal customized content authoring services, and Ethernet LAN services) will become widely popular. In this paper we introduce the concept of groupcast routing and wavelength assignment (GC-RWA) and evaluate the performance of GC-RWA for light-forests corresponding to the groupcast sessions, when these light-forests are composed of lightpaths and light-trees.", "paper_title": "Lightpath- and Light-Tree-Based Groupcast Routing and Wavelength Assignment in Mesh Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270407600007"}
