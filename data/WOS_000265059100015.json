This algorithm makes explicit use of the fact that some scattering profiles of engineering interest (e.g., traveling ocean waves) come in branches parameterized analytically by a bifurcation quantity. Our approach delivers recursions which not only can be implemented to yield a rapid, robust and high-order numerical scheme, but also give a new proof of analyticity of scattering quantities with respect to the bifurcation parameter of the surface family. The real advantage of this new approach is that it computes, in one step, the scattered field for all possible members of the family of surfaces. By contrast, other state-of-the-art schemes must restart when the returns from a new surface are desired, so that the cost of our new approach is greatly advantaged when the number of samples of the family reaches even modest values. Numerical results which verify the accuracy of our approach and demonstrate their utility in computing grating efficiencies scattered by traveling surface ocean waves are presented.
