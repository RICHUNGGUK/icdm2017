Because fragments are fast and promiscuous, it is common to have contradictory hit results between different experimental screening techniques. Here, we simultaneously determine fragment binding poses, affinities, and kinetics on a focused library of 42 fragments against the serine protease factor Xa using multimillisecond molecular dynamics simulations. We predict experimental poses of 12 over 15 Si crystal structures, and affinities are recovered for 4 out of 6. A kinetic map of protein cavities is computed in terms of on- and off-rates as well as insights into secondary ligand poses. The results suggest that the approach can be useful to recapitulate discordant fragment screening data.", "paper_title": "Insights from Fragment Hit Binding Assays by Molecular Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000363914200012"}
