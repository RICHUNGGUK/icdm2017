Alternative co-variation schemes are, however, possible. In this paper we investigate the properties of the standard proportional co-variation and introduce two alternative schemes: uniform and order-preserving co-variation. We theoretically investigate the effects of using alternative co-variation schemes on the so-called sensitivity function, and conclude that its general form remains the same under any linear co-variation scheme. In addition, we generalise the CD-distance for bounding global belief change to explicitly include the co-variation scheme under consideration. We prove a tight lower bound on this distance for parameter changes in single conditional probability tables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
