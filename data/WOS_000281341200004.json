Most of them try to optimize the performance of predictive window queries. However, not much attention is paid to two other important query types: the predictive range query and the predictive k nearest neighbor query. In this article, we focus on these two types of queries. The novelty of our work mainly lies in the introduction of the Transformed Minkowski Sum, which can be used to determine whether a moving bounding rectangle intersects a moving circular query region. This enables us to use the traditional tree traversal algorithms to perform range and kNN searches. We theoretically show that our algorithms based on the Transformed Minkowski Sum are optimal in terms of the number of tree node accesses. We also experimentally verify the effectiveness of our technique and show that our algorithms outperform alternative approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
