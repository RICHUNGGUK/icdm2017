To understand the synchronization phenomenon, the two oscillators were considered in their phase spaces, and a ring-dynamics approach was applied. As synchronization occurs, pedestrian motion becomes in phase quadrature with a quarter-of-period in advance of the bridge motion: this ensures stability of walking conditions on a moving deck, but causes random cancellation of forces typical of an incoherent crowd. Correspondingly, the lateral force transmitted to the structure increases its value, approaching resonance conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
