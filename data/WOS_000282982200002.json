Prior works assume trusted infrastructure, require an individual to trust unknown entities, or provide relatively low probabilistic guarantees of authenticity (95 percent for realistic settings). This work presents SPATE, a primitive that allows users to establish trust via mobile devices and physical interaction. Once the SPATE protocol runs to completion, its participants' mobile devices have authentic data that their applications can use to interact securely (i.e., the probability of a successful attack is 2(-24)). For this work, we leverage SPATE as part of a larger system to facilitate efficient, secure, and user-friendly collaboration via e-mail, file-sharing, and text messaging services. Our implementation of SPATE on Nokia N70 smartphones allows users to establish trust in small groups of up to eight users in less than one minute. The example SPATE applications provide increased security with little overhead noticeable to users once keys are established.", "paper_title": "SPATE: Small-Group PKI-Less Authenticated Trust Establishment", "paper_id": "WOS:000282982200002"}
