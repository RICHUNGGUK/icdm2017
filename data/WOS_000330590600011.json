The ultimate goal of this research is to create a digital clone for each individual and to provide active desirable services. We present a part of our research work focusing on examining the basic system architecture and the birth process of Cyber-I from a security perspective. In this study, a customized honeypot is used to record multidimensional data Cyber-I is constructed for a corresponding invader. Further, assembling a Cyber-I with associated CI-Applications enables aninvader having more behaviors in the honeypot and provides a possible chance to prolong activities of the invader, which complements a loop mechanism to feed Cyber-I for its growth. The preliminary result in this paper reveals that appropriate authorization and controls are extremely necessary to prevent Cyber-I from being maliciously used and to ensure privacy of its real individual in building an open Cyber-I platform.", "paper_title": "A malicious behavior analysis based Cyber-I birth", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590600011"}
