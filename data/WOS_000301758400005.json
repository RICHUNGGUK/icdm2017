However, the high dimensionality and intrinsically low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of fMRI data poses great challenges to such techniques. The problem is aggravated in the case of multiple subject experiments because of the high inter-subject variability in brain function. To address these difficulties, the majority of current approaches uses a single classifier. Since, in many cases, different stimuli activate different brain areas, it makes sense to use a set of classifiers each specialized in a different stimulus. Therefore, we propose in this paper using an ensemble of classifiers for decoding fMRI data. Each classifier in the ensemble has a favorite class or stimulus and uses an optimized feature set for that particular stimulus. The output for each individual stimulus is therefore obtained from the corresponding classifier and the final classification is achieved by simply selecting the best score. The method was applied to three empirical fMRI datasets from multiple subjects performing visual tasks with four classes of stimuli. Ensembles of GNB and k-NN base classifiers were tested. The ensemble of classifiers systematically outperformed a single classifier for the two most challenging datasets. In the remaining dataset, a ceiling effect was observed which probably precluded a clear distinction between the two classification approaches. Our results may be explained by the fact that different visual stimuli elicit specific patterns of brain activation and indicate that an ensemble of classifiers provides an advantageous alternative to commonly used single classifiers, particularly when decoding stimuli associated with specific brain areas.
