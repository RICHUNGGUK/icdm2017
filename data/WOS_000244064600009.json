Cooperation formation has been a very active area of research in multi-agent systems. An efficient algorithm is needed for this topic since the numbers of the possible coalitions are exponential in the number of agents. Genetic algorithm ( GA) has been widely reckoned as a useful tool for obtaining high quality and optimal solutions for a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems due to its intelligent advantages of self-organization, self- adaptation and inherent parallelism. This paper proposes a GA- based algorithm for coalition structure formation which aims at achieving goals of high performance, scalability, and fast convergence rate simultaneously. A novel 2D binary chromosome encoding approach and corresponding crossover and mutation operators are presented in this paper. Two valid parental chromosomes are certain to produce a valid offspring under the operation of the crossover operator. This improves the efficiency and shortens the running time greatly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through a robust comparison with heuristic search algorithms. We have confirmed that our new algorithm is robust, self- adaptive and very efficient by experiments. The results of the proposed algorithm are found to be satisfactory. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
