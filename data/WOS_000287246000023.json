ESS++ works well both when the number of observations is larger than the number of predictors and in the 'large p, small n' case. In the current version, ESS++ can handle several hundred observations, thousands of predictors and a few responses simultaneously. The core engine of ESS++ for the selection of relevant predictors is based on Evolutionary Monte Carlo. Our implementation is open source, allowing community-based alterations and improvements.", "paper_title": "ESS++: a C++ objected-oriented algorithm for Bayesian stochastic search model exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000287246000023"}
