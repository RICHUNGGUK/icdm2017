However, at smaller length-scales, the influence of geometrical imperfections and defects can significantly affect the accuracy of the model predictions. This work details the modeling techniques required to achieve an accurate prediction of the mechanical behavior of metal micro-textured thermal interface material (MMT-TIM) structures as they undergo compressive deformation. Of particular significance is the development of a novel and practical technique for accurately creating detailed micro-scale geometries for finite element modeling applications. This technique relies on an SEM stereoscopic surface reconstruction methodology and is extended here to create solid geometries amenable to direct simulation by finite element software tools. By accurately characterizing the geometry over the relevant length-scales, an improved prediction of the mechanical response of these structures is attained compared to models employing idealized geometries. Accurate mechanical models enable the subsequent heat transfer modeling of these materials to be achieved with a corresponding high degree of accuracy. The value of the geometry reconstruction technique for other applications is also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
