In the joint optimization, the problem at hand is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem by using linear-algebraic techniques. The unconstrained problem obtained is then solved by applying an efficient quasi-Newton algorithm. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the utility of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Separate/joint optimization of error feedback and realization for roundoff noise minimization in a class of 2-D state-space digital filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000250920700008"}
