The proposed system is based on an efficient stereo correspondence technique, which consists of (i) coarse-to-fine correspondence search, and (ii) outlier detection and correction, both employing phase-based image matching. The proposed sub-pixel correspondence search technique contributes to dense reconstruction of arbitrary-shaped 3D surfaces with high accuracy. The outlier detection and correction technique contributes to high reliability of reconstructed 3D points. Through a set of experiments, we show that the proposed system measures 3D surfaces of objects with sub-mm accuracy. Also, we demonstrate high-quality dense 3D reconstruction of a human face as a typical example of free form objects. The result suggests a potential possibility of our approach to be used in many computer vision applications.", "paper_title": "A high-accuracy passive 3D measurement system using phase-based image matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000007"}
