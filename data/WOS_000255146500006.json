The pile-soil system is divided into thin layers, and the Laplace transform is used to solve the governing equations of the soil layer and the pile segment. The matrix equations to describe the stiffness of the pile are deduced from the loading condition at the pile head and the compatibility between the pile and the soil. The displacement of the pile in the time domain is calculated by using the numerical inverse transformation. The pile's slenderness ratio and its transverse isotropy are calculated numerically.
