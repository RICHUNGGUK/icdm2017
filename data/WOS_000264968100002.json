Design/methodology/approach In trying to maintain the highest level of generality, the finite clement method is employed for representing the microstructure: at this fine scale and computing the solution. The main focus of this work is the implementation procedure which crucially relies on a novel software product developed by the first author in terms of component template library (CTL). Findings The paper confirms that trills that one can produce very powerful Computational tools by software coupling technology described herein, which allow; the class of complex problems one can successfully tackle nowadays to be extended significantly. Originality/value This paper elaborates upon a nets multi-scale solution strategy suitable for highly non-linear inelastic problems.", "paper_title": "Multi-scale modelling of heterogeneous structures with inelastic constitutive behavior - Part II - software coupling implementation aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000264968100002"}
