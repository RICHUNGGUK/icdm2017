In healthcare systems, reliability of a recognition model is of high importance. Limited amount of training data and imbalanced number of activity instances result in over-fitting thus making recognition models inconsistent. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition approach that integrates the distance minimization (DM) and probability estimation (PE) approaches to improve the reliability of recognitions. DM uses distances of instances from the mean representation of each activity class for label assignment. DM is useful in avoiding decision biasing towards the activity class with majority instances; however, DM can result in over-fitting. PE on the other hand has good generalization abilities. PE measures the probability of correct assignments from the obtained distances, while it requires a large amount of data for training. We apply data oversampling to improve the representation of classes with less number of instances. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to combine the outputs of both DM and PE, since SVM performs better with imbalanced data and further improves the generalization ability of the approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five publicly available smart home datasets. The results demonstrate better performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art activity recognition approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
