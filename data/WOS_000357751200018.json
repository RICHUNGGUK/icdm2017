To better capture the relationship between features and the class, class labels are separated into individual variables and relevance and redundancy are explicitly handled on each class label. Super-efficiency DEA is employed to evaluate and rank features via their conditional dependence scores on all class labels, and the feature with maximum super-efficiency score is then added in the conditioning set for conditional dependence estimation in the next iteration, in such a way as to iteratively select features and get the final selected features. Eventually, experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed method compared with five state-of-the-art methods from the viewpoint of classification accuracy. Empirical results verify the feasibility and the superiority of proposed feature selection method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
