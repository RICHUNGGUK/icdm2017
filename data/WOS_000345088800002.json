To conserve arithmetic operators and hasten processing speed, we propose an architecture based on recycled computation without the need for a multiplier. Center-based computation is used to generate the pixels in plane mode using two parallel cores and the architecture is implemented using four-parallel inputs and two-parallel outputs to achieve high-speed processing. The architecture is a configurable structure capable of computing the parameters and generating the predicted pixels in DC and plane mode within only 239 cycles in the processing of YUV blocks. The high-speed prediction for H.264 encoding meets the requirement for real-time HDTV.", "paper_title": "Fast low-complexity computation and real-time architecture for H.264/AVC intra-prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000345088800002"}
