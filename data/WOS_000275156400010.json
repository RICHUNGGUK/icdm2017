The drivers for this change are the increase in efficiency and a better and more stable water quality. Fully automated treatment plants will require more sophisticated operator care than manually operated plants, so operation Supervisors should periodically train in a drinking water treatment plant simulator. The Successful first time setup of such a simulator is addressed in this paper. Environmental decision-support systems (EDSSs) were used as a blueprint for this simulator because the integration of different models is common in EDSSs. By applying a SCADA-like graphic user interface and several report options, even a group of end-users without specific modelling skills or knowledge can take advantage of the use of integrated hydraulic, water quality and process control models. The 'Waterspot' drinking water treatment plant simulator has been developed and applied to Dutch drinking water treatment plants. To demonstrate successful application, a case study is described for the drinking water treatment plant at Weesperkarspel. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
