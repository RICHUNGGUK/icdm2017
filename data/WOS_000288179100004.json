Multiple-gated transistor technique was used to improve linearity. A new approach for choosing the bias voltage of auxiliary transistor by analyzing the shift of gate bias is used in the design. The simulated results of the proposed two-stage differential power amplifier indicate 25.28 dBm P1-dB, 32.87% PAE, and 26.18 dBm saturated output power with a 5.2 dB P1-dB improvement compared to conventional single transistor amplifier.
