Slow-wave coplanar waveguides are used for matching and interconnects to study the benefits of using this line type in amplifier design. Measured power gain, noise figure and 1 dB output compression point at 60 GHz are 13 dB, 6.3 dB and +4 dBm, respectively. The amplifier has 19.6 GHz of 3 dB bandwidth, thus covering entirely the unlicensed band around 60 GHz. The performance is achieved with a 1.2 V supply and 45 mA DC current consumption.", "paper_title": "60 GHz amplifier employing slow-wave transmission lines in 65-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280593900003"}
