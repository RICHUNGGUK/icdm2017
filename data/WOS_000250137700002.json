The described data structures support planar range reporting queries in time O(log n+k log log (4n/(k+1))) and space O(n log log n), or in time O(log n+k) and space O(nlog(epsilon) n) for any epsilon > 0. Both data structures can be constructed in O(n log n) time and support insert and delete operations in amortized time O(log(2)n) and O(log n log log n) respectively. These results match the corresponding upper space bounds of Chazelle (SIAM J. Comput. 17, 427-462, 1988) for the static case. We also present a dynamic data structure for d-dimensional range reporting with search time O(log(d-1) n+k), update time O(log(d) n), and space O(n log(d-2+epsilon) n) for any epsilon > 0. The model of computation used in our paper is a unit cost RAM with word size log n.", "paper_title": "Space efficient dynamic orthogonal range reporting", "paper_id": "WOS:000250137700002"}
