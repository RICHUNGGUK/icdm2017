It is shown that if the threshold is chosen appropriately as a function of the cross-talk noise and of the activity of the stored patterns, adapting itself automatically in the course of the recall process, an autonomous functioning of the network is guaranteed. This self-control mechanism considerably improves the quality of retrieval, in particular the storage capacity, the basins of attraction and the mutual information content.", "paper_title": "Adaptive thresholds for layered neural networks with synaptic noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100071"}
