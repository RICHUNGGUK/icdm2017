When we use CBR to solve real world problems, its inherent uncertainty tends to propagate and may be detrimental to the system's quality. Consequently, the quality of a CBR system's outcome tends to increase as we address its uncertainty. This article examines approaches based on fuzzy set theory that manage the uncertainty originated in CBR systems and describes in detail a method based to address the uncertainty originated in the CBR assumption that similar problems have similar solutions.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy set theory and uncertainty in case-based reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000243363300001"}
