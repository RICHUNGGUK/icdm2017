Thus, we are able to assess the problem considering probabilistic information and the attitudinal character of the decision maker. For doing so, the fuzzy generalized probabilistic OWA (FGPOWA) operator is presented. It is an aggregation operator that unifies the probability and the OWA operator considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the aggregation. It also uses fuzzy numbers that deal with uncertain environments where the available information is imprecise. Moreover, it includes a wide range of particular cases including the fuzzy generalized probabilistic aggregation, the fuzzy POWA operator and the fuzzy GOWA operator. A further generalization to this approach is presented by using quasi-arithmetic means forming the fuzzy quasi-arithmetic POWA (Quasi-FPOWA) operator. An application in fuzzy group decision making is developed by using the multi-person - FGPOWA (MP-FGPOWA) operator.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy group decision-making with generalized probabilistic OWA operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800020"}
