Although simulation-based training can improve the effectiveness of training for company employees, there are still many management challenges that need to be overcome. This paper develops a hybrid framework that integrates data mining techniques with the simulation-based training to improve the effectiveness of training evaluation. The concept of confidence-based learning is applied to assess trainees' learning outcomes from the two dimensions of knowledge/skill level and confidence level. Data mining techniques are used to analyze trainees' profiles and data generated from simulation-based training for evaluating trainees' performance and their learning behaviors. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example of a real case of simulation-based infantry marksmanship training in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed methodology can accurately evaluate trainees' performance and their learning behaviors and can discover latent knowledge for improving trainees' learning outcomes.
