A BB in each DiffServ domain handles SLAs on behalf of its domain by communicating with its neighboring peers. The proposed model uses a destination-based SLAs aggregation to increase signaling and state scalability, and it uses a BB-based inter-domain routing to increase resource utilization. The experimental results are provided to verify the achievements.", "paper_title": "A bandwidth-broker based inter-domain SLA negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242560000014"}
