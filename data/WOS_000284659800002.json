The mathematical model includes the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Euler-Newton equations describing fluid-structure interaction for the generalized Neumann boundary conditions on upstream and downstream boundaries. The solution method includes the finite element method combined with an operator-splitting scheme, where the fictitious formulation allows the flow calculations to be in a fixed rectangular parallelepiped to predict the dynamic structural positions and flow field during the valve opening and closing phases.
