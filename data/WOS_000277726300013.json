The target is to minimize inter-cellular movements. Inspired by the rational behind the so called grouping genetic algorithm (GGA), this paper proposes a grouping version of differential evolution (GDE) algorithm and its hybridized version with a local search algorithm (HGDE) to solve benchmarked instances of cell formation problem posing as a grouping problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we borrow a set of 40 problem instances from literature and compare the performance of GGA and GDE. We also compare the performance of both algorithms when they are tailored with a local search algorithm. Our computations reveal that the proposed algorithm performs well on all test problems, exceeding or matching the best solution quality of the results presented in previous literature.
