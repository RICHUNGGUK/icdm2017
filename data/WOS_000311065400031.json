Such problems are often very computationally complex to solve. We develop a relax-and-fix-based decomposition approach to solve large-scale GBLPs, which we demonstrate will significantly reduce solution runtimes while not severely impacting optimality. We also introduce problem-specific logical restrictions, constraints that reduce the feasible region and the resulting branch-and-bound tree with minimal reductions in optimality.
