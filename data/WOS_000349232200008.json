Genetic improvement of software for multiple objective exploration (GISMOE) found code that is 70 times faster (on average) and yet is at least as good functionally. Indeed, it even gives a small semantic gain.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Existing Software with Genetic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000349232200008"}
