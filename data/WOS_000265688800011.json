However, current service frameworks are predominantly used through precompiled service-access components, which are invariably hard-wired to a specific service provider. The Dynamic and Asynchronous Invocation of Services framework is a message-based service framework that supports SOA implementation, allowing dynamic invocation of SOAP/WSDL-based and RESTful services.
