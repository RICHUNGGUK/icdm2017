We propose a novel multi-objective model that decouples the minimization of the distribution costs from the maximization of the freshness state of the delivered products. The main objective of the work is to examine the relation between distribution scenarios and the cost-freshness trade-off. Small size instances adapted from the vehicle routing problem with time windows are solved with an epsilon-constraint method and for large size instances a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is implemented. The computational experiments show the conflicting nature of the two objectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
