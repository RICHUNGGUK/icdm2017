The network is secured through a variant of the secure socket layer protocol, with ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange using elliptic curve cryptography. Our traffic and energy model allows calculations of cluster populations under the simultaneous constraints of prescribed secure event sensing reliability and lifetime of the whole network.
