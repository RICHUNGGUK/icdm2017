We first quantitatively show that a pre-OPC litho-metric is highly uncorrelated with a post-OPC metric, which stresses the importance of a post-OPC litho-metric for design-time optimization. We then propose a compact post-OPC litho-metric for a detailed router (DR) based on statistical characterization, where the interferences among predefined litho-prone shapes are captured as a lookup table. Our litho-metric derived from the characterization shows high fidelity to the total edge placement error (EPE) in large scale, compared with Calibre OPC/optical rule check. Therefore, ELIAD powered by the proposed litho-metric can enhance the overall post-OPC printed silicon image. Experimental results on 65-nm industrial circuits show that ELIAD outperforms a rip-up/rerouting approach such as Resolution-enhancement-technique-Aware Detailed Routing with 8x more EPE hot spot reduction and 12x speedup. Moreover, compared with a conventional DR, ELIAD is only about 50% slower.", "paper_title": "ELIAD: Efficient Lithography Aware Detailed Routing Algorithm With Compact and Macro Post-OPC Printability Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000007"}
