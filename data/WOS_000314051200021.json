Between the two enzymes, GAD67 accounts for normal GABA requirement, while GAD65 stays inactive until emergent demand for GABA. Recent crystal structure findings revealed that the distinct conformation of a common catalytic loop of the enzymes may account for their different functions (Fenalti et al Nat Struct Mol Biol, 14:280-286, 2007). Enlightened by their inferences, we studied the underlying reaction mechanism of the two GAD isoforms using density functional theory (DFT). A rather complete reaction pathway is identified, including nine transition state (TS) structures and 14 intermediate (IM) structures. The rate limiting step occurs early during the reaction and involves a proton transfer. In the late stage, there are two pathways that involve C-4' and C-alpha protonation by Tyr or Lys. Our calculations show that the reaction barriers corroborate the conjecture made by Fenalti et al.", "paper_title": "Quantum chemistry studies of the catalysis mechanism differences between the two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200021"}
