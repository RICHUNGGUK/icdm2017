The purpose of this paper is to investigate and discuss the potential of a simple complex-permeability model. Design/methodology/approach - A frequency dependent complex-permeability model as well as a more detailed model (describing hysteresis, classical eddy current effects, and excess losses separately) are compared to single-sheet measurements on laminated electrical steel. It is discussed under which circumstances the simple complex-mu model is an adequate substitute for the more detailed model. Findings - A satisfactory agreement of the simple complex-mu model was found with both detailed model and measurements, improving with increasing frequencies. This is true not only for the effective permeability function, but holds also for the detailed H-B characteristics (hysteresis). Originality/value - It is demonstrated that the complex-A model is a reliable and convenient starting point for the estimation of flux distribution and losses in complicated magnetic core geometries.", "paper_title": "Comparison of a simple and a detailed model of magnetic hysteresis with measurements on electrical steel", "paper_id": "WOS:000267277700017"}
