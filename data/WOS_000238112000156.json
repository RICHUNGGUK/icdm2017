In this paper, an improved one class support vector classifier (SVC) and its boosting chain learning algorithm is proposed. Different from the one class SVC, this algorithm considers negative samples information, and integrates the bootstrap training and boosting algorithm into its learning procedure. The performances of the SVC can be successively boosted by repeat important sampling large negative set. Compared with traditional methods, it has the merits of higher detection rate and lower false positive rate, and is suitable for object detection and information retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed boosting SVM chain learning method is efficient and effective.", "paper_title": "A boosting SVM chain learning for visual information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000156"}
