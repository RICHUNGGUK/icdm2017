Several dies are combined to achieve a full-bridge topology, realizing a bipolar output voltage. This output voltage can be increased using a stacking technique. As a result, AC output voltages up to 4 V have been achieved, which is more than three times the nominal 1.2 V supply voltage of the technology. Problems such as hot carrier degradation and oxide breakdown are absent, since each subblock operates within the standard voltage limits. The passives are integrated on-chip. Consequently, the bill of materials (BOM) is heavily reduced. In a standard half-bridge topology, bulky external components are needed to filter off the DC-offset. This main obstacle of an off-chip capacitor and inductor is alleviated in the full-bridge topology, reducing the BOM even more. An output peak-to-peak voltage of 3.8 V is achieved at a maximal efficiency of 58.3 %. A total output power of 56 mW is obtained.", "paper_title": "High voltage DC-AC conversion in standard 1.2 V CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458100008"}
