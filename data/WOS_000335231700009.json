The CSS application of music content creation paradigm called DesignStorming as it pertains to CSS modeling and developing. CSS is an interactive service system that can be systematic service innovation and automatic semi-automated value co-creation between service providers and customers to enhance service productivity. The objectives of this research are threefolda\"Euroto propose a novel design methodology for CSS, to incorporate simple service machine (SSM) and intelligent service machine (ISM) for CSS, and to demonstrate a CSS application of music content creation. SSM is a road map that can be used to define the salient attribute elements for CSS design. According to the predefined SSM, ISM conducts modeling the cognitive process of service exchanges and service provision, their knowledge representations, and value co-production process for a computerized CSS. DesignStorming demonstrates how a CSS can be automated the interactive communications and problem solving processes during the music content creation work. The CSS application involves the three system components: 1) Ontology Developer, 2) SFGA Partnership Matcher, and 3) Co-created Value Appraiser. In addition, a service evaluation model is described and evaluated, so that some of their important characteristics can be identified. Such a comprehensive design methodology can provide the foundation for building future more diversified and innovative collaborative service system.", "paper_title": "Collaborative service system design for music content creation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335231700009"}
