In this paper the possibility of respiratory impedance measurement by interrupter technique as well as the accuracy of this approach are assessed. Transient states of flow and pressure recorded during expiratory flow interruption are simulated with a complex, linear model for the respiratory system and then used to calculate the impedance, including three states of respiratory mechanics and the influence of the measurement noise. The results of computations are compared to the known, theoretical impedance of the model. At 1 kHz sampling rate, the optimal time window lays between 100 and 200 ms and is centred around the pressure jump caused by the flow interruption. The proposed algorithm yields satisfactory accuracy in the range from 10 to 400 Hz, particularly to 150 Hz. Depending on the simulated respiratory system state, the error of calculated impedance (relative Euclidean distance between the vectors of computed and theoretical values), for the window of 190 ms, varies between 5.0% and 7.1%.
