MCMI can provide the concurrent transmission in different channels for each node with multiple interfaces; MPR offers an increased number of concurrent transmissions on the same channel; DA can be more effective than omni-DA by reducing interference and increasing spatial reuse. This paper explores the capacity of wireless networks that integrate MCMI, MPR, and DA technologies. Unlike some previous research, which only employed one or two of the aforementioned technologies to improve the capacity of networks, this research captures the capacity bound of the networks with all the aforementioned technologies in arbitrary and random wireless networks. The research shows that such three-technology networks can achieve at most 2 pi/theta root k capacity gain in arbitrary networks and (2 pi/theta)(2) k capacity gain in random networks compared with MCMI wireless networks without DA and MPR. The paper also explored and analyzed the impact on the network capacity gain with different c/m, theta, and k-MPR ability.
