Examples include avionics mission replanning over Link-16, security systems based on wireless camera networks, and online collaboration using camera phones. Meeting image transmission deadlines is a key challenge in such systems due to unpredictable network conditions. In this paper, we present CAMRIT, a Control-based Adaptive Middleware framework for Real-time Image Transmission in distributed real-time embedded systems. CAMRIT features a distributed feedback control loop that meets image transmission deadlines by dynamically adjusting the quality of image tiles. We derive an analytic model that captures the dynamics of a distributed middleware architecture. A control-theoretic methodology is applied to systematically design a control algorithm with analytic assurance of system stability and performance, despite uncertainties in network bandwidth. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMRIT can provide robust real-time guarantees for a representative application scenario.", "paper_title": "Control-based adaptive middleware for real-time image transmission over bandwidth-constrained networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255199500005"}
