It is known that the augmented cube AQ is maximally connected, i.e. (2n - 1)-connected, for n >= 4. By the classic Menger's Theorem, every pair of vertices in AQ is connected by 2n - 1 vertex-disjoint paths for n >= 4. A routing with parallel paths can speed up transfers of large amounts of data and increase fault tolerance. Motivated by research on networks with faults, we obtained the result that for any faulty vertex set F c V(AQ) and [F] < 2n - 7 for n >= 4, each pair of non-faulty vertices, denoted by u and v, in AQ F is connected by min{deg(f)(u), deg(f) (v)} vertex-disjoint fault-free paths, where degf(u) and degf(v) are the degree of u and v in AQ(n) - F, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that for any faulty vertex set F subset of V(AQ(n)) and vertical bar F vertical bar < 4n - 9 for n 4, there exists a large connected component with at least 2(n) - vertical bar F vertical bar 1 vertices in AQ F, which improves on the results of Ma et al. (2008) who show this for n >= 6. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
