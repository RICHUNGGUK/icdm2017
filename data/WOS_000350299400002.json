While well known approaches such as error correcting codes exist to recover from failures and provide fault-free chips, they will not be affordable anymore in the future due to their growing cost. Consequently, other approaches like fine-grained disabling and reconfiguration of hardware elements (e.g. individual functional units or cache blocks) will become economically necessary. This fine-grained disabling will degrade performance compared to a fault-free execution. To the best of our knowledge, all static worst-case execution time (WCET) estimation methods assume fault-free processors. Their result is not safe anymore when fine-grained disabling of hardware components is used. In this paper we provide the first method that statically calculates a probabilistic WCET bound in the presence of permanent faults in instruction caches. The proposed method derives a probabilistic WCET bound for a program, cache configuration, and probability of cell failure. As our method relies on static analysis to bound the longest path, its probabilistic nature only stems from the probability that faults actually occur. Our method is computationally tractable because it does not require an exhaustive enumeration of all the possible combinations of faulty cache blocks. Experimental results show that it provides WCET estimates very close to, but never below, the method that derives probabilistic WCETs by enumerating all possible locations of faulty cache blocks. The proposed method not only allows to quantify the impact of permanent faults on WCET estimates, but, most importantly, can be used in architectural exploration frameworks to select the most appropriate fault management mechanisms and design parameters for current and future chip designs.", "paper_title": "Static probabilistic worst case execution time estimation for architectures with faulty instruction caches", "paper_id": "WOS:000350299400002"}
