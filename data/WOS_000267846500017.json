The new component allows the sample to be described by its material dynamic structure factor. which is separated into coherent and incoherent contributions. The effects of absorption and multiple scattering are treated and results from simulations and previous experiments are compared. The sample component can also be used to treat any scattering material which may be close to the sample and therefore contaminates the total, measured signal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
