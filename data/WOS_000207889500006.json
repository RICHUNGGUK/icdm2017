Several approaches have already been proposed, which can be seen as isolated attempts to address partial issues and specific sub-sets of the general problem. This paper aims at tackling gaze-based home automation as a whole, exploiting state-of-the-art technologies and trying to integrate interaction modalities that are currently supported and that may be supported in the near future. User-home interaction is sought through two, complementary, interaction patterns: direct interaction and mediated interaction. Integration between home appliances and devices and user interfaces is granted by a central point of abstraction and harmonization called House Manager. Innovative points can be identified in the wide flexibility of the approach which allows on one side to integrate virtually all home devices having a communication interface, and, on the other side, combines direct and mediated user interaction exploiting the advantages of both. A discussion of interaction and accessibility issues is also provided, justifying the presented approach from the point of view of human-environment interaction.", "paper_title": "A blueprint for integrated eye-controlled environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000207889500006"}
