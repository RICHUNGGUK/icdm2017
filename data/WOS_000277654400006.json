The regions with invariant optimal partitions as well as the behaviour of the optimal value function on the regions are investigated. We show that identifying these regions can be done in polynomial time in the output size. An algorithm for identifying all invariancy regions is presented. Some implementation details as well as a numerical example are discussed.", "paper_title": "Bi-parametric convex quadratic optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000277654400006"}
