In this paper, a method for decomposition of mixed pixels which combines competitive neural network and fuzzy clustering, termed self-organizing map and fuzzy membership (SOM&FM) is proposed. The proposed method only demands some data samples as prior knowledge to train the SUM neural network in a supervised way. And the unmixing is based on the fuzzy model, which satisfies the abundances non-negative constraint (ANC) and the abundances summed-to-one constraint (ASC) automatically. Experimental results on synthetic and real hyperspectral data demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for both linear and nonlinear spectral mixture situations, and has good unmixing performances.
