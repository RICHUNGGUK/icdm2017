Multi-scale wavelet coefficients are used as input for SOM, and likelihood probabilities for observations are obtained from trained SOMs. Texture segmentation is performed by the likelihood probability from trained SOMs and ML (maximum likelihood) classification. The result of texture segmentation is improved using contextual information. The proposed segmentation method performed better than segmentation method using HMT (hidden Markov trees) model. In addition, texture segmentation results by SOM and multi-scale Bayesian image segmentation technique called HMTseg also performed better than those by HMT and HMTseg.", "paper_title": "Texture segmentation using SOM and multi-scale Bayesian estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000097"}
