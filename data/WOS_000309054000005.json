This approach, named base flow lattice Boltzmann method, is of great interest in particular for aeroacoustic fields where the acoustic perturbation, on the one hand, is almost exclusively influenced by the large scale average structures of the underlying flow, and on the other hand, has a low effect on the large structures. The method is implemented for weakly compressible flows and the results of the base flow lattice Boltzmann are compared with the standard single relaxation time LBM. The boundary conditions for the base flow lattice Boltzmann method are discussed, as well as the implementation of outflow conditions for acoustic waves. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
