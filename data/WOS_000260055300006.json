Different faults on a protected cable should be classified and located correctly to ensure the reliable operation of power systems. The proposed scheme is insensitive to fault type, fault resistance, fault inception angle, and system source Configuration. The proposed scheme has been implemented on a digital relay and its behavior is investigated on a simulated power system model. The novelty of this work compared with other artificial intelligence applications is the design and hardware implementation of the proposed scheme in fault classification and fault location. Studies show that the proposed scheme is very accurate in both fault classification and fault location.", "paper_title": "FAULT CLASSIFICATION AND FAULT LOCATION USING ANN FOR MEDIUM VOLTAGE CABLES: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260055300006"}
