Lower cost and greater flexibility are the key factors luring enterprises to transition to VoIP. Some security problems may surface with the widespread deployment of VoIP. In this article, we discuss these security problems and propose a high-level security architecture that captures required features at each boundary-network-element in the VoIP infrastructure. We describe mechanisms to efficiently integrate information between distributed security components in the architecture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
