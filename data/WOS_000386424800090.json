The same information, however, can be represented using many different structures and the structural properties observed over particular representations do not necessarily hold for alternative structures. Because these algorithms tend to be highly effective over some choices of structure, such as that of the databases used to validate them, but not so effective with others, graph analytics has largely remained the province of experts who can find the desired forms for these algorithms. We argue that in order to make graph analytics usable, we should develop systems that are effective over a wide range of choices of structural organizations. We demonstrate Universal-DB an entity similarity and proximity search system that returns the same answers for a query over a wide range of choices to represent the input database.", "paper_title": "Universal-DB: Towards Representation Independent Graph Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800090"}
