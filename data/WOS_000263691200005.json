On the basis of a novel theoretical model of bipedal walking, this paper investigates a model of biped robot which makes use of minimum control and elastic passive joints inspired from the structures of biological systems. The model is evaluated in simulation and a physical robotic platform by analyzing the kinematics and ground reaction force. The experimental results show that, with a proper leg design of passive dynamics and elasticity, an attractor state of human-like walking gait patterns can be achieved through extremely simple control without sensory feedback. The detailed analysis also explains how the dynamic human-like gait can contribute to adaptive biped walking. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
