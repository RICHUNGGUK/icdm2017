The non-compositionality of this intuitive operational semantics motivates the design of a compositional and fully abstract denotational semantics.", "paper_title": "Fully abstract semantics for a coordination model with asynchronous communication and enhanced matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000242909600002"}
