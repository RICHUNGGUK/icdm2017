Such pervasive computing environments pose a difficult challenge in formally accessing the resources. The digital information generally represents sensitive and confidential information that organizations must protect and allow only authorized personnel to access and manipulate them. As organizations implement information strategies that call for sharing access to resources in the networked environment, mechanisms must be provided to protect the resources from adversaries. In this paper, we seek to address the issue of how to advocate selective information sharing while minimizing the risks of unauthorized access. We integrate a role-based delegation framework to propose a system architecture. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our framework through a proof-of-concept implementation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
