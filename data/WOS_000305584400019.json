The SoS is modeled using hypergraphs, where their architectural representation allows the application of a supervision strategy, from ascending or descending directions directly on the graph. From ascending direction, it is possible to detect local or global faults on a system, when some constraints are no longer satisfied. This is done using the concept of \"degree of satisfaction,\" where the new operating mode of SoS is deduced using the principle of automata. In the descending direction and based on the constraint satisfaction problem, we can check from the hypergraphs a possible structural reconfiguration of SoS in the presence of faults. This reconfiguration is possible when the available systems satisfy a maximum number of constraints. Finally, an application of a SoS is presented. This is done using intelligent autonomous vehicles in a platoon configuration within a seaport terminal.", "paper_title": "Hypergraph Models for System of Systems Supervision Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584400019"}
