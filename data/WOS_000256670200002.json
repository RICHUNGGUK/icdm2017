With the help of Galerkin's method, the dynamics of DPS with time delay can be first converted into a group of low-order functional ordinary differential equations, which will be used for design of the robust fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller designed can guarantee exponential stability of the closed-loop DPS. Some sufficient conditions are derived for the stabilization together with the linear matrix inequality design approach. The effectiveness of the proposed control design methodology is demonstrated in numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Robust stabilization of the distributed parameter system with time delay via fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670200002"}
