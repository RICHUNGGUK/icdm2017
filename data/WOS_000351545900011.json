However, WSN software development is difficult for the average software developer because data processing-related design and network-related design are tangled in the software. Here, we propose a software development process for WSN software by stepwise refinement. Our process enables stepwise refinement to separately address data processing-related and network-related concerns, reuse of well-defined designs, and implementations for network-related concerns prepared by the experts, and perform model-driven development to obtain source codes from models by model transformations. Additionally, we used case studies using actual WSN software development and user studies to evaluate how our proposed process can support actual WSN software development.", "paper_title": "Model-Driven-Development-Based Stepwise Software Development Process for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351545900011"}
