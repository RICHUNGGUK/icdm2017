In this paper, we propose a common vector space to describe documents and users to create a social network based on affinities, and explore epidemic routing to recommend documents according to the user's interests. Furthermore, we propose the creation of a SoftDHT structure to improve the recommendation results. Using these mechanisms, an efficient document recommender system with a fast organization of clusters of users based on their affinity can be provided, preventing the creation of unlinked communities. We show through simulations that the proposed system has a short convergence time and presents a high recall ratio. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
