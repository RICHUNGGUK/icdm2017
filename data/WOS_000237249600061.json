The merits of the proposed method are threefold. 1) The score ranged in [0, 100] can further illustrate the degree of tumor status in contrast to the conventional tumor classifier. 2) The derived score system can be used as a tumor classifier using a system-suggested or human-specified threshold value. 3) The derived classifier with a compact fuzzy rule base can. generate an interpretable and accurate prediction result. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and compared using two well-known datasets from microarray data and an existing tumor classifier. It is shown by computer simulation that the proposed scoring method is effective using ROC curves of classification.", "paper_title": "Scoring method for tumor prediction from microarray data using an evolutionary fuzzy classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600061"}
