They use MST or SPT as the initial solution and improve the total power consumption by switching certain tree nodes from their respective parent nodes to new corresponding parent nodes. These algorithms are not scalable because the refinement operations require heavy message exchange flows. In this paper, we propose the algorithm Localised Energy-efficient Multicast with Grouping (LEMG) features to perform a local search in a fully localised fashion. The mechanism Grouping exploits a novel idea to evaluate the power consumption cost of every node and to limit message exchange within an adjustable constant hop. Our simulation shows LEMG is comparable in energy efficiency with DMEM, while the refinement can be performed with limited hops of message passing regardless of the network size and the number of destinations.", "paper_title": "Fully localised energy-efficient multicast in large-scale wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288319400004"}
