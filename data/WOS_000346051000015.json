The core of Chimera is a fusion data structure that can store fusion events detected with any of the aforementioned tools. Fusions are then easily manipulated with standard R functions or through the set of functionalities specifically developed in Chimera with the aim of supporting the user in managing fusions and discriminating falsepositive results.", "paper_title": "Chimera: a Bioconductor package for secondary analysis of fusion products", "paper_id": "WOS:000346051000015"}
