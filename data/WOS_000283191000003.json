First we describe the corpus and explain the linguistic and computational motivation for its design and collection process; then, the phonetic antecedents and the alphabet adopted for the transcription task are presented; the corpus has been transcribed at three different granularity levels, which are also specified in detail. The corpus statistics for each transcription level are also presented. A set of phonetic rules describing phonetic context observed empirically in spontaneous conversation is also validated with the transcription. The corpus has been used for the construction of acoustic models and a phonetic dictionary for the construction of a speech recognition system. Initial performance results suggest that the data can be used to train good quality acoustic models.", "paper_title": "The Corpus DIMEx100: transcription and evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283191000003"}
