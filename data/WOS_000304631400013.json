Specifically, we propose a novel distributed 2-hop coloring algorithm for the time-slot assignment of newly deployed sensor nodes to establish collision-free communication links in wireless sensor and robot networks. The proposed algorithm does not assume the existence of the MAC layer or nodes' IDs, making it compatible to be applied in the initial environment of the wireless sensor and robot networks. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the effectivity of the proposed 2-hop coloring algorithm for the newly deployed wireless sensor and robot network. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
