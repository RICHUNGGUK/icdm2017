DAISIES works in a connection-oriented network, e.g. an IP/MPLS network, and follows a routing-based approach, i.e. it acts on the routing algorithm whilst link switch-off/on are consequence of routing decisions. The basic idea is to re-compute the path of each traffic demand when its requested capacity changes. A specific cost function is used to compute link weights into the shortest path routing algorithm with the goal of keeping unused as many links as possible. The main advantages of DAISIES can be summarized as follows: (i) no changes are required to current routing and signaling protocols, (ii) packet loss is completely avoided, (iii) both traffic decreasing and increasing and changing network conditions are automatically managed, and (iv) link switch-off/on take place transparently to the routing protocol and to other nodes. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of energy saving relative to a static network optimized to support the peak traffic. Results show that DAISIES is able to save about 30% of energy in several traffic conditions. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible keeping the additional complexity low and still reaching high energy efficiency. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
