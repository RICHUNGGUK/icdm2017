In this paper, the authors explore novel broadcasting schemes to improve the discovery phase of reactive routing protocols in MANETs. The objective is to reduce the redundancy of routing packets during the discovery phase of the reactive routing protocols for MANETs. For this purpose, the Jaccard distance is used to select dissimilar nodes during the discovery phase in order to reduce redundancy. Furthermore, it is shown that the Jaccard distance is correlated to the Euclidean distance. The simulation results obtained indicate that the Jaccard distance is a suitable metric for improving the discovery phase of the reactive routing protocols in MANETs.", "paper_title": "Improving discovery phase of reactive ad hoc routing protocols using Jaccard distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000329111400007"}
