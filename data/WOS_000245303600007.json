In this paper we prove a series of normal forms for spiking neural P systems, concerning the regular expressions used in the firing rules, the delay between firing and spiking, the forgetting rules used, and the outdegree of the graph of synapses. In all cases, surprising simplifications are found, without losing the computational completeness - sometimes at the price of (slightly) increasing other parameters which describe the complexity of these systems.
