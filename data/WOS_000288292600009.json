The sorted list is a canonical form for the equivalence relation of set equality. Other canonical forms arise in graph isomorphism algorithms. To determine if two graphs are cospectral (have the same eigenvalues), we compute their characteristic polynomials and see if they are equal; the characteristic polynomial is a complete invariant for cospectrality. Finally, an equivalence relation may be decidable in P without either a complete invariant or canonical form. Blass and Gurevich (1984) asked whether these conditions on equivalence relations-having an FP canonical form, having an FP complete invariant, and being in P-are distinct. They showed that this question requires non-relativizing techniques to resolve. We extend their results, and give new connections to probabilistic and quantum computation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
