We propose the relative consensus degree ILOWA (RCD-ILOWA) operator which uses the relative consensus degree (RCD) variable as the order inducing variable, and the compatibility index ILOWA (CI-ILOWA) operator which uses the compatibility index (CI) variable as the order inducing variable. We also investigate some desired properties of RCD-lLOWA operator and the CI-ILOWA operator which provide theoretic basis for the application of the additive linguistic preference relations in GDM. A general formulation and a nonlinear model to determine experts' weights and two approaches based on the RCD-ILOWA operator and the CI-ILOWA operator for GDM involving additive linguistic preference relations are developed respectively. A numerical example for comprehensive evaluation is given to illustrate the applications of the new operators.", "paper_title": "Some ILOWA operators and their applications to group decision making with additive linguistic preference relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100033"}
