However, it sometimes fails to offer a satisfactory convergence performance under certain circumstances. In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid HS approach, HS-PBIL, by merging the HS together with the population-based incremental learning (PBIL). Numerical simulations demonstrate that our HS-PBIL is well capable of outperforming the regular HS method in dealing with nonlinear function optimization and a practical wind generator optimization problem.", "paper_title": "A hybrid PBIL-based harmony search method", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552000025"}
