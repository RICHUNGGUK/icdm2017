We introduce a discrete level structure to calculate the amount of occlusion by using the contour level, an integer value derived from the depth difference of neighboring texels. We use the uniform sampling to define the positions of the neighboring texels in the depth texture. Our method does not depend on geometric complexity because our method works in screen space and works well for both static and dynamic scenes without any precomputation.
