It relies on visual analysis of activity levels and facial expressions of its users to select responses from a database of short video segments. This ever-growing database is automatically prepared by an offline analysis of user-uploaded videos. The resulting system matches its user's affect along dimensions of valence and arousal, and gradually adapts its response to each specific user. In an extended mode, two such systems are coupled and feed each other with visual content. The strengths and weaknesses of the system are assessed through a usability study, where a Wizard-of-Oz response logic is contrasted with the fully automatic system that uses affective and activity-based features, either alone, or in tandem.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of an affect-responsive interactive photo frame", "paper_id": "WOS:000309997100003"}
