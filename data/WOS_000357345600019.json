In this paper, a dynamically hierarchical, resource-allocation algorithm is proposed for multiple cloud nodes collaborating in big data environment. Using fuzzy pattern recognition, the algorithm dynamically divides tasks and nodes into different levels based on computing power and storage factors. Thus a dynamically adjusted mapping is generated between tasks and nodes. When a new task arrives, only the nodes corresponding to the task level join in the bid. The algorithm takes advantages of dynamical hierarchy to reduce the communication traffic during resource allocation. Both theoretical and experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the MinMin algorithm in terms of communication traffic and makespan.", "paper_title": "Dynamically hierarchical resource-allocation algorithm in cloud computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000357345600019"}
