Furthermore, most of the time, such schemes lack a careful security analysis. In this paper, we analyze the security and usability for an authentication mechanism that can be instantiated as a graphical password scheme. We model the information an adversary might extract by analyzing the transcripts of authentication sessions as a boolean formula. Our experiments show that the time needed by a passive adversary to extract the user secret in the last presented protocol grows exponentially in the system parameter, giving evidence of the security of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a two-factor graphical password scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000341829200002"}
