The success in matching user requirements to potential products is dependent on how well the functional and non-functional customer requirements can be understood and translated into cell features (design rules, processes and module types). This paper reports on a knowledge based methodology for forming customisable re-configurable assembly cells. The approach is based on matching user requirements to existing supplier knowledge in terms of design rules and principles, modules offered by different vendors, new emerging technologies and existing own and competitors' products. The decision making includes requirements analysis, generating assembly processing alternatives and evaluating and selecting assembly modules and cells. The proposed approach aims to assist decision making in assembly system design by enabling users and suppliers to jointly participate in an interactive and iterative process of forming re-configurable assembly cells.", "paper_title": "Knowledge based formation of re-configurable assembly cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000248611500009"}
