The data originates from a network of sensors embedded in an indoor environment such as an office, home, factory, public mall or airport. Data analysis is performed to automatically detect events and classify activities taking place within the environment. Sensor failure and in particular intermittent failure, caused by electrical interference, undermines the inference processes. PCA and CCA are compared for detecting intermittent faults and masking such failures. The fault detection relies on models built from historical data. As new sensor observations are collected the model is updated and compared to that previously estimated, where a difference is indicative of a failure. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
