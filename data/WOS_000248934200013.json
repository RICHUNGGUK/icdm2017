The proposed speech enhancer adaptively changes the speech spectral density used in the MAP estimation according to the sum of the observed power spectra. In a speech segment, the speech spectral density approaches to Rayleigh distribution to keep the quality of the enhanced speech. While in a non-speech segment, it approaches to an exponential distribution to reduce noise effectively. Furthermore, when the noise is super-Gaussian, we modify the width of Gaussian so that the Gaussian model with the modified width approximates the distribution of the super-Gaussian noise. This technique is effective in suppressing residual noise well. From computer experiments, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Speech enhancement based on MAP estimation using a variable speech distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200013"}
