For the commercial satellite \"IKONOS,\" spatial resolutions of high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution multispectral (MS) satellite images are 1 m and 4 m, respectively. To cope with color distortion and blocking artifacts in fused images, in this study, a multispectral and multiresolution image fusion approach using PSO is proposed. The pixels of fused images in the training set are classified into several categories based on the characteristics of low-resolution MS images. Then, the smooth parameters of spatial and spectral responses between the high-resolution PAN and low-resolution MS images are determined by PSO. All the pixels within each category are normalized by its own smooth parameter so that color distortion and blocking artifacts can be greatly reduced. Based on the experimental results obtained in this study, the overall visual quality of the fused images by the proposed approach is better than that by three comparison approaches, whereas the correlation coefficients, gamma (PAN) , for the fused images by the proposed approach are greater than that by three comparison approaches.", "paper_title": "Multispectral and multiresolution image fusion using particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300002"}
