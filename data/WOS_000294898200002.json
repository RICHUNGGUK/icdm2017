The novel architecture uses the time domain to individually address each port within a card and the space domain to address each card. Optical enabling technologies passively time-compress serial packets by exploiting the wavelength domain and perform a broadcast-and-select to a destination card with minimum power dissipation. Scalability of both the physical layer and the overall power dissipation of the architecture is shown to be enhanced with respect to the existing interconnection network architectures based on space and wavelength domains. The space-time network architecture is scalable up to 2(16) ports with space-switches exhibiting energy efficiency of the order of picojoules per bit, thanks to the self-enabled semiconductor-optical-amplifier-based space-switches.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Space-Time Multi-plane Optical Interconnection Network Using Energy-Efficient Enabling Technologies [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000294898200002"}
