The key nodes have maximum and minimum out-degree nodes, which show important in spreading disaster. This paper considers directed Erdos-Renyi, scale-free and small-world networks. Using the model considering the common characteristics of infrastructure and lifeline networks, i.e., self-healing function and disaster spreading mechanism, we carry out simulations for the effects of the recovery time parameter and the time delay on the recovery rate and the number of damaged nodes. Simulation results show some typical disaster spreading characteristics, e.g., a non-equilibrium phase transition in the parameter space, disturbance from the maximum out-degree nodes resulting in more damaged effect, etc.", "paper_title": "Modeling the dynamics of disaster spreading from key nodes in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251413500011"}
