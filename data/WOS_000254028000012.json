As a popular technology, data warehouse has been widely used by many global value chains to manage complicated information requirements for decision making. However, data warehouse technology cannot guarantee the quality of data. To resolve data quality problems occurring in global value chains, the concept of Master Data Management (MDM) is proposed. The concept of MDM is that the management rights of Master Data (MD) should be isolated from enterprise systems. And this concept can be applied to resolve issues over global management, such as global flexible automation. To construct an MDM system, the metadata in an MDM system should be designed first. However, current literature is too limited to construct MDM systems. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative design methodology for metadata in MDM systems. The design methodology consists of four steps: MD Dimensions, MD Views, MD Classifications, and MD Definitions. The logic applied in each step is illustrated. Following the methodology, the metadata in an MDM system can be systematically clarified. As demonstrated in this paper, two simple scenarios for global recreation brand are presented to illustrate the benefits of an MDM system on product introduction. The concepts in this paper are not specific to the recreation industry only. It can be easily adapted to other global industries. MDM system can maintain the accuracy, the completeness, and the consistency of global data. With MDM system, system integrated (SI) applications can be invented to support global value chain operations, such as global flexible automation.
