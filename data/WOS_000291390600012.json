However lasso has two major drawbacks. First, it does not enforce any grouping effect and secondly in some situation lasso solutions are inconsistent for variable selection. To overcome this inconsistency adaptive lasso is proposed where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients. Recently a doubly regularized technique namely elastic net is proposed which encourages grouping effect i.e. either selection or omission of the correlated variables together. However elastic net is also inconsistent. In this paper we study adaptive elastic net which does not have this drawback. In this article we specially focus on the grouped selection property of adaptive elastic net along with its model selection complexity. We also shed some light on the bias-variance tradeoff of different regularization methods including adaptive elastic net. An efficient algorithm was proposed in the line of LARS-EN, which is then illustrated with simulated as well as real life data examples.", "paper_title": "On the grouped selection and model complexity of the adaptive elastic net", "paper_id": "WOS:000291390600012"}
