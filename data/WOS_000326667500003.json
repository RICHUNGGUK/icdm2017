We propose a BSS approach that simultaneously estimates the number of sources, separates the sources based on the sparseness of speech, estimates the direction of arrival of each source, and performs permutation alignment. We confirmed experimentally that reasonably good separation was obtained with the present method without specifying the number of sources.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Blind Separation of Infinitely Many Sparse Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500003"}
