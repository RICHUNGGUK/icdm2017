In this paper, we discuss the development and features of a Gossip-Enabled Monitoring Service (GEMS), a highly responsive and scalable resource monitoring service, to monitor health and performance information in heterogeneous distributed systems. GEMS has many novel and essential features such as detection of network partitions and dynamic insertion of new nodes into the service. Easily extensible, GEMS also incorporates facilities for distributing arbitrary system and application-specific data. We present experiments and analytical projections demonstrating scalability, fast response times and low resource utilization requirements, making GEMS a potent solution for resource monitoring in distributed computing.", "paper_title": "GEMS: Gossip-Enabled Monitoring Service for scalable heterogeneous distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000202967600008"}
