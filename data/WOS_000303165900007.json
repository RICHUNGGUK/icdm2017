Consequently, researchers have proposed dedicated hardware architectures, utilizing a variety of classification algorithms targeting object detection. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is among the most popular classification algorithms used in object detection yielding high accuracy rates. However, existing SVM hardware implementations attempting to speed up SVM classification, have either targeted only simple applications, or SVM training. As such, there are limited proposed hardware architectures that are generic enough to be used in a variety of object detection applications. Hence, this paper presents a parallel array architecture for SVM-based object detection, in an attempt to show the advantages, and performance benefits that stem from a dedicated hardware solution. The proposed hardware architecture provides parallel processing, resource sharing among the processing units, and efficient memory management. Furthermore, the size of the array is scalable to the hardware demands, and can also handle a variety of applications such as multiclass classification problems. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented on an FPGA platform and evaluated using three popular detection applications, demonstrating real-time performance (40-122 fps for a variety of applications).", "paper_title": "A Parallel Hardware Architecture for Real-Time Object Detection with Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000303165900007"}
