This paper presents a new pattern discrimination method for HIT hand control. The method uses a bagged-BP neural network based on combing the BP neural networks using bagging algorithm. Bagging has been used to overcome the problem of limited number of training data in uni-model systems, by combining neural networks as weak learners. We compared the results of the bagging based BP network, using four features, with the results obtained separately from these uni-feature systems. The results show that the bagged-BP network improves both the accuracy and stability of the BP classifier.", "paper_title": "Multi-degree prosthetic hand control using a new BP neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000065"}
