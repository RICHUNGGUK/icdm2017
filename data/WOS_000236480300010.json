We describe some original algorithms on weighted automata and transducers (computation of the quotient, conversion of a regular expression into a weighted automaton, and composition). We explain how complex declarations due to the generic programming are masked from the user and finally we present a proposal for an XML format that allows implicit descriptions for simple types of automata.", "paper_title": "Inside Vaucanson", "paper_id": "WOS:000236480300010"}
