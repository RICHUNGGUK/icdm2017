Human intelligence in organizing companies in a civic society has been adopted in this framework. In the HGFNN framework, an FNN is regarded as a company and fuzzy rules are considered as employees of the company. Analogous to the management of a company, three criteria, namely client satisfaction, performance evaluation and cost minimization, have been proposed. Simulation studies on mobile robot control demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other existing approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
