Recently, the research focused on finding some algorithms that can detect line singularities of image while smoothing noise. Based on the finite Radon transform a finite ridgelet transform was derived for this purpose. But the wrap-around effect of the finite Radon transform limits its power greatly. In this paper, a way is pointed out to remove the wrap-around effect of the finite Radon transform. By embedding it into a moving window pyramid, a multiscale image denoising algorithm is developed.
