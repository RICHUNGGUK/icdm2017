The emergence of industry-standard trusted computing technologies promises a revolution in this respect by providing roots of trust upon which secure applications can be developed. These technologies offer a particularly attractive platform for security policy enforcement in general distributed systems. In this paper we propose a security framework to enforce access control policies with trusted computing, by following the recently proposed policy-enforcement-implementation (PEI) models. Our architecture is based on an abstract layer of trusted hardware which can be constructed with emerging trusted computing technologies. A trusted reference monitor (TRM) is introduced beyond the trusted hardware. By monitoring and verifying the integrity and properties of running applications in a platform using the functions of trusted computing, the TRM can enforce various policies on behalf of object owners. We further extend this platform-based architecture to support general user-based access control policies, cooperating with existing services for user identity and attributes, thus potentially supporting general access control models such as lattice-based, role-based, and usage-based access control policies.", "paper_title": "Client-side access control enforcement using trusted computing and PEI models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239988500003"}
