According to our simulation result for the single neuron model, this new C-CNN model has richer and more flexible dynamics, compared to the conventional CNN with only stable dynamics. The hardware implementation of this new network may be important for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Chaotic cellular neural networks with negative self-feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000008"}
