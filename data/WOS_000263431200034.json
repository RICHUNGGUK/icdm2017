The extracted trajectories of the feature points contain both rigid head motion components and non-rigid facial expression motion components. A 3D Virtual face model is used to obtain accurate estimation of the head rotation angle such that the non-rigid motion components can be precisely separated to enhance the facial expression recognition performance. The separation performance of the proposed system is further improved through the use of a restoration mechanism designed to recover feature points lost during large pan rotations. Having separated the rigid and non-rigid motions, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are employed to recognize a prescribed set of facial expressions defined in terms of facial action coding system (FACS) action units (AUs).
