The user's experience of the website played a moderating role. For less experienced users, perceived ease of use was found to be a more important factor in deciding to revisit the website, whereas perceived usefulness had more effect on more experienced users. Thus, web designers can identify and remove web factors that hinder user acceptance and address underlying obstacles to post-adoption usage. The novelty of the study consisted in applying TAM to a free-content website while considering the moderating effects of Internet and website experience. Significant practical implications can be derived from the results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
