The proposed method is based on the theory of controllably periodically forced oscillators and is implemented within the frame of the time-domain periodic steady-state analysis. The novel method is able to predict, in an accurate way, the conditions for which the correct frequency division occurs and can identify the transitions to more complex regimes that limit the exploitable synchronization region.", "paper_title": "Computing the Synchronization Regions of Injection-Locked Strongly Nonlinear Oscillators for Frequency Division Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000284417400001"}
