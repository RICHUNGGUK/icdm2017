Unlike previous approaches where the overall moods or sentiments are considered, the sentiments of the specific topics of the company are incorporated into the stock prediction model. Topics and related sentiments are automatically extracted from the texts in a message board by using our proposed method as well as existing topic models. In addition, this paper shows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis in the stock prediction task via a large scale experiment. Comparing the accuracy average over 18 stocks in one year transaction, our method achieved 2.07% better performance than the model using historical prices only. Furthermore, when comparing the methods only for the stocks that are difficult to predict, our method achieved 9.83% better accuracy than historical price method, and 3.03% better than human sentiment method.
