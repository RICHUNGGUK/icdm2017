A key feature of our algorithm is that it finds the conformation and orientation of secondary structure elements as well as the global fold in polynomial time. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm for de novo high-resolution biomacromolecular structure determination using experimentally recorded data from either NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography. Previous algorithmic formulations of this problem focused on using local distance restraints from NMR ( e. g., nuclear Overhauser effect [NOE] restraints) to determine protein structure. This approach has been shown to be NP-hard, essentially due to the local nature of the constraints. In practice, approaches such as molecular dynamics and simulated annealing, which lack both combinatorial precision and guarantees on running time and solution quality, are used routinely for structure determination. We show that residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data, which gives global restraints on the orientation of internuclear bond vectors, can be used in conjunction with very sparse NOE data to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for structure determination. Furthermore, an implementation of our algorithm has been applied to six different real biological NMR data sets recorded for three proteins. Our algorithm is combinatorially precise, polynomial-time, and uses much less NMR data to produce results that are as good or better than previous approaches in terms of accuracy of the computed structure as well as running time.", "paper_title": "A polynomial-time algorithm for de novo protein backbone structure determination from nuclear magnetic resonance data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241414800001"}
