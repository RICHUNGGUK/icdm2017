We start with the convection-diffusion-reaction equations at each scale of the lung and apply a spatial averaging technique (based on Liapunov-Schmidt method of the classical bifurcation theory) to obtain low-dimensional multiscale models. Our simulations for methemoglobin anemia show that while breathing in room air, the O-2 saturation in the patient's hemoglobin falls to below 94% at 50 ppm NO, and above 203 ppm, NO causes severe hypoxemia by reducing the O-2 saturation to below its critical value of 88%. We predict that patients respond to O-2 therapy up to inhaled NO levels of 271 ppm, above which they are candidates for methylene blue therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
