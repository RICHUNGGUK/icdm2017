Unlike many previous computational studies in graph colouring, a large range of both artificially generated and real-world graphs are considered, culminating in over 40,000 individual trials that have consumed more than a decade of computation time in total. The picture painted by the comparison is complex, with each method outperforming all others on at least one occasion; however, general patterns are also observed, particularly with regards to the advantages of hybridising local-search techniques with global-based operators.
