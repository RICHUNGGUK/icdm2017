In this paper, the problem of multiple gait features fusion is explored with the framework of the factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM). The FHMM has a multiple-layer structure and provides an alternative to combine several gait features without concatenating them into a single augmented feature. Besides, the feature concatenation is used to directly concatenate the features and the parallel HMM (PHMM) is introduced as a decision-level fusion scheme, which employs traditional fusion rules to combine the recognition results at decision level. To evaluate the recognition performances, McNemar's test is employed to compare the FHMM feature-level fusion scheme with the feature concatenation and the PHMM decision-level fusion scheme. Statistical numerical experiments are carried out on the Carnegie Mellon University motion of body and the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences gait databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the FHMM feature-level fusion scheme and the PHMM decision-level fusion scheme outperform feature concatenation. The FHMM feature-level fusion scheme tends to perform better than the PHMM decision-level fusion scheme when only a few gait cycles are available for recognition.", "paper_title": "Factorial HMM and Parallel HMM for Gait Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328400010"}
