We study the computational complexity of this problem. We prove that the Matrix Packing Down problem is NP-complete even when restricted to zero trace symmetric ( 0, 1)-matrices or to ( 0, 1)-matrices with at most two 1' s per column. Also, as intermediate results, we introduce several new simple graph layout problems which are proved to be NP-complete.", "paper_title": "Packing of (0,1)-matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000242275400001"}
