It occurs whenever human beings (or machines) draw conclusions that go beyond what is explicitly provided. Reasoning about spatial relations is an excellent testbed for the assessment of competing reasoning theories. In the present paper we show that such competing theories are often less diverse than one might think. We introduce an approach for how relational reasoning can be conceived as verbal reasoning. We describe a theory of how humans construct a one-dimensional mental representation given spatial relations. In this construction process objects are inserted in a dynamic structure called a \"queue\" which provides an implicit direction. The spatial interpretation of this direction can theoretically be chosen freely. This implies that choices in the process of constructing a mental representation influence the result of deductive spatial reasoning. To derive the precise rules for the construction process we employ the assumption that humans try to minimize their cognitive effort, and two cost measures are compared to judge the efficiency of the construction process. From this we deduce how the queue should be constructed. We discuss empirical evidence for this approach and provide algorithms for a computational implementation of the construction and reasoning process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
