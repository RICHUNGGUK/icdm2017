This relation is strong in the case of resource allocation systems (RASs). Siphons can be used in these systems in order to both characterize and prevent/avoid deadlock situations. However, the computation of these structural components can be very time consuming or, even, impossible. Moreover, if, in general, the complete enumeration of the set of minimal siphons must be avoided (there can exist an exponential number of such components), some deadlock prevention methods rely on its (complete or partial) computation and enumeration. The special syntactical constraints of some classes of RASs can help in developing specific algorithms to compute siphons in a more efficient way. In this work, a known method for siphon computation is adapted to get advantage of the special (syntactical) structure of a class of RASs; a parallel implementation is proposed and some experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Computing minimal siphons in Petri net models of resource allocation systems: A parallel solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000237457600013"}
