In the simulation of trishear fault-propagation folding, growth strata and strain ellipses are calculated and displayed simultaneously. This web-based program is easy to use. Model parameters are changed by simple mouse actions, which have the advantage of speed and simplicity. And it gives an instant visual appreciation of the effect of changing the parameters that are used to construct the initial configuration of the model and the fold-propagation folding. These data can be exported to a text file, and be shared with other geologists to replay the kinematic evolution of structures using the program. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
