Similarities and differences from the classical ICA framework (over the real field) are explored. We show that a necessary and sufficient identifiability condition is that none of the sources should have a uniform distribution. We also show that pairwise independence of the mixtures implies their full mutual independence (namely a nonmixing condition) in the binary (P = 2) and ternary (P = 3) cases, but not necessarily in higher order (P > 3) cases. We propose two different iterative separation (or identification) algorithms: One is based on sequential identification of the smallest-entropy linear combinations of the mixtures and is shown to be equivariant with respect to the mixing matrix; the other is based on sequential minimization of the pairwise mutual information measures. We provide some basic performance analysis for the binary (P = 3) case, supplemented by simulation results for higher orders, demonstrating advantages and disadvantages of the proposed separation approaches.", "paper_title": "Independent Component Analysis Over Galois Fields of Prime Order", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500029"}
