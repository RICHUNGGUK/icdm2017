Relationships were investigated using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The mean relative error was significantly (P < 0.01) lower for ANN than MLR model. Globally, the non-linear ANN model approach is shown to provide a better prediction of FAV than linear multiple regression.", "paper_title": "Prediction of feed abrasive value by artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552000009"}
