With the rapid accumulation of newly sequenced genomes, this analysis has become a computationally intensive and data-intensive problem. This paper describes the development of a Web-service-enabled, component-based, architecture to support the large-scale comparative analysis of complete microbial genome sequences and the subsequent identification of orthologues and protein families (Nflcrobase). The system is coordinated through the use of Web-service-based notifications and integrates distributed computing resources together with genomic databases to realize all-against-all comparisons for a large volume of genome sequences and to present the data in a computationally amenable format through a Web service interface. We demonstrate the use of the system in searching for orthologues and candidate protein famifies, which ultimately could lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets.", "paper_title": "Exploring microbial genome sequences to identify protein families on the grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000247889100009"}
