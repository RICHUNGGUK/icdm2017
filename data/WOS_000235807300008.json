The behaviour of these P systems is then defined according to a strategy which, in each step, randomly selects the next rule to be applied depending upon a certain distribution of probabilities. As an application, we present a P system model of the quorum sensing regulatory networks of the bacterium Vibrio Fischeri. In this respect, a formalisation of the network in terms of P systems is provided and some simulation results concerning the behaviour of a colony of such bacteria are reported. We also briefly describe the implementation techniques adopted by pointing out the generality of our approach which appears to be fairly independent from the particular choice of P system variant and the language used to implement it.", "paper_title": "On P systems as a modelling tool for biological systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807300008"}
