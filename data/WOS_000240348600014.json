In the buy-at-bulk k-Steiner tree problem we are given a graph G(V, E) with a set of terminals T subset of V including a particular vertex s called the root, and an integer k <= vertical bar T vertical bar. There are two cost functions on the edges of G, a buy cost b : E -> R+ and a distance cost r : E -> R+. The goal is to find a subtree H of G rooted at s with at least k terminals so that the cost Sigma(e is an element of H) (b(e)) + Sigma(t is an element of T-s) dist(t, s) is minimize, where dist(t, s) is the distance from t to s in H with respect to the r cost. We present an O(log(4) n)-approximation for the buy-at-bulk k-Steiner tree problem. The second and closely related one is bicriteria approximation algorithm for Shallow-light k-Steiner trees. In the shallow-light k-Steiner tree problem we are given a graph G with edge costs b(e) and distance costs r(e) over the edges, and an integer k. Our goal is to find a minimum cost (under b-cost) k-Steiner tree such that the diameter under r-cost is at most some given bound D. We develop an (O(log n), O(log(3) n))-approximation algorithm for a relaxed version of Shallow-light k-Steiner tree where the solution has at least terminals. Using this we obtain an (O(log(2) n), O(log(4) n))-approximation for the shallow-light k-Steiner tree and an O(log(4) n)-approximation for the buy-at-bulk k-Steiner tree problem.", "paper_title": "Approximating buy-at-bulk and shallow-light kappa-Steiner trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600014"}
