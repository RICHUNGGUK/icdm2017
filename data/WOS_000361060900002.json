The key feature of the approach is screen-space filtering with the help of additional information (depth, normal direction, etc.) of the illumination separated from material color. It allows to reach high-quality and edge-aware filtering. The proposed method yields 1-2 times speed-up without putting significant restrictions on the raytracing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Practical approach to the fast Monte-Carlo ray-tracing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361060900002"}
