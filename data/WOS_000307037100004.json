To this end, we discuss methods for virtual topology aggregation with consideration of inter-domain routing, and propose two heuristic algorithms for two representative applications, referred to as real-time streaming and bulk data transfer. We consider specific requirements of each application, including transmission deadline and jitter, and evaluate the impact of differential delay issue of multipath routing on the performance of proposed algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed multipath routing algorithms yield a low blocking ratio of inter-domain connections even on the static virtual topology, which is known for poor blocking performance otherwise. The resulting differential delay is sufficiently small for the studied applications, and can be compensated with relatively small buffers. We show that a scalable inter-domain service provisioning in optical networks can be achieved by using a combination of static virtual topology and multipath routing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
