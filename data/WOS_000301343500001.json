The housekeeping system (HKS) is the core part of ZDPS-1A. The reliability of HKS has an important influence on the safety of the satellite. Traditional fault-tolerant methods do not apply to ZDPS-1A due to such pico-satellite characteristics as light weight, compactness in size, energy saving, and high integration. This paper deals with a highly-reliable, low-cost design for HKS using industrial devices. The reliable strategies of HKS include a dual modular redundancy scheme, CPU warm backup, a static triple modular redundancy scheme, and two-level watchdogs. Recursive experiments, special tests, and environmental tests show that this system meets the design target. This design has already been applied to ZDPS-1A, which was launched to execute in-orbit tasks on Sept. 22, 2010. To date, the satellite has been in a proper state for more than 15 months.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of the highly-reliable, low-cost housekeeping system in the ZDPS-1A pico-satellite", "paper_id": "WOS:000301343500001"}
