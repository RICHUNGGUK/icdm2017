The presence of noise in sample data can make it more difficult to obtain precise system models. A new modeling algorithm called ANFIS-GMDH is presented in this paper, which builds upon the traditional ANFIS structure and utilizes the self-organizing mechanisms of GMDH. The aim of ANFIS-GMDH is to improve upon the traditional ANFIS method and prevent overfitting of noisy data. The well-studied Box-Jenkins gas furnace data is utilized to validate the algorithm, with results showing that the proposed algorithm performs better than traditional ANFIS, GMDH and subtractive clustering for both noisy and noiseless data, without any significant increase in execution time.", "paper_title": "A new modeling algorithm based on ANFIS and GMDH", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900007"}
