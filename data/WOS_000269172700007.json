From these properties, it can be shown that these measures provides important approaches to measuring the discernibility ability of different knowledge in ordered information systems. And relationship between knowledge granulation, knowledge entropy and knowledge uncertainty measure are considered. As an application of knowledge granulation, we introduce definition of rough entropy of rough sets in ordered information systems. By an example, it is shown that the rough entropy of rough sets is more accurate than classical rough degree to measure the roughness of rough sets in ordered information systems.
