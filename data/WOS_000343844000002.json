The approach features simplicity, flexibility, and easy adaptation to local contexts and needs. It is based on the governing design decision to provide a basic representation device known to be easy to use and adopted by teachers in standard practice: a table, similar to that found in office suites. The table is put in structural correspondence with a pivotal model (a tree), which is used to implement services requiring complex mechanisms that can be found in state-of-the-art systems, for example instantiation support or operationalization. We show how this approach makes it possible to design simple, flexible editors that offer complex services as add-ons and are easy to adapt to users' local needs, practices, and/or technical ecosystems.
