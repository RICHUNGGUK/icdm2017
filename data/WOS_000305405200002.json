The purpose of this paper is to derive order barriers for approximations of this and related forms. Although some of these barriers are already known, we will analyse them in a new way. Order arrows were originally proposed as a complement to order stars for establishing barriers for A-stable methods but they are shown also to be a powerful tool for analysing the type of order barrier considered in this paper.", "paper_title": "Order bounds for second derivative approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000305405200002"}
