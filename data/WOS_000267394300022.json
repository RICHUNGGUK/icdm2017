The detailed molecular mechanism of macrolide binding is yet to be elucidated as it is currently known to the most general idea only. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to study their interaction at the molecular level, and the binding free energies for both systems were calculated using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. The calculated binding free energies for both systems were slightly overestimated compared to the experimental values, but individual energy terms enabled better understanding in the binding for both systems. Decomposition of results into residue basis was able to show the contribution of each residue at the binding pocket toward the binding affinity of macrolides and hence identified several key interacting residues that were in agreement with previous experimental and computational data. Results also indicated the contributions from van der Waals are more important and significant than electrostatic contribution in the binding of macrolides to the binding pocket. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the understanding of a detailed mechanism of action in a quantitative matter and thus assisting in the development of a safer macrolide antibiotic.", "paper_title": "Molecular Insights into 14-Membered Macrolides Using the MM-PBSA Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000267394300022"}
