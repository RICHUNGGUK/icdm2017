The approach relies on the notion of proximity which is defined in a relative way. We show how such proximity allows for transforming a given predicate into an enlarged one. The resulting predicate is semantically not far from the original one and it is obtained by a simple fuzzy arithmetic operation. We show also how the search for a non-failing relaxed query over the lattice of relaxed queries can be improved by exploiting the notions of MFSs (Minimal Failing Sub-queries) and MGQs (Maximally Generalized failing Queries) of the original query.", "paper_title": "Relaxation paradigm in a flexible querying context", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000004"}
