We present structural results on C and S. Using a diagonalization argument, we show that neither C nor S is closed under disjoint union, also known as join. We show that this implies that neither C nor S is closed under union, intersection, or symmetric difference. Consequently EL(1), the first level of the extended low hierarchy, is not closed under join. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
