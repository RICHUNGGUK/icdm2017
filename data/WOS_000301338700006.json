In this work, the combined effects of the spatial discretization and interface reconstruction in flow simulation are examined. The mixed finite element pairs, Q1Q0 (with pressure stabilization) and Q2P-1 are compared. Material order-dependent and material order-independent first and second-order accurate interface reconstruction methods are used. The Q2P-1 elements show significant improvements in computed flow solution accuracy for single material flows but show reduced convergence using element-average piecewise constant density and viscosity in volume-tracked simulations. In general, a refined Q1Q0 grid, with better material interface resolution, provided an accuracy similar to the Q2P-1 element grid with a comparable number of degrees of freedom. Moment-of-fluid shows more benefit from the higher-order accurate flow simulation than the LVIRA, Youngs', and power diagram interface reconstruction methods, especially on unstructured grids, but does not recover the dramatic accuracy improvements it has shown in advection tests.
