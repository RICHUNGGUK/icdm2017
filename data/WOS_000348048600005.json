We recently proposed the finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model to the throughput analysis of DS uncoded CDMA/unslotted ALOHA networks for fixed length data traffic in the mobile environment. We now propose the FSMC model to the throughput analysis of coded DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA networks with variable length data traffic and one or two user classes in the mobile environment. The proposed DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA wireless networks for two user classes with access control can maintain maximum throughput for the high priority user class under high message arrival per packet duration.", "paper_title": "Throughput of Coded DS CDMA/Unslotted ALOHA Networks with Variable Length Data Traffic and Two User Classes in Rayleigh Fading FSMC Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000348048600005"}
