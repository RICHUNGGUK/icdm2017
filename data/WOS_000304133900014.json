PPA is compared with the Thomson-Reuters Institute for Scientific Information (TR) 5-year and 2-year impact factors and with expert opinion. The ranking produced by the method under study is only partially correlated with citation-based measures (TR), but exhibits close agreement with expert survey rankings. A simple average of TR and power rankings results in a new ranking that is highly correlated with the expert survey rankings. This evidence suggests that power ranking can contribute to evaluating artificial intelligence journals.", "paper_title": "Applying the Publication Power Approach to Artificial Intelligence Journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000304133900014"}
