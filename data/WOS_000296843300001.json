Furthermore, a new energy efficiency binary power control (EEBPC) algorithm is designed to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM wireless communication systems. Simulation results show that the EEBPC algorithm has better energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency than the average power control algorithm in MIMO-OFDM wireless communication systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Performance Analysis of Energy Efficiency Binary Power Control in MIMO-OFDM Wireless Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296843300001"}
