The tool reports as putative novel the 3'UTRs not annotated in available databases. Furthermore, if data from two related samples are uploaded, common and specific alternative 3'UTRs are identified and reported by the server.", "paper_title": "3USS: a web server for detecting alternative 3 ' UTRs from RNA-seq experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625300023"}
