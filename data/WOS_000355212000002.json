However, conversion from an integer scalar to a short tau NAF is a costly operation. In this paper, we improve the recently proposed scalar conversion scheme based on division by tau(2). We apply two levels of optimizations in the scalar conversion architecture. First, we reduce the number of long integer subtractions during the scalar conversion. This optimization reduces the computation cost and also simplifies the critical paths present in the conversion architecture. Then we implement pipelines in the architecture. The pipeline splitting increases the operating frequency without increasing the number of cycles. We have provided detailed experimental results to support our claims made in this paper.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Scalar Conversion for Koblitz Curve Cryptoprocessors on Hardware Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000002"}
