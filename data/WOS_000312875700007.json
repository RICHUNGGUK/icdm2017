Trusted users can securely access and employ Grid resources and services. In this paper, five portal components are presented: (1) The credential management administrates the user-credentials and authenticates them to the Grid. (2) The brain imaging data analysis (FSL) submits workflows to the Grid as part of Medical Image processing. (3) The integrated web services of Generic Workflow Execution Service (GWES) manage workflows executed by users in the Grid. (4) The data management component provides secure and efficient data management in a Grid environment, and enables high-speed data transports between user and Grid. (5) The lung sound analysis application provides twofold-pseudonymization before data-transferred to the Grid. The implementation as standardized portlets allows easy integration of specific components into different Grid portals such as the VO specific MediGRID and PneumoGrid portals.", "paper_title": "The Charit, Grid Portal: User-friendly and Secure Access to Grid-based Resources and Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000312875700007"}
