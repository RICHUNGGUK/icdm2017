The use of qualitative methods for shape description allows the gathering of semantic information from the sketches. The qualitative description and recognition of sketches are evaluated in order to verify that it is possible to use the proposed qualitative method for the development of a learning application for children.", "paper_title": "Sketch retrieval based on qualitative shape similarity matching: Towards a tool for teaching geometry to children", "paper_id": "WOS:000346283600007"}
