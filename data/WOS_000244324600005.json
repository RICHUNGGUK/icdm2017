The proposed method is especially suitable for beyond 3G (B3G) wireless networks. It offers a significant increase in the number of clients that the system can potentially serve simultaneously as well as a significant reduction in the expected waiting time for a service. Under high load conditions, the ratio of the expected waiting time for a service offered by the proposed method to the expected waiting time offered by the conventional method currently used for video streaming in wireless networks is very significant and increases exponentially with the load.
