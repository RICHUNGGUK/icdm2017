We investigate spatio-temporal movement patterns in large tracking data sets, i.e. in large sets of polygonal paths. Specifically, we study so-called 'popular places', that is, regions that are visited by many entities. Given a set of polygonal paths with a total of (n) over bar vertices, we look at the problem of computing such popular places in two different settings. For the discrete model, where only the vertices of the polygonal paths are considered, we propose an O((n) over bar log (n) over bar) algorithm; and for the continuous model, where also the straight line segments between the vertices of a polygonal path are considered, we develop an O((n) over bar (2)) algorithm.We also present lower bounds and hardness results.", "paper_title": "FINDING POPULAR PLACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469600003"}
