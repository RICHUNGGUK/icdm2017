The problem involves both a staffing and a scheduling decision. We propose an enumerative algorithm with bounding in which each node of the enumeration tree represents a mixed integer linear problem (MILP). We reformulate the MILP such that it becomes tractable for commercial MILP solvers. Extensive computational tests on 40 instances that are derived from a real-life setting indicate that the algorithm is capable of finding close-to-optimal solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
