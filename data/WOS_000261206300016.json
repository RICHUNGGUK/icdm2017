The proposed method jointly optimizes the generated clusters and the number of clusters according to a Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The criterion assesses a partitioning of utterances based on how high the level of within-cluster homogencity can be achieved at the expense of increasing the number of clusters. Unlike the existing methods, in which BIC is used only to deter-mine the optimal number of clusters, the proposed method uses BIC in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal cluster where each utterance should be located at. The experimental results show that the proposed speaker-clustering method outperforms the conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Speaker Clustering Based on Bayesian Information Criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000261206300016"}
