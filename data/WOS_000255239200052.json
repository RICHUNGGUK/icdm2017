In order to exploit the temporal structure of the data, we use a time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) process to model each source signal. Then variational Bayesian (VB) learning is adopted to integrate the source model with blind source separation (BSS) in probabilistic form. Our separation algorithm makes full use of temporally correlated prior information and avoids overfitting in separation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our vblCA-TVAR algorithm learns the temporal structure of sources and acquires cleaner source reconstruction. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
