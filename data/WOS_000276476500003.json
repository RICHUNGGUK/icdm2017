The recognition process consists of three stages. At the first stage, vehicles and pedestrians are detected in video images and the area, the shape and the velocity features are obtained by classical methods. At the second stage, BPR is used to classify the Zernike moments extracted at the first stage. At the last stage, CI is then adopted for multi-features fusion based on the output of BPR, and the area and the velocity features obtained at the first stage to improve the recognition accuracy. Experiment results show that this approach is efficient.", "paper_title": "An approach for moving object recognition based on BPR and CI", "paper_id": "WOS:000276476500003"}
