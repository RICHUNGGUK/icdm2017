For example, the distinguished emergent web events should be paid more attentions by the departments of the government to save lives and damages or by news websites to increase their hit-rates using limited resources. However, how to efficiently distinguish the types of web events remains a challenge issue due to the seldom efforts paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, we conduct a thorough consideration on this problem and then propose an innovative Bayesian-based model to distinguish the different types of web events. To be specific, all web events are firstly assumed within three types whose formal definitions are given by considering their properties. Aiming to sufficiently describe and distinguish three types web events, a set of specially designed features are then extracted from the volume and the content of web events. Finally, a Bayesian-based model is proposed based on the designed features. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to distinguish types of web events, and the comparisons with other state-of-the-art classifiers also show the efficiency of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "BAYESIAN-BASED TYPE DISCRIMINATION OF WEB EVENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359178000008"}
