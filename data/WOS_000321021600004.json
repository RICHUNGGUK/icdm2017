Moreover we show that the corresponding region may contain Grobner cones intersecting in the boundary of the Grobner fan in the origin only. This implies that Grobner walks aiming for the elimination of variables from a polynomial ideal can be terminated earlier than previously known. We provide a slightly improved stopping criterion for a known Grabner walk algorithm for the elimination of variables.
