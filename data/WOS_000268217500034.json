Many application fields now require more than a strict classification of elements into a hierarchy tree. Eider diagrams, one of the most natural ways of depicting intersecting sets, may provide a solution to these problems. In this paper we present an approach for the automatic generation of Euler-like diagrams. This algorithm differs from previous approaches in that it has no undrawable instances of input, allowing it to be used in systems where the output is always required. We also improve the readability of Euler diagrams through the use of Bezier curves and transparent coloured textures. Our approach has been implemented rising the Tulip platform. Both the source and executable program used to generate the results are freely available.", "paper_title": "Fully Automatic Visualisation of Overlapping Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000268217500034"}
