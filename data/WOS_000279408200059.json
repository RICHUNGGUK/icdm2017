This paper highlights its deficiencies when the designer cannot obtain any expert recommendations or guidelines from the computer's program regarding a decision-making process such as material selection. Particular product's development design process, within a well-known enterprise from the white goods industry is presented and supported by a case study. The advantages and disadvantages are set out, and any potential benefits gained from using an intelligent decision support system for plastic products' design are introduced. The proposed decision support system contains human cognition within the field of design knowledge and special domain knowledge expertise regarding plastics supported by design methodology called 'Design for Manufacturing' (DFM).
