This procedure can be used to evaluate integrals over a lower dimensional interface and may be used to evaluate the contribution of singular source terms. This approach produces results that are second-order accurate and robust to the perturbation of the interface location on the grid. Moreover, since we use a cell-wise approach, this procedure can be easily extended to quadtree and octree grids. We demonstrate the second-order accuracy and the robustness of the method in two and three spatial dimensions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
