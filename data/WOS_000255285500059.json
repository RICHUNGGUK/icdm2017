Camera characterization refers to the process of mapping device-dependent signals, such as digital camera RAW images, into a well-defined color space. This is a well-understood process for low dynamic range (LDR) imaging and is part of most digital cameras - usually mapping from the raw camera signal to the sRGB or Adobe RGB color space. This paper presents an efficient and accurate characterization method for high dynamic range imaging that extends previous methods originally designed for LDR imaging. We demonstrate that our characterization method is very accurate even in unknown illumination conditions, effectively turning a digital camera into a measurement device that measures physically accurate radiance values - both in terms of luminance and color - rivaling more expensive measurement instruments.", "paper_title": "Characterization for high dynamic range imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500059"}
