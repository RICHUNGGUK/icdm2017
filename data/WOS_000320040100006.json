Several linear power allocation strategies combined with single-user equalization schemes are compared with a joint pre-filtering with an equal power constraint at the base station and maximal ratio combining at the mobile terminals. Our bit error rate analysis obtained in this paper facilitates predicting the performance of various space-frequency pre-filtering schemes without massive simulations.
