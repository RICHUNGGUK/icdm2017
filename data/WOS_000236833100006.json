Self-adapting numerical software (SANS) systems are intended to meet this significant challenge. The process of arriving at an efficient numerical solution of problems in computational science involves numerous decisions by a numerical expert. Attempts to automate such decisions distinguish three levels: algorithmic decision, management of the parallel environment, and processor-specific tuning. of kernels. Additionally, at any of these levels we can decide to rearrange the users data. In this paper we look at a number of efforts at the University of Tennessee to investigate these areas.", "paper_title": "Self-adapting numerical software (SANS) effort", "paper_id": "WOS:000236833100006"}
