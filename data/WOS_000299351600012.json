Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, has been shown to target histamine-producing cells and to promote anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antiangiogenic effects. Previous experimental work has demonstrated that EGCG has a direct inhibitory effect on both HDC and DDC. In this study, we investigated the binding modes of EGCG to HDC and DDC as a first step for designing new polyphenol-based HDC/DDC-specific inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Structural Perspective on the Direct Inhibition Mechanism of EGCG on Mammalian Histidine Decarboxylase and DOPA Decarboxylasea", "paper_id": "WOS:000299351600012"}
