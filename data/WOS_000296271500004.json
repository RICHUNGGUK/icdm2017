The main issues, affecting the performance of cooperating robotic cells, are discussed with the aid of a case study, where two different scenarios are compared. The first scenario uses a conventional fixture-based configuration of a robotic cell for performing a welding operation, while the second features the use of cooperating robots. The cases are compared with the aid of a simulation platform, and future potential developments are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Industrial applications with cooperating robots for the flexible assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000296271500004"}
