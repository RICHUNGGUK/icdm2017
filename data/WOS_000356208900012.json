Under 100 hours' test, it is shown that the voltage fluctuation of the output signal can be well suppressed by the proposed AC-DC type output module up to the whole 46 stages. The power consumption can be obviously reduced by using the AC-DC type output module compared with the conventional AC-AC type output module. It is measured that the power consumption of one stage for the proposed scan driver with AC-DC type output module at the clock frequency of 16.7 kHz is 170 mu W, as well as 393 mu W for the proposed scan driver with the conventional AC-AC type output module. It is shown from the simulation results that there is a good tradeoff between the power consumption and the rising time for the proposed AC-DC type output module compared with AC-AC type output module and DC-DC type output module.
