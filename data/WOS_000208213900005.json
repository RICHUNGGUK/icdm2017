Power control is an important research topic in WSNs since it can guarantee basic levels of system performance, such as delay, connectivity, and throughput, in the presence or absence of mobility. A large variety of schemes for power control issues in WSNs have been proposed in the literature, whereby different approaches typically focus on different performance metrics. This article provides a classification and presents a comprehensive survey concerning passive and active power control mechanisms in wireless sensor networks, based on this classification.
