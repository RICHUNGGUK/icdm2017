The degree of blurring depends on many factors such as exposure time, stability of the platform, and user experience. Camera shake involves not only translations but also rotations resulting in nonuniform blurring. In this paper, we develop a method that takes input non-uniformly blurred and differently exposed images to extract the deblurred, latent irradiance image. We use transformation spread function (TSF) to effectively model the blur caused by camera motion. We first estimate the TSFs of the blurred images from locally derived point spread functions by exploiting their linear relationship. The scene irradiance is then estimated by minimizing a suitably derived cost functional. Two important cases are investigated wherein 1) only the higher exposures are blurred and 2) all the captured frames are blurred.", "paper_title": "Non-Uniform Deblurring in HDR Image Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200001"}
