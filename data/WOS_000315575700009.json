Several relations in different function forms have been proposed. There are instances when this variety of proposed functions potentially results in one problem having completely dissimilar solutions at the same time. The question then is which function form is the one that can better explain this relationship. In this paper, three major existing quantitative relationships between QoE and QoS are investigated. After conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between them, a new definition of QoE-QoS dependency appears. It then results in identifying a new mutual relationship between QoE and QoS. The newly proposed relationship improves the deficiency of previous QoE-QoS relationships along with solving the problem of diversity of simultaneous solutions for one problem.", "paper_title": "A Generic Quantitative Relationship to Assess Interdependency of QoE and QoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315575700009"}
