The algorithm, suggested by the behaviour of quantum systems, is an example of proficuous cross contamination between classical and quantum computer science. In this survey paper we illustrate how hard combinatorial problems are tackled by quantum computation and present some examples of the heuristics provided by quantum annealing. We also present preliminary results about the application of quantum dissipation (as an alternative to imaginary time evolution) to the task of driving a quantum system toward its state of lowest energy.", "paper_title": "AN INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM ANNEALING", "paper_id": "WOS:000289623800006"}
