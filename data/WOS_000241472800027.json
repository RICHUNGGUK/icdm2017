This model draws on the notion of inflammation and introduces an extensible, sub-symbolic mechanism for modulating high-level behaviour using the notion of artificial inflammation. Preliminary results obtained via simulation are presented and demonstrate the potential benefits of such a scheme. Additionally the system maps the robot's physiological state-space, which is defined in terms of the levels and sources of inflammatory response. This is achieved using Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map algorithm to arrange the states experienced during the lifetime of the robot. The future use of this map for diagnosis and localization of faults and for the generation of specific. high-level remediation behaviour is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Don't touch me, I'm fine: Robot autonomy using an artificial innate immune system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472800027"}
