We present new algorithms that solve this. problem using a combination of convolutions and a dynamic programming procedure. We give randomized and deterministic solutions that run in time O(nk(2) log m) and O(Ok(3) log m), respectively, and are faster than the most efficient extant methods for small values of k. Our deterministic algorithm is the first to obtain an O(polylog(k) . n log m) running time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
