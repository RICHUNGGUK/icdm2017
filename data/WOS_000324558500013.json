While recent progress in simulation and motion captured-based techniques for crowd synthesis has focused on natural macroscale behavior, this paper addresses the complementary problem of synthesizing crowds with realistic microscale behavior and appearance. Example-based synthesis methods such as video textures are an appealing alternative to conventional model-based methods, but current techniques are unable to represent and satisfy constraints between video sprites and the scene. This paper describes how to synthesize crowds by segmenting pedestrians from input videos of natural crowds and optimally placing them into an output video while satisfying environmental constraints imposed by the scene. We introduce crowd tubes, a representation of video objects designed to compose a crowd of video billboards while avoiding collisions between static and dynamic obstacles. The approach consists of representing crowd tube samples and constraint violations with a conflict graph. The maximal independent set yields a dense constraint-satisyfing crowd composition. We present a prototype system for the capture, analysis, synthesis, and control of video-based crowds. Several results demonstrate the system's ability to generate videos of crowds which exhibit a variety of natural behaviors.", "paper_title": "Video-Based Crowd Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324558500013"}
