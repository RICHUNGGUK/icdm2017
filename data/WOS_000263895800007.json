Our goal is to assign a broadcast power f(v) to every vertex v in a graph such that Sigma(v is an element of v) f(v) is minimized, and such that every vertex u with f(u) = 0 Is within distance f(v) of some vertex v with f(v) > 0. The problem is solvable in polynomial time on a general graph (Heggernes and Lokshtanov, Disc Math (2006), 3267-3280) and Blair et al. (Congr. Num. (2004), 55-77.) gave an O(n(2)) algorithm for trees. In this article, we provide an O(n) algorithm for trees. Our algorithm is notable due to the fact that it makes decisions for each vertex v based on \"nonlocal\" information from vertices far away from v, whereas almost all other linear-time algorithms for trees only make use of local information.
