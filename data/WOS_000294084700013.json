In order to detect exceptions effectively, exception monitoring requires proper understanding of the possible exceptions. However, the extant exception monitoring approaches or systems still lack sufficient emphasis in exceptions understanding. This paper presents a novel outbound logistics exception monitoring approach by incorporating multi-perspective ontologies and intelligent agents. Specially, the multi-perspective ontologies, involving static ontology, social ontology and dynamic ontology, are firstly employed to develop the taxonomy of the logistics exception, to reflect the situation dependencies of logistics exception and to represent the dynamic nature of business processes. From this point forwards, an outbound exception monitoring system is designed by introducing multi-intelligent agents, which can ensure autonomous, flexible, and collaborative exception monitor in logistics service. Finally, the presented approach and designed system are exhibited through a case study of two ubiquitous logistics exceptions, which indicates that the proposed multi-perspective ontologies provide better understanding of exceptions thereby enabling the designed outbound exception monitoring system to perform well.
