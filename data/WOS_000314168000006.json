A type of coefficient sensitivity performance measure is first developed tomeasure the sensitivity of the transfer function with respect to controller coefficient variations, and the corresponding controller design problem is naturally reformulated as a mixed-objective H 8 control problem. It is worth mentioning that a novel bounded real lemma (BRL), i.e. Theorem 1 in this article, for delta operator systems is obtained, which is adapted to deal with the multi-objective optimisation problem or polytopic uncertain systems in a potentially less conservative framework. Then, based on the novel lemma, an linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based design method is proposed for achieving the output tracking purpose. Finally, a numerical example based on the linearised model of F-18 aircraft is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H infinity output tracking control for delta operator systems with insensitivity to controller coefficient variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000314168000006"}
