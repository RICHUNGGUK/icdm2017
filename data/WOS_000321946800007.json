The parametrization preserves areas up to a constant factor and is thus very useful in the context of rendering as it allows to map random sample point sets in [0, 1](2) onto the spherical rectangle. This allows for easily incorporating stratified, quasi-Monte Carlo or other sampling strategies in algorithms that compute scattering from planar rectangular emitters.", "paper_title": "An Area-Preserving Parametrization for Spherical Rectangles", "paper_id": "WOS:000321946800007"}
