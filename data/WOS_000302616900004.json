The first stage of the research involved studying various forms of building facades, including rectangular and angular as well as concave and convex shapes. For the second stage, concave facades were selected, as they had been shown to generate the highest luminance values. This detailed examination of concave facades includes a mathematical analysis of the caustic curve and the formulation of geometrical conditions for its formation with supporting, custom-made software. In conclusion, this study suggests how designers can either avoid caustic curve formation or how to predict its precise position in the building's surroundings.", "paper_title": "The Influence of Reflected Solar Glare Caused by the Glass Cladding of a Building: Application of Caustic Curve Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302616900004"}
