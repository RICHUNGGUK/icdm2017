Despite its effectiveness (i.e. without heavy computational overheads) in ensuring a message can only be read when all the designated parties are available, this is an under-researched topic (there are only two published MDE schemes in the literature, to the best of our knowledge). In this paper, we propose an efficient MDE scheme and prove its CCA2 security in the standard model under the decisional bilinear Diffie Hellman assumption.", "paper_title": "A CCA2-Secure Multi-Decrypter Encryption Scheme Without Random Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000363225700011"}
