The methodology makes it possible to extract key molecular features from very few known active compounds and classify molecules according to different potency levels. The approach was developed in light of the situation often faced during the early stages of lead optimization efforts: too few active reference molecules are available to build computational models for the prediction of potent compounds. The ECP method generates high-resolution signatures of active compounds. Predictive ECP models can be built based on the information provided by sets of only three molecules with potency in the nanomolar and micromolar range. In addition to individual compound predictions, an iterative ECP scheme has been designed. When applied to different sets of active molecules, iterative ECP classification produced compound selection sets with increases in average potency of up to 3 orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Emerging chemical patterns: A new methodology for molecular classification and compound selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242298100029"}
