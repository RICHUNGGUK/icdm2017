In this paper, we introduce a new bidirectional hetero-associative memory model for true-color patterns that uses the associative model with dynamical synapses recently introduced in Vazquez and Sossa (Neural Process Lett, Submitted, 2008). Synapses of the associative memory could be adjusted even after the training phase as a response to an input stimulus. Propositions that guarantee perfect and robust recall of the fundamental set of associations are provided. In addition, we describe the behavior of the proposed associative model under noisy versions of the patterns. At last, we present some experiments aimed to show the accuracy of the proposed model with a benchmark of true-color patterns.", "paper_title": "A Bidirectional Hetero-Associative Memory for True-Color Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000260839000001"}
