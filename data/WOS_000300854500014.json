Under assumption that all the controllers share their prior information about the subsystem reference models, the interconnections between subsystems are relaxed to arbitrarily strong nonlinearities without matching conditions. The assumption on input gains is extended from typical positive constants to highly nonlinear functions. The feedback and adaptation mechanisms require neither the typical observation error filtering nor the famous strictly positive-real condition. Based on Lyapunov's direct method, the tracking errors of the closed-loop large-scale system are guaranteed to converge to tunable neighbourhoods of the origin. The proposed algorithm is applied to controlling two mechanical large-scale systems and simulation results substantiate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Decentralised direct adaptive output feedback fuzzy controller for a class of large-scale nonaffine nonlinear systems and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300854500014"}
