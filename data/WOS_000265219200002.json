The first example, hard-particle molecular dynamics, is well known. We also present a recently developed diffusion kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, as well as a novel stochastic molecular-dynamics algorithm that builds on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo. We explain how to effectively combine asynchronous event-driven with classical time-driven or with synchronous event-driven handling. Finally, we discuss some promises and challenges for event-driven simulation of realistic physical systems.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous Event-Driven Particle Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000265219200002"}
