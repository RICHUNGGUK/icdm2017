Employing Schauder fixed point theorem, we obtain some novel sufficient conditions ensuring the existence as well as the global convergence of the periodic solution. Our results are new and improve some previously known results since these results are based on integral average values of the coefficients. The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
