It is especially difficult to change ECU suppliers or reuse the software in a new generation of products. Increasing functional requirements in automotive E/E vehicle development will significantly enhance the integration of novel functions. In order to satisfy the increasing requirements for the complex software development of automotive E/E system, implement the portability of application software modules and compatibility of ECU modules among different automotive OEMs and their suppliers, this paper presents an open design rnethodology based on quantum platform. An open architecture of automotive E/E system based quantum platform is established. Its principle and structures are described in detail. Finally, an automated mechanical transmission (AMT) system as a typical case is used to demonstrate the design process based on the proposed method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
