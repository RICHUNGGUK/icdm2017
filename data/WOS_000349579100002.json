To address this issue, in the paper we propose a recommendation approach stemming from collaborative filtering. We claim that the whole sequence of queries belonging to an OLAP session is valuable because it gives the user a compound and synergic view of data; for this reason, our goal is not to recommend single OLAP queries but OLAP sessions. Like other collaborative approaches, ours features three phases: (i) search the log for sessions that bear some similarity with the one currently being issued by the user; (ii) extract the most relevant subsessions; and (iii) adapt the top-ranked subsession to the current user's session. However, it is the first that treats sessions as first-class citizens, using new techniques for comparing sessions, finding meaningful recommendation candidates, and adapting them to the current session. After describing our approach, we discuss the results of a large set of effectiveness and efficiency tests based on different measures of recommendation quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
