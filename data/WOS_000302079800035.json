This result is an answer of a question raised by C. Ding and T. Feng in [2]. We also present another series of codebooks which nearly meet the Welch bound, where the codebook is constructed by a subset D-epsilon in additive group R = F-q1 circle plus F-q2. When q(1) = q(2), D-epsilon is an almost difference set of R.", "paper_title": "Two Classes of Codebooks Nearly Meeting the Welch Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800035"}
