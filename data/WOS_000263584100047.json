This paper proposes a hybrid approach on ensuring the competitiveness requirements for major Turkish container ports by utilizing fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodologies to manage strategic decision-making with incomplete information. The outcomes of the quantitative models are utilized as data input for SWOT analysis that provide additional contributions for identifying the development strategies on container ports. The proposed strategies on Turkish container ports can be originally recommended as guidelines both for port administrations and new enterprises in Turkish maritime industry. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
