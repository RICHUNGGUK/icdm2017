While BCI research endeavors to create new communication channels for severely handicapped people using their brain signals, recent efforts also have been focused on developing potential applications in rehabilitation, multimedia communication, virtual reality, and entertainment and relaxation. To attain high-quality brain data and, thus, a reliable BCI system, we first need to create the stimulus conditions or mental task setting that will generate maximally measurable and classifiable brain states.", "paper_title": "Noninvasive BCIs: Multiway Signal-Processing Array Decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259922300015"}
