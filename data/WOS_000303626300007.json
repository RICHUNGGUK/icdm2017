The changes of composite service mainly cover three types, i.e., the processes, bindings, and interfaces. In this article, an approach is proposed to select test cases for regression testing of different versions of BPEL (business process execution language) composite service where these changes are involved. The approach identifies the changes by performing control flow analysis and comparing the paths in a new version of composite service with those in the old one using a kind of eXtensible BPEL flow graph (XBFG). Message sequence is appended to XBFG path so that XBFG can fully describe the behavior of composite service. The binding and predicate constraint information added in different XBFG elements can be used for path selection and even for test case generation. Both theoretic analysis and case study show that the proposed approach is effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
