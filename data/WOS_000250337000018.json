Multi-step analysis of high-dimensional data requires an integrated suite of bioinformatic tools. In this paper we detail an analysis pipeline for array CGH data. Methods: We developed an analysis tool for array CGH data which supports single and multi-chip analyses as well as combined analyses with paired mRNA gene expression data. The functions supporting relevant steps of analysis were implemented using the open source software R and combined as package aCGHPipeline. Analysis methods were illustrated using 189 CGH arrays of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Results: The package covers data input, quality control, normalization, segmentation and classification. For multi-chip analysis aCGH Pipeline offers an algorithm for automatic delineation of recurrent regions. This task was performed manually up to now. The package also supports combined analysis with mRNA gene expression data. Outputs consist of HTML documents to facilitate communication with clinical partners. Conclusions: The R package aCGH Pipeline supports basic tasks of single and multi-chip analysis of array CGH data.", "paper_title": "Development and implementation of an analysis tool for array-based comparative genomic hybridization", "paper_id": "WOS:000250337000018"}
