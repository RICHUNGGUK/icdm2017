When contrasting challenge tests are used, various forms of adaptability can be tested and this gives a multidimensional view on the health of these individuals. Here we introduce a methodology to describe the similarities and differences on how individuals are positioned in the health space based on the responses to different challenge tests. Results show that anabolic and catabolic challenges differentiate healthy subjects in rather different ways. Considering these results we hypothesize that combining challenge tests can improve the understanding of the underlying multidimensional phenotype. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
