We decompose an asset management system into atomic or composite business processes (BPs). Triggered by RFID events, the business events are invoked automatically. Data gathering from RFID receivers are used to fill in required parameters specified in the descriptions of the BPs. The main idea behind the framework is a separation of business logic from sensor technologies for gathering data. This separation allows changes of BPs without effects on gathering sensor data and vice versa. We evaluate our approach through the development of a system for asset management called CSCE-AMS which can be thought of as an instance of RADIO-MAMA. The framework facilitates the rapid development and extension of sensor based systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
