We model web service behaviours and the contracts governing them as WSBPEL specification. We use the formalism of temporal-epistemic logic, suitably extended to deal with compliance/violations of contracts, to specify properties of service compositions. We compile the WSBPEL behaviours into a specialised system description language ISPL, to be used with the model checker MCMAS to verify the behaviours automatically. We illustrate these concepts using a motivating example whose state space is approximately 10(6) and discuss experimental results.", "paper_title": "Towards verifying contract regulated service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000299514900001"}
