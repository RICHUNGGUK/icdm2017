Weber's law states that the ratio of the increment threshold to the background intensity is constant. Inspired by Weber's law (WL), in this paper, a novel image de-noising method, named \"Weber's law Noise Identifier\" (WLNI), is proposed. By applying WLNI to a corrupted image, we can identify 100% of the impulse noise. For noise removal, we propose two methods to replace pixels classified as noise pixels. Experimental results show that our proposed WLNI cannot only efficiently identify the impulse noise, but can also preserve the detailed information of an image relative to existing methods more efficiently.
