In such dynamic settings, traditional information management systems fail to provide adequate support due to their inflexible data structures and hard-wired usage procedures, as well as their restricted ability to integrate process and product information. In this paper, we advocate the idea of Process Data Warehousing as a means to provide a knowledge management and integration platform for such design processes. The key idea behind our approach is a flexible ontology-based schema with formally defined semantics that enables the capture and reuse of design experience, supported by advanced computer science methods.
