We improve on recent results by giving a 2-approximation algorithm for the feedback vertex set problem. We show that this result is the best that we can attain when using optimal solutions to a certain linear program as a lower bound on the optimal value. For the feedback arc set problem on bipartite tournaments, we show that a recent 4-approximation algorithm proposed by Gupta (2008) [8] is incorrect. We give an alternative 4-approximation algorithm based on an algorithm for the feedback arc set on (non-bipartite) tournaments given by van Zuylen and Williamson (2009) [14]. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
