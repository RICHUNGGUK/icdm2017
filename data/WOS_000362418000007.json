To facilitate the development, the dynamic model of the quadrotor is firstly presented. Then the boundary value problem is mathematically formulated based on the optimal control theory. According to the problem formulation and utilizing the subspace stabilization approach, the control strategy is proposed to suppress the state-trajectory tracking errors and manipulate the quadrotor from a known initial state to the desired final state in a finite time horizon. As there exist input delays in real-time flights, the Smith predictor is designed to enhance the performance of the developed control strategy. Finally, an indoor experimental platform of the quadrotor is built and real-time experiments of the ball-batting is conducted with a coefficient of restitution of approximate 0.7 and a racket with diameter of 0.13 m. The experimental results show that the quadrotor can well establish the desired final state and bat the ball towards its target location (the deviation of position is less than 0.15 m), which verify the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Solving the Boundary Value Problem of an Under-Actuated Quadrotor with Subspace Stabilization Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000362418000007"}
