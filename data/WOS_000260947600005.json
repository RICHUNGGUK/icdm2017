In order to detect and eliminate illumination effect, a wavelet-based face recognition method is proposed in this paper. in this work, the effect of illuminations is effectively reduced by wavelet-based denoising techniques, and meanwhile the multiscale facial structure is generated. Among others, the proposed method has the following advantages: (1) it can be directly applied to single face image, without any prior information of 3D shape or light sources, nor' many training samples: (2) due to the multiscale nature of wavelet transform, it has better edge-preserving ability in low frequency illumination fields; and (3) the parameter selection process is computationally feasible and fast. Experiments are carried out upon the Yale B and CMU PIE face databases, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory recognition rates under varying illumination conditions.
