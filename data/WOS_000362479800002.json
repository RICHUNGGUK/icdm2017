With an increasing popularity of social tagging systems, it becomes urgent to model recommendations on users, items, and tags in a unified way. In this paper, we propose a framework for studying recommender systems by modeling user preferences as a relation on (user, item, tag) triples. We discuss tag-aware recommender systems from two aspects. On the one hand, we compute associations between users and items related to tags by using an adaptive method and recommend tags to users or predict item properties for users. On the other hand, by taking the similarity-based recommendation as a case study, we discuss similarity measures from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives and k-nearest neighbors and reverse k-nearest neighbors for recommendations.", "paper_title": "Modeling Tag-Aware Recommendations Based on User Preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000362479800002"}
