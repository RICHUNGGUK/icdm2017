In contrast to current practices of \"greedy\" combination of all available features, six features are suggested according to the human intuition for translation quality. Then the contribution of linguistic features is examined and analyzed via a hill-climbing strategy. Experiments indicate that, compared to either the SVM-ranking model or the previous attempts on exhaustive linguistic features, the regression SVM model with six linguistic information based features generalizes across different datasets better, and augmenting these linguistic features with proper non-linguistic metrics can achieve additional improvements.", "paper_title": "Improvement of Machine Translation Evaluation by Simple Linguistically Motivated Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000286866900007"}
