The 3-D structure of none of the beta 3GalTs is known to date. In this study, the 3-D structures of human beta 3Ga1T I, II, IV, V. VI and beta 3GalNAcT1 have been modeled using fold-recognition and comparative modeling methods. Residues that constitute the UDP-Gal binding site have been predicted. The models are able to qualitatively rationalize data from the site-directed mutagenesis experiments reported in the literature. Residues likely to be involved in conferring differential acceptor substrate specificity have been predicted by a combination of specificity determining positions prediction (SDPs) and subsequent mapping on the generated 3-D models.
