The algorithm operates within a multiscale framework, thus taking advantage of the fact that objects/regions to be segmented usually reside at different scales. At each scale segmentation is carried out via the expectation-maximization algorithm, coupled with anisotropic diffusion on classes, in order to account for the spatial dependencies among pixels. This new approach is validated via experiments on a variety of medical images and its performance is compared with more standard methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
