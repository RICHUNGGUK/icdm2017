Equivalently, Z is the limit of a Markov chain driven by that map. We give an algorithm that can be automated under the condition that we have a source capable of generating independent copies of Y, and that V has a density that can be evaluated in a black-box format. The method uses a doubling trick for inducing coalescence in coupling from the past. Applications include exact samplers for many Dirichlet means, some two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet means, and a host of other distributions related to occupation times of Bessel bridges that can be described by stochastic fixed point equations.", "paper_title": "The Double CFTP Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000287307300002"}
