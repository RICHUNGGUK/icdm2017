We observe that the force of infection and the predation rate play important roles in maintaining stability around the positive steady state. We also observe that proper predation may even result in the extinction of the infective migratory prey population from the system.", "paper_title": "Role of migratory bird population in a simple eco-epidemiological model", "paper_id": "WOS:000244667500006"}
