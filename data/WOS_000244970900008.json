In this paper, a bidirectional associative memory NN with four neurons and multiple delays is considered. By applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem, analysis of its linear stability and Hopf bifurcation is performed. An algorithm is worked out for determining the direction and stability of the bifurcated periodic solutions. Numerical simulation results supporting the theoretical analysis are also given.", "paper_title": "Stability and Hopf bifurcation in a simplified BAM neural network with two time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900008"}
