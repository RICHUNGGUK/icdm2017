Its main objective is to group similar objects into the same cluster, while dissimilar objects should belong to different clusters. In particular k-means clustering, as member of the partitioning clustering family, has obtained great popularity. The classic (hard) k-means assigns an object unambiguously to one and only one cluster. To address uncertainty soft clustering has been introduced using concepts like fuzziness, possibility or roughness. A decade ago Lingras and West introduced a k-means approach based on the interval interpretation of rough sets theory. In the past years their rough k-means has gained increasing attention. In our paper, we propose a refined rough k-means algorithm that utilizes Laplace's principle of indifference to calculate the means. As we will discuss this provides a sounder justification for the impacts of the objects in the approximations in comparison to established rough k-means algorithms. Furthermore, the weighting in the mean function is based on individual objects rather than on aggregated sub-means. In experiments, we compare the refined algorithm to related approaches.
