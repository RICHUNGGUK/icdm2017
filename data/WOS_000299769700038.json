Single pteridine-2,4(1 H,3 H)-dithione and dimethylformamide molecules are packed via N-H center dot center dot center dot O and N-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds into centrosymmetric clusters containing two molecules of each class; these are roughly planar and placed into two different sets of planes -both containing the [-1,0,2] direction- mutually angled by 77.8A degrees. Despite the distance between two neighbor planes in each set is ca. 3.4 , the analysis of pi,pi-stacking interactions shows too large slippage distance between aromatic rings from contiguous planes. Additional sigma-pi interactions between S2, S4 and O1S atoms and pyrazine or pyrimidine rings from adjacent molecules are present. The structure for the cluster [DTLM-DMF](2) has been simulated by using the density functionals B1B95 (6-31 G(d) and 6-31+G(d) basis sets) and M06-2X (6-31 G(d) basis set). As a result, the M06-2X/6-31 G(d) approach provides the best agreement with the experimental XRD data. For a better evaluation of the intermolecular interactions, the superposition of two dimeric adducts [DTLM-DMF](2) has been modelized. The binding capability of DTLM ligand was simulated on systems containing two metal-binding modes to palladium (N5-S4 and N1-S2) with different chelate size. The analysis of the frontier orbitals points out that the link with the metallic centers will take place through the sulfur atoms.", "paper_title": "XRD and DFT-modelized structures of a pteridine-2,4(1H,3H)-dithione/N,N '-dimethylformamide H-bonded cluster (2:2).
