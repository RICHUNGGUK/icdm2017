That is, do the strings differ on at most a bits? Let 0 <= a <= n - 1. We show (1) any deterministic protocol-as well as any error-free quantum protocol (C* version)-for this problem requires at least n-2 bits of communication, and (2) a lower bound of n/2 - 1 for error-free Q* quantum protocols. We also show the same results for determining if two strings differ in exactly a bits. Our results are obtained by lower-bounding the ranks of the appropriate matrices.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds on the Deterministic and Quantum Communication Complexity of Hamming-Distance Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361246100001"}
