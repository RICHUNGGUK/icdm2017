We consider the following question: what is the maximum achievable data rate that such a network can support for communication from an arbitrary radio node to its destination under transmission power and network-topology constraints, as the network size goes to infinity? In other words, we study the data-rate guarantee for an arbitrarily chosen source-destination pair assuming all other nodes act as relays. We consider two types of network deployments: (1) a regular deployment with unreliable nodes; and (2) a random deployment. We provide upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic achievable data rate for both linear and planar topologies under the two deployment models. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
