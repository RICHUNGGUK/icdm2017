Finding shape-restricted estimates may require solving a difficult optimization problem, however, making these advantages hard to realize. A particle swarm algorithm is proposed to overcome this barrier and expand the possibilities for shape-constrained estimation. The algorithm uses a cooperative search strategy with two swarms, one focused on global exploration and one focused on local exploitation. The new heuristic has the added advantage of being a general tool, applicable without modification to a variety of estimators, constraints, and objective functions. The algorithm is demonstrated on a number of density estimation and regression problems, and the potential for further improvement is discussed. Supplementary materials, including source code, are available online. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
