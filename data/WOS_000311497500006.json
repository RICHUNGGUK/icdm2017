We adopt a process view of impulsivity, and recorded the detailed information search patterns of consumers using an eye-tracker methodology. The results show that incidental moods tend to increase process impulsivity, and this effect may not be restrained by involvement. We also demonstrate that the decision-making process can be separated into two stages - orientation and evaluation. We further find that differences in impulsivity are most evident in the evaluation stage. These results suggest the importance of mood-elicited impulsivity of purchases in e-commerce.
