To comply with the traditional energy efficiency formula under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge available, this new metric is designed on the fractional relation between the effective throughput and the total power consumed at the transmitter. Mathematical proofs are presented to confirm such compliance in terms of the impact of the channel coefficients on the energy efficiency performance. In order to prove the property, this letter also presents profound insight into the monotonicity of the non-centralized chi-squared distribution.", "paper_title": "New Energy Efficiency Metric With Imperfect Channel Considerations for OFDMA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600007"}
