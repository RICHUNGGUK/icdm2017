In order to overcome this problem the authors propose a method based on signed differencing and connectivity analysis. The proposal is suitable to applications which cannot afford the un-avoidable errors of background modeling or the limitations of 3-frames preprocessing.", "paper_title": "Foreground-to-ghost discrimination in single-difference pre-processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100024"}
