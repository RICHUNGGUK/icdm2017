The analysis is made possible by modeling the system as a particular instance of a high dimensional multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channel. The secrecy capacity is formulated as a maximization problem under a trace constraint, and simple expressions are given for its high signal-to-noise (SNR) limit. The low rate limit of the secrecy outage probability is also evaluated under a fading channel model. As for the finite SNR case, the secrecy rates that can be achieved with particular inputs are considered. Numerical results are provided under a Rayleigh fading channel model and under dependence of the main and eavesdropper channels. The secrecy loss due to the OFDM structure constraints, and the information gain for an eavesdropper that uses amore complex receiver, are also considered.", "paper_title": "Physical-Layer Secrecy for OFDM Transmissions Over Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000306520900021"}
