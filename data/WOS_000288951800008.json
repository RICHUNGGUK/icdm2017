It is assumed that the blood flow is laminar and that the Navier-Stokes equations of motion are applied. Downstream of the bifurcation, a strong skewing occurs towards the flow divider walls as a result of branching. For the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) transport analysis where a specific boundary condition at the arterial walls is applied, LDL is generally elevated at locations where shear stress distribution is low, but it does not co-locate at whole domain. This numerical simulation gives an insight, as well as detailed quantitative data, of haemodynamic conditions in the left coronary artery as well as mass transfer patterns for a specific patient.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of the flow field and mass transport pattern within the coronary artery", "paper_id": "WOS:000288951800008"}
