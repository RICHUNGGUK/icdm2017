We build a model of the pure lambda-calculus in this setting and show how to interpret a probabilistic version of the functional language PCF. We give a probabilistic interpretation of the semantics of probabilistic PCF closed terms of ground type. Last we suggest a generalization of this approach, using Banach spaces.
