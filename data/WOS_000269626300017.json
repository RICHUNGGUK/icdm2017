While many routing protocols have been proposed for MANETs based on different criteria, few have considered the impact of multi-rate communication capability that is supported by many current WLAN products. Given a routing path, this paper provides an analytic tool to evaluate the expected throughput of the route with spectral reuse, assuming that hosts move following the discrete-time, random-walk model. The derived result can be added as another metric for route selection. Simulation results show that the proposed formulation can be used to evaluate path throughput accurately.", "paper_title": "Route Throughput Analysis with Spectral Reuse for Multi-Rate Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269626300017"}
