In order to develop an adapted WBLS, this study also proposes a design model for system designers to tailor the preferences linked with each cognitive style. The samples comprise 105 third-grade Accounting Information System course students from a technology university in central Taiwan. Analytical results demonstrate that learners with different cognitive styles have similar but linear learning approaches, and learners with different cognitive styles adopt different navigation tools to process learning.
