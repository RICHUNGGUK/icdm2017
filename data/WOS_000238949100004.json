It highlights several issues related to knowledge reuse, including the collection, distillation and dissemination of knowledge, the role of subject experts in the knowledge reuse process and how technology facilitates knowledge reuse. For practitioners, this paper offers an inspiring exemplar of knowledge reuse success. For researchers, existing theoretical grounds for knowledge reuse have been opened for further debate.", "paper_title": "Review - Knowledge reuse in action: the case of CALL", "paper_id": "WOS:000238949100004"}
