That is, the online player must make an investment decision while neither future demand for orders nor future investment opportunities are known. This problem which generalizes the basic leasing problem has been introduced by Azar et al., and then two special cases have been studied by Damaschke. In the so-called equal prices model a 2-competitive algorithm is devised and a 1.618 lower bound is given. Here we make use of an averaging technique and obtain a better tight lower bound of 2, in other words, this lower bound cannot be improved. Furthermore, another special case which only considers two-stage device replacement is studied in this paper. Accounting for the interest rate is an essential feature of any reasonable financial model. Therefore, we explore the two-stage model with and without the interest rate respectively. In addition, we introduce the risk-reward model to analyze this problem and improve the competitive ratio performance.", "paper_title": "Competitive analysis of two special online device replacement problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254050000005"}
