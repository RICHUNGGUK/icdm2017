PARAFAC analysis of the EEM structures identifies three components corresponding to two different-sized CDs with the Hg(II) and pH profiles highly correlated plus a background. Parallel profiles with Linear Dependences (PARALIND) model with three components in the excitation-emission spectral modes and two components in the Hg(II) or pH mode gave similar results as PARAFAC, but is more useful from a theoretical point of view because PARALIND shows that the two different-sized CDs have similar chemical reactivity toward Hg(II) and pH. PARAFAC2 was used as a trilinear confirmatory test of the data structures under analysis.
