In this paper, we present Web performance prediction in time and in space by making a forecast of a Web resource downloading using the Turning Bands (TB) geostatistical simulation method. Real-life data for the research were obtained in an active experiment conducted by our multi-agent measurement system MWING performing monitoring of a group of Web servers worldwide from agents localized in different geographical localizations in Poland. The results show good quality of Web performance prediction made by means of the TB method, especially in the case when European Web servers were monitored by an MWING agent localized in Gliwice, Poland.", "paper_title": "Distributed Web Systems Performance Forecasting Using Turning Bands Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600027"}
