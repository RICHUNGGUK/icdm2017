For this reason the set of issues encompassed by the term quality of experience (QoE), i.e., the quality perceived subjectively by the end-user, is key to Internet service providers, network and software engineers, developers and scientists. From the technical point of view, to assure a high level of QoE, an appropriate level of quality of service (QoS), grade of service (GoS), and quality of resilience (QoR) must be provisioned by the network involved in service delivery. This paper studies QoE provisioning approaches with respect to the following convergence requirements: any service, anywhere, anytime, any user device, any media and networking technology, and by any operator. Challenges related to QoS, GoS and QoR provisioning in converged networks and implications on QoE provisioning are discussed. Convergence between fixed and wireless networks as well as within wireless networks based on different technologies, are considered. A variety of technologies and concepts for future converged networks are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
