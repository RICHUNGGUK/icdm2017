The criteria weights are represented by interval numbers and criteria values by triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The proposed approach does not need to utilize the theories such as arithmetic operations for Triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, for it can remove the influence of the limitations existed in the arithmetic operations. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the rationality and utility of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
