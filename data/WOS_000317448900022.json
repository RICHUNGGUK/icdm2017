Traditionally, the output of a group ranking problem can be classified into ranking lists and maximum consensus sequences. In this study, we propose a consensus preference graph approach to represent the coherent aggregated results of users' preferences. The advantages of our approach are that (1) the graph is built based on users' consensuses, (2) the graph can be understood intuitively, and (3) the relationships between items can be easily seen. An algorithm is developed to construct the consensus preference graph from users' total ranking data. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out using synthetic and real data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and can effectively identify consensus graphs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
