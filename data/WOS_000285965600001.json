Assuming that discordance is caused by incomplete lineage sorting, species tree estimates can be obtained by finding those species trees that minimize the number of \"deep'' coalescence events required for a given collection of gene trees. Efficient algorithms now exist for applying the minimizing-deep-coalescence (MDC) criterion, and simulation experiments have demonstrated its promising performance. However, it has also been noted from simulation results that the MDC criterion is not always guaranteed to infer the correct species tree estimate. In this article, we investigate the consistency of the MDC criterion. Using the multipscies coalescent model, we show that there are indeed anomaly zones for the MDC criterion for asymmetric four-taxon species tree topologies, and for all species tree topologies with five or more taxa.", "paper_title": "Consistency Properties of Species Tree Inference by Minimizing Deep Coalescences", "paper_id": "WOS:000285965600001"}
