Lots of efforts have been devoted to make network infrastructure and network protocols power-aware and green. Among these efforts, Adaptive Link Rate (ALR) is one of the most widely discussed approaches. This survey highlights the most recent ALR approaches with a brief taxonomy and the state of the art.", "paper_title": "A survey on Green communications using Adaptive Link Rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000322775400019"}
