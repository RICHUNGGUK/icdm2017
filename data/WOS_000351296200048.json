The vendor confronts two constraints: number of orders and available budget. In this model, the fuzzy demand is formulated using trapezoidal fuzzy number (TrFN) where the centroid defuzzification method is employed to defuzzify fuzzy output functions. Minimizing both the total inventory cost and the warehouse space are the two objectives of the model. Since the proposed model is formulated into a bi-objective integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed to find Pareto front solutions. Besides, since there is no benchmark available in the literature to validate the solutions obtained, another MOEA, namely the non-dominated ranking genetic algorithms (NRGA), is developed to solve the problem as well. To improve the performances of both algorithms, their parameters are calibrated using the Taguchi method. Finally, conclusions are made and future research works are recommended.
