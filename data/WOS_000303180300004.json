For a given order sigma and balanced shift s the first algorithm determines an order basis with a cost of O-similar to (n(omega) [m sigma / n]) field operations in K, where omega is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Here an input shift is balanced when max((s) over bar) - min((s) over bar) is an element of O(m sigma / n). This extends the earlier work of Storjohann which only determines a subset of an order basis that is within a specified degree bound delta using O-similar to(n(omega)delta) field operations for delta >= [m sigma / n]. While the first algorithm addresses the case when the column degrees of a complete order basis are unbalanced given a balanced input shift, it is not efficient in the case when an unbalanced shift results in the row degrees also becoming unbalanced. We present a second algorithm which balances the high degree rows and computes an order basis also using O-similar to(n(omega)[m sigma / n]) field operations in the case that the shift is unbalanced but satisfies the condition Sigma(n)(i=1)(max((s) over bar) - (s) over bar) <= m sigma. This condition essentially allows us to locate those high degree rows that need to be balanced. This extends the earlier work by the authors from ISSAC'09. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
