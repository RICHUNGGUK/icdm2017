Necessary and sufficient conditions for such a comparison are derived. Due to the special nature of the introduced binary relation, a criterion may be formulated in terms of an inclusion of polyhedral sets. Then, algebraic and geometric forms are easily obtained from Haar's Lemma. Our results allow us to discuss some earlier results on the stochastic comparison of functions of Markov chains.", "paper_title": "Positive invariance of polyhedrons and comparison of Markov reward models with different state spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400020"}
