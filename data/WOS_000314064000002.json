We study the problem of energy-constrained dynamic allocation of tasks to a heterogeneous cluster computing environment. Our goal is to complete as many tasks by their individual deadlines and within the system energy constraint as possible given that task execution times are uncertain and the system is oversubscribed at times. We use Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to balance the energy consumption and execution time of each task. We design and evaluate (via simulation) a set of heuristics and filtering mechanisms for making allocations in our system. We show that the appropriate choice of filtering mechanisms improves performance more than the choice of heuristic (among the heuristics we tested).", "paper_title": "Deadline and energy constrained dynamic resource allocation in a heterogeneous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000314064000002"}
