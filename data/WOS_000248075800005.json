The descriptions of human body features mostly defined in ASTM (1999) and ISO (1989) are interpreted into logical mathematical definitions. Using these significant definitions, we employ image processing and computational geometry techniques to identify, automatically, body features from the torso cloud points. We have currently extracted 21 feature points and 35 feature lines on the human torso; this number may be extended if necessary. Moreover, less than 2 min processing time is taken for body feature extraction starting from the raw point cloud. This algorithm is successfully tested on several Asian female adults who are aged from 18 to 60. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
