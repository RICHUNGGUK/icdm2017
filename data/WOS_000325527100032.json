The main focus of the paper is the definition and preservation of coordinate invariant local bounds for velocity vector and development of momentum remapping method such that the radial symmetry of the radially symmetric flows is preserved when remapping from one equiangular polar mesh to another. The properties of this new method are demonstrated on a set of selected numerical cyclic remapping tests and a full hydrodynamic example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
