Osher, A. Sole, L. Vese, Image decomposition and restoration using total variation minimization and the H-1 norm, SIAM Journal on Multiscale Modeling and Simulation 1 (3) (2003) 349-370]. By the regularization method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions to the system with BV initial data and Neumann boundary conditions. Finally, we also give an experimental approach to show the efficiency of this kind of model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
