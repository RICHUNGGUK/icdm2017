Major elements of this project were components of the first author's experience in an operational production organization, including the work to transform industrial practice into opportunities for new research. A critical aspect of information alignment, as developed in this framework, is the recognition that computer-based information systems must be implemented with an eye to effective integration with other forms of information exchange and production knowledge in the organization.", "paper_title": "Improving computer-mediated information alignment in production organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000286115600009"}
