The widely used conventional fuzzy c-means for medical image segmentations has limitations because of its squared-norm distance measure to measure the similarity between centers and data objects of medical images which are corrupted by heavy noise, outliers, and other imaging artifacts. To overcome the limitations this paper develops a novel objective function based standard objective function of fuzzy c-means that incorporates the robust kernel-induced distance for clustering the corrupted dataset of breast and brain medical images. By minimizing the novel objective function this paper obtains effective equation for optimal cluster centers and equation to achieve optimal membership grades for partitioning the given dataset. In order to solve the problems of clustering performance affected by initial centers of clusters, this paper introduces a specialized center initialization method for executing the proposed algorithm in segmenting medical images. Experiments are performed with synthetic, real breast and brain images to assess the performance of the proposed method. Further the validity of clustering results is obtained using silhouette method and this paper compares the results with the results of other recent reported fuzzy c-means methods. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed clustering results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
