In the few numerical studies carried out in this field, the definition and distribution of the hydrogel in the infarcted myocardium were simplified. In this computational study, a more realistic biomaterial distribution was simulated after which the effect on cardiac function and mechanics was studied. A validated finite element heart model was used in which an antero-apical infarct was defined. Four infarct models were created representing different temporal phases in the progression of a MI. Hydrogel layers were simulated in the infarcted myocardium in each model. Biomechanical and functional improvement of the LV was found after hydrogel inclusion in the ischaemic models representing the early phases of MI. In contrast, only functional but no mechanical restitution was shown in the scar model due to hydrogel presence.", "paper_title": "The effect of hydrogel injection on cardiac function and myocardial mechanics in a computational post-infarction model", "paper_id": "WOS:000326070800007"}
