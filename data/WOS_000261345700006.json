Equational reasoning in such fields is greatly simplified but in deriving a term one still wishes to know whether or not the calculation has invoked 0(-1). If it has not then we call the derivation division safe. We propose three methods of guaranteeing division safe calculations in 0-totalised fields.", "paper_title": "Division Safe Calculation in Totalised Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000261345700006"}
