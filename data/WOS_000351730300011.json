In an analogy to thermostatistics, to describe the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, we introduce a functional, whose maximum corresponds to a scale-free configuration. We then identify the equivalents to energy, Zeroth-law, entropy and heat capacity for scale-free networks. Discussing the merging of scale-free networks, we also establish an exact relation to predict their final \"equilibrium\" degree exponent. All analytic results are complemented with Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach illustrates the possibility to apply the tools of equilibrium statistical physics to study the properties of growing networks, and it also supports the recent arguments on the complementarity between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems.", "paper_title": "A thermostatistical approach to scale-free networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351730300011"}
