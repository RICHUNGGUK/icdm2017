The DCMST problem is known to be NP-hard. This paper presents an ant-based algorithm to find low cost degree-constrained spanning trees (DCST). The algorithm employs a set of ants which traverse the graph and identify a set of candidate edges, from which a DCST is constructed. Local optimization algorithms are then used to further improve the DCST. Extensive experiments using 612 problem instances show many improvements over existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "An Improved Ant-Based Algorithm for the Degree-Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000302540100007"}
