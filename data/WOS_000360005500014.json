Despite the competition, we find some of the security mechanisms offered by the services to be similar, indicating that the cloud industry has established a number of \"best-practices,\" while other security mechanisms vary widely, indicating that there is also still room for innovation and experimentation. We investigate these differences and possible underlying reasons for it. We also contrast the security mechanisms offered by public IaaS cloud offerings and with security mechanisms proposed by academia over the same period. Finally, we speculate on how industry and academia might work together to solve the pressing security problems in public IaaS clouds going forward.", "paper_title": "The State of Public Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005500014"}
