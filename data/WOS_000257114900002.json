This article proposes a fuzzy system that helps in such decision-making and thereby mitigates these difficulties. The knowledge related to the decision is incorporated into the system by means of conditional rules, which serve to provide the ideal recovery policy for each particular case. The model proposed is applied to the analysis of a number of examples and proves to be a versatile tool that provides coherent results. These characteristics could be of critical importance especially in the point of entry into the RL pipeline and in the centralized return centres.", "paper_title": "A decision-making support system on a products recovery management framework a fuzzy approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000257114900002"}
