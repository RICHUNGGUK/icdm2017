Only the designated verifier can verify the signature and make sure that the information is correct. In addition, a strong designated verifier scheme allows the verifier to maintain a transcript signature of the verifier's secret key. Recently, Yoon proposed an identity-based strong designated verifier signature scheme to solve the problems of some previously proposed schemes. Unfortunately, Yoon's scheme still has some weaknesses, such as inefficiency in the verifying phase and being vulnerable to replay-attack. To overcome these, we propose a novel designated verifier signature scheme in this paper.", "paper_title": "A Novel Designated Verifier Signature Scheme Based on Bilinear Pairing", "paper_id": "WOS:000324642200005"}
