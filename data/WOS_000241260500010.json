Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical frame was used as a foundation for the empirical analysis. The process of cultural convergence was empirically based on 16 cultural variables of 22 European countries, longitudinal data was used. The process of economic-cultural convergence was based on five economic-cultural variables of 22 European countries, longitudinal data was used. Findings - The cultural diversity on its own is not a obstacle for the introduction and enforcement of modem social structures in Europe. The level of homogenisation of the cultural value orientations is in the year 1999 higher than in the year 1990. Culture is more oriented toward global care, reflecting more holism and interdependence. Research limitations/implications - The research explores new empirical views on convergence process in the context of the EU integration processes. Practical implications - The research is of great importance to policy makers and decision takers on a national and supranational level. Originality/value - The research proposes a different methodological perspective on convergence processes in the EU.", "paper_title": "The economic-cultural context of the EU economies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500010"}
