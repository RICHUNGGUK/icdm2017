A realistic three-dimensional (3D) fiber orientation has not been implemented in modeling fluid flow-dependent response of articular cartilage; thus the detailed mechanical role of the collagen network may have not been fully understood. In the present study, a previously developed fibril-reinforced model of articular cartilage was extended to account for the 3D fiber orientation. A numerical procedure for the material model was incorporated into the finite element code ABAQUS using the \"user material\" option. Unconfined compression and indentation testing was evaluated. For indentation testing, we considered a mechanical contact between a solid indenter and a medial femoral condyle, assuming fiber orientations in the surface layer to follow the split-line pattern. The numerical results from the 3D modeling for unconfined compression seemed reasonably to deviate from that of axisymmetric modeling. Significant fiber orientation dependence was observed in the displacement, fluid pressure and velocity for the cases of moderate strain-rates, or during early relaxation. The influence of fiber orientation diminished at static and instantaneous compressions.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional fibril-reinforced finite element model of articular cartilage", "paper_id": "WOS:000266092600005"}
