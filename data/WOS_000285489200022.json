For a given space-time block code, we combine several component codes in conjunction with set partitioning of the expanded signal constellation according to the coding gain distance criterion. The error performance of an example code is compared with a traditional multilevel space-time code in computer simulation.", "paper_title": "Multilevel Concatenated Space-Time Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200022"}
