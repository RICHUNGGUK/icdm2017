This algorithm differs from previous ones in that it computes a local Smith form for each irreducible factor in the determinant separately and then combines them into a global Smith form, whereas other algorithms apply a sequence of unimodular row and column operations to the original matrix. The performance of the algorithm in exact arithmetic is reported for several test cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
