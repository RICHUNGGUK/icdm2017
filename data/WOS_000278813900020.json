In particular, we propose new patterns for 3- and 5-connectivity. We also discover that there exists a hexagon-based universally elemental pattern that can generate all known optimal patterns. The previously proposed Voronoi-based approach cannot be applied to prove the optimality of the new patterns due to their special features. We propose a new deployment-polygon-based methodology. We prove the optimality of deployment patterns to achieve 3-connectivity, 4-connectivity, and 5-connectivity for certain ranges of R-c/R-s, respectively, and prove the optimality of deployment patterns to achieve 6-connectivity under all ranges of R-c/R-s.", "paper_title": "Optimal Deployment Patterns for Full Coverage and k-Connectivity (k <= 6) Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278813900020"}
