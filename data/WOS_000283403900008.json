Despite the growing use of Building Information Modelling and the improvement in as-built records, several more years will be required before guidelines that require as-built data modelling will be implemented for the majority of constructed facilities, and this will still not address the stock of existing buildings. A technical solution for scanning buildings and compiling Building Information Models is needed. However, this is a multidisciplinary problem, requiring expertise in scanning, computer vision and videogrammetry, machine learning, and parametric object modelling. This paper outlines the technical approach proposed by a consortium of researchers that has gathered to tackle the ambitious goal of automating as-built modelling as far as possible. The top level framework of the proposed solution is presented, and each process, input and output is explained, along with the steps needed to validate them Preliminary experiments on the earlier stages (i.e processes) of the framework proposed are conducted and results are shown; the work toward implementation of the remainder is ongoing (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Toward automated generation of parametric BIMs based on hybrid video and laser scanning data", "paper_id": "WOS:000283403900008"}
