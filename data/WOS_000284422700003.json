We introduce a stream classification algorithm that is online, running in amortized O(1) time, able to handle intermittent arrival of labeled records, and able to adjust its parameters to respond to changing class boundaries (\"concept drift\") in the data stream. In addition, when blocks of labeled data are short, the algorithm is able to judge internally whether the quality of models updated from them is good enough for deployment on unlabeled records, or whether further labeled records are required. Unlike most proposed stream-classification algorithms, multiple target classes can be handled. Experimental results on real and synthetic data show that accuracy is comparable to a conventional classification algorithm that sees all of the data at once and is able to make multiple passes over it.", "paper_title": "Classification Using Streaming Random Forests", "paper_id": "WOS:000284422700003"}
