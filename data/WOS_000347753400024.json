In this technique, regularization parameter is conventionally computed using a cross-validation procedure. In this paper, we propose a deterministic way of computing the regularization parameter in RLDA for small sample size problem. The computational cost of the proposed deterministic RLDA is significantly less than the cross-validation based RLDA technique. The deterministic RLDA technique is also compared with other popular techniques on a number of datasets and favorable results are obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
