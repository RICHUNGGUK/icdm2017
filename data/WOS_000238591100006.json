The complexity of the scientific models being simulated has also evolved, leading to a variety of coupled multi-physics simulation codes. Such cooperating parallel programs require fundamentally new interaction capabilities, to efficiently exchange parallel data structures and collectively invoke methods across programs. So-called \"M x N\" research, as part of the common component architecture (CCA) effort, addresses these special and challenging needs, to provide generalized interfaces and tools that support flexible parallel data redistribution and parallel remote method invocation. Using this technology, distinct simulation codes with disparate distributed data decompositions can work together to achieve greater scientific discoveries. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
