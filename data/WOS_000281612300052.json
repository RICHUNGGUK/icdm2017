The varying-time delay is taken as composition of a nominal positive value subject to a time-varying perturbation. The methodology is based on Gu's discretization technique and a strategy that decouples the system matrices from the Lyapunov functional matrices. Two numerical examples are performed to support the theoretical predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
