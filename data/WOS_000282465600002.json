Even more, usually one cannot decide a priori which attributes are relevant. In this paper we present an improved version of the algorithm for identification of the full set of truly important variables in an information system. It is an extension of the random forest method which utilises the importance measure generated by the original algorithm. It compares, in the iterative fashion, the importances of original attributes with importances of their randomised copies. We analyse performance of the algorithm on several examples of synthetic data, as well as on a biologically important problem, namely on identification of the sequence motifs that are important for aptameric activity of short RNA sequences.", "paper_title": "Boruta - A System for Feature Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000282465600002"}
