Our main contribution is the computation of atlas-based indexes that quantify the abnormality in the motion of a given subject against a reference population, at every location in time and space. The critical computational cost inherent to the construction of an atlas is highly reduced by the definition of myocardial velocities under a small displacements hypothesis. The indexes we propose are of notable interest for the assessment of anomalies in cardiac mobility and synchronicity when applied, for instance, to candidate selection for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We built an atlas of normality using 2D ultrasound cardiac sequences from 21 healthy volunteers, to which we compared 14 CRT candidates with left ventricular dyssynchrony (LVDYS). We illustrate the potential of our approach in characterizing septal flash, a specific motion pattern related to LVDYS and recently introduced as a very good predictor of response to CRT.
