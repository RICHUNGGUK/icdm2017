Deploying applications on these systems, however, has proven to be difficult and very labor intensive. in this paper we review the current state of practice for application development on hybrid systems. We also present our vision of the application development languages and tools that we believe would greatly benefit the process of designing, implementing, and deploying applications on hybrid systems.
