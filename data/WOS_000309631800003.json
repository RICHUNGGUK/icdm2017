The model aims to minimize the total cost of the regional DES network and can be used to deal with the DES planning problems including the optimal number, capacity and location of the energy suppliers and the optimal heat transportation network. A hybrid algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated bi-level programming model. The proposed method is validated through a real case study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
