By fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy adaptive high-gain observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. Under the framework of the backstepping design, fuzzy adaptive output feedback control is constructed recursively. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy adaptive control approach guarantees the semi-global boundedness property for all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system. Simulation results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
