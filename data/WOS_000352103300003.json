Design/methodology/approach - An uncertainty-risk-value framework was proposed based on perceived risk theory, prospect theory, and perceived value theory. Structural equation modeling method was used to test the research model. Findings - Perceived information asymmetry, perceived technology uncertainty, perceived regulatory uncertainty, and perceived service intangibility are confirmed as the main determinants of perceived risk, while perceived performance risk, perceived financial risk, and perceived privacy risk were found to have strong negative effects on perceived value and acceptance intention. Practical implications - The findings may help businesses and policy makers better understand the sources of perceived risk and help support the development of appropriate strategies to mitigate the risk concerns consumers have regarding m-payment. Originality/value - Although the hindering effects of perceived risk regarding m-payment acceptance have been confirmed in previous studies, the sources of perceived risk were rarely investigated. By examining the determinants of perceived risk in m-payment acceptance, this paper offers insights into how consumers perceive risks when adopting new innovations. Additionally, it bridges the gap between the antecedents and consequences of perceived risk.", "paper_title": "Understanding perceived risks in mobile payment acceptance", "paper_id": "WOS:000352103300003"}
