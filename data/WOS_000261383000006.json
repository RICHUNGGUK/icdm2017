We show, by examples, in some practical collaboration networks that the network acts, represented by certain complete subgraphs in the projected single-mode network, usually are highly interwoven. However, we can easily identify the communities by the definition and the algorithm presented in this paper. We also propose a novel statistical quantity, i.e., interweavement, which describes quantitatively how the acts are interwoven in a collaboration network.", "paper_title": "COMMUNITY, HIERARCHY AND INTERWEAVEMENT IN COLLABORATION NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261383000006"}
