The objectives of this paper are threefold: (i) to model a supply chain from the DCSP perspective; (ii) to develop a coordination mechanism in such a distributed supply chain with quantity flexibility for inventory management; and (iii) to examine the usefulness of the proposed methodology through a series of simulation studies. Results are compared with a stochastic model with the system subject to the same independent variables: demand and supply uncertainties. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can successfully filter the impact of the said uncertainties on the system performance including system cost, retailer cost, supplier cost, inventory cost and fill rate.", "paper_title": "A simulation study with quantity flexibility in a supply chain subjected to uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000234924500005"}
