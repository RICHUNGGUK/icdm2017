The linear transconductor is designed based on the flipped-voltage follower (FVF) circuit and an active resistor to achieve the transconductance tuning. The transconductance tuning can be obtained by changing the bias current of the active resistor. A third-order Butterworth low-pass filter implemented with the transconductors was designed by TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The results show that the filter can operate with the cutoff frequency of 10-20 MHz. The tuning range would be suitable for the specifications of IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n Wireless LANs under the consideration of saving chip areas. In the design, the maximum power consumption is 13 mW with the cutoff frequency of 20 MHz under a 1.8 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A G (m) -C continuous-time analog filter for IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262668000003"}
