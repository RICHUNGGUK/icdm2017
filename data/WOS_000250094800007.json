These relations form part of the qualia structure assumed in the generative lexicon, where the relic role represents a typical purpose of the entity and the agentive role represents the origin of the entity. Our proposed method employs a supervised machine-leaming technique which makes use of template-based contextual features derived from token instances of each noun. The output of our method is a ranked list of verbs for each noun, across the different qualia roles. We also propose a variant of Spearman's rank correlation to evaluate the correlation of two top-N ranked lists. Using this correlation method, we represent the ability of the proposed method to identify qualia structure relative to a conventional template-based method.", "paper_title": "Automatic acquisition of qualia structure from corpus data", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800007"}
