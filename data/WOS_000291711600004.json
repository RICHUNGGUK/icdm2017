Large Round Tip Time (RTT) of packets in long-distance networks is a problem to cause the performance degradation of original TCP connections. Although the RTT-based TCP has been recognized to benefit the response performance of TCP connections, the previous conservative schemes do not offers a feasible and reliably approach. For efficient response, the alternative approach to adapt the congestion window is proposed based on a four-stage adjustment, rather than the conventional three-stage approach. Additionally, the original TCP Vegas with constant-interval is improved by the usage of dynamic intervals. In the proposed iTCP-Vegas, the main advantages includes (1) dynamic adjustment of the parameters, alpha and beta, to control the congestion window size values to upgrade the throughput of TCP connections on long-distance networks; (2) Simulation results show that in typical conditions of bandwidth and distance, the proposed mechanism effectively improves the throughput of standard TCP Vegas. Besides, the analysis of fairness among homogenous and heterogeneous TCP connections is also presented.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT TCP VEGAS TO SUPPORT LONG-DISTANCE HIGH SPEED NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600004"}
