DRX operations depend on several parameters, which can be tuned to achieve optimal performance with different traffic profiles (i.e., CBR vs. bursty, periodic vs. sporadic, etc.). This work investigates how to configure these parameters and explores the trade-off between power saving, on one side, and per-user QoS, on the other. Unlike previous work, chiefly based on analytical models neglecting key aspects of LTE, our evaluation is carried out via simulation. We use a fully-fledged packet simulator, which includes models of all the protocol stack, the applications and the relevant QoS metrics, and employ factorial analysis to assess the impact of the many simulation factors in a statistically rigorous way. This allows us to analyze a wider spectrum of scenarios, assessing the interplay of the LTE mechanisms and DRX, and to derive configuration guidelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
