We propose three integrated models for allocating resources. The first model aims at minimizing the input consumption, the second one aims at maximizing the total outputs within the current resources, and the last one aims at maximizing the total outputs using the predicted resources in the next production season. Since the number of inputs or outputs is usually more than one, the abovementioned issue is often a multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) problem. Through the proportion of inputs (outputs) of new decision making unit (DMU) to the total inputs (outputs) of all old DMUs, we transform the MOLP problem into a single objective linear programming model. We assume that decision maker must ensure that the expected outputs of each DMU after allocation in the next production season are not less than this production season. All these proposed models have the same advantage that the results gained from the models are Pareto efficient. A numerical example of 25 supermarkets is used to illustrate our proposed approach.", "paper_title": "NEW APPROACHES FOR RESOURCE ALLOCATION VIA DEA MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299782600006"}
