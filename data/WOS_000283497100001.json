These techniques include the active-feedback single Miller capacitor frequency compensation (AFSMC) and the dual active-feedback single Miller capacitor frequency compensation (DAFSMC). In the proposed techniques, only one Miller capacitor in series with a current buffer is utilized. The main advantages of the proposed three-stage amplifiers are the enhanced unity-gain bandwidth and the reduced silicon area. Small-signal analyses are performed and the design equations are obtained. Extensive HSPICE simulation results are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed AFSMC and DAFSMC amplifiers in both large and small capacitive loads.", "paper_title": "ACTIVE-FEEDBACK SINGLE MILLER CAPACITOR FREQUENCY COMPENSATION TECHNIQUES FOR THREE-STAGE AMPLIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100001"}
