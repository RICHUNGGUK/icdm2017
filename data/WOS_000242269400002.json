Design/methodology/approach - The frequency-domain homogenization is based on the adoption of complex and frequency-dependent material characteristics (e.g. reluctivity) in the homogenized domain. The value of the complex quantity is obtained analytically or by means of a simple 2D FE model. The time-domain counterpart requires the introduction of additional unknowns and equation. Findings - The homogenization methods allow to take into account the global eddy current effect in the individual laminations and wires, with a reasonable precision and computational cost. Research limitations/implications - The homogenization methods have been validated numerically, i.e. by comparison with brute-force FE computations where the eddy current effects are directly and accurately taken into account. Experimental validation should follow. Originality/value - The analogy between the homogenization of laminated cores and windings has been evidenced.", "paper_title": "Frequency and time domain homogenization of laminated magnetic cores and windings in FE models of high-frequency electromagnetic devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000242269400002"}
