One of them is an extension of that in [Liska R, Shashkov M. Enforcing the discrete maximum principle for linear finite element solutions of second-order elliptic problems. Communications in Computational Physics 2008; 3(4):852877.] for linear finite element solutions, which is a local repair technique, and another is a new global repair technique. Both of them keep total energy conservation and are easy to be implemented in existing codes. Numerical examples show that these two repair techniques do not destroy the accuracy of solution for the diamond schemes on distorted meshes.
