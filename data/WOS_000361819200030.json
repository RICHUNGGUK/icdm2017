In fact, if an appropriate key is not selected, the cryptosystem may be attacked and therefore each confidential signal can be recovered only from the encrypted ones. Two important conditions which are studied in this paper are the number of quantized levels for a digital key and also non-sparsity in time-frequency domain. In the case of the first condition, simulation results show that with smaller coefficient for the confidential signal in comparison with the key, the number of quantized levels for the key should be more to guarantee the security. In the case of the second condition, an algorithm is proposed to recover the confidential signal only from the encrypted signal when the key is sparse in time-frequency domain.", "paper_title": "Security in the speech cryptosystem based on blind sources separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361819200030"}
