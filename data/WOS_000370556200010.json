Tracking changes in the DNS over time provides valuable information about the evolution of the Internet's infrastructure. Until now, only one large-scale approach to perform these kinds of measurements existed, passive DNS (pDNS). While pDNS is useful for applications like tracing security incidents, it does not provide sufficient information to reliably track DNS changes over time. We use a complementary approach based on active measurements, which provides a unique, comprehensive dataset on the evolution of DNS over time. Our high-performance infrastructure performs Internet-scale active measurements, currently querying over 50% of the DNS name space on a daily basis. Our infrastructure is designed from the ground up to enable big data analysis approaches on, e.g., a Hadoop cluster. With this novel approach we aim for a quantum leap in DNS-based measurement and analysis of the Internet.", "paper_title": "The Internet of Names: A DNS Big Dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200010"}
