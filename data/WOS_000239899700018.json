Many statistical approaches for assigning significance values to genes have been developed. The Comparative Marker Selection suite consists of three modules that allow users to apply and compare different methods of computing significance for each marker gene, a viewer to assess the results, and a tool to create derivative datasets and marker lists based on user-defined significance criteria.", "paper_title": "Comparative gene marker selection suite", "paper_id": "WOS:000239899700018"}
