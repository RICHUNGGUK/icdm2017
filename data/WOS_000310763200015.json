However, it appears that companies are failing to reap full benefits of this powerful technology as the maintenance of simulation models has become very time-consuming, particularly due to vast amounts of data to be handled. Hence, an increased level of automation of input data handling is highly desirable. This paper presents the current practices relating to input data management and identifies further research and development required to achieve high levels of automation. A survey of simulation users shows that there has been a progress in the use of automated solutions compared to a similar study presented by Robertson and Perera in 2002. The results, however, reveal that around 80% of the users still rely on highly manual work procedures in input data management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
