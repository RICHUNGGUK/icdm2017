It is derived as an efficient implementation of the filter-bank summation method and performs time-domain filtering with coefficients adapted in the uniform or non-uniform frequency-domain. The frequency warped version of the proposed filter-bank has a lower computational complexity than the usual warped analysis-synthesis filter-bank for most parameter configurations. The application to speech enhancement shows that the same quality of the enhanced speech can be achieved but with lower signal delay. For systems with tight signal delay requirements, modifications of the new filter-bank design are discussed to further decrease its signal delay by approximating the original time-domain filter by an FIR or IIR filter of lower degree. This approach can achieve a very low signal delay and reduced computational complexity with almost no loss for the perceived speech quality. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
