However, MMC ignores the discriminative information within the local structures of samples and the structural information embedding in the images. In this paper, we develop a novel criterion, namely Laplacian bidirectional maximum margin criterion (LBMMC) to address the issue. We formulate the image total Laplacian matrix, image within-class Laplacian matrix and image between-class Laplacian matrix using the sample similar weight that is widely used in machine learning. The proposed LBMMC based feature extraction computes the discriminant vectors by maximizing the difference between image between-class Laplacian matrix and image within-class Laplacian matrix in both row and column directions. Experiments on the FERET and Yale face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed LBMMC based feature extraction method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
