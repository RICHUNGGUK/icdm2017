After introducing the definition, this paper gives some examples of entropy of uncertain variables. Furthermore this paper proposes the maximum entropy principle for uncertain variables, that is, out of all the uncertainty distributions satisfying given constraints, to choose the one has maximum entropy.", "paper_title": "Maximum Entropy Principle for Uncertain Variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000296658700009"}
