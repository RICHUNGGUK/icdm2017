Previous studies on anypath routing have concentrated on finding an anypath, which optimizes a single quality of service (QoS) parameter. In this paper, we study anypath routing subject to multiple constraints. We first prove that the problem is NP-hard when the number of constraints is larger than one. We then present a polynomial time K-approximation algorithm MAP, where K is the number of constraints. Our algorithm is as simple as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Therefore, it is suitable for implementation in wireless routing protocols.", "paper_title": "MAP: Multiconstrained Anypath Routing in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323680200001"}
