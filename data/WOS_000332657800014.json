The recent advancements in various structural systems have made the selection of the appropriate structural system for a specific project a challenging decision-making process. This process involves different economic and technical criteria representing the availability of experienced technicians and engineers and necessary machinery and construction materials. Economic life cycle, environmental protection related issues, safety of the project site, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes are also issues related to the country and location in which the construction project takes place, and they should also be addressed in the decision-making process. In this paper, a new algorithm combining two well-known multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III) and preference ranking organization method for enrich evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), have been specially developed for ranking of structural systems. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to group decision-making cases. In addition, the decision matrix data, criteria weights, preference, indifference, and veto thresholds are set as interval values to consider uncertainties in the decision-making procedure. The proposed methodology considers veto threshold, provide complete ranking, exempts the preference functions and includes conceptions such as risk, uncertainty, and reliability with interval approach. The proposed algorithm has been utilized in selecting the appropriate structural system in a low-rise multihousing project in Iran. In this case study, sixteen criteria have been used to select the best structural system between eight alternatives considering relevant uncertainties in the judgments of three groups of stakeholders (owner, consultants, and contractors). The results of the case study showed that the proposed methodology can be used as a proper tool for decision making in the construction management processes.", "paper_title": "Integration of ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II Decision-Making Methods with an Interval Approach: Application in Selection of Appropriate Structural Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332657800014"}
