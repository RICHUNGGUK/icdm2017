However, the classical way of comparing two Zernike descriptors only takes into account the magnitude of the moments and loses the phase information. The novelty of our approach is to take advantage of the phase information in the comparison process while still preserving the invariance to rotation. This new Zernike comparator provides a more accurate similarity measure, together with the optimal rotation angle between the patterns, while keeping the same complexity as the classical approach. This angle information is of particular interest for many applications, including 3D scene understanding through images. Experiments demonstrate that our comparator outperforms the classical one in terms of similarity measure. In particular, the robustness of the retrieval against noise and geometric deformation is greatly improved. Moreover, the rotation angle estimation is also more accurate than state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Improving Zernike Moments Comparison for Optimal Similarity and Rotation Angle Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000263396100004"}
