In this paper, we propose a new reusable neuron architecture (RNA) enabling a performance-efficient and cost-effective silicon implementation for ANN. The RNA architecture consists of a single layer of physical RNA neurons, each of which is designed to use minimal hardware resource (e.g., a single 2-input multiplier-accumulator is used to compute the dot product of two vectors). By carefully applying the principal of time sharing, RNA can multiplexs this single layer of physical neurons to efficiently execute both feed-forward and back-propagation computations of an ANN while conserving the area and reducing the power dissipation of the silicon. A three-layer 51-30-12 ANN is implemented in RNA to perform the ECG classification for CVD detection. This RNA hardware also allows on-chip automatic training update. A quantitative design space exploration in area, power dissipation, and execution speed between RNA and three other implementations representative of different reusable hardware strategies is presented and discussed. Compared with an equivalent software implementation in C executed on an embedded microprocessor, the RNA ASIC achieves three orders of magnitude improvements in both the execution speed and the energy efficiency.
