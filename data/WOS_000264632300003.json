By using the accesses of nodes of PlanetLab testbed, we create a detailed AS-level map including the end-to-end path of all nodes, as well as the relationship of all involved ASes. Based on this map, we evaluate the performance of a set of locality-aware P2P solutions, including an optimal solution guaranteeing the minimum AS hop count, as well as modified BitTorrent system with locality-awareness built into its neighbor selection, peer choking/unchoking, and piece selection processes. Our findings suggest that locality-awareness can help existing P2P solution to significantly decrease load on Internet, and achieve shorter downloading time. By comparing the performance of different kinds of locality-aware and traditional BitTorrent systems, we also point out the necessity to tradeoff between the goals of optimizing AS-related performance and achieving fairness among peers such as intra-AS traffic and peer burden fairness.", "paper_title": "Locality-Awareness in BitTorrent-Like P2P Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632300003"}
