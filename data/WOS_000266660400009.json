We investigate the global stability, the periodic character and the boundedness nature of solutions of the above mentioned difference equation. In particular, our results solve the open problem introduced by Kulenovic and Ladas in their monograph [Dynamics of Second Order Rational Difference Equations with Open Problems anti Conjectures, Chapman and Hall/CRC, Boca Raton. 2002].
