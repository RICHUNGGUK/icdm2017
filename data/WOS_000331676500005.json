The method works on the basis of guiding the optimization process using the well-known principle of virtual work as well as the information collected during the structural analysis and design stages. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated through a benchmark truss instance as well as four real-size trusses sized for minimum weight according to AISC-LRFD specifications. A comparison of the numerical results obtained using the GSS with those of other available algorithms indicates that the proposed technique is capable of locating promising solutions using lesser computational effort.
