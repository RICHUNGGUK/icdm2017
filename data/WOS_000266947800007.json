It is believed that the number of users and shared resources will become enormously huge. As a result, many researches have been dedicated to improve the scalability and efficiency of P2P models. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered P2P resource sharing model, called ML-Chord, that assigns nodes into Chord-like layers based on the categories of shared resources. From the experimental results, it shows that ML-Chord is both efficient and scalable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
