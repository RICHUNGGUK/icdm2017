This paper goes further by assuming that the confidence levels are private information of the two players. And the so-called credibilistic bimatrix game with asymmetric information is investigated. A solution concept of Bayesian optimistic equilibrium strategy as well as its existence theorem are presented. Moreover, a sufficient and necessary condition is given for finding the Bayesian optimistic equilibrium strategy. Finally, an example is provided for illustrating purpose.", "paper_title": "CREDIBILISTIC BIMATRIX GAME WITH ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION: BAYESIAN OPTIMISTIC EQUILIBRIUM STRATEGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000323067200008"}
