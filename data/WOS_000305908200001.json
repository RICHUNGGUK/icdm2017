In this paper, we show that there is a close connection between the construction of the perfect kernel of a class via the iteration of the Cantor-Bendixson derivative through the ordinals and the construction of the well-founded semantics for finite predicate logic programs via Van Gelder's alternating fixpoint construction. This connection allows us to transfer known complexity results for the perfect kernel of classes to give new complexity results for various questions about the well-founded semantics of a finite predicate logic program P.", "paper_title": "A connection between the Cantor-Bendixson derivative and the well-founded semantics of finite logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305908200001"}
