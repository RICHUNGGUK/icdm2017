LRC decides to which interval of the output channel (void) an incoming burst should be allocated on the basis of reuse of the remaining voids. LRC dynamically uses information available to make allocation decisions. It is shown here that LRC produces lower blocking probability and distributes losses more uniformly among routes than do other existing scheduling policies.", "paper_title": "Channel reusability for burst scheduling in OBS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100006"}
