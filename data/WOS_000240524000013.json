The concept of block overlapping is adopted to conceal the erroneous blocks, and the recovered pixels are estimated by the weighted sum from the overlapping. The overlapping weighting matrix has been carefully selected in order to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlation between boundary blocks and the lost block. Furthermore, the motion vector for the lost block has been recovered by considering the best results for the overlapping. The experimental results are shown by integrating our algorithm into the H.263+ coder.", "paper_title": "Temporal error concealment based on weighted pixel estimator", "paper_id": "WOS:000240524000013"}
