In this paper, we first analyze the necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for DS-FP, and then propose a schedulability test algorithm for DS-FP by exploiting the fact that there always exists a repeating pattern in a DS-FP schedule. To resolve the limitation of fixed priority scheduling in DS-FP, we then extend the deferrable scheduling to a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm called DS-EDF by applying the earliest deadline first (EDF) policy to schedule update jobs. We also propose a schedulability test for DS-EDF and compare its performance with DS-FP and ML through extensive simulation experiments. The results show that the schedulability tests are effective. Although the schedulability of DS-EDF is lower than DS-FP and the repeating patterns in DS-EDF schedules are longer than those in DS-FP due to the use of dynamic priority scheduling, the performance of DS-EDF is better than both DS-FP and ML in terms of CPU utilization and impact on lower priority application transactions.", "paper_title": "Schedulability Analysis of Deferrable Scheduling Algorithms for Maintaining Real-Time Data Freshness", "paper_id": "WOS:000333472500015"}
