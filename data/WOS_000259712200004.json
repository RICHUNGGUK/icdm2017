The proposed algorithm is an effective feature extraction algorithm that is invariant to image translation and to 3D rotation, and it is within a partial range of the image scale. Representative performance analysis confirms that the proposed G-LAIFE algorithm significantly enhances the recognition rate and is more efficient than the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), especially in terms of 3D rotation change and computational time.
