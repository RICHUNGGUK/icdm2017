The arrival process is a particular Markov-modulated process which belongs to the class of discrete batched Markovian arrival processes. The server process is a single server deterministic queue. A closed form exact solution is given for the expected queue length and delay. A simple system of equations is given for the probability of the queue exceeding a given length. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
