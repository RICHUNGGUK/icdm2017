Instead, the network grows in a bottom-up fashion as more people express interest in participating in the community and connect with their neighbors. People who participate in community networks are usually volunteers with limited free time. Due to these factors, making the management of community networks simpler and easier for all participants is the key component in boosting their growth. Specifics of individual networks often force communities to develop their own sets of tools and best practices which are hard to share and do not interoperate well with others. We propose a new general community network management platform nodewatcher that is built around the core principle of modularity and extensibility, making it suitable for reuse by different community networks. Devices are configured using a platform-independent configuration which nodewatcher can transform into deployable firmware images, eliminating any manual device configuration, reducing errors, and enabling participation of novice maintainers. An embedded monitoring system enables live overview and validation of the whole community network. We show how the system successfully operates in an actual community wireless network, wlan slovenija. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
