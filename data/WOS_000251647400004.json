The transient Navier-Stokes equations are solved directly with Galerkin finite elements. The Reynolds number defined with respect to the height of the wind tunnel is 12518. Instantaneous streamline patterns are shown that give a complete picture of the flow phenomena. Energy and enstrophy spectra yield the dual cascade of two-dimensional turbulence and the -1 power law decay of enstrophy. Mean values of velocities and root mean square fluctuations are compared with the available experimental results. Other statistical characteristics of turbulence such as Eulerian autocorrelation coefficients, longitudinal and lateral coefficients are also computed. Finally, oscillation diagrams of computed velocity fluctuations yield the chaotic behaviour of turbulence.
