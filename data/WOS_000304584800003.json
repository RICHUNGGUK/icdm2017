According to propagation direction of control packets, the existing signaling schemes for optical burst switched networks can be roughly divided into three categories: one-way, two-way, and hybrid signaling. Since one-way signaling launches bursts without the acknowledgment of successful reservation of resources, it has small end-to-end delay but high data loss rate; two-way signaling uses a control packet to gather the state of links and needs the successful acknowledgment before sending out a burst, so it has large end-to-end delay but low data loss rate. A hybrid signaling gets a tradeoff of performance between one-way and two-way signaling. In this paper, we propose another hybrid signaling named inverse two-way signaling. By introducing the process of link state collection into one-way signaling, the inverse two-way signaling can decrease the data loss rate without increasing the end-to-end delay compared to one-way signaling. In other words, the inverse two-way signaling is an improved version of one-way signaling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
