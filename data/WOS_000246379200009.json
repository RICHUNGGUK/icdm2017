However, labeled training documents are sometimes unavailable or inadequate even if they are available. The goal of this article is to present a self-learned approach to extract high-quality training documents from the Web when the required manually labeled documents are unavailable or of poor quality. To learn a text classifier automatically, we need only a set of user-defined categories and some highly related keywords. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using the test set from the Reuters-21578 news data set. The experiments show that very promising results can be achieved only by using automatically extracted documents from the Web.", "paper_title": "Web-based text classification in the absence of manually labeled training documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000246379200009"}
