This has been considered by several authors. Dually, there might be some contexts where one wishes to maximize the orness while guaranteeing some fixed variability. In this paper, we present two algorithms for finding such weights, when the variability is captured by the entropy and by the variance.", "paper_title": "Maximal orness weights with a fixed variability for owa operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000238794800003"}
