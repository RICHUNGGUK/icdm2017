These new features include parallel improved linear solver techniques, parallel I/O methodologies and partitioning tools. The impact of these new features on parallel performance has been analysed for a range of prototype Petascale computing systems as part of the PRACE pan-European initiative. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
