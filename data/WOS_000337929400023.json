This includes an easy and straightforward definition of the model, the calculation of all vertices, mass matrices, tadpole equations, and self-energies. Also the two-loop renormalization group equations for a general gauge theory are now included and have been validated with the independent Python code PyR@TE. Model files for FeynArt s, CalcHep/CompHep, WHIZARD and in the UFO format can be written, and source code for SPheno for the calculation of the mass spectrum, a set of precision observables, and the decay widths and branching ratios of all states can be generated. Furthermore, the new version includes routines to output model files for Vevacious for both, supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric, models. Global symmetries are also supported with this version and by linking Susyno the handling of Lie groups has been improved and extended.

Computer: All for which Mathematica is available. Operating system: All for which Mathematica is available. Classification: 11.1, 11.6. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEIB_v2_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013) 2604 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes, the new version includes all known features of the previous versions but also provides the new features mentioned below. Nature of problem: A supersymmetric model is usually characterized by the particle content, the gauge sector and the superpotential. It is a time consuming process to obtain all necessary information for phenomenological studies from these basic ingredients. Solution method: Non-supersymmetric models are supported by the new possibility to define not only chiral superfields but also component fields. The renormalization group equations (RGEs) for a non-supersymmetric models are calculated by using the generic formulae for a general quantum field theory. Reasons for new version: New features in the definition of models and a full support of non-supersymmetric models. New output for Vevacious. Summary of revisions: Support of non-supersymmetric models; calculation of renormalization group equations for a general gauge theory; link to Susyno for handling of non-SU(N) gauge groups; support of global symmetries; output of model files for Vevacious; support of aligned VEVs; calculation of gauge dependent parts of RGEs for VEVs in running of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models. Restrictions: Only renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian are supported. No support of fields with spin 2 or 3/2. Unusual features: Calculation of non-supersymmetric RGEs includes effects of kinetic mixing as well as gauge dependence of running vacuum expectation values. SARAH is the first tool which can automatically create model files for Vevacious. Fully automatized derivation of all terms in the Lagrangian which are fixed by gauge invariance.
