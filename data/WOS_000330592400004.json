Moreover, the resulting PKENO construction is efficient if the underlying GS scheme is efficient and the message space of the PKENO scheme is restricted to short messages. Hence, our result not only shows that the existence of this type of GS implies the existence of PKENO, but also that designing a practical GS scheme is as difficult as designing a practical PKENO scheme. Our transform is constructed by carefully investigating the relationship between the functionalities of GS and that of PKENO, and developing a novel (but specific) multiple encryption technique. This multiple encryption technique plays an important role for simultaneously achieving both practical efficiency and security.", "paper_title": "Group signature implies public-key encryption with non-interactive opening", "paper_id": "WOS:000330592400004"}
