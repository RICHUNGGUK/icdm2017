The available ambulances are typically relocated to reestablish maximal coverage. We present a two-stage stochastic optimization model for the ambulance redeployment problem that minimizes the number of relocations over a planning horizon while maintaining an acceptable service level. We conduct computational testing based on the real historical data from the Region of Waterloo Emergency Medical Services. The results show that the optimal relocation strategies can be computed within 40 s of computational time for a desired service level of 90%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
