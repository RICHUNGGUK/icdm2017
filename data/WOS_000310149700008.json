However, this usually comes at a cost of significantly reduced quality of the tomographic data, out-of-plane image artifacts, and overall loss of image contrast and spatial resolution. Quantitative optoacoustic image reconstruction implies therefore collection of point 3-D (volumetric) data from as many locations around the object as possible. Here, we propose and validate an accurate model-based inversion algorithm for 3-D optoacoustic image reconstruction. Superior performance versus commonly-used backprojection inversion algorithms is showcased by numerical simulations and phantom experiments.", "paper_title": "Accurate Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Three-Dimensional Optoacoustic Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000310149700008"}
