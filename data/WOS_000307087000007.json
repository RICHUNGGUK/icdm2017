By developing a new integral inequality and using the properties of nonnegative matrix, we obtain the sufficient conditions for the existence of the global attracting set of the considered delayed neural networks. The results have extended and improved the related reports in the literature and the algebra criteria are easy to check and apply in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
