For this purpose, novel adaptive algorithms for the estimation of the square root of the inverse covariance matrix Sigma(-1/2) are introduced and applied for Gaussian optimal feature extraction. New adaptive algorithms are drawn by optimization of an appropriate cost function that is presented for the first time. Based on the proposed adaptive algorithms, related networks are implemented in order to extract optimal features from a sequence of multidimensional Gaussian data. Adaptive nature of the new feature extraction methods makes them appropriate for on-line pattern recognition applications. Experimental results using multidimensional Gaussian data demonstrated the effectiveness of the new adaptive feature extraction methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
