Design/methodology/approach - Two TWT finite-element analysis modules were adapted to be run on the GRB), for this purpose scripts were written to submit a collection of independent jobs (the parameter study) to the GRID and collect the results. Findings - A 25-job electron gun parameter study runs on the GRID in 30-40 min instead of 7 h locally. A 16-job slow-wave structure parameter study runs in I h on the GRID instead of 8 h locally. Turnaround time on the GRID was limited by priority levels presently set by GRID management for the various jobs submitted. Practical implications - The procedures guarantee a remarkable reduction of the computing time. Originality/value - For heavy-computational cost tasks such as the above finite element electromagnetic calculations, the effective use of a heterogeneous, distributed, computing platform (the GRID computing platform) is very advantageous. The paper shows the development of new generation collaborative tools.", "paper_title": "Distributed computing finite element electromagnetic analysis of traveling wave tubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262005500012"}
