The tool is based on a formal semantics defining the temporal aspects of SMIL elements by means of a set of inference rules. The rules, in the spirit of Hoare's semantics, describe how the execution of a piece of code changes the state of the computation of a player. If any temporal conflict is found, the system returns a message to the user pointing out the element which contains the conflict and its motivation. This helps the user to develop robust and clear code.", "paper_title": "Analysis and verification of SMIL documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000299521500002"}
