Two different types of noises arising in practical implementations are considered: the system noise and the measurement noise. By employing the convergence results of a class of perturbed linear time-varying (LW) systems, the effects of these noises upon the learning performance are revealed. It is shown that while there is little effect upon the learning speed, noises have much influence on the learning accuracy. Compared with system noise, the effects of measurement noise appear to be more complicated. Under the noisy environments, robustification technique on the learning algorithm is required to avoid parameter drift. Furthermore, it is shown that additive system noise can be used to enhance the generalization ability of the RBF networks. Simulation studies are included to illustrate the results.
