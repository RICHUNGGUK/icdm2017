To fully tap into the potential of these processors, the operating system must be aware of the hardware asymmetry when making scheduling decisions and map applications to cores in consideration of their performance characteristics. We propose a Heterogeneity-Aware Signature-Supported (HASS) scheduling algorithm that performs this mapping using per-thread architectural signatures, which are compact summaries of threads' architectural properties. We implemented HASS in OpenSolaris, and demonstrated that it always outperforms a heterogeneity-agnostic scheduler (by as much as 12.5%) for workloads exhibiting sufficient diversity. Our evaluation also includes an extensive comparison with other heterogeneity-aware schedulers to provide a more clear understanding of the pros and cons behind HASS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
