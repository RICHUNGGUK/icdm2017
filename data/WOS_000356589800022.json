Recently, there is huge amount of emerging items which are divided into a variety of categories and researchers have argued or suggested that top-K recommendation of item category could be very beneficial for users to make better and faster decisions. However, the traditional methods encounter some common but crucial problems in this scenario because additional information, such as time, is ignored. The ranking algorithm on graphs and the increasingly growing amount of online user behaviors shed some light on these problems. We propose a construction method of time-aware graphs to use ranking algorithm for personalized recommendation of item category. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over competitive baseline algorithms.", "paper_title": "Personalized Recommendation of Item Category Using Ranking on Time-Aware Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589800022"}
