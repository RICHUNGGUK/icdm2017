However, the interaction techniques and design decisions for their effective use are not well defined. We present a conceptual framework for considering implicit input from the brain, along with design principles and patterns we have developed from our work. We also describe a series of controlled, offline studies that lay the foundation for our work with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging, as well as our real-time platform that serves as a testbed for exploring brain-based adaptive interaction techniques. Finally, we present case studies illustrating the principles and patterns for effective use of brain data in human-computer interaction. We focus on signals coming from the brain, but these principles apply broadly to other sensor data and in domains such as aviation, education, medicine, driving, and anything involving multitasking or varying cognitive workload.", "paper_title": "Designing Implicit Interfaces for Physiological Computing: Guidelines and Lessons Learned Using fNIRS", "paper_id": "WOS:000348204100007"}
