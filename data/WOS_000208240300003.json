MPIWS takes advantage of the SOAP communication protocol, and allows direct MPI-style communication among loosely coupled services. The MPI-style communication supported by MPIWS includes both point-to-point and collective communications. In this paper, point-to-point and collective communication operations are evaluated in comparison with mpiJava. The evaluation results demonstrate that although the overhead of SOAP messaging takes a toll on performance, MPIWS is generally comparable with mpiJava sending Object data types, especially for coarse-grain applications, and outperforms mpiJava in some cases.", "paper_title": "The Design and Evaluation of MPI-Style Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000208240300003"}
