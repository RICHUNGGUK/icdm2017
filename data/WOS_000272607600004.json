A theoretical analysis of lighting conditions is carried out, and a case study is shown by means of the setup of an experimental environment and an empirical analysis of lighting conditions. Finally, a methodology for saving energy, which adjusts luminance to user preferences, is presented, and a study of the consumption results is given.", "paper_title": "A Study on Saving Energy in Artificial Lighting by Making Smart Use of Wireless Sensor Networks and Actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000272607600004"}
