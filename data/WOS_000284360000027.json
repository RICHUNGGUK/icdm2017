In this paper, we present a framework and method for detecting and measuring the dynamic changes of the pivotal traffic patterns. A bidirectional regional flow model is established to aggregate traffic packets and extract the traffic metrics and profiles. The characteristics of the regional flows are analyzed and interesting findings are obtained. A directed graph model is applied to describe the flow metrics and six flow features are extracted to capture the dynamic changes of the flow patterns. The measurements based on Renyi entropy are developed to quantitatively monitor these changes. The experimental results based on the actual network traffic data traces show that the method presented in this paper can capture the dynamic changes of pivotal traffic patterns effectively.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Feature Analysis and Measurement for Large-Scale Network Traffic Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000284360000027"}
