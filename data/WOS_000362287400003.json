And an objective weight of INSs is presented to unearth and utilize deeper information that is uncertain. Using the proposed weighted correlation coefficient measure of INSs, a decision-making method is developed, which takes into account the influence of the evaluations' uncertainty and both the objective and subjective weights.", "paper_title": "An Improved Weighted Correlation Coefficient Based on Integrated Weight for Interval Neutrosophic Sets and its Application in Multi-criteria Decision-making Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362287400003"}
