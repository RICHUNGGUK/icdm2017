By applying local branching throughout the solution process, one can simultaneously improve both the lower and upper bounds. We also show how Benders feasibility cuts can be strengthened or replaced with local branching constraints. To assess the performance of the different algorithmic ideas presented in this hybrid solution approach, extensive computational experiments were performed on two families of network design problems. Numerical results clearly illustrate their benefits.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Benders Decomposition by Local Branching", "paper_id": "WOS:000265756900012"}
