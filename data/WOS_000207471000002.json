The proposed method is based on self-organising isometric embedding algorithm that adaptively emphasises the most accurate range measurements and naturally accounts for communication constraints within the sensor network. Each node adaptively chooses a neighbourhood of sensors to update its estimated position by minimising a local cost function and then passes this update to neighbour sensors. Simulation demonstrated that the proposed method is more robust to measurement error than previous proposals and it can achieve comparable results using fewer anchor nodes than previous methods. The applications of the new method in logistics and transportation system monitoring are also illustrated in the paper.", "paper_title": "Node localisation in wireless sensor network based on self-organising isometric embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000207471000002"}
