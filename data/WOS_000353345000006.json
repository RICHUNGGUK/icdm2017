This is capable of delivering up to 15.6 dBm saturated output power with an associated peak power added efficiency of 31% in measurement. Although amplifiers with higher output power have been reported, this amplifier occupies only 0.086 mm(2) and does not require any off chip component for its operation, even at the UHF band. It also achieves the highest power density among a similar class of PA's below 10 GHz. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
