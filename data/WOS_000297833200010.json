An instance of such a problem consists of a set of variables V and a multiset of constraints, which are ordered triples of distinct variables of V. The objective is to find a linear ordering alpha of V that maximizes the number of triples whose rearrangement (under alpha) follows a permutation in Pi. We prove that every ternary Permutation-CSP parameterized above average has a kernel with a quadratic number of variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
