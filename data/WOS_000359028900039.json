Typically in classification theory it is assumed that sampling is performed randomly in accordance with the prior probabilities on the classes and this has heretofore been true in the case of OBC. In the present paper we propose to forego random sampling and utilize the prior knowledge and previously collected data to determine which class to sample from at each step of the sampling. Specifically, we choose to sample from the class that leads to the smallest expected classification error with the addition of the new sample point. We demonstrate the superiority of the resulting nonrandom sampling procedure to random sampling on both synthetic data and data generated from known biological pathways.
