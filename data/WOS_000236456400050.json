A moment-based method that finds several eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in a given domain is used. This method is suitable for master-worker type parallel programming models. In order to improve the parallel efficiency of the method, we propose a hybrid implementation using a GridRPC system Ninf-C and MPI. We examined the performance of the proposed method in an environment where several PC clusters are used.", "paper_title": "A hybrid parallel method for large sparse eigenvalue problems on a grid computing environment using Ninf-G/MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400050"}
