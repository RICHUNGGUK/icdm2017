Egghe, I.K. Ravichandra Rao, Theory of first-citation distributions and applications, Mathematical and Computer Modelling 34 (2001) 81-90] is extended to the general source-item situation. This yields a time-dependent Lotka function based on a given (static) Lotka function (considered to be valid for time t = infinity). Based on this function, a time-dependent Lotkaian informetrics theory is then further developed by e.g. deriving the corresponding time-dependent rank-frequency function. These tools are then used to calculate the dynamical (i.e. time-dependent) g-index (of Egghe) while also an earlier proved result on the time-dependent h-index (of Hirsch) is refound. It is proved that both indexes are concavely increasing to their steady state values for t = infinity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
