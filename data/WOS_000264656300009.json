These languages are designed while assuming temporal data modelled as sequences of data. So far, two styles of implicit temporal query languages are known: T-WHILE like languages are based on a temporal extension of WHILE with left and right moves; mu TL like languages are a fixpoint extension of TL. This article focusses on comparing the expressive power of T-WHILE style languages and mu TL languages and provides complementary results with respect to Abiteboul et al. (1999, J. Comput. System Sci.,58, 5468). The main contribution is the proof of the equivalence of the three following temporal languages: the non-inflationary variant of mu TL, the language T-WHILE and more surprisingly the language T-FIXPOINT.", "paper_title": "Fixpoint and While Temporal Query Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000264656300009"}
