In particular, we show that, when restricted to the class of strongly positive generalized Bernoulli measures, they all coincide with the classical equivalence, which requires that two measures have the same nullsets.", "paper_title": "Constructive equivalence relations on computable probability measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200012"}
