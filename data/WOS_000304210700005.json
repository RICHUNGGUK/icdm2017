The polyphase components of the analysis filters are assumed to have an identical denominator in order to simplify the PR condition. A modified model reduction is employed to derive a nearly PR causal-stable IIR FB as the initial guess to obtain a PR IIR FB from a PR FIR FB. To obtain high quality PR FIR FBs for carrying out model reduction, cosine-rolloff FIR filters are used as the initial guess to a nonlinear optimization software for solving to the PR solution. A factorization based on the lifting scheme is proposed to convert the IIR FB so obtained to a structurally PR system. The arithmetic complexity of this FB, after factorization, can be reduced asymptotically by a factor of two. Multiplier-less IIR FB can be obtained by replacing the lifting coefficients with the canonical signal digitals (CSD) or sum of powers of two (SOPOT) coefficients.", "paper_title": "Design and Factorization of Two-Channel Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks with Causal-Stable IIR Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000304210700005"}
