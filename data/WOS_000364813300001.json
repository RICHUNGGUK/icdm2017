A virtual backbone of such a network is a strongly connected dominating and absorbing set (SCDAS). This paper presents a (2 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the minimum dominating and absorbing set problem (DAS), which, as far as we know, is the first one achieving a constant approximation ratio for DAS without requiring a bounded ratio of maximum transmission range over minimum transmission range. Based on such a DAS, a (4 + 3 ln(2 + epsilon)opt + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for SCDAS is presented, where opt is the size of an optimal SCDAS, which improves on the previous approximation ratio (3H (n - 1) - 1), where n is the number of nodes, and H(center dot) is the Harmonic function.", "paper_title": "Strongly connected dominating and absorbing set in directed disk graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000364813300001"}
