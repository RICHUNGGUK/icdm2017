This paper combines robust feature extraction, qualitative spatial relations, relational instance-based learning and compositional hierarchies in one framework. For each layer in the hierarchy, qualitative spatial structures in images are detected, classified and then employed one layer up the hierarchy to obtain higher-level semantic structures. We apply a four-layer hierarchy to street view images and subsequently detect corners, windows, doors, and individual houses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
