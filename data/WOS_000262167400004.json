Usually the strategy adopted involves the combination of multiple sources of relevance into a single ranking. This work proposes the use of evolutionary techniques to derive good evidence combination functions using three different sources of evidence of relevance: the textual content of documents, the reputation of documents extracted from the connectivity information available in the processed collection and the anchor text concatenation. The combination functions discovered by our evolutionary strategies were tested using a collection containing 368 queries extracted from a real nation-wide search engine query log with over 12 million documents. The experiments performed indicate that our proposal is an effective and practical alternative for combining sources of evidence into a single ranking. We also show that different types of queries submitted to a search engine can require different combination functions and that our proposal is useful for coping with such differences.
