The players, Maker and Breaker, take the edges of the graph in turns, and Maker wins iff his subgraph has a given - usually monotone - property. Here we introduce the d-diameter game, which means that Maker wins iff the diameter of his subgraph is at most d. We investigate the biased version of the game; i.e., when the players may take more than one, and not necessarily the same number of edges, in a turn. Our main result is that we proved that the 2-diameter game has the following surprising property: Breaker wins the game in which each player chooses one edge per turn, but Maker wins as long as he is permitted to choose 2 edges in each turn whereas Breaker can choose as many as (1/9)n(1/8/)(In n)(3/8). In addition, we investigate d-diameter games for d >= 3. The diameter games are strongly related to the degree games. Thus, we also provide a generalization of the fair degree game for the biased case. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
