It models all the levels from the mechanisms of contraction up to the hemodynamics of the LV. We validate our model by presenting several case studies. The goal is to build a model with a strong physiological basis that may be understood in physical terms but, in contrast with other existing models, may be simulated sufficiently fast to use it as a teaching tool in cardiovascular physiology and allow its integration as a boundary condition in more sophisticated 3D finite-element models.
