It is important to perform measurement system analysis (MSA) on a multisite testing system to assess its testing capability. Traditional MSA methods are designed to be either univariate or multivariate in a single-site system. They are not capable of analyzing a complex multisite testing system where there are multivariate measurements and multiple instruments in parallel. We propose an online multivariate MSA approach to detecting faulty test instruments in a multisite testing system. In order to pinpoint a faulty test instrument in a multisite testing system we compare the performance of each test instrument to the overall performance of all the parallel instruments in the system. A modified principal component analysis (PCA) method is proposed to transform multivariate measurement data with dependent variables into those with independent principal components. Assuming that all the instruments have the same measurement accuracy and precision we consider a faulty instrument as one whose principal component values are beyond the three sigma control limits of the principal component values of all instruments. We conduct an experiment to provide empirical evidence that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the faulty instruments in a multisite testing system. This approach can be implemented as an online monitoring technique so that production is not interrupted until a faulty instrument is identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
