This stage - called 'filtering\" or \"screening\" - chooses a set of alternatives to be considered for identification and more detailed evaluation. For successful filtering processes, composers increasingly focus on closing the gap between required and offered functionality, hence reducing ambiguity of information for comparison. However, it is quite difficult to establish a framework for managing unstructured information at this early stage. In this paper, we introduce filtering immersed in a Six Sigma-based process, aiming at improving the filtering process itself as well as its deliverables. We illustrate the proposal by a case study.", "paper_title": "A Six Sigma-based process to improve COTS component filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000250650600003"}
