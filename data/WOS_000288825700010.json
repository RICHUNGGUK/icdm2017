Item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches for determining recommendations. A common problem of current item-based CF approaches is that all users have the same weight when computing the item relationships. To improve the quality of recommendations, we incorporate the weight of a user, userrank, into the computation of item similarities and differentials. In this paper, a data model for userrank calculations, a PageRank-based user ranking approach, and a userrank-based item similarities/differentials computing approach are proposed. Finally, the userrank-based approaches improve the recommendation results of the typical Adjusted Cosine and Slope One item-based CF approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
