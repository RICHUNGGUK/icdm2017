In practical applications, the dynamics of each agent may be of high order and only the outputs of all agents are required to achieve time-varying formations. Therefore, this paper focuses on time-varying output formation control problems for high-order linear time-invariant swarm systems with directed interaction topologies. A general output formation protocol is proposed based on the relative outputs of neighboring agents. Necessary and sufficient conditions for swarm systems to achieve time-varying output formations are presented using a consensus based approach. An explicit expression of the output formation reference function is given. For a swarm system, whether or not a desired output formation is feasible is a crucial problem. Based on partial stability theory, necessary and sufficient conditions for output formation feasibility are derived. Approaches to expand the feasible time-varying output formation set and an algorithm to design the protocol for swarm systems to achieve time-varying output formation are presented respectively. Finally, theoretical results are demonstrated by numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
