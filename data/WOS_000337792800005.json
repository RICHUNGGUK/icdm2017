The computation burden for MV prediction is not very high. However, there is high irregularity in raw MV prediction algorithm with two-stage and four-level hierarchical tree control flows. It makes efficient VLSI architecture implementation challenging. The high irregularity is mainly derived from the abundant inter prediction modes including variable block size partition and temporal prediction direction, as well as the irregular control flow of the MV prediction algorithm. This paper proposes a highly regular architecture to implement MV prediction for multi-standard video codec. Complex control logic is simplified by regularly table look-up of the control parameters predefined and stored in on-chip tables. The parameters of the current macroblock (MB) and its neighboring blocks are initialized and refreshed in a regular manner. Moreover, pipelining and parallelism are employed in the proposed architecture to improve throughput efficiency and tradeoff between hardware cost and efficiency. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design.", "paper_title": "A Regular VLSI Architecture of Motion Vector Prediction for Multiple-Standard MPEG-Like Video Codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000337792800005"}
