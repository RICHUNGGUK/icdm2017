While being scheduled at the same time, the multiple links may interfere with one another that makes it challenging to provide QoS in multi-hop WiMax mesh networks. In this paper, we propose the LMDFS (Layered Maximum Degree First Select) algorithm for channel assignment in multi-channel single-transceiver WiMax mesh network. The goal is to eliminate the interference, to allow multiple non-interfering links to be scheduled at the same time and to increase the throughput of traffic flows. The simulation results show that this proposed algorithm greatly reduces the length of scheduling and improves the throughput and the average delay from network nodes to the BS in insufficient channels.", "paper_title": "Improvement of Channel Assignment Scheme for WiMax Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276467200002"}
