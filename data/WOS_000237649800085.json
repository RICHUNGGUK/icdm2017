More and more enterprises and organizations are recently trying to build flexible and integrated information systems with web services in order to satisfy the changing needs of customers. The web Service can currently be recognized as a new alternative for integrating the scattered information assets within an enterprise or an organization. Due to the increasing number of Web Service applications and the service suppliers, however, the customers are confronted with the problem of selecting the most suitable Web Service. In this paper the new methodology for marshaling the composite Web Service satisfying Web Service QoS goals is suggested. This provides a theoretical basis from which a goal programming model is identified by which the web service QoS can be quantified.", "paper_title": "Goal programming approach to compose the web service quality of service", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800085"}
