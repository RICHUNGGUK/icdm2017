In particular the dictionary is recoverable as the local maximum of a new maximization criterion that generalizes the K-means criterion. For this maximization criterion results for asymptotic exact recovery for sparsity levels up to O (mu(-1)) and stable recovery for sparsity levels up to O (mu(-2)) as well as signal to noise ratios up to O (root d) are provided. These asymptotic results translate to finite sample size recovery results with high probability as long as the sample size N scales as O (K-3 dS (epsilon) over tilde (-2)), where the recovery precision (epsilon) over tilde can go down to the asymptotically achievable precision. Further, to actually find the local maxima of the new criterion, a very simple Iterative Thresholding and K (signed) Means algorithm (ITKM), which has complexity O (dKN) in each iteration, is presented and its local efficiency is demonstrated in several experiments.", "paper_title": "Local Identification of Overcomplete Dictionaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000369886600003"}
