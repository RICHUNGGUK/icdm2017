The investigation is focused on the effect of the coalescence efficiency on this evolution. A dilute system of bubbles under microgravity conditions is considered. It is found that if the initial coalescence efficiency is low, a slight increase produces a significant effect oil the bubble coalescence rate, and thus on the evolution of the Population. If, however, the initial coalescence efficiency is high, its increase results in a marginal effect on the way the population evolves. The results of simulations are validated against experimental data on the population mean. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
