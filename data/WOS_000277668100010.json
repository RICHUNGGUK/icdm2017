This weakness in Sun et al.'s CAS originates because 1) no change is made to a group key after a new member arrives, and 2) updates of group keys are done in an insecure manner. We show how simple protocol changes can fix these weaknesses and thus render Sun et al.'s CAS capable of preserving backward secrecy.", "paper_title": "Improvements on Sun et al.'s Conditional Access System in Pay-TV Broadcasting Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277668100010"}
