It demonstrates how Spurious Free Dynamic Range >50 dB can be maintained up to 1 GHz, while keeping the DAC footprint small -0.035 mm(2). Several linearization techniques, such as current source cascodes with local biasing, thick-oxide output cascodes, bleeding currents, and 50% level of segmentation are validated for the first time at such very high frequencies. Testing is facilitated by means of integrating a digital front-end design-for-test scheme in 0.048 mm(2). It uses a 5-kb 8X TI data memory, based on circular shift registers to avoid signal-dependent disturbances. An integrated 7-GHz Current Mode Logic ring oscillator-type clock generator and a serial data interface enable simple testing of the DAC at reduced cost.", "paper_title": "A 28-nm CMOS 7-GS/s 6-bit DAC With DfT Clock and Memory Reaching SFDR > 50 dB Up to 1 GHz", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100035"}
