First, a new technique is devised for the addition of various fuzzy numbers in a path using alpha-cuts by proposing a least squares model to obtain membership functions for the considered additions. Due to the complexity of the addition of various fuzzy numbers for larger problems, a genetic algorithm is presented for finding the shortest path in the network. For this, we apply a recently proposed distance function for comparison of fuzzy numbers. Examples are worked out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
