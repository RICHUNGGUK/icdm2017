In the first analysis, C-N2/C-T (number of non-sp2 hybridized carbons per the total carbons) and chiral angle were identified as critical descriptors for both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Further analysis and literature findings indicate the effect of chiral angle is negligible at larger CNT radii for both properties. Raman spectroscopy can be used to measure C-N2/C-T, providing a direct link between experimental and computational results. Poisson's ratio approaches two different limiting values as CNT radii increases: 0.23-0.25 for, chiral and armchair CNTs and 0.10 for zigzag CNTs (surface defects <3%). In the second analysis, the critical descriptors were C-N2/C-T, chiral angle, and M-N/C-T (number of methyl groups per total carbons). These results imply new types of defects can be represented as a new descriptor in QSPR models. Finally, results are qualified and quantified against experimental data.", "paper_title": "Developing Descriptors To Predict Mechanical Properties of Nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000318060200005"}
