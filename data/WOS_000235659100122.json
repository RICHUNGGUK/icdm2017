With the standardization of ontology, the semantic Web services can make the communication more flexible and automated. This paper presents an ontology-based, runtime semantic solution for solving the interacting problem between two agents. The paper demonstrates how to employ the OWL description and service ontology to a Request for Quote (RFQ) scenario, and how to develop a methodology for runtime semantics.", "paper_title": "A semantic web approach to \"Request for Quote\" in E-commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100122"}
