The molecular mechanisms of the initial ligand binding and induced large scale motion of the proteins domains still remain elusive. In this study, we use a new docking protocol that combines a recently proposed explicit water placement algorithm based on the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation and conventional docking software (AutoDock Vina) to explain the mechanisms of maltotriose binding to the apo-open state of a maltose-binding protein. We confirm the predictions of previous NMR spectroscopic experiments on binding modes of the ligand. We provide the molecular details on the binding mode that was not previously observed in the X-ray experiments. We show that this mode, which is defined by the fine balance between the protein-ligand direct interactions and solvation effects, can trigger the proteins domain motion resulting in the holo-closed structure of the maltose-binding protein with the maltotriose ligand in excellent agreement with the experimental data. We also discuss the role of water in blocking unfavorable binding sites and water-mediated interactions contributing to the stability of observable binding modes of maltotriose", "paper_title": "Role of Water in Ligand Binding to Maltose-Binding Protein: Insight from a New Docking Protocol Based on the 3D-RISM-KH Molecular Theory of Solvation", "paper_id": "WOS:000349943100012"}
