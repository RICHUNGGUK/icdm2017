The Monte Carlo simulation is performed to study the effect of multiple scattering on the measured signal losses. The OCT signal is divided into two categories: one is from the target layer in the medium (LSP); the other is from the rest of the medium (MSP). The results show the MSP signal decays much more slowly than the LSP signal. The LSP contribute to the precise OCT signal and the MSP degrades the OCT signal. Signal decays constantly and the decay constant, increases with the increasing scattering coefficient. Experiment results are also presented to show how multiple scattering affects the measured OCT signal losses.", "paper_title": "EFFECT OF MULTIPLE SCATTERING ON MEASURED SIGNAL LOSSES USING OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY STUDIED BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700030"}
