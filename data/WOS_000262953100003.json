By applying HESH descriptors to Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) study on three peptides including 58 Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, and 20 thromboplastin inhibitors, we get three excellent Partial Least Squares (PLS) models, with the squared multiple correlation coefficients (R(cum)(2)), cross-validation (R(cum)(2)), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.877, 0.838, and 0.36.1 for ACE inhibitors, 0.926,0.865, and 0.172 for bitter-tasting dipeptides and 0.996, 0.865, and 0.11.5 for thromboplastin inhibitors. These results were superior to many other reported researches. It showed that HESH may be a useful structural expression method for the study on QSAR of peptide.", "paper_title": "Structural Parameter Characterization and Bioactivity Simulation Based on Peptide Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000262953100003"}
