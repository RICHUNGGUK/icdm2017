The proposed intelligent methodology is based on a class of neural network-GARCH autoregressive models for the effective handling of the dynamics related to the statistical mispricing between relative stock prices. The performance of the proposed intelligent trading system is properly measured with the aid of profit loss diagrams.", "paper_title": "An intelligent statistical arbitrage trading system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100075"}
