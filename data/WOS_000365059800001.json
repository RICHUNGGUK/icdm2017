One aspect of the testing process is the automatic generation of test inputs. This paper studies the Alternating Variable Method (AVM) approach to search-based test input generation. The AVM has been shown to be an effective and efficient means of generating branch-covering inputs for procedural programs. However, there has been little work that has sought to analyse the technique and further improve its performance. This paper proposes two different local searches that may be used in conjunction with the AVM, Geometric and Lattice Search. A theoretical runtime analysis proves that under certain conditions, the use of these searches results in better performance compared to the original AVM. These theoretical results are confirmed by an empirical study with five programs, which shows that increases of speed of over 50% are possible in practice. (C) 2015 The Authors.
