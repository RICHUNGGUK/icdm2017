The methods proposed so far in the literature do not account for long-range dependence. The method proposed in the present paper also provides an estimate of the Hurst parameter. Simulation results show that: (i) the estimate of the traffic matrix is more efficient than those obtained via existing techniques: (ii) the estimation error of the traffic matrix is lower for larger values of the true traffic intensity: (iii) the estimate of the Hurst parameter is slightly negatively biased.
