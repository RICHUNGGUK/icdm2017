The derivation of the formulae is discussed and a MAPLE program code is included which allows to determine the analytic expressions of the perturbation corrections needed to construct methods of different orders. Some numerical illustrations are given showing the accuracy, the robustness and the CPU-time gain of the proposed algorithms over the sixth order LILIX method which was presented in [L.Gr.
