We determine the number of cyclic codes for a given length. We describe the duals of the cyclic codes, describe the form of cyclic codes that are self-dual and give the number of these codes. We end by examining specific cases of cyclic codes, giving all cyclic self-dual codes of length less than or equal to 14.", "paper_title": "Cyclic codes over Z(4) of even length", "paper_id": "WOS:000236201800001"}
