A hybrid quad-binary (QB) tree structure is utilized to efficiently model and code geometrical information within images. Compared to other tree-based representation such as wedgelets, the proposed QB-tree based method is more efficient for a wide range of contour features such as junctions, corners and ridges, especially at low bit rates.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Segmentation-Based Image Coding Using Hybrid Quad-Binary Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000266163300011"}
