To achieve fast, flexible forwarding for both wired and wireless networks with good scalability, simplicity, security and enhancement of the network Quality of Service (QoS), this paper proposes two fast forwarding approaches on the basis of Link Interface Code (LIC), i.e., the One-way connection-based LIC Forwarding (OLICF) scheme and the Two-way connection-based LIC Forwarding (TLICF) scheme. The two proposed schemes can run over existing routing protocols and execute like explicit routing via establishing connection-oriented LIC paths in advance, where OLICF is suitable for the transmission of asymmetric flows and TLICF is more suitable for the transmission of symmetric flows including interactive real-time services. Finally, extensive experiments performed on the test network show that the proposed schemes can achieve lower end-to-end delay and higher throughput than existing methods.", "paper_title": "Two LIC-Based Fast Forwarding Schemes for Explicit Routing with Scalability, Flexibility and Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300006"}
