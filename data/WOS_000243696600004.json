A Thermal Bias Compensating Network (TBCN) based on the Neuro-Fuzzy logic is proposed in the paper. The network uses an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to compensate the TBE. The parameters of the ANFIS can be initialized by previous training in the ground and modified on space orbit working. Algorithm simulation and ground test have shown that the TBCN has a high capability of tracking and compensating the temperature bias error.", "paper_title": "Satellite borne fiber optical gyroscope thermal bias compensation network based on neuro-fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000243696600004"}
