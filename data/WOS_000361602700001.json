The Preisach model, based on the delayed relay operator for hysteresis modelling, is introduced. The model is identified from experimental data with an input function ensuring information for all input levels. This paper presents implementational issues with respect to hysteresis compensation using the Preisach model, showing the procedure to follow, avoiding pitfalls in both identification and inversion. Issues due to the discrete nature of the Preisach model are discussed, and a specific linear interpolation method is tested experimentally, showing effective avoidance of excitation of vibrational dynamics in the smart material. Experimental results of hysteresis compensation are presented, showing an approximate error of 5% between the reference and measured displacement. Consequences of an insufficient discretization level and a high frequency reference signal are illustrated, showing significant deterioration of the hysteresis compensation performance.", "paper_title": "On Implementation of the Preisach Model Identification and Inversion for Hysteresis Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361602700001"}
