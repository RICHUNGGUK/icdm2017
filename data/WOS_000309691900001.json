Some phenomenon already exists in the real world, such as epidemics, social networks, ecology food web, metabolic, genetic or protein interaction networks and database maintained by telecom operator can also be observed via scientific approaches based on networking aspect, which may be useful for solving problems or providing killer applications in real world. In this paper we first review some basic concepts of characterizing a network from different aspects by various structural properties. Then we describe several important network models and approaches developed in the past decade. Furthermore, in order to better obtain network structural properties and topology from data in an effective way, we visualized the result of network analysis by open-source software library, JUNG as a tool, and take cognitive radio networks as a target for evaluation of the structural properties. Finally we apply Bayesian method to the data from real mobile service network to estimate the preference of subscribers for achieving precise marketing as an example of probabilistic network construction from data.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Network Construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000309691900001"}
