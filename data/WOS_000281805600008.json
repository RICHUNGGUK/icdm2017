This method uses a distributed computing approach for analysis of internal fault in transient stability (T/S) studies of electrical networks using Diakoptics and large change sensitivity (LCS) concepts. The combination of these concepts by phase frame model of transformer will be used here to develop an internal fault simulation of transformers. This approach leads to a model which is compatible with commercial phasor-based software packages. Consequently, it enables calculation of fault currents in any branch of the network due to a winding fault of a power transformer. The proposed method is implemented successfully and validated by time domain software and GEC group measurement results.", "paper_title": "Detailed Simulation of Transformer Internal Fault in Power System by Diakoptical Concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000281805600008"}
