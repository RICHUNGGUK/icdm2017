This phenomenon brings us a bio-motivated Lindenmayer system. To investigate conditions for a variety of cell types, we have constructed a stochastic model over Lindenmayer systems. This model considers interactive behaviors among cells, yielding complicated polynomials. Using symbolic computation, we have derived explicit relations between cell-type diversity and cell-type ratio constraint. These relations exhibit elliptic curve-and Fibonacci number-related patterns. This is the first example of elliptic curves to appear in the Lindenmayer context. A survey of the rational points and the quadratic irrational numbers on the derived curves has revealed Fibonacci-related periodic and quasiperiodic patterns. Further we have found that in some region, there are only two elliptic curve-related periodic patterns.", "paper_title": "Elliptic curves and Fibonacci numbers arising from Lindenmayer system with symbolic computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297221500005"}
