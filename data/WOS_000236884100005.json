These initiatives have met various difficulties and had mixed degrees of success, and none of them has yet attained both de facto and de jure status. This paper reviews two of these initiatives with respect to a framework wherein service composition is approached from multiple interrelated perspectives. One conclusion is that standardisation initiatives in this area have not been built on top of an explicitly defined overarching conceptual foundation. The paper outlines a research agenda aimed at identifying requirements and concepts that should be addressed by and incorporated into these standards.", "paper_title": "Standards for web service choreography and orchestration: Status and perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100005"}
