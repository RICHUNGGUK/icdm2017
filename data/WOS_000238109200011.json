In this paper we introduce a natural generalization of the notion of disjoint NP-pairs to disjoint k-tuples of NP-sets for k >= 2. We define subclasses of the class of all disjoint k-tuples of NP-sets. These subclasses are associated with a propositional proof system and possess complete tuples which are defined from the proof system. In our main result we show that complete disjoint NP-pairs exist if and only if complete disjoint k-tuples of NP-sets exist for all k >= 2. Further, this is equivalent to the existence of a propositional proof system in which the disjointness of all k-tuples is shortly provable. We also show that a strengthening of this conditions characterizes the existence of optimal proof systems.", "paper_title": "Tuples of disjoint NP-sets (Extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200011"}
