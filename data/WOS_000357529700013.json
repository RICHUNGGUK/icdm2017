Yet understanding these dependencies is critical to making good management decisions, since dependence data underlie important analyses such as fault localization and impact analysis. Current methods for discovering dependencies, developed primarily for fixed networks, assume that dependencies change only slowly and require relatively long monitoring periods as well as substantial memory and communication resources, all of which are impractical in the MANET environment. We describe a new dynamic dependence discovery method designed specifically for this environment, yielding dynamic snapshots of dependence relationships discovered through observations of service interactions. We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of the accuracy of the discovered dependencies, and draw insights on the selection of critical parameters under various operational conditions. Although operated under more stringent conditions, our method is shown to provide results comparable to or better than existing methods.", "paper_title": "On-Demand Discovery of Software Service Dependencies in MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529700013"}
