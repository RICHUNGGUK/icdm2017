In addition to retaining the best K nodes, we also consider all the nodes whose costs are within a certain margin of the cost of the Kth best node. The resulting algorithm is called improved K-best sphere decoder (IKSD). Three IKSD variants are considered in this letter, which are fixed threshold, normalized threshold and adaptive threshold IKSD. The proposed IKSD requires a smaller K (indicating lower complexity) while still achieving a better and near optimal performance compared to the conventional KSD. These gains are confirmed by the simulation results. For example, for the fixed threshold IKSD in a 4 x 4 16-QAM multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, with K = 2, it achieves the same performance as the conventional KSD (K = 16), yielding about 80% complexity savings. For coded MIMO systems, the IKSD is also extended as a list sphere decoder for joint iterative detection and decoding.", "paper_title": "Improved K-Best Sphere Detection for Uncoded and Coded MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300017"}
