Under certain conditions, the encoded signals can be reconstructed from the nonuniform spike time sequences using a time decoding machine. Time encoding and time decoding methods have been studied using the nonuniform sampling theory for band-limited spaces, as well as for generic shift-invariant spaces. This letter proposes a new framework for studying IF time encoding and decoding by reformulating the IF time encoding problem as a uniform sampling problem. This framework forms the basis for two new algorithms for reconstructing signals from spike time sequences. We demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction algorithms are faster, and thus better suited for real-time processing, while providing a similar level of accuracy, compared to the standard reconstruction algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Novel Reconstruction Framework for Time-Encoded Signals with Integrate-and-Fire Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000360091800003"}
