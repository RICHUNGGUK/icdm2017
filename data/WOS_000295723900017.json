Such reactor is known to show oscillatory behavior and to have periodic limit points, particularly at high molecular weights. Four efficient novel hybrid optimization methods which use variable population size genetic algorithm (VPGA), bacterial optimization algorithm (BO) and shuffled frog leaping method (SFL) were introduced for this kind of reactors. These algorithms can reliably find dynamically stable points with desired conditions for PVAc production. The dynamic modeling combined with the new hybrid optimization methods were used to obtain the optimal operating conditions which increased the outlet flow rate by 17%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
