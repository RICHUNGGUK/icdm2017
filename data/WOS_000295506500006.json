The dynamic analysis uses an analytical solution and accounts for spatial variability, sensor placement and actuator delay. The optimization algorithm deals with model geometry, deck sections and control algorithm as design variables. Control devices were used to improve the dynamic properties and energy dissipation.", "paper_title": "Optimum design of a controlled cable stayed bridge subject to earthquakes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295506500006"}
