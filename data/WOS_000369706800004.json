However, examiners encountered difficulties in acquiring complete memory dump from MTK Android phones, a popular brand of smartphones, due to a lack of technical knowledge on the phone architecture and that system manuals are not always available. This research will perform tests to capture data from MTK Android phone by applying selected forensic tools and compare their effectiveness by analyzing the extracted results. It is anticipated that a generic extraction tool, once identified, can be used on different brands of smartphones equipped with the same CPU chipset.", "paper_title": "DATA EXTRACTION ON MTK-BASED ANDROID MOBILE PHONE FORENSICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000369706800004"}
