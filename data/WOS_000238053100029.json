Classical approaches use heuristics, statistical tests, or a meta-learning level in order to find out the optimal combination function. NW study this problem from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. In our modeling, an agent tries to earn the best policy for selecting classifiers by exploring a state space and considering a future cumulative reward from the environment. We evaluate our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art combination methods and obtain very promising results.", "paper_title": "Ensemble pruning using reinforcement learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100029"}
