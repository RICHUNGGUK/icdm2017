Some scholars claim that by doing so, we can also produce a forecast of the result. Relying on a proper methodology for sentiment analysis remains a crucial issue in this respect. In this work, we apply the supervised method proposed by Hopkins and King to analyze the voting intention of Twitter users in the United States (for the 2012 Presidential election) and Italy (for the two rounds of the centre-left 2012 primaries). This methodology presents two crucial advantages compared to traditionally employed alternatives: a better interpretation of the texts and more reliable aggregate results. Our analysis shows a remarkable ability of Twitter to nowcast as well as to forecast electoral results.", "paper_title": "Using Sentiment Analysis to Monitor Electoral Campaigns: Method Matters-Evidence From the United States and Italy", "paper_id": "WOS:000348103000001"}
