In such a setting, finding a stable matching of maximum size is NP-hard. We study the parameterized complexity of this problem, where the parameter can be the number of ties, the maximum or the overall length of ties. We also investigate the applicability of a local search algorithm for the problem. Finally, we examine the possibilities for giving an FPT algorithm or an FPT approximation algorithm for finding an egalitarian or a minimum regret matching.", "paper_title": "Parameterized Complexity and Local Search Approaches for the Stable Marriage Problem with Ties", "paper_id": "WOS:000278615500012"}
