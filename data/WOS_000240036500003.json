These are sub-systems that must operate and be controlled simultaneously with data or signal processing. The core integrates, for example, the control loop of two practical systems for typical light deflection purposes. An application is presented where the core is also applied for developing a complete image projection system. Experimental results show that an FPGA with modest resources, namely the SPARTAN-IIs300e, is able to fulfill the basic requirements of these applications.", "paper_title": "Configurable embedded core for controlling electro-mechanical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500003"}
