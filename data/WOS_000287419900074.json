Although mining blogs may share many similarities to Web and text documents, existing techniques need to be reevaluated and adapted for the multidimensional representation of blog data, which exhibit dimensions not present in traditional documents, such as tags. Blog tags are semantic annotations in blogs which can be valuable sources of additional labels for the myriad of blog documents. In this paper, we present a tag-topic model for blog mining, which is based on the Author-Topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The tag-topic model determines the most likely tags and words for a given topic in a collection of blog posts. The model has been successfully implemented and evaluated on real-world blog data.
