In addition, the jobs are related by a series-parallel graph. It is shown that for the general linear problem to minimize the makespan, polynomial algorithms exist. It is also shown that for the proportional linear problem of minimization of the total weighted completion time, polynomial algorithms exist, too. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
