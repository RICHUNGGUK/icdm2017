This field has experienced a major development in recent years. One reason for this has been the increase in the number of sound sources used in playback applications available to users. Another reason is the growing need to incorporate new effects and to improve the hearing experience. Massive convolution requires high computing capacity. GPUs offer the possibility of parallelizing these operations. This allows us to obtain the processing result in much shorter time and to free up CPU resources. One important aspect lies in the possibility of overlapping the transfer of data from CPU to GPU and vice versa with the computation, in order to carry out real-time applications. Thus, a synthesis of 3D sound scenes could be achieved with only a peer-to-peer music streaming environment using a simple GPU in your computer, while the CPU in the computer is being used for other tasks. Nowadays, these effects are obtained in theaters or funfairs at a very high cost, requiring a large quantity of resources. Thus, our work focuses on two mains points: to describe an efficient massive convolution implementation and to incorporate this task to real-time multichannel-sound applications.", "paper_title": "Real-time massive convolution for audio applications on GPU Massive convolution on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000296635800020"}
