For example it is proved that for any r, k >= 2 there exists infinitely many (r, k)-configurations. Most proofs are given from a graph theoretical point of view, in the sense that the configurations are represented by their incidence graphs. An application to private information retrieval is described.", "paper_title": "ASSOCIATING A NUMERICAL SEMIGROUP TO THE TRIANGLE-FREE CONFIGURATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293562800020"}
