Specifically, multiple real-time traffic metrics including latency, loss, and queue depth are normalized and processed via an array of ranking functions and multiplexed into an aggregate rank. This aggregate rank is then used in a fractional knapsack scheduling implementation. Experiments with this scheduling mechanism show improved traffic processing intelligence over existing scheduling models, especially in overload states.", "paper_title": "Overload-state downlink resource allocation in LTE MAC layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600024"}
