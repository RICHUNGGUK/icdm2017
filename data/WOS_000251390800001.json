The paper considers the convergence of cascade algorithms in Sobolev spaces. With the help of the factorization of matrix masks, we give a sufficient condition for the convergence. The condition is expressed in the time domain. More importantly, an algorithm for the construction of convergent cascade algorithms in Sobolev space starting from any matrix mask satisfying a mild condition is presented. Examples are given to illustrate our theorems.", "paper_title": "A construction of convergent cascade algorithms in Sobolev spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800001"}
