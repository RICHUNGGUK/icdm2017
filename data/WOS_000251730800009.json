In this paper, an improved statistical approach to extracting whole cerebrovascular tree in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography is proposed. Firstly, in order to get a more accurate segmentation result, a localized observation model is proposed instead of defining the observation model over the entire dataset. Secondly, for the binary segmentation, an improved Iterative Conditional Model (ICM) algorithm is presented to accelerate the segmentation process. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can obtain more satisfactory segmentation results and save more processing time than conventional approaches, simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Adaptive segmentation of cerebrovascular tree in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography", "paper_id": "WOS:000251730800009"}
