The scheduler must ensure that the demand for the common resource never exceeds the available capacity. This introduces an orthogonal constraint to the classical minimum makespan scheduling problem. Such a constraint also arises in other contexts where a common resource is shared across machines. We study the non-preemptive case of this problem and present a (2+I mu)-approximation algorithm which relies on the interplay of several classical and modern techniques in scheduling like grouping, job-classification, and the use of configuration-LPs. This improves upon previous bound of 3 that can be obtained by list scheduling approaches, and gets close to the (3/2-I mu) inapproximability bound. If the number of machines or the number of different resource requirements are bounded by a constant we obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme.", "paper_title": "Scheduling with an Orthogonal Resource Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000350873800004"}
