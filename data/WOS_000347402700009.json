In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for solving this problem that can achieve performance comparable with the most accurate algorithms with a speed comparable to the fastest ones. The main idea behind the proposed algorithm is to convert the problem of ARM discovery into a density estimation problem in the single dimensionality shift-space (rather than in the original time-series space). This makes the algorithm more robust to short noise bursts that can dramatically affect the performance of most available algorithms. The paper also reports the results of applying the proposed algorithm to synthetic and three real-world datasets in the domains of gesture discovery and motion primitive discovery.", "paper_title": "Shift density estimation based approximately recurring motif discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000347402700009"}
