Denoting by (X) over cap (n) and (Q) over cap (n), respectively, the diffusion scale deviation of the headcount process from the quantity corresponding to the underlying fluid model and the diffusion scale queue-length, we consider minimizing r.v.'s of the form c(X)(n) = integral(u)(0) C((X) over cap (n)(t)) dt and c(Q)(n) = integral(u)(0) C((Q) over cap (n)(t)) dt over policies that allow for service interruption. Here, C : R(I) -> R(+) is continuous, and u > 0. Denoting by. the so-called workload vector, it is assumed that C*(w) := min{C(q) : q is an element of R(+)(I), theta . q = w} is attained along a continuous curve as w varies in R(+). We show that any weak limit point of c(X)(n) stochastically dominates the r.v. integral(u)(0) C*(W(t)) dt for a suitable reflected Brownian motion W and construct a sequence of policies that asymptotically achieve this lower bound. For c(Q)(n), an analogous result is proved when, in addition, C* is convex. The construction of the policies takes full advantage of the fact that in this regime the number of servers is of the same order as the typical queue-length.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal interruptible service policies for scheduling jobs in a diffusion regime with nondegenerate slowdown", "paper_id": "WOS:000298880500003"}
