We start with the formulations of three fundamental cyclic scheduling problems, namely the cyclic jobshop, cyclic flow-shop, and cyclic project scheduling problems. We present state-of-the-art results on the computational complexity of the problems, paying special attention to recent results on the unsolvability (NP-hardness) of various cyclic problems arising from the scheduling of robotic cells.
