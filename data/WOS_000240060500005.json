With random access, an advice string of exponential length becomes meaningful for polynomially bounded complexity classes. We compare the power of complexity classes under this model. It gives a more stringent notion than the usual model of computation with relativization. Under this model of random access, we prove that there exist advice strings such that the polynomial-time hierarchy PH and parity polynomial-time circle plus P all collapse to P. Our main proof technique uses the decision tree lower bounds for constant depth circuits [Y], [C], [Ha], and the algebraic machinery of Razborov [R] and Smolensky [S].", "paper_title": "Random access to advice strings and collapsing results", "paper_id": "WOS:000240060500005"}
