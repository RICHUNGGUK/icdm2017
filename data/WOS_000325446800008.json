Gap junctions between the spines electrically couple neighboring neurons whereas the GABAergic synaptic terminals are thought to act to decrease the effectiveness of this coupling. Thus, the glomeruli are thought to be important for determining the oscillatory and synchronized activity displayed by 10 neurons. Indeed, the tendency to display such activity patterns is enhanced or reduced by the local administration of the GABA-A receptor blocker picrotoxin (FIX) or the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX), respectively. We studied the functional roles of the glomeruli by solving the inverse problem of estimating the inhibitory (g(i)) and gap-junctional conductance (g(c)) using an 10 network model. This model was built upon a prior 10 network model, in which the individual neurons consisted of soma and dendritic compartments, by adding a glomerular compartment comprising electrically coupled spines that received inhibitory synapses. The model was used in the forward mode to simulate spike data under PIX and CBX conditions for comparison with experimental data consisting of multi-electrode recordings of complex spikes from arrays of Purkinje cells (complex spikes are generated in a one-to-one manner by 10 spikes and thus can substitute for directly measuring 10 spike activity). The spatiotemporal firing dynamics of the experimental and simulation spike data were evaluated as feature vectors, including firing rates, local variation, auto-correlogram, cross-correlogram, and minimal distance, and were contracted onto two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) space. g and gi were determined as the solution to the inverse problem such that the simulation and experimental spike data were closely matched in the PCA space. The goodness of the match was confirmed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the PCA scores between the experimental and simulation spike data. In the PIX condition, gi was found to decrease to approximately half its control value. CBX caused an approximately 30% decrease in g from control levels. These results support the hypothesis that the glomeruli are control points for determining the spatiotemporal characteristics of olivocerebellar activity and thus may shape its ability to convey signals to the cerebellum that may be used for motor learning or motor control purposes.
