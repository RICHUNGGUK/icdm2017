The algorithm runs in linear time. We carried out good experimental results on real dictionaries, on biological sequences and on the sets of suffixes (resp. factors) of a set of words that shows how our automaton is near to the minimal one. For the suffixes of a text, we propose a modified construction that leads to an even smaller automaton. We moreover construct linear algorithms for the insertion and deletion of a word in a finite set, directly from the constructed automaton.", "paper_title": "ON-LINE CONSTRUCTION OF A SMALL AUTOMATON FOR A FINITE SET OF WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302061000005"}
