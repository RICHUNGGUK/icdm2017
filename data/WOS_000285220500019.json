It is demonstrated theoretically that the elastic component resulting from ECR coincides with principal components of PCA when alpha = 0 and also coincides with PLS components when alpha = 1. In this context, PCR and PLS occupy the two ends of ECR and alpha is an element of(0,1) will lead to an infinite number of transitional models which collectively uncover the model path from PCR to PLS. Therefore, the framework of ECR shows a natural progression from PCR to PLS and may help add some insight into their relationships in theory. The performance of ECR is investigated on a series of simulated datasets together with a real world near infrared dataset.
