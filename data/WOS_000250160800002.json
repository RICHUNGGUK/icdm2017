The sequence space is built from 20 amino acid long fragments of proteins from a very large collection of fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The fragments, points in the space, are connected, if they are closely related (high sequence identity). The connected fragments form variety of networks of sequence kinship. In this research the networks in the formatted sequence space and their topology are analyzed. For lower identity thresholds a huge network of complex structure is formed, involving up to 10% points of the space. When the threshold is increased, the major network splits into a set of smaller clusters with a wide diversity of sizes and topologies. Such \"evolutionary networks\" may serve as a powerful sequence annotation tool that allows one to reveal fine details in the evolutionary history of proteins.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary networks in the formatted protein sequence space", "paper_id": "WOS:000250160800002"}
