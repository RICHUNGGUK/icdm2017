Energy harvesting efficiency can be increased by eliminating AC/DC conversion. A test chip demonstrating self-timing, power-on reset circuitry, and dynamic memory for energy harvesting AC voltages has been designed in 180 nm CMOS and tested. An energy scalable DSP architecture implements FIR filters that consume as little as 170 pJ per output sample. The on-chip DRAM retains data for up to 28 ms while register data is retained down to a supply voltage of 153 mV. Circuit operation is confirmed for supply frequencies between 60 Hz and 1 kHz with power consumption below 130 mu W. Reaching the limits of miniaturization will require approaching the limits of power dissipation. We extrapolate from this DSP architecture to find the minimum volume required for mechanical vibration energy harvesting sensors.", "paper_title": "Scaling Self-Timed Systems Powered by Mechanical Vibration Energy Harvesting", "paper_id": "WOS:000279365300002"}
