As an answer to this challenge the networking community developed a wealth of piecemeal SDN troubleshooting tools aiming to track down misconfigurations or bugs of a specific nature (e.g. in a given SDN layer). In this demonstration we present EPDXIDE, an Emacs based modular framework, which can effectively combine existing network and software troubleshooting tools in a single platform and defines a possible way of integrated SDN troubleshooting.", "paper_title": "EPDXIDE: A Modular Prototype for SDN Troubleshooting", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200051"}
