Finding the optimal performance settings typically requires investigating all possible combinations of design parameters, while the number of required experiments increases exponentially for each considered design parameter. The aim of this paper is to analyze the applicability of global optimization techniques to reduce the optimization time of wireless experimentation. In particular, the paper applies the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm implemented in the Surrogate MOdeling (SUMO) toolbox inside a wireless testbed. Moreover, to cope with the unpredictable nature of wireless testbeds, the paper applies an experiment outlier detection which monitors outside interference and verifies the validity of conducted experiments. The proposed techniques are implemented and evaluated in a wireless testbed using a realistic wireless conferencing scenario. The performance gain and experimentation time of a SUMO optimized experiment is compared against an exhaustively searched experiment. In our proof of concept, it is shown that the proposed SUMO optimizer reaches 99.79% of the global optimum performance while requiring 8.67 times less experiments compared to the exhaustive search experiment.
