This is proven by defining a symmetric quantum state that is n-partite SLOCC inequivalent to the W state, and then constructing a totally correct anonymous leader election protocol using this state. This result, which contradicts the previous necessity result of D'Hondt and Panangaden, furthers our understanding of how non- local quantum states can be used as a resource for distributed computation.", "paper_title": "W-LIKE STATES ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR TOTALLY CORRECT QUANTUM ANONYMOUS LEADER ELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188700008"}
