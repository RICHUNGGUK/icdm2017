In this paper, we propose a 3D gyroscope-based handwriting recognition system that uses stepwise lower-bounded dynamic time warping, instead of conventional 3D accelerometer data. The results of experiments conducted indicate that our proposed method is more effective and efficient than conventional methods for user-independent recognition of the 26 lowercase letters in the English alphabet.
