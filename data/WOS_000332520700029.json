It is one of the dynamic behaviors that have been recognized in the dynamic fault tree analysis, where a dynamic gate called FDEP was designed to model such behavior. Traditional approaches to handling functional dependence in the reliability analysis of fault-tolerant systems with imperfect fault coverage are mainly based on Markov models, which are often computationally intensive, and even intractable due to the well-known state space explosion problem. In addition, the Markov-based approaches are typically restricted to exponential time-to-failure distributions for system components. In this paper, a combinatorial, separable method based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm and total probability theorem is proposed for addressing the above problems. The proposed method obviates the use of inefficient Markov models, offering exact, computationally-efficient solutions to the reliability analysis of imperfect coverage systems subject to functional dependencies. The proposed method is applicable to the analysis of large systems with any arbitrary time-to-failure distributions. Several case studies are given to illustrate the application and advantages of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial Reliability Analysis of Imperfect Coverage Systems Subject to Functional Dependence", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700029"}
