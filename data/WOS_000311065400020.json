Fast Tool Servo (FTS) machining is an enabling and efficient technology for fabricating high quality microlens arrays with submicrometer form accuracy and nanometric surface finish. Although there have been a number of studies on modeling and characterization of surface generation in Single Point Diamond Turning (SPTD), there is relatively little research on the modeling and characterization of surface generation in FTS machining of microlens arrays, which is radically different from SPTD and has additional process parameters. This paper therefore establishes a theoretical model for the prediction of surface generation in FTS machining of microlens arrays based on the cutting mechanism of FTS, cutting tool geometry, machining parameters, and the workpiece surface contour. A surface matching based method has been developed to characterize the surface quality of the microlens array as a whole instead of a single lens evaluation. A series of cutting experiments have been conducted, the actual results of which were found to largely agree with the predicted results. The successful development of the deterministic models and methods not only make the surface generation in FTS machining of microlens array more predictable, but also allow a better evaluation of the surface quality of the machined microlens array. It also helps to minimize or eliminate the need for conducting trial-and-error cutting experiments to optimize the machining process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
