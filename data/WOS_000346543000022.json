In this paper, we investigate the expressive efficiency of two kinds of binary-valued CP-nets, the first kind is set-structured CP-nets, and the second kind is equal difference CP-nets. For the first kind, we prove that it can express 3(n) - 2(n) preference relations with n preference rules, and has an expressive efficiency of (3(n) - 2(n))/n. For the second kind, we show that it can express a total order of 2(n-1) * (2(n) - 1) preference relations with 2(n) - 1 preference rules, and has an expressive efficiency of 2(n-1). For the future research, we propose an open problem: given an acyclic CP-net N with the in-degree sequence of (d(1), d(2), ..., d(n)), how many preference relations can be expressed by N?
