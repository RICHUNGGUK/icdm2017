When the inner code has a cyclic algebra structure over a number field, as for perfect space-time codes, an outer code can be designed via coset coding, more precisely, by taking the quotient of the algebra by a two-sided ideal which leads to matrices over finite alphabets for the outer code. In this paper, we show that the determinant criterion induces various metrics on the outer code, such as the Hamming and Bachoc distances. When n = 2, partitioning the 2 x 2 Golden code by using an ideal above the prime 2 leads to consider codes over either M-2(F-2) or M-2(F-2[i]), both being noncommutative alphabets. By identifying them as algebras over a finite field or a finite ring respectively, we establish an unexpected connection with classical error-correcting codes over F-4 and F4[i]. Matrix rings of higher dimension, suitable for 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 perfect codes, give rise to more complex examples.", "paper_title": "Codes Over Matrix Rings for Space-Time Coded Modulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900016"}
