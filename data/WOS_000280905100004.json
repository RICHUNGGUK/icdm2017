A method based on the power series solution is proposed to solve the natural frequency of very slender rotating beam at high angular velocity. The rotating beam is subdivided into several equal segments. The governing equations of each segment are solved by a power series. Numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The effect of Coriolis force, angular velocity, and slenderness ratio on the natural frequency of rotating beams is investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
