This paper studies the application of these models. Through setting reasonable values to the direct, inflow and direct outflow coefficient matrix, we computed the real complete inflow coefficient matrix and the real complete outflow coefficient matrix. By these matrixes, we did research on the quantitative relations between the commercial banks' deposits and loans and the total currency flow of all the sectors, and studied the influence of one sector's deposits and loans to all the other sectors. The results showed that the model proposed in this paper confirms to the economic meanings of currency flows very well. At last, this paper proposed a monetary policy-optimizing model based on the vertical equilibrium relations, and deduced the corresponding mathematical formulas.", "paper_title": "MULTI-SECTOR CURRENCY FLOWS BASED ON THE INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, PART 2: MODEL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300016"}
