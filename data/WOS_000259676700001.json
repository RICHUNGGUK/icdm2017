In the EDD-tree, all data points are first grouped into clusters by a k-means clustering algorithm. Then the uniform ID number of each data point is obtained by a dual-distance-driven encoding scheme, in which each cluster sphere is partitioned twice according to the dual distances of start- and centroid-distance. Finally, the uniform ID number and the centroid-distance of each data point are combined to get a uniform index key, the latter is then indexed through a partition-based B+-tree. Thus, given a query point, its k-NN search in high-dimensional spaces can be transformed into search in a single dimensional space with the aid of the EDD-tree index. Extensive performance studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed scheme, and the results demonstrate that this method outperforms the state-of-the-art high-dimensional search techniques such as the X-tree, VA-file, iDistance and NB-tree, especially when the query radius is not very large.", "paper_title": "An encoding-based dual distance tree high-dimensional index", "paper_id": "WOS:000259676700001"}
