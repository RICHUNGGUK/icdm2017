Given a system R, we are interested in the lengths of the reductions in the smallest valleys t ->* s'* <- t' expressed as a function: - for confluence a function vs(R)(m, n) where the valleys are for peaks t* <- s ->* t' with s of size at most m and the reductions of maximum length n, and - for the Church-Rosser property a function cvs(R)(m, n) where the valleys are for conversions t <->* t' with t and t' of size at most m and the conversion of maximum length n. For confluent Term Rewriting Systems (TRSs), we prove that vs(R) is a total computable function, and for linear such systems that cvs(R) is a total computable function. Conversely, we show that every total computable function is the lower bound on the functions vs(R)(m, n) and cvs(R)(m, n) for some TRS R: In particular, we show that for every total computable function phi : N -> N there is a TRS R with a single term s such that vs(R)(vertical bar s vertical bar, n) >= phi(n) and cvs(R)(n, n) >= phi(n) for all n. For orthogonal TRSs R we prove that there is a constant k such that: (a) vs(R)(m, n) is bounded from above by a function exponential in k and (b) cvs(R)(m, n) is bounded from above by a function in the fourth level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. Similarly, for lambda-calculus, we show that vs(R)(m, n) is bounded from above by a function in the fourth level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy.", "paper_title": "Least Upper Bounds on the Size of Confluence and Church-Rosser Diagrams in Term Rewriting and lambda-Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000329129900007"}
