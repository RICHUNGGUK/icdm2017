Using lattice-based methods finding small integer solutions of modular linear equations, we recover the secret key of this cryptosystem for a certain range of parameters. In experiments, for the suggested parameters by Wang and Hu, the secret key can be recovered in seconds.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of a Public Key Cryptosystem Based on the Matrix Combinatorial Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000321935800004"}
