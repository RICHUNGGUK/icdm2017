It can be applied to a variety of different data types, such as gene expression, protein levels, operons or phylogenetic pro. les. In this article, we investigate different approaches to extract relevant pathways from metabolic networks. Although these approaches have been adapted to metabolic networks, they are generic enough to be adjusted to other biological networks as well. Results: We comparatively evaluated seven sub-network extraction approaches on 71 known metabolic pathways from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a metabolic network obtained from MetaCyc. The best performing approach is a novel hybrid strategy, which combines a random walk-based reduction of the graph with a shortest paths-based algorithm, and which recovers the reference pathways with an accuracy of similar to 77%.", "paper_title": "Pathway discovery in metabolic networks by subgraph extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000277225400012"}
