A product service system (PSS) is presented in this paper which aims to better integrate product development with maintenance and service operations. This project focuses on the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services in the aerospace industry. A MRO service model is proposed for the development of the proposed PSS. An ontology-based knowledge representation model is developed for the reuse of knowledge unambiguously in MRO services. An initial attempt has been made to demonstrate the role of PSS in the aerospace industry as a decision support tool for MRO services. Product lifecycle management (PLM) environment and Web-based technologies have been developed to enable the methodology to provide services and support in the aerospace manufacturing and flight operations business.
