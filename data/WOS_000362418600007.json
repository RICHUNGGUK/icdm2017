Especially, the confidence interval of those measures might be required for statistical analysis. In this situation, the traditional method that utilizes the central limit theorem (CLT) is inapplicable if the output data set has autocorrelation structure. The bootstrap is one of the most suitable methods which can reflect the autocorrelated phenomena in statistical analysis. Therefore, the confidence interval for a time averaged measure having autocorrelation structure can also be calculated by the bootstrap methods. This study introduces the method that constructs these confidence intervals applying the bootstraps. The bootstraps proposed are the threshold bootstrap (TB), the moving block bootstrap (MBB) and stationary bootstrap (SB). Finally, some numerical examples will be provided for verification.", "paper_title": "Bootstrap generated confidence interval for time averaged measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000362418600007"}
