An efficient and accurate numerical scheme is presented and implemented for the coupled nonlinear systems of Navier-Stokes type linear momentum equations and volume preserving Allen-Cahn type phase equations. Detailed numerical simulations for a Newtonian fluid filament falling into another ambient Newtonian fluid are carried out. The dynamical scaling behavior and the pinch-off behavior, as well as the formation of the consequent satellite droplets are investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
