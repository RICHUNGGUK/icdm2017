From these, convergence results based on the order of the underlying Taylor method, the choice of the iteration method, the predictor, and the number of iterations, for It and Stratonovich SDEs, and for weak as well as strong convergence are derived. As special case, also the application of Taylor methods to ODEs is considered. The theory is supported by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "B-series analysis of iterated Taylor methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000294463100005"}
