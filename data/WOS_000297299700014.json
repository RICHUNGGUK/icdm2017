In this article we propose a new approach, where the computation of the minimal-volume OBB is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem on the rotation group SO(3, R). It is solved using a hybrid method combining the genetic and Nelder-Mead algorithms. This method is analyzed and then compared to the current state-of-the-art techniques. It is shown to be either faster or more reliable for any accuracy.", "paper_title": "Fast Oriented Bounding Box Optimization on the Rotation Group SO(3, R)", "paper_id": "WOS:000297299700014"}
