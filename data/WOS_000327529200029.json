This paper presents a stochastic evolution (StocE) algorithm for solving the MOSP problem. The proposed algorithm is a single-solution-based evolutionary algorithm (EA) with an archive for storing several non-dominant solutions. The solution quality of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the established population-based EAs. In StocE, the solution replaces its bad characteristics as the generations evolve. In the proposed algorithm, different sub-paths are the characteristics of the solution. Using the proposed perturb operation, it eliminates the bad sub-paths from generation to generation. The experiments were conducted on huge real road networks. The proposed algorithm is comparable to well-known single-solution and population-based EAs. The single-solution-based EAs are memory efficient, whereas, the population-based EAs are known for their good solution quality. The performance measures were the solution quality, speed and memory consumption, assessed by the hypervolume (HV) metric, total number of evaluations and memory requirements in megabytes. The HV metric of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the existing single-solution and population-based EAs. The memory requirements of the proposed algorithm is at least half than the EAs delivering similar solution quality. The proposed algorithms also executes more rapidly than the existing single-solution-based algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving MOSP problems in embedded systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
