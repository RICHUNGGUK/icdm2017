The integration level for nanoscale electronic devices could eventually be in the range of 10(10) to 10(11) devices per square centimeter. At this level, long interconnects represent a significant challenge to operation, design, and manufacturing. Given these realities, future nanoscale technology could drive a migration to different information-processing and computing approaches, such as digital cellular automata.", "paper_title": "Assessment of integrated digital cellular automata architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000252175100010"}
