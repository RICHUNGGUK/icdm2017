Design/methodology/approach - Aggregation and decomposition of mathematical models of operations, performed using analytical-numerical optimization methods, lead to serial and parallel structures for which allocation algorithms are known. Evaluation of allocations carried out by means of a computer simulation. Findings - Resource allocation problems for mixed-structure operation systems may be solved by applying aggregation, decomposition and allocation algorithms determined for simple structures. Allocation algorithms based on C-uncertain variables outperform these based on basic uncertain variables. Research limitations/implications - Application of the presented algorithms is limited to some mixed structures, however, the methodology used appears general enough to allow developing algorithms for other mixed structures. Practical implications - The algorithms developed may be embedded into a knowledge-based system supporting management-level decisions concerning optimal distribution of limited financial resources. Originality/value - Originally determined rules for aggregation and decomposition, as well as resulting allocation algorithms. The presented methodology seems promising for developing a general resource allocation algorithm - valid for any mixed structure of an operation system.", "paper_title": "Application of C-uncertain variables and systemic approach to resource distribution in a class of operation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270378700016"}
