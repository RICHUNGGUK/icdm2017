This class of models is an extension of Lo's (Ann. Stat. 12:351-357, 1984) kernel mixture model for independent observations. The kernel represents a known distribution of time series conditional on past time series and both present and past latent variables. The latent variables are independent samples from a Dirichlet process, which is a random discrete (almost surely) distribution. This class of models includes an infinite mixture of autoregressive processes and an infinite mixture of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) processes.", "paper_title": "A Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithm for a class of mixture time series models", "paper_id": "WOS:000285363700006"}
