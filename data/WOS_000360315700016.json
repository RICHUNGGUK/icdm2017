Various solutions have been proposed to enable efficient energy usage in wireless networks, and these approaches are referred to as green wireless communications and networking. In this survey, we mainly focus on energy-efficient techniques in base stations and mobile terminals as they constitute the major sources of energy consumption in wireless access networks, from the operator and user perspectives, respectively. Unlike the existing articles and surveys, we aim to present a unified treatment of green solutions and analytical models for both network operators and mobile users. Such a unified treatment will help in the future to develop green solutions that enable an improved and balanced efficient usage of energy by operators and end users.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Green Mobile Networking: From the Perspectives of Network Operators and Mobile Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000360315700016"}
