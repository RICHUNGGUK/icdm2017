WDM-PON mitigates the complicated time-sharing and power budget issues in time-division-multiplexed PON (TDM-PON) by providing virtual point-to-point optical connectivity to multiple end users through a dedicated pair of wavelengths. There are a few hurdles to overcome before WDM-PON sees widespread deployment. Several key enabling technologies for converged WDM-PON systems are demonstrated, including the techniques for longer reach, higher data rate, and higher spectral efficiency. The cost-efficient architectures are designed for single-source systems and resilient protection for traffic restoration. We also develop the integrated schemes with radio-over-fiber (RoF)-based optical-wireless access systems to serve both fixed and mobile users in the converged optical platform.", "paper_title": "Key Technologies of WDM-PON for Future Converged Optical Broadband Access Networks [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408300005"}
