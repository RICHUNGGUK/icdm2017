In this paper we analyze how a \"born global\" start-up firm is linked to different types of places, and how it explores and exploits different territorial innovation potentials. Our case company-i.e., Living PlanIT-develops, tests and sells smart city software to processes real-time information collected through sensors embedded in a city's buildings and infrastructure towards energy savings and manifold efficiency gains. The paper illustrates how the interaction with different places and knowledge-based cities provides unique resources for the technology development, search, experimentation, market formation and societal legitimation. Beyond focusing on a place's fixed knowledge assets, the paper empirically assesses the innovation functions of different types of knowledge-cities and temporary \"non-places\" such as international high-level events.
