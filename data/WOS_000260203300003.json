Reconfigurable systems avoid costly modifications required to change and adapt to changes in product, production and services. A fully automated, collaborative, and integrated while reconfigurable Manufacturing system proves Cost-effective in the long term and is a promising Strategy for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, there is a lack Of Computing models to facilitate the design and development of control and management systems in a truly reconfigurable manner. This paper presents all innovative Computing model for reconfigurable systems and controlled manufacturing processes while allowing for the integration of modern technologies to facilitate reconfiguration, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA). Shop floor manufacturing activities are modeled as processes from a business perspective. A process-driven formal method that builds on prior research oil virtual production lines is proposed for the formation of a reconfigurable cross-facility manufacturing system. The trajectory of the controlled manufacturing systems is optimized for on-demand production services. Reconfigurable process controllers are introduced in support of the essential system reconfigurability Of future semiconductor manufacturing systems. Implementation of this approach is also presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
