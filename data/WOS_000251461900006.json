When the dimension d is unbounded, the problem is equivalent to graph isomorphism and is conjectured to be in FPT. When vertical bar A vertical bar = m vertical bar B vertical bar = n, the problem becomes that of deciding whether A is congruent to a subset of B and is known to be NP-complete. We show that point subset congruence, with d as a parameter, is W[1]-hard, and that it cannot be solved in O(mn(o(d)))-time, unless SNP subset of DTIME(2(o(n))). This shows that, unless FPT = W[1], the problem of finding an isometry of A that minimizes its directed Hausdorff distance, or its Earth Mover's Distance, to B, is not in FPT. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
