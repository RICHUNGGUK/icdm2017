The drift is modeled by a scaled linear combination of basis functions with a Gaussian prior on the coefficients. The scaling parameter is equipped with a partially conjugate prior. The number of basis functions in the drift is equipped with a prior distribution as well. For continuous data, a reversible jump Markov chain algorithm enables the exploration of the posterior over models of varying dimension. Subsequently, it is explained how data-augmentation can be used to extend the algorithm to deal with diffusions observed discretely in time. Some examples illustrate that the method can give satisfactory results. In these examples a comparison is made with another existing method as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
