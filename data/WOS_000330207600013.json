In order to reduce the effect of the offset of the operation amplifiers, the proposed BGR introduces feedback paths to not only realize sub-1V output but also reduce the factor of operation amplifier's offset voltage. In addition, a cross-coupled structure is dedicated to reduce the offset voltage factor further by increasing the bipolar junction transistor's base emitter voltage difference. The new proposed offset-compensated BGR has been successfully verified in a 0.5 mu m BCD process. The relative accuracy is increased by 4 times compared with the conventional circuit. Furthermore, the proposed circuit achieves a temperature coefficient of 8.5 ppm/A degrees C over a wide temperature range of -20 to 120 A degrees C, power supply rejection ratio of more than 70 dB at low frequencies and a line regulation of 0.09 % easily, without requiring additional operational amplifiers or complex circuits.", "paper_title": "A novel sub-1V bandgap reference with offset compensated techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000330207600013"}
