New microwatt off-grid powered devices are introduced that may be installed at any location in the network. These monitors are equipped with a unique software-defined address, allow status monitoring of network parameters, facilitate the integration of remote active elements such as switches, and scale up easily to thousands of devices. Such monitors may be used to identify and measure the power levels and connection availability of a customer's site independent of the subscribers' optical network termination (ONT). Even physical disconnection of a rogue or erroneous ONT is demonstrated. A hardware implementation using off-the-shelf components together with a special communication protocol was successfully demonstrated in a gigabit passive optical network (GPON) testbed, where random data were transmitted. The lowest power consumption with less than 2 mu W allows for powering with an optical supply channel or a small battery that lasts for a decade.", "paper_title": "In-Service Monitoring of PON Access Networks With Powerline Independent Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000344989200008"}
