In this study, we use two processes (pre process and post process) to select suitable rules and to explore the relationship among attributes In pre process, we propose a pruning process to select suitable rules by setting up a threshold on the support object of decision rules, to thereby solve the problem of too many rules The post process used the formal concept analysis from these suitable rules to explore the attribute relationship and the most important factors affecting decision making for choosing behaviours of personal investment portfolios In this study, we explored the main concepts (characteristics) for the conservative portfolio the stable job, less than 4 working years, and the gender is male, the moderate portfolio. high school education, the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), the gender is male, and the aggressive portfolio. the monthly salary between NT$30,001 (US$1000) and NT$80,000 (US$2667), less than 4 working years, and a stable job The study result successfully explored the most important factors affecting the personal investment portfolios and the suitable rules that can help decision makers.
