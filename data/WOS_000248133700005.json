Our general dimension provides tight upper and lower bounds on the query complexity for all sorts of queries, not only for example-based queries as in previous works. As an application we show that for learning DNF formulas, unspecified attribute value membership and equivalence queries are not more powerful than standard membership and equivalence queries. Further, in the approximate learning setting, we use the general dimension to characterize the query complexity in the statistical query as well as the learning by distances model. Moreover, we derive close bounds on the number of statistical queries needed to approximately learn DNF formulas. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
