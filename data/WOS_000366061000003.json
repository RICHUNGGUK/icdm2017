An editable university digital museum system was proposed and developed according to the learning theory and used in the Zhejiang University History Museum. In addition, the input and output efficiency of the system was compared with that of the university digital museum based on X3D. Finally, the editable university digital museum system was used in informal learning. The result indicated that the editable university digital museum system is superior to the traditional 3D digital museum in development speed as well as the immersive, management and learning effects.", "paper_title": "The Development and Educational Application of Editable University Digital Museum", "paper_id": "WOS:000366061000003"}
