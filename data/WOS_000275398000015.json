Compared with the corresponding already introduced topologies, the proposed CCCII offers the advantage of low-voltage operation capability. In addition, due to the absence of PNP or PMOS transistors for handling ac signals, its performance in terms of maximum frequency of operation is improved.", "paper_title": "Low-voltage current controlled current conveyor", "paper_id": "WOS:000275398000015"}
