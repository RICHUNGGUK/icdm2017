This article proposes an adapted CLONALG algorithm to simultaneously construct IRT-based parallel tests. Based on the CLONALG features, the proposed scheme can use a single test construction model to simultaneously construct multiple parallel tests. At the same time, it avoids the inequality problem in the sequential construction and solves the drawback of larger numbers of variables and constraints in the simultaneous construction. The serial experiments show that the proposed scheme has a lower deviation in simultaneously constructing parallel tests than the Linear Programming (LP) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). It is also able to construct parallel tests with identical test specifications from a large item bank.", "paper_title": "Simultaneously construct IRT-based parallel tests based on an adapted CLONALG algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000303480300015"}
