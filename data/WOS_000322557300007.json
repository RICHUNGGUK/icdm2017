We show that the network Msw(H; G) lends itself to optoelectronic implementation and examine its topological and algorithmic. We derive the length of a shortest path joining any two vertices in Msw(H; G) and consequently a formula for the diameter. We show that if G has connectivity kappa >= 1 and H has connectivity lambda >= 1 where lambda <= kappa then Msw(H; G) has connectivity at least kappa + lambda, and we derive upper bounds on the (kappa + lambda)-diameter of Msw(H; G). Our analysis yields distributed routing algorithms for a distributed-memory multiprocessor whose underlying topology is Msw(H; G). We also prove that if G and H are Cayley graphs then Msw(H; G) need not be a Cayley graph, but when H is a bipartite Cayley graph then Msw(H; G) is necessarily a Cayley graph. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
