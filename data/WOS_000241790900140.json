Reorganization is the essential capability for an organization to achieve organizational objectives flexibly and becomes one of the key issues of organization theories. To represent formally the dynamic process of reorganization in multi-agent systems, in this paper, we formulate a graph transformation based model of reorganization process in the context of organizational structures. In this model, a multi-level graph is proposed to capture main elements and their inter-relations of the organization and the specific operational semantics of organizational changes are defined with the graph manipulation of this graph based on graph transformation rules. Finally, for methodologies, we specify the examples of applying this graph transformation approach to the transition of organizational structures during the reorganization process.", "paper_title": "A graph transformation system model of dynamic reorganization in multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900140"}
