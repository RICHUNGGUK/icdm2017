The tool itself is another MAS which is deployed and coexists alongside the one being studied. This characteristic allows us to adapt PeMMAS to any scenario in which MAS deployment in JADE is used. PeMMAS extracts information from the target MAS regarding the use of system resources, the flight time for comprehensive messages according to agent type, as well as the processing time for actions. After processing this information, PeMMAS sends a report to the final user for subsequent analysis.", "paper_title": "PeMMAS: A Tool for Studying the Performance of Multiagent Systems Developed in JADE", "paper_id": "WOS:000333100500003"}
