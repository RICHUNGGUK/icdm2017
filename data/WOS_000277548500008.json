In this approach, inconsistency is viewed as a property of data and described with annotations. To be more precise, every piece of data in a relation can have zero or more annotations with it and annotations are propagated along with queries from the source to the output. With annotations, inconsistent data in both input tables and query answers can be marked out but preserved, instead of being filtered in most previous work. Thus this approach can avoid information loss, a vital and common deficiency of most previous work in this area. To calculate query answers on an annotated database, we propose an algorithm to annotate the input tables, and redefine the five basic relational algebra operations (selection, projection, join, union and difference) so that annotations can be correctly propagated as the valid set of functional dependency changes during query processing. We also prove the soundness and completeness of the whole annotation computing system. Finally, we implement a prototype of our system, and give some performance experiments, which demonstrate that our approach is reasonable in running time, and excellent in information preserving.", "paper_title": "Annotation Based Query Answer over Inconsistent Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000277548500008"}
