With the advent of the Internet and its evolution, web-based expert systems have become very important. Moreover, the arrival of new mobile devices that can connect to the Internet has made it easy to access information from any place at any time, creating new requirements for web systems. The creation of an expert system normally requires certain technical knowledge and concepts of artificial intelligence (Al). If the need to make it accessible through the Internet is added, the degree of technical knowledge necessary for its development is greater, entailing an unaffordable cost for small and medium-sized companies. In this article, we present a tool for the development of web-based expert systems which permits the expert to define the knowledge without having to know anything about Al. The proposed inference engine is integrated in a web server through which it can be accessed from any device with an Internet connection. Finally, the article presents examples of developments achieved via the proposed framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
