As a formal framework, we consider the dynamic version of the well-studied Planted Bisection Model dyn-g(n, p, q) where the node set [n] of the network is partitioned into two unknown communities and, at every time step, each possible edge (u, v) is active with probability p if both nodes belong to the same community, while it is active with probability q (with q << p) otherwise. We also consider a time-Markovian generalization of this model. We propose a distributed protocol based on the popular Label-Propagation approach and prove that, when the ratio p/q is larger than n(b) (for an arbitrarily small constant b > 0), the protocol finds the right \"planted\" partition in O (log n) time even when the snapshots of the dynamic graph are sparse and disconnected (i.e., when p = Theta(1/n)).
