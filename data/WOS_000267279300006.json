Because of this, content-based music retrieval has attracted attention from the multimedia database and information retrieval communities. Content-based music retrieval requires us to be able to automatically identify particular characteristics of music data. One such characteristic, useful in a range of applications, is the identification of the singer in a musical piece. Unfortunately, existing approaches to this problem suffer from either low accuracy or poor scalability. In this article, we propose a novel scheme, called Hybrid Singer Identifier (HSI), for efficient automated singer recognition. HSI uses multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and nonvocal music segments to enhance the identification process; it achieves this via a hybrid architecture that builds profiles of individual singer characteristics based on statistical mixture models. An extensive experimental study on a large music database demonstrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and robustness.", "paper_title": "A Novel Framework for Efficient Automated Singer Identification in Large Music Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000267279300006"}
