Morse code is composed of a series of dots, dashes, and space intervals, and each element is transmitted by sending a signal for a defined length of time. A suitable adaptive automatic recognition method is needed for persons with disabilities due to their difficulty in maintaining a stable typing rate. To overcome this problem, the proposed method combines the support vector machines method with a variable degree variable step size LMS algorithm. The method is divided into five stages: tone recognition, space recognition, training process, adaptive processing, and character recognition. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method elicited a better recognition rate in comparison to alternative methods from the literature.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Morse code recognition using support vector machines for persons with physical disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400016"}
