The protocol employs a new method to isolate a session key from key confirmation keys so that there is no direct usage of hash functions in the protocol. The protocol is proved secure without random oracles in a variant of Bellare and Rogaway style model, an exception to current proof method in this style model in the ID-based setting. We believe that this key isolation method is novel and can be further studied for constructing more efficient protocols.", "paper_title": "A provable secure ID-based explicit authenticated key agreement protocol without random oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000259322900015"}
