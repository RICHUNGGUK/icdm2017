Here we introduce and investigate the concepts of aperiodic and of star-free formal power series over semirings and partially commuting variables. We prove that if the semiring K is idempotent and commutative, or if K is idempotent and the variables are non-commuting, then the product of any two aperiodic series is again aperiodic. We also show that if K is idempotent and the matrix monoids over K have a Burnside property (satisfied, e.g. by the tropical semiring), then the aperiodic and the star-free series coincide. This generalizes a classical result of Schutzenberger (Inf. Control 4:245-270, 1961) for aperiodic regular languages and subsumes a result of Guaiana et al. (Theor. Comput. Sci. 97:301-311, 1992) on aperiodic trace languages.", "paper_title": "On aperiodic and star-free formal power series in partially commuting variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000254920900009"}
