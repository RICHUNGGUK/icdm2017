H is a fixed directed acyclic graph. The problem is, given an input digraph G, to determine how many homomorphisms there are from G to H. We give a graph-theoretic classification, showing that for some digraphs H, the problem is in P and for the rest of the digraphs H the problem is #P-complete. An interesting feature of the dichotomy, absent from related dichotomy results, is the rich supply of tractable graphs H with complex structure.", "paper_title": "On counting homomorphisms to directed acyclic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500005"}
