By means of the theory of Riordan arrays, we solve the enumeration problem and we give a particular succession rule, called jumping and marked succession rule, which describes the growth of such words according to their number of ones. Moreover, the problem of associating a word to a path in the generating tree obtained by the succession rule is solved by introducing an algorithm which constructs all binary words and then kills those containing the forbidden pattern.", "paper_title": "Pattern 1(j+1)0(j) Avoiding Binary Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000305269500005"}
