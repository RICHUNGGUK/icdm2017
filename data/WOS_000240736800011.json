In contrast to previous mesh compression techniques, the approach enables us to progressively decompress an arbitrary portion of a mesh without decoding other non-interesting parts. This simultaneous support of random accessibility and progressiveness is accomplished by adapting selective refinement of a multiresolution mesh to the mesh compression domain. We present a theoretical analysis of our connectivity coding scheme and provide several experimental results. The performance of our coder is about I I bits for connectivity and 21 bits for geometry with 12-bit quantization, which can be considered reasonably good under the constraint that no fixed neighborhood information can be used for coding to support decompression in a random order.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution random accessible mesh compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800011"}
