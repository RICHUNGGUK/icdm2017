Most of the papers allowing position-dependent processing times consider only special cases, where the job processing times follow a specific function of the job-position. Polynomial time solutions have hardly been found for general position-dependent processing times in scheduling literature. In this note we provide one of these cases: we introduce a polynomial time solution for minimum makespan on an m-machine proportionate flowshop. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
