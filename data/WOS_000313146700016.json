We introduce a dominance relation in the framework of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information systems to come up with the concept we call a dominance-based interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information system (DIIFIS). This system is used to establish a dominance-based rough set model, which is grounded primarily on the substitution of the indiscernibility relation in the classic rough set theory with the aforementioned dominance-based relation. This relation is defined by the score and accuracy of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value. To simplify knowledge representation and extract useful and simple dominance-based interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy rules, we present two attribute reduction approaches to eliminating redundant information. To demonstrate the potential of these approaches, we apply them to computer auditing risk assessment, decision-making problems in wealth management, and pattern classification. Our findings confirm that the proposed rough set model is an effective means of extracting knowledge from dominance-based interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information systems.
