Two distributed Nussbaum-type control laws are proposed to solve the leaderless and leader-following adaptive consensus for heterogeneous multiple agents. Examples and simulations are given to verify their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "OUTPUT CONSENSUS OF NONLINEAR MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN CONTROL DIRECTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000356210500011"}
