We consider optimal re-use strategies for packages of disparate architectures brought together within a modern component framework. In this practical case study, the legacy codes include both procedural and object-oriented architectures. We consider also the special requirements on scientific component middleware, with a specific focus on high-performance computing. We present an example application in this component architecture and outline future development planned for this project.
