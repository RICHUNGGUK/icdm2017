Therefore, an overview of the most important classes of FEC codes is presented, assessing the most suitable to be used in time-division multiple access networks. Concerning the traffic characteristics and the properties of such networks, the Reed-Solomon codes were found to be the most appropriate, and an analysis of the performance improvement obtained with these codes is reported. The upstream performance of 10 Gbits/s Ethernet passive optical network systems employing the selected FEC code is evaluated and the benefits of introducing FEC are assessed, aiming for the minimization of characteristic impairments of such networks.
