A new variant of adaptive routing, which assumes perfect online information of continuous real-time link travel time, is proposed. Driver's speed profile is taken into consideration to realistically estimate travel times, which also involves the stochasticity of links in a dynamic network. An adaptive approach is suggested to tackle the continuous dynamic shortest path problem. A decremental algorithm is consequently developed to reduce optimization time. The impact of the proposed adaptive routing and the performance of the decremental approach are evaluated in static and dynamic networks under different traffic conditions. The proposed approach can be incorporated into vehicle navigation systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
