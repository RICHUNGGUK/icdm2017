Formal mathematical specification is promoted for writing unambiguous requirements, which can be used to judge the correctness and thus the reliability of PMGT. Mathematics is also shown to improve understandability, reusability and maintainability through modelling software modules as finite state machines. The proposed methodology includes explicit traceability between requirements, design, implementation and test cases. Traceability improves the verification of completeness and consistency and it allows for proper change management. To improve the reliability of PMGT, given the challenge that the correct solution is unknown a priori, an automated testing approach is adopted to verify the known properties of a correct solution, such as conformality and counterclockwise vertex numbering.
