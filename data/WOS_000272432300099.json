In order to investigate how capable the ANN technique is at estimating the prediction value for surface roughness, a real machining experiment is referred to in this study. In (lie experiment, 24 samples of data concerned with the milling operation are collected based on eight samples of data of a two-level DOE 2(k) full factorial analysis, four samples of centre data. and 12 samples of axial data All data samples are tested in real machining by using uncoated. TiAlN coated and SN(TR) coated cutting tools of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). The Matlab ANN toolbox is used for the modelling purpose with some justifications Feedforward backpropagation is selected as the algorithm with traingdx, learngdx, MSE, logsig as the training, learning, performance and transfer functions. respectively With three nodes in the Input layer and one node in the output layer, eight networks are developed by using different numbers of nodes in the hidden layer which are 3-1-1, 3-3-1. 3-6-1. 3-7-1, 3-1-1-1, 3-3-3-1, 3-6-6-1 and 3-7-7-1 structures It was found that the 3-1-1 network structure of the SN(TR) coated cutting too[ gave (lie best ANN model in predicting the surface roughness value This study concludes that the model for surface roughness in the milling process could be improved by modifying the number of layers and nodes ill the hidden layers of the ANN network structure, particularly for predicting the value of the Surface roughness performance measure As a result of the prediction, the recommended combination of cutting conditions to obtain the best Surface roughness value is a high speed with a low feed rate and radial rake angle.
