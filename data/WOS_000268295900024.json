[20]; Saurel et al. [30]. These methods deal with extended systems of hyperbolic equations involving a non-conservative volume fraction equation and relaxation terms. Following the same theoretical frame, we derive here an Eulerian diffuse interface model for elastic solid-compressible fluid interactions in situations involving extreme deformations. Elastic effects are included following the Eulerian conservative formulation proposed in Godunov [16], Miller and Colella [23], Godunov and Romenskii [17], Plohr and Plohr [27] and Gavrilyuk et al. [14]. We apply first the Hamilton principle of stationary action to derive the conservative part of the model. The relaxation terms are then added which are compatible with the entropy inequality. In the limit of vanishing volume fractions the Euler equations of compressible fluids and a conservative hyperelastic model are recovered. It is solved by a unique hyperbolic solver valid at each mesh point (pure fluid, pure solid and mixture cell). Capabilities of the model and methods are illustrated on various tests of impacts of solids moving in an ambient compressible fluid. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
