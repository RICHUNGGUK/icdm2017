The authors extend a mips processor with the ultra-reduced instruction set coprocessor (URISC). They evaluate the impact of single-upset faults on the instructions that are rendered faulty and the area and performance overhead of using a URISC.", "paper_title": "RELIABLE COMPUTING WITH ULTRA-REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COPROCESSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346634000010"}
