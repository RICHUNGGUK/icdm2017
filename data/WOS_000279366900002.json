The distinction between inner and boundary nodes of the network can provide valuable knowledge to a broad spectrum of algorithms. This article tackles the challenge of providing a scalable and range-free solution for boundary recognition that does not require a high node density. We explain the challenges of accurately defining the boundary of a wireless sensor network with and without node positions and provide a new definition of network boundary in the discrete domain. Our solution for boundary recognition approximates the boundary of the sensor network by determining the majority of inner nodes using geometric constructions, which guarantee that for a given d, a node lies inside of the construction for a d-quasi unit disk graph model of the wireless sensor network. Moreover, such geometric constructions make it possible to compute a guaranteed distance from a node to the boundary. We present a fully distributed algorithm for boundary recognition based on these concepts and perform a detailed complexity analysis. We provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and show that it is applicable to dense as well as sparse deployments.", "paper_title": "On Boundary Recognition without Location Information in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279366900002"}
