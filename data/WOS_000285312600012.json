Starting from the planar structure, the array antenna consisted of sixteen 2 x 2 subarrays is conformal to the cylinders with various curvature radii to fit the payload box of the airborne vehicle. The return losses are almost constant even if the curvature radius changes. Measured radiation patterns are compared with various curvatures at the same frequencies. The array can be easily placed on the aircraft payload or fuselage due to its ultra thin thickness, ultra lightweight, and conformal structure, which has potential airborne applications in polarimetric radar surveillance, remote sensing, and wireless communications.
