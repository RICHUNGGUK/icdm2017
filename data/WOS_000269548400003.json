It is necessary to conduct a survey on these protocols to investigate and compare among them. In this article, we present a survey on the protocols proposed for reliable data transport in space Internet, with a focus on the latest developments. The survey includes the following contents: (1) Classification of these protocols into different approaches; (2) Discussions and comments on the design and operation methods of the protocols; and (3) Comparisons and comments on the main techniques and performance of the protocols.", "paper_title": "Protocols for Reliable Data Transport in Space Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000269548400003"}
