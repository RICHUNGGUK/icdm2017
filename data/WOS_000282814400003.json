It is shown that the important block HPP rule behaves as an excellent classifier of the density in the initial configuration when applied to cells endowed with pondered memory of their previous states. If the weighing is made so that the most recent state values are assigning the highest weights, the HPP rule surpasses the performance of the best two-dimensional density classifiers reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "THE HPP RULE WITH MEMORY AND THE DENSITY CLASSIFICATION TASK", "paper_id": "WOS:000282814400003"}
