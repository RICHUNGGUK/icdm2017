Both methods are derived through analytical continuations from unitary to contractive transformations. We find that the methods are mathematically and numerically distinct: ECS is complex stretching that rotates the operator's spectrum into the complex plane, whereas PML is a complex gauge transform which shifts the spectrum. Consequently, the schemes differ in their times-stability. Numerical examples are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
