In this letter, we propose a model based on coevolution of biological quasi-species to characterize the propagation of polymorphic worms and the effect of IDSes on their dynamics. The model is used to derive the conditions required for the IDS to contain the worm. The model is validated using simulations.", "paper_title": "A Quasi-Species Model for the Propagation and Containment of Polymorphic Worms", "paper_id": "WOS:000268162600011"}
