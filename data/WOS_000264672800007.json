The resource space model and the semantic link network are applied in case-base construction for efficient resource management and reuse. Adaptation rules are generated from the case-base with the guidance of domain knowledge, which is also extracted from the case-base. The adaptation rules are refined before they are applied in the revision process. General domain knowledge is brought in to help accurate similarity computing. After solving each new problem, the adaptation rule set is updated by an evolution module in the retention process. The results of our experiment show that the obtained adaptation rules can improve the performance of the CBR system compared with a retrieval-only CBR system. The average solution difference error is decreased by 46.56%.
