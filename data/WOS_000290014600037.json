The model's derivation is given in an intuitive and physical manner. The model gives a non-homogeneous wave equation for the acoustic pressure where the right-hand side depends on the divergence of the nonlinear term of the NSE and external force. The stability, accuracy, convergence and implementation of the semidiscrete FEM scheme for a problem based on this model is studied. The rate of convergence depends on the FEM discretization for the wave equation and the L-2(0, T; L-2(Omega))-error of the flow variables acting as the acoustic source. We also present numerical results that confirm our theoretical predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
