Desigri/methodology/approach - By using four bootstrap methods; standard bootstrap (SB) confidence interval, percentile bootstrap (PB) confidence interval, bias-corrected percentile bootstrap (BCPB) confidence interval, and bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) confidence interval. A numerical simulation study is carried out in order to demonstrate performance of these proposed bootstrap confidence intervals. Especially, we investigate the accuracy of the four bootstrap confidence intervals by calculating the coverage percentage, the average length, and the relative coverage of confidence intervals. Findings - Among the four bootstrap confidence intervals, the PB method has the largest relative coverage in most situations. That is, the PB method is the best one made by practitioners who want to obtain an efficient interval estimation of availability. Originality/value - It is the first time that the relative coverage is introduced to evaluate the performance of estimation method, which is more efficient than the existing measures.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping comparison on availability of parallel systems with non-identical components", "paper_id": "WOS:000262020600010"}
