As suitable projection methods seem to be not amenable to distributed implementation, we first focus on a primal-dual algorithm to solve the utility-based power control problem subject to the SIR requirements. We prove a global convergence of the algorithm for a large class of utility functions and show that it can be implemented in a distributed wireless environment. However, the approach has an important drawback: An optimal solution may not exist as the SIR targets may be infeasible due to, for instance, channel effects. This motivates a reformulation of the problem so that an optimal solution always exists. We consider the possibility of using a barrier method to closely approach the desired SIRs of the users and combine this approach with the conventional utility-based power control problem to incorporate best effort users. We prove relevant properties of optimal solutions and propose a distributed recursive algorithm with global convergence. Finally, the performance of the proposed approaches is verified by simulations.", "paper_title": "Utility-based power control with QoS support", "paper_id": "WOS:000282045600012"}
