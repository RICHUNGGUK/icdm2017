When several data representations (or metrics) are available, they should be combined to build a single similarity matrix. Often the resulting combination is an indefinite matrix and can not be used to train the classifier. In this paper we introduce new methods to build a PSD matrix from an indefinite matrix. The obtained matrices are used as input kernels to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification tasks. Experimental results on artificial and real data sets are reported.", "paper_title": "From indefinite to positive semi-definite matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100084"}
