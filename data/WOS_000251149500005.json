For visual realism, the model should, at a minimum, bend smoothly under pure bending load conditions. For physical accuracy, it should bend approximately the same amount and shape as dictated by continuum mechanics. By matching the 2D MSD model with an elastic plate, we obtain a series of constraints on the parameters of the model. We find that for a 2D unstructured MSD model, it is necessary to apply preloads on the springs for accurate modeling of bending resistance. By simultaneously applying the constraints for both visual realism and physical accuracy, we can optimize the parameters of the model to enhance its fidelity. The simulation shows that the deformation of the optimized MSD model with preload is very close to the result obtained by the finite element method (FEM) under either point load condition or pressure load condition. With a much smaller computational burden compared with FEM, the optimized MSD model is especially suitable for real time haptic applications.", "paper_title": "Improved 2D mass-spring-damper model with unstructured triangular meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251149500005"}
