In contrast to previous works, this proposed approach guarantees the order of satisfactory degrees consistent with priorities. The decision-maker not only acquires satisfactory solution of all the objectives, but also realizes the preemptive priority requirement among them. The originally complex optimization problem is simplified and divided into two subproblems that are solved in sequence. Numerical examples and actual application show the proposed method's effectiveness, flexibility and efficiency in comparison with results from the literature.", "paper_title": "Two-step interactive satisfactory method for fuzzy multiple objective optimization with preemptive priorities", "paper_id": "WOS:000247285300009"}
