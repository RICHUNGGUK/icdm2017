These include broadcasting, multicasting, and gossiping (all-to-all communication). In this work we study such problems in static ad hoc networks. Since, in ad hoc networks, energy is a scarce resource, the important engineering question to be solved is to guarantee a desired communication pattern minimizing the total energy consumption. Motivated by this question, we study a series of wireless network design problems and present new approximation algorithms and inapproximability results.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient wireless network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000240364100001"}
