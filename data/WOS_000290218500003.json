Simultaneous management of construction materials and their data using ID devices for construction automation has been proposed. In this management scheme, workers or robots (1) acquire the ID of a device using an ID reader, (2) obtain construction material data using the ID, and (3) use the data to perform various tasks. In this scheme, the object pose is crucial because it can be changed by robots and workers who do not possess an ID reader or have not measured the pose previously. The proposed method uses the geometric relationship between the ID device attached to the object and the ID reader, and is based on the relationship between the relative displacements of multiple ID devices. The position and direction of each ID device and ID reader are measured with respect to the object and reference coordinate frames, respectively. Experimental results proved the feasibility of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Pose Estimation of Construction Materials Using Multiple ID Devices for Parts and Packets Unification", "paper_id": "WOS:000290218500003"}
