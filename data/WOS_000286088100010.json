The method involves discrete element simulation of TBM slurry shield advancement and considers explicitly soil excavation from the face, effects of varying face support pressure, and the influence of tunnel cover depth. For the cases studied, it is found that for tunnel cover depths (C/D) between 0.7 and 2.1, ground deformations inducing by the tunnelling can be controlled within a certain extent and tunnel face stability can ensured, provided the support pressure ratio (N) lies between 0.8 and 1.5. The proposed method is reasonably benefited to modeling the face stability in shield-driven tunnels in soft soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
