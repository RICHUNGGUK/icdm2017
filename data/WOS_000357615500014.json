We illustrate the method by constructing, in a natural manner, correct graph calculi for some multi-modal logics, which may include the global and difference modalities, and may have some special properties.", "paper_title": "On Graph Calculi for Multi-modal Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000357615500014"}
