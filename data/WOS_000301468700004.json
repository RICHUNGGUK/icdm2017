With buffers elimination, bufferless routing is emerging as a promising solution to provide power-and-area efficiency for NoC. In this paper, we present a new bufferless routing algorithm that can be coupled with any topology. The proposed routing algorithm is based on the concept of making-a-stop (MaS), aiming to deadlock and livelock freedom in wormhole-switched NoC. Performance evaluation is carried out by using a flit-level, cycle-accurate network simulator under synthetic traffic scenarios. Simulation results indicate that the proposed routing algorithm yields an improvement over the recent bufferless routing algorithm in average latency, power consumption, and area overhead by up to 10%, 9%, and 80%, respectively.
