However, features having smaller dimensions are removed by this operation, which may significantly alter the structure of thin-walled parts. To avoid potential production errors, this work describes in detail an algorithmic framework that makes beam compensation more reliable by computing laser scan paths for thin features. The geometry of the features can be adjusted by the scan paths by means of five intuitive parameters, which are illustrated with examples. Benchmarks show that the scan path generation comes at a reasonable cost without altering the computational complexity of the overall beam compensation framework. The framework was applied to Selective Laser Melting (SLM) to demonstrate that it can significantly improve the robustness of additive manufacturing. Besides robustness, the framework is expected to allow further improvements to the accuracy of additive manufacturing by enabling a geometry-dependent determination of the laser parameters.
