By introducing transmission matrix, nonlinear delayed Markovian jump systems model with partially unknown transition probabilities are established by multiple channels data transmission framework. Based on the obtained model, mode-dependent fault detection filters are used for residual generator, the addressed fault detection problem is converted into nonlinear H-infinity attenuation problem. Then the desired mode-dependent fault detection filters are constructed in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the fault detection systems are stochastically stable with H-infinity attenuation level. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
