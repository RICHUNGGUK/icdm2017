Via the backstepping technique and the minimal learning parameters algorithm, the problem is solved. Based on the Razumikhin lemma and neural networks' approximation capability, a new adaptive neural control scheme is developed. The proposed control scheme can ensure that the error variables are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in the sense of four-moment, while all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. Two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural control of stochastic nonlinear systems with multiple time-varying delays and input saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700025"}
