To make the planet more sustainable, abundant data has to be collected and analyzed from ecosystems for scientific decision-making, restoring and preserving natural resources. In this paper, an integrated systems approach has been proposed for the data acquisition and analysis in information management of an ecosystem; it is a direct extension of an agriculture ecosystem enterprise information system (AEEIS) developed by Xu et al. (Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 3:5-17, 2008). The challenges in system development have been discussed, and the significance of the developed system has been illustrated through a thorough discussion and a case study on the genetic coding and expression of antelopes. In the case study, an IoT-based enterprise information system (EIS) has been applied to investigate the effects of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on the adaptation mechanism to high altitude hypoxia. Two remarkable conclusions are (i) the levels of the STAT3 mRNA and protein vary from one tissue to another, and the highest level is in the lung tissue, and (ii) Tibetan antelope's expression of STAT3 mRNA and protein are higher than that from plain sheep. Based on the fact that a Tibetan antelope has a higher adaptability to hypoxia; it has illustrated that the hypoxic STAT3-specific expression is one of the molecular bases of high altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan antelope.", "paper_title": "An integrated systems approach to plateau ecosystem management-a scientific application in Qinghai and Tibet plateau", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520100007"}
