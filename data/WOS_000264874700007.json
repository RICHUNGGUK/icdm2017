The criterion is a minimization of total weighted tardiness. We establish a simple criterion to integrate machine availability constraints and scheduling decisions simultaneously. We propose a hybrid meta-heuristic to tackle the given problem. This meta-heuristic method, called EMSA, is a combination of two meta-heuristics: (1) Electromagnetic-like mechanism (EM); and (2) simulated annealing (SA). The hybridization is done to overcome some existing drawbacks of each of these two algorithms. To evaluate the proposed hybrid meta-heuristic method, we carry out a benchmark by which the proposed EMSA is compared with some existing algorithms as well as simulated annealing and electromagnetic-like mechanism alone in a fixed given computational time. All the related results and analysis obtained through the benchmark illustrate that our proposed EMSA is very effective and supersedes the foregoing algorithms.", "paper_title": "A hybridization of simulated annealing and electromagnetic-like mechanism for job shop problems with machine availability and sequence-dependent setup times to minimize total weighted tardiness", "paper_id": "WOS:000264874700007"}
