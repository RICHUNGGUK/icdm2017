The method is discussed and its advantages and limitations are pointed out. This is illustrated on fullerenes C12k+4 and four topological indices: the Wiener index, the edge Wiener index, the eccentric connectivity index, and the reverse Wiener index. The results for the edge Wiener index correct earlier computations from the literature. Related formulas are derived for cyclic phenylenes.", "paper_title": "Interpolation Method and Topological Indices: The case of Fullerenes C12k+4", "paper_id": "WOS:000307149200021"}
