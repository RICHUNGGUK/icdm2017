This paper presents a feature-oriented fuzzy shock-diffusion equation, where the shock term is used to sharpen edges along the normal direction to the isophote line (edge), while the diffusion term is used to remove artifacts (\"jaggies\") along the tangent direction. A fuzzy decision mechanism is used to preserve image features such as edge, texture and fine part. Finally, a shock capturing scheme with a special limiter function is developed to speed the process with numerical stability. Experimental results on real images demonstrate that our algorithm substantially OF improves the subjective quality of the enhanced images over conventional interpolations and some related equations.", "paper_title": "Feature-oriented fuzzy shock-diffusion equation for adaptive image resolution enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000108"}
