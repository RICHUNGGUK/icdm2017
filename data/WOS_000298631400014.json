This method integrates multiagent systems (MAS) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. An agent in MADE represents an individual to DE and a candidate solution to the optimization problem. All agents live in a lattice like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice point. In order to obtain optimal solution quickly, each agent competes and cooperates with its neighbors and it can also use knowledge. Making use of these agent-agent interaction and DE mechanism, MADE realizes the purpose of minimizing the value of objective function. MADE applied to optimal power flow is evaluated on 6 bus system and IEEE 30 bus system with different generator characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed method converges to better solutions much faster than earlier reported approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
