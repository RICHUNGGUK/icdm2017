A humanoid robot named TWNHR-3 with 26 degrees of freedom (DOFs) is designed so that it can do five basic motions. Four IR sensors and one electronic compass are installed on TWNHR-3 to detect the environment information including obstacles, the distances of the obstacles, and the directional angle of the robot. Based on the obtained information, an obstacle avoidance method is proposed to decide one behavior from five motions so that it can avoid obstacles and go to the destination area effectively. Some MATLAB simulation results with different number of obstacles and two real experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy control of humanoid robot for obstacle avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333600001"}
