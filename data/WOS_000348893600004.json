The proposed analysis is based on roots of the associated characteristic equation of the vector-generating function of system-length distribution at prearrival epochs. We provide the steady-state system-length distribution at random epoch by using the classical argument based on Markov renewal theory. The queueing-time distribution has also been investigated. Numerical aspects have been tested for a variety of interarrival-and service-time distributions and a sample of numerical outputs is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
