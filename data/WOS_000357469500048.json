The problems are referred to herein as f-SALBP and f-SULBP and the objectives that are considered to be satisfied are: (a) minimizing the numbers of stations, (b) maximizing the fuzzy line efficiency, (c) minimizing the fuzzy idleness percentage, and (d) minimizing the fuzzy smoothness index. In fact, the f-SALBP and f-SULBP are SALBP and SULBP generalization in fuzzy circumstance, respectively. Initially, the two problems are formulated and due to the uncertainty, variability and imprecision that often occurred in real-world production systems, the processing time of tasks are supposed as triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, to solve the problem, a hybrid multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed. A One-Fifth Success Rule (OFSR) is deployed for the selection and mutation operators to improve the genetic algorithm's performance. The results in the genetic algorithm are being controlled in convergence and diversity simultaneously by means of controlling the selective pressure (SP) and mutation rate. Likewise, a fuzzy controller to SP is employed for the OFSR toward a better implementation of the genetic algorithm. In addition, the Taguchi design of experiments is used for parameter control and calibration. Finally, the numerical examples are presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with the existing ones. The results show significantly better performance for the proposed algorithm.
