The system has been employed to empower research on very different platforms ranging from simple two-wheeled structures with only a few cheap sensors, to complex two-legged humanoid robots, with many actuators, degrees of freedom and sensors. It is flexible and adjustable enough to be used in part or as a whole, to target different research domains projects and questions, including Evolutionary Robotics, RoboCup and Artificial Language Evolution on Autonomous Robots (ALEAR, an EU funded cognitive systems project). In contrast to many other frameworks, the system is such that researchers can quickly adjust the system to different problems and platforms, while allowing maximum reuse of components and abstractions, separation of concerns and extensibility.
