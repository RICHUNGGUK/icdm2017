Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the approaches that can be successfully employed in such cases. However, due to the complexity of these processes, obtaining a suitable model is often a difficult task. In this paper a hybrid fuzzy modelling approach with a compact formulation is introduced. The hybrid system hierarchy is explained and the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy formulation for the hybrid fuzzy modelling purposes is presented. An efficient method for identifying the hybrid fuzzy model is also proposed. A MPC algorithm suitable for systems with discrete inputs is treated. The benefits of the MPC algorithm employing the proposed hybrid fuzzy model are verified on a batch-reactor simulation example: a comparison between MPC employing a hybrid linear model and a hybrid fuzzy model was made. We established that the latter approach clearly outperforms the approach where a linear model is used. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
