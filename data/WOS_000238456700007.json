The emulator works with Java applications by intercepting and perturbing application traffic at the socket API level. As traffic shaping takes place in the user-space by means of an instrumented socket implementation, using the toolkit does not require a modified interpreter. The way the emulator perturbs the communication preserves the TCP connection-oriented byte stream semantics. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
