It is usually difficult to build a precise BOF endpoint dynamic model because many input variables affect the endpoint carbon content and temperature. For this problem, two effective variables selection steps: mechanism analysis and mutual information calculation are proposed to choose appropriate input variables according to a variable selection algorithm. Then, the selected inputs are weighted on the basis of mutual information values. Finally, two input weighted support vector machine BOF endpoint dynamic models are constructed to predict endpoint carbon content and temperature. Results show that the variable selection for BOF endpoint prediction model is essential and effective. The complexity and precise of two endpoint prediction models are improved.
