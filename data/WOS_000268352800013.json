Test sets such as Waltz and Manners measure the speed of first order logic inference engines. However, to our knowledge, no test sets for propositional logic inference engines have heretofore been identified. This paper proposes and tests two test sets that measure the performance of propositional logic inference engines. The first, Chess, measures the speed at which individual rules are tested in a large test set. The second, the Christmas Tree, tests the speed of the chaining process using a binary tree of configurable depths.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE TESTING OF PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC INFERENCE ENGINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000268352800013"}
