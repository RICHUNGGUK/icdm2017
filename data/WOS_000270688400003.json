In introducing a complexity class PPAD, Papadimitriou [C.H. Papaclimitriou, On graph-theoretic lemmata and complexity classes, in: Proceedings of the 31st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1990, 794-801] proved that its 3D analogue is PPAD-complete about fifteen years ago. The complexity of 2D-SPERNER itself has remained open since then. We settle this open problem with a PPAD-completeness proof. The result also allows us to derive the computational complexity characterization of a discrete version of the 2D Brouwer fixed point problem. improving a recent result of Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papaclimitriou [C. Daskalakis, P.W. Goldberg, C.H. Papaclimitriou, The complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium, in: Proceedings of the 38th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing(STOC), 2006]. Those hardness results for the simplest version of those problems provide very useful tools to the study of other important problems in the PPAD class. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
