The resulting one-step decoding tree is cycle-free and achieves lower decoding complexity. Experimental studies show that the proposed convergence-optimization algorithm accelerates the convergence process by 33%.", "paper_title": "Design of Convergence-Optimized Non-Binary LDPC Codes over Binary Erasure Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200019"}
