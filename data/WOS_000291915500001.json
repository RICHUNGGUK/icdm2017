The system explores the feasibility of speeding up image analysis by tapping into split-second perceptual judgments of humans. We present an incremental learning system with less memory storage and computational cost for single-trial event-related potential (ERP) detection, which is trained using cross-session data. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on the task of target image detection. We apply linear and nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) and a linear logistic classifier (LLC) for single-trial ERP detection using data collected from image analysts and naive subjects. For our data the detection performance of the nonlinear SVM is better than the linear SVM and the LLC. We also show that our ERP-based target detection system is five-fold faster than the traditional image viewing paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
