The present method is characterized by high accuracy, robustness and simple implementation. Its advantages are highlighted by applying it to several benchmark problems (internal duct flow, flow over a backward facing step) and by extensive comparison with other numerical methods such as SIMPLE and CVP concerning accuracy and convergence. The accuracy of the predictions of the present method is demonstrated through comparison with experimental data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
