Particularly, there has been a significant focus on exploiting the use of small cells and heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In the latter, the economic and environmental impact of the energy consumption is a key concern. Although much research has been done to address the energy consumption in HetNets, existing approaches have failed to capture the key factors affecting it. In this paper, the energy consumption in HetNets is analyzed with a focus on their multi-layer nature and the dependence of the energy consumption on the spatio-temporal traffic demands and the internal base station hardware components. The problem of minimizing the energy consumption is then studied and characterized in terms of a 0-1 Knapsack-like problem. Due to the differences with the classical 0-1 Knapsack problem, an efficient algorithm is introduced to minimize the energy consumption by adjusting the cell-association and the base stations on-off policies. Such algorithm is shown to be applicable to the two- and m-layer HetNet cases. Performance evaluation is provided to identify the achievable energy savings of our algorithm and its effect on the energy consumption, activity, and load across multiple layers.", "paper_title": "Energy Consumption Analysis and Minimization in Multi-Layer Heterogeneous Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364856900006"}
