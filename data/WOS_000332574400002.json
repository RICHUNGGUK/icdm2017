Let denote the state space, the transition relation and the partition of induced by simulation equivalence. While some algorithms are designed to reach the best space bounds, whose dominating additive term is , other algorithms are devised to attain the best time complexity . We present a novel simulation algorithm which is both space and time efficient: it runs in space and time. Our simulation algorithm thus reaches the best space bounds while closely approaching the best time complexity.", "paper_title": "An efficient simulation algorithm on Kripke structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000332574400002"}
