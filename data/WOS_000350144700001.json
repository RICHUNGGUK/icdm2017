Deriving values for said model parameters via nonlinear regression, however, is challenging as usually one of the numerous local minima of the sum-of-squared errors (SSEs) is determined; furthermore, for different starting points, different minima may be found. Thus, nonlinear regression is prone to low accuracy and low reproducibility. Therefore, there is a need for a generally applicable, automated initialization of nonlinear least squares algorithms, which reaches a good, reproducible solution after spending a reasonable computation time probing the SSE-hypersurface. For this purpose, a three-step methodology is presented in this study. First, the SSE-hypersurface is randomly probed in order to estimate probability density functions of initial model parameter that generally lead to an accurate fit solution. Second, these probability density functions then guide a high-resolution sampling of the SSE-hypersurface. This second probing focuses on those model parameter ranges that are likely to produce a low SSE. As the probing continues, the most appropriate initial guess is retained and eventually utilized in a subsequent nonlinear regression. It is shown that this guided random search derives considerably better regression solutions than linearization of model functions, which has so far been considered the best-case scenario. Examples from infrared spectroscopy, cell culture monitoring, reaction kinetics, and image analyses demonstrate the broad and successful applicability of this novel method.
