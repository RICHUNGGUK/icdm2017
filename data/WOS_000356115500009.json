This study extends the literature significantly by examining the roles of key information sources in coping and threat appraisal development. This is accomplished by integrating protection-motivation with social learning theories. Through an email interview (n = 12) and two surveys (pilot, n = 115 and main, n = 339), the study identifies and shows how key information sources (knowledge regarding countermeasures, social influences, and experience of the threat) influence users' coping and threat appraisals and, ultimately, coping intentions.
