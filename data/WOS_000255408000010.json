Attempts to statically select a subset of efficient contracting operators fail to offer reliable performance speed-ups. By embedding the recency-weighted average Reinforcement Learning method into a constraint propagation algorithm to dynamically learn the best operators, we show that it is possible to obtain robust algorithms with reliable performances on a range of sparse problems. Using a simple heuristic to compute initial weights, we also achieve significant performance speed-ups for dense problems.", "paper_title": "A reinforcement learning approach to interval constraint propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255408000010"}
