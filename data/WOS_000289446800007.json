The extended finite element method (XFEM) is able to reproduce such discontinuities within elements. Robust and accurate interface capturing schemes with no restrictions on the interface topology are thereby enabled. This paper investigates different enrichment schemes and time-integration schemes within the XFEM. Test cases with and without surface tension on moving or stationary meshes are studied and compared to interface tracking results when possible. A particularly useful setting is extracted which is recommended for two-phase flows. An extension of this formulation for the simulation of free-surface flows and of floating objects is proposed.
