With the recent standardization of the new MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), the flexibility and implantation of adaptive video systems has increased due to the fact that DASH can operate on a conventional web infrastructure. In this paper we propose an estimation and adaptation system for DASH. The proposed adaptive algorithm is based on client buffer threshold and smooth throughput measures (based on the throughput of previous segments). Before DASH, the standard of Scalable Video Coding (SVC) also arose from the idea of adaptation. Both systems (adaptive system based on SVC and the proposed system for DASH) are compared in terms of Video Quality (VQ) metrics. The results show that the proposed system reacts properly to changes in the network capacity, while maintaining a minimum level of segments in the buffer. The user-perceived quality is better than in the SVC-based adaptive system although the generated traffic is higher.", "paper_title": "Adaptation engine for a streaming service based on MPEG-DASH", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200026"}
