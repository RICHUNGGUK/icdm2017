We present an algorithm that, given X and a tolerance epsilon on the data error, computes a set g, of polynomials such that each element of g, is \"almost vanishing\" at X and at all its equivalent sets (X) over tilde. The set g, is not, in the general case, a basis of the vanishing ideal l(X). Nevertheless g, can determine geometrical configurations simultaneously characterizing the set X and all its equivalent sets (X) over tilde. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
