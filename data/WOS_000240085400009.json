In order to overcome the premature convergence, the paper introduced a negative feedback mechanism into particle swarm optimization and developed an adaptive PSO. The improved method takes advantage of the swarm-diversity to control the tuning of the inertia weight (PSO-DCIW), which in turn can adjust the swarm-diversity adaptively and contribute to a successful global search. The proposed PSO-DCIW was applied to some well-known benchmarks and compared with the other notable improved methods for PSO. The relative experimental results show PSO-DCIW is a robust global optimization method for the complex multimodal functions, which can improve the performance of the standard PSO and alleviate the premature convergence validly.", "paper_title": "Adaptive particle swarm optimization with feedback control of diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400009"}
