Public displays can dynamically collaborate and group with each other so as to minimize information clutter and redundancy. We analyse the usability constraints of this scenario in terms of information layout on the screens. This allows us to introduce a decentralized architecture in which information screens as well as users are modeled by software agents. We then present a simulator that implements this system.", "paper_title": "Dynamic cooperative information display in mobile environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600020"}
