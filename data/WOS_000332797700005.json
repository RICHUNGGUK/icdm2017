Casson's rheological model is adopted and a local correction to the relaxation time is implemented in order to modify the viscosity. The hyperelastic, hardening and anisotropic behavior of a flexible arterial wall is discussed and a closed-form solution is used to predict the deformed configuration of the vessel. A partitioned staggered-explicit strategy to couple the LB method and such analytical prediction is proposed.", "paper_title": "Analysis of blood flow in deformable vessels via a lattice Boltzmann approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000332797700005"}
