Quite often, these large processes comprise software components as well as human actors, they face highly dynamic environments and their subsystems are updated and evolve independently of each other. Due to their dynamic nature and complexity, it might be difficult, if not impossible, to ensure at design-time that such systems will always exhibit the desired/expected behaviors. This, in turn, triggers the need for runtime verification and monitoring facilities. These are needed to check whether the actual behavior complies with expected business constraints, internal/external regulations and desired best practices. In this work, we present Mobucon EC, a novel monitoring framework that tracks streams of events and continuously determines the state of business constraints. In Mobucon EC, business constraints are defined using the declarative language Declare. For the purpose of this work, Declare has been suitably extended to support quantitative time constraints and non-atomic, durative activities. The logic-based language Event Calculus (EC) has been adopted to provide a formal specification and semantics to Declare constraints, while a light-weight, logic programming-based EC tool supports dynamically reasoning about partial, evolving execution traces. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we describe a case study about maritime safety and security and provide a synthetic benchmark to evaluate its scalability.", "paper_title": "Monitoring Business Constraints with the Event Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000329159900017"}
