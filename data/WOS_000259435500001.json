We will begin with Kleinrock's seminal work on modeling store and forward networks and its extensions, and end with the successful development of fluid models for the current Internet. The rest of the talk will focus on lessons learned from these endeavors and how modeling and analysis can and will play a role in the development of new networks (e. g., wireless networks, application-level networks). Finally, we conclude that one can have fun modeling networks while at the same time make a living.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Internet is fun!
