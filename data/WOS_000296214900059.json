The neural identifier which contains a self-organizing RBF (SORBF) network with structure and parameter learning is designed to online estimate a system dynamics using the gradient descent method. The SORBF network can add new hidden neurons and prune insignificant hidden neurons online. The smooth compensator is designed to dispel the effect of minimum approximation error introduced by the neural identifier in the Lyapunov stability theorem. In general, how to determine the learning rate of parameter adaptation laws usually requires some trial-and-error tuning procedures. This paper proposes a dynamical learning rate approach based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function to speed up the convergence of tracking error. Finally, the proposed IASRNC system is applied to control two chaotic systems. Simulation results verify that the proposed IASRNC scheme can achieve a favorable tracking performance.
