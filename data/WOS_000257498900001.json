This algorithm was implemented in the inhouse code DD3IMP. Attention is paid to the augmented lagrangian method adopted to treat the contact with friction problem. The global resolution of the coupled equilibrium and contact problem is performed in a single loop, with a static implicit iterative Newton-Raphson scheme. This demands particular attention in the contact search algorithm, which in this case adopts a parametric description of the tools. In order to highlight the adopted strategies a review of the state-of-the-art in sheet metal forming simulation is presented, with respect to models reliability and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Algorithms and strategies for treatment of large deformation frictional contact in the numerical simulation of deep drawing process", "paper_id": "WOS:000257498900001"}
