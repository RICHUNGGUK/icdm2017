Firstly, identifications of consumers buying behavior are performed by using multivariate statistical techniques based on real data bases and sociological approaches. Then the population is divided into appropriate groups according to the level of overbuying and a discrete compartmental model is constructed. The future short term addicted population is computed assuming several future economic scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
