Markov Strings are, in fact, a class of Markov processes, obtained by a mixing mechanism of stochastic processes, introduced by Meyer. We prove that Markov strings are strong Markov processes with the cadlag property. We then show how a very general class of stochastic hybrid processes can be embedded in the framework of Markov strings. This class, which is referred to as the General Stochastic Hybrid Systems (GSHS), includes as special cases all the classes of stochastic hybrid processes, proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "Toward a general theory of Stochastic Hybrid Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241528000001"}
