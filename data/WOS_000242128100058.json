The lazy PRM approach calculates a collision-free and feasible path for the mobile robot before it starts moving under the permanent protection of its DVZ. In the absence of dynamic obstacles, the control is performed by the lazy PRM approach and does not require reflex commands. In the presence of dynamic obstacles in its path, the reactive approach takes the control and generates commands to move the robot away from the intruder obstacles before forcing its DVZ to go back to the original state. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the planner proposed here.", "paper_title": "A reactive lazy PRM approach for nonholonomic motion planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100058"}
