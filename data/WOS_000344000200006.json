Flatness is a key geometrical feature of strip products in a cold rolling process. In order to achieve good flatness, it is necessary to reveal the factors that often influence the flatness quality, to develop a general flatness pattern predictionmodel that can handle the varying operating condition during the rolling of products with different specifications and to realize an effective flatness feedback control strategy. This paper develops a practical data mining-based flatness pattern prediction method for cold rolling process with varying operating condition. Firstly, the high-dimensional process measurements are projected onto a low-dimensional space (i.e., the latent variable space) using locality preserving projection method; at the same time, the Legendre orthogonal polynomials are used to extract the basic flatness patterns by projecting the high-dimensional flatness measurements into several flatness characteristic coefficients. Secondly, a mixture probabilistic linear regression model is adopted to describe the relationships between the latent variables and the flatness characteristic coefficients. Case study is conducted on a real steel rolling process. Results show that the developed method has not only the satisfactory prediction performance, but good potentials to improve process understanding and strip flatness quality.", "paper_title": "Data mining-based flatness pattern prediction for cold rolling process with varying operating condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000344000200006"}
