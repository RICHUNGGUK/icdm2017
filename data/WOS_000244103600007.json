The current SOA is producer-centric, in which the service providers publish services that they produce and let the consumers to search available services to compose their applications. GSE is build on top of Consumer-Centric SOA (CCSOA), in which the application builders publish their application requirements for the service providers to follow when producing or customizing services to support the application. This new methodology reduces the workload and improves the application description capability of the service consumers. It also extends the capacity of design and code sharing, and thus further improves the software productivity. This paper presents the concepts, architecture, enabling techniques, and illustrative examples of collaborative software design in GSE.", "paper_title": "Collaborative software design in an SOA environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000244103600007"}
