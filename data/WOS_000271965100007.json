In particular, known stability problems with split-inertia substructured systems are reinterpreted as causality issues within the new conceptual framework. As an example, causality analysis is used to provide a practical solution to a split-inertia substructuring problem and the solution is experimentally verified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
