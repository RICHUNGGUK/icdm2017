Often D&E methods need to be applied in contexts different of those they had been applied before and as such must be transferred to those new contexts. This work presents a model for the quantitative method matching step of the transfer process, describes how different MCDM methods can be applied to this task, and discusses the results of an experience that tried to apply a couple of MCDM procedures to method selection.", "paper_title": "Quantitative support for UX methods identification: how can multiple criteria decision making help?", "paper_id": "WOS:000354621900006"}
