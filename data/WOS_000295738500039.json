The channel series is closely related to the quantum channels arising from universal quantum cloning machines. The additivity proof is motivated by a special property the studied channels enjoy: the property of conjugate degradability. As a consequence of the announced proof, we also provide an easy way of proving the additivity of the Holevo capacity for the original Unruh channel for which the quantum capacity is already known. Consequently, we present not only an infinite series of finite-dimensional channels but also a nontrivial example of an infinite-dimensional channel for which the classical and quantum channel capacities are easily calculable.", "paper_title": "An Infinite Sequence of Additive Channels: The Classical Capacity of Cloning Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500039"}
