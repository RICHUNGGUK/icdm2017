Our approach enables secure localization with a broad spectrum of localization techniques, ultrasonic or radio, based on the received signal strength or signal time of flight. Through several examples, we show how this approach can be used to secure node-centric and infrastructure-centric localization schemes. We further show how this approach can be applied to secure localization in mobile ad hoc and sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Secure location verification with hidden and mobile base stations", "paper_id": "WOS:000253155100009"}
