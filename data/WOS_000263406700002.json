The main reason is that CIP structures are monolithic in nature, as opposed to the discrete objects that are typical of steel and precast. A consortium of 12 major contractors and design firms collaborated over a one-year period to formulate the functional requirements for development of a BIM tool for cast-in-place reinforced concrete. The functional requirements were derived from a process model used to scope and understand the processes surrounding reinforced concrete design and production. The functional requirements were finally expressed as a set of object schemas, defining relations, methods, and attributes needed. These are essential for software companies to incorporate in their BIM tools to provide for the unique needs of modeling CIP structures.", "paper_title": "Unique Requirements of Building Information Modeling for Cast-in-Place Reinforced Concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000263406700002"}
