However, conventional context-aware systems, which have been popular in the ubiquitous decision support systems field, cannot provide such agile and proactive decision support. To fill this research void, this paper proposes a new concept of context prediction mechanism by which the ubiquitous decision support devices are able to predict users' future contexts in advance, and provide more timely and proactive decision support that users would be satisfied much more. Especially, location prediction is useful because ubiquitous decision support systems could dynamically adapt their decision support contents for a user based on a user's future location. In this sense, as an alternative for the inference engine mechanism to be used in the ubiquitous decision support systems capable of context-prediction, we propose an inductive approach to recognizing a user's location by learning a dynamic Bayesian network model. The dynamic Bayesian network model has been evaluated with a set of contextual data from undergraduate students. The evaluation result suggests that a dynamic Bayesian network model offers significant predictive power in the location prediction. Besides, we found that the dynamic Bayesian network model has a great potential for the future types of ubiquitous decision support systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
