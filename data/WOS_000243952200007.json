Considering system error and the change rate of system error, a PI type fuzzy controller is obtained. On the basis of the novel fuzzy controller, a receding horizon optimization method to tune the fuzzy controller parameters is given through minimizing the generalized predictive control criterion. Therefore, the PI-type fuzzy controller has the capability to adapt a wide-range of operating condition. Then, a simple and sufficient bound condition of input and output variable is achieved under the Lyapunov theory with brief analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the better performance of this novel fuzzy control scheme.", "paper_title": "A wide-range operating fuzzy control algorithm via receding horizon optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000243952200007"}
