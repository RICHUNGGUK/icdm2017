MWCDS is to select a vertex subset with minimum weight for a given unit disk graph, such that each vertex of the graph is contained in this subset or has a neighbor in this subset. Besides, the subgraph induced by this vertex subset is connected. Our algorithm is composed of two phases: the first phase computes a dominating set, which has approximation ratio 6+epsilon (epsilon is an arbitrary positive number), while the second phase connects the dominating sets computed in the first phase, which has approximation ratio 4.", "paper_title": "A better constant-factor approximation for weighted dominating set in unit disk graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000268311900005"}
