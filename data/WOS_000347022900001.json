We propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm for constructing good solutions, combining priority rules for assigning jobs to machines and a local search with exact procedures for solving the one-machine subproblems. These solutions are then used in two metaheuristic frameworks, Path Relinking and Scatter Search, to obtain high quality solutions for the problem. The algorithms are tested on a large number of test instances to assess the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The results show that our algorithms consistently outperform the best reported results for this problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
