Here. resolving a question that had been open since their work, we show ail expected constant-round protocol for authenticated Byzantine agreement assuming honest majority (i.e., t < n/2), and relying only oil the existence Of Signature schemes and a public-key infrastructure. Combined with existing results, this gives the first expected constant-round protocol for secure computation with honest majority in a point-to-point network under the same assumptions. Our key technical tool - a new primitive we introduce called moderated VSS - also yields a Simpler proof of the Feldman-Micali result. In addition, we show a simple technique for sequential composition of Byzantine agreement protocols that do not achieve Simultaneous termination, something that is inherent for protocols using 0(t) rounds.
