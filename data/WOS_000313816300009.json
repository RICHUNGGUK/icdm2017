However, the lack of receivers in transmit-only nodes renders most existing MAC protocols invalid. Based on our previous study on WSNs with pure transmit-only nodes, this work proposes a simple, yet cost effective and powerful single-hop hybrid WSN cluster architecture that contains not only transmit-only nodes but also standard nodes (with transceivers). Along with the hybrid architecture, this work also proposes a new MAC layer protocol framework called Robust Asynchronous Resource Estimation (RARE) that efficiently and reliably manages the densely deployed single-hop hybrid cluster in a self-organized fashion. Through analysis and extensive simulations, the proposed framework is shown to meet or exceed the needs of most applications in terms of the data delivery probability, QoS differentiation, system capacity, energy consumption, and reliability. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that brings reliable scheduling to WSNs containing both nonsynchronized transmit-only nodes and standard nodes.", "paper_title": "Improve Efficiency and Reliability in Single-Hop WSNs with Transmit-Only Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313816300009"}
