The gap between the traffic demand and the link capacity, along with time-varying link conditions, results in poor service quality of video streaming over mobile networks such as long buffering time and intermittent disruptions. Leveraging the cloud computing technology, we propose a new mobile video streaming framework, dubbed AMES-Cloud, which has two main parts: adaptive mobile video streaming (AMoV) and efficient social video sharing (ESoV). AMoV and ESoV construct a private agent to provide video streaming services efficiently for each mobile user. For a given user, AMoV lets her private agent adaptively adjust her streaming flow with a scalable video coding technique based on the feedback of link quality. Likewise, ESoV monitors the social network interactions among mobile users, and their private agents try to prefetch video content in advance. We implement a prototype of the AMES-Cloud framework to demonstrate its performance. It is shown that the private agents in the clouds can effectively provide the adaptive streaming, and perform video sharing (i.e., prefetching) based on the social network analysis.", "paper_title": "AMES-Cloud: A Framework of Adaptive Mobile Video Streaming and Efficient Social Video Sharing in the Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000319228500010"}
