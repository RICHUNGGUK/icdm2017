We develop a configurable algorithm that naturally handles a number of practical requirements, such as architectural features of the target platform, core failures, and hardware accelerators, and in addition, is scalable to a large number of tasks and cores. Experiments with several real life applications show that our algorithm outperforms manual mapping, integer linear programming-based mapping after ten days of solver run time, and a recent packet-switched network on chip-based task mapper through which, we underscore the unique requirements of task mapping for circuit-switched GALS architectures.", "paper_title": "Time-Scalable Mapping for Circuit-Switched GALS Chip Multiprocessor Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135600009"}
