Recently developed fuzzy transformation theory introduces the concept of fuzzy ranks, which incorporates sample spread (or sample diversity) information into the sample ranking framework. Thus, the fuzzy rank reflects a sample's rank, as well as its similarity to the other sample (namely, joint rank order and spread), and can be utilized to improve the performance of the conventional rank-order-based filters. In this paper, the well-known lower-upper-middle (LUM) filters are generalized utilizing the fuzzy ranks, yielding the class of fuzzy rank LUM (F-LUM) filters. Statistical and deterministic properties of the F-LUM filters are derived, showing that the F-LUM smoothers have similar impulsive noise removal capability to the LUM smoothers, while preserving the image details better. The F-LUM sharpeners are capable of enhancing strong edges while simultaneously preserving small variations. The performance of the F-LUM filters are evaluated for the problems of image impulsive noise removal, sharpening and edge-detection preprocessing. The experimental results show that the F-LUM smoothers can achieve a better tradeoff between noise removal and detail preservation than the LUM smoothers. The F-LUM sharpeners are capable of sharpening the image edges without amplifying the noise or distorting the fine details. The joint smoothing and sharpening operation of the general F-LUM filters also showed superiority in edge detection preprocessing application. In conclusion, the simplicity and versatility of the F-LUM filters and their advantages over the conventional LUM filters are desirable in many practical applications. This also shows that utilizing fuzzy ranks in filter generalization is a promising methodology.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy rank LUM filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000242362900003"}
