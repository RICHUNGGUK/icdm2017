Instead of the penalty function technique usually used to deal with the constrained problem, a heuristic repair operator utilizing problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the modified algorithm. Computational results show that the new PSO based algorithm is capable of quickly obtaining high-quality solutions for problems of various characteristics.", "paper_title": "Apply the particle swarm optimization to the multidimensional knapsack problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000119"}
