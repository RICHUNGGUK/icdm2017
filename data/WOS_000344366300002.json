To address this issue, this paper presents a new approach for automating the dynamic system model composition. The presented approach aims to maximise information reuse, by defining the minimum set of information that is necessary to the composition process, to maximise decoupling by removing the need for explicit interfaces and to present a methodology with a modular and structured approach to composition. Moreover the presented approach is illustrated in the context of system design verification against requirements using a Modelica environment, and an approach for expressing the information necessary for automating the composition is formalized.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Automated Model Composition Illustrated in the Context of Design Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000344366300002"}
