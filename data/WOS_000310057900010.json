The problem is particularly challenging because of the uncontrolled illumination conditions and of the destructive reflection speckle present in most photographs of paintings. A fully automatic image processing chain is described that, starting from several bursts of a painting taken under different angles, permits one to obtain the best possible result by eliminating highlights and motion blur by robust statistics, reducing noise by fusion, and compensating optical distortion in the registration process. This image fusion method is applicable to photographs of a painting taken with a hand-held camera without any particular setup. It works under bad lighting conditions and eliminates motion blur, even when the painting is protected by a glass screen creating structured reflections of the room. The careful discussion of each step of the processing chain also permits one to review and discuss the efficiency of the image fusion tools recently proposed in the literature and insert several new ones in the chain.", "paper_title": "Photographing Paintings by Image Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000310057900010"}
