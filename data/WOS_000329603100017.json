Blanket dimension is a commonly used fractal dimension and has the multi-resolution characteristics with which the image texture information can be better extracted. In this work, palmprint recognition with blanket dimension and its expansions was investigated. The efficiencies of horizontally and vertically expanded blanket dimensions for extracting the directional feature of palmprint were compared, and a palmprint recognition algorithm based on horizontally expanded blanket dimension (HEBD) was proposed according to the comparison results. Furthermore, a multi-scale HEBD (MHEBD) algorithm for palmprint recognition was also presented, and the MHEBD was demonstrated to be more effective than the single-scale HEBD for feature extraction. The algorithm was evaluated on Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) database (v2) and CASIA database. The experimental results indicate that the multi-scale HEBD can extract the palmprint features effectively and efficiently with a high recognition rate and less processing time.
