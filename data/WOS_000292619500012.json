It enables us to define a multilinear relationship among image points derived from non-rigid object motions viewed from multiple cameras with arbitrary curvilinear motions. We show the new multilinear relationship is useful for generating images and reconstructing 3D non-rigid object motions viewed from cameras with arbitrary curvilinear motions. The method is tested in real image sequences.", "paper_title": "Multiple View Geometry for Curvilinear Motion Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619500012"}
