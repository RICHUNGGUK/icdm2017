Sharing location data with others is an intrinsic feature of LBSs. However, publishing location may raise serious privacy concerns due to its close connection with users' sensitive information. This work identifies a new privacy threat called trajectory matching. We show that available privacy protection techniques preserving spatial relations of location samples are likely vulnerable to trajectory matching in existence of background information. We develop a matching algorithm, trajectory finder, and analyze its effectiveness on a real-life privacy protected trajectory dataset.", "paper_title": "Privacy Risks in Publishing Mobile Device Trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300001"}
