The well-known middle-level conjecture asserts that G(2k+1)(k) is Hamiltonian for all k >= 1. We study this problem in G(n)(k) for fixed k. It is known that G(n)(0), and G(n)(1) are Hamiltonian for all odd n >= 3. In this paper we prove that also G(n)(2) is Hamiltonian for all odd n 5, and we conjecture that G(n)(k) is Hamiltonian for every k >= 0 and every odd n >= 2k + 1. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
