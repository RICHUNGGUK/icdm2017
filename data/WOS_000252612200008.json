Besides unicast traffic, future destination stripping ring WDM networks also need to support multicast traffic efficiently. This article examines the largest achievable transmitter throughput, receiver throughput, and multicast throughput of both unidirectional and bidirectional ring WDM networks with destination stripping. A probabilistic analysis evaluates both the nominal capacity, which is based on the mean hop distances traveled by the multicast packet copies, and the effective capacity, which is based on the ring segment with the highest utilization probability, for each of the three throughput metrics. The developed analytical methodology accommodates not only multicast traffic with arbitrary multicast fanout but also unicast and broadcast traffic. Numerical investigations compare the nominal transmission, receiver, and multicast capacities with the effective transmission, receiver, and multicast capacities and examine the impact of number of ring nodes and multicast fanout on the effective transmission, reception, and multicast capacity of both types of ring networks for different unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic scenarios and different mixes of unicast and multicast traffic. The presented analytical methodology enables the evaluation and comparison of future multicast-capable medium access control (MAC) protocols for unidirectional and bidirectional ring WDM networks in terms of transmitter, receiver, and multicast throughput efficiency.", "paper_title": "Multicast capacity of packet-switched ring WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252612200008"}
