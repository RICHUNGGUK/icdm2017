The search for literature about sequence variation is hampered by the large number of allelic variants reported for many genes and by the variability in both gene and sequence variants nomenclatures. We describe OSIRIS, a search tool that integrates different sources of information with the aim to retrieve literature about sequence variation of a gene. In addition, it provides a method to link a dbSNP entry with the articles referring to it.", "paper_title": "OSIRIS: a tool for retrieving literature about sequence variants", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300021"}
