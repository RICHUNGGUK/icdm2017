For efficient process improvement, work performance should be enhanced in line with organization's vision by identifying areas for improvement and risks with process assessment standards such as SPICE or CMMI and then mapping them in the software development environment.. SPICE(Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination ISO/IEC 15504) is most widely used process assessment model in the SPI work today. This paper expands the number of routes for improvement in the existing OTF model from 8 to 24 and the number of processes in SEF model from 40 of the TR version to 51 of the IS version. This paper proposes OTEM (Opportunity Tree Enterprise Model) which can provide optimal strategies for the organization's vision by using Balanced Scorecard method to determine optimal strategies to the expanded routes for improvement.", "paper_title": "Design of opportunity tree for organization's process strategy decision-making based on SPICE assessment experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800094"}
