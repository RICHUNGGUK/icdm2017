Regarding the application, we consider that WSNs apply information fusion techniques to detect events in the sensor field. Particularly, in event-driven scenarios there might be long intervals of inactivity. However, at a given instant, multiple sensor nodes might detect one or more events, resulting in high traffic. To save energy, the network should be able to remain in a latent state until an event occurs, then the network should organize itself to properly detect and notify the event. Based on the premise that we have an information-fusion application for event detection, we propose a role assignment algorithm, called Information-Fusion-based Role Assignment (InFRA), to organize the network by assigning roles to nodes only when events are detected. The InFRA algorithm is a distributed heuristic to the minimal Steiner tree, and it is suitable for networks with severe resource constraints, such as WSNs. Theoretical analysis shows that, in some cases, our algorithm has a O(1)-approximation ratio. Simulation results show that the InFRA algorithm can use only 70% of the communication resources spent by a reactive version of the Centered-at-Nearest-Source algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
