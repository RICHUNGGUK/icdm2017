We first propose a set of statistical properties to analyse such routes. We then use the results to suggest and evaluate methods for generating artificial routes suitable for simulation purposes. The proposed approach also leads to insight on various network models. The present work is based on large data sets provided mainly by CAIDA'S skitter infrastructure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
