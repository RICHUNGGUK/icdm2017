Based on this model, a generic service composition platform is proposed as an individual middleware layer to support the pervasive E-Commerce. The platform consists of an orchestration component and several atomic service components (ASCs). It is in charge of dynamic and automatic general service (GS) construction taking the user preferences and demanded quality of service (QoS) into account. The designed platform is flexible and extensible thanks to the service oriented architecture (SOA) (service oriented architecture)-based atomic reusable and sharable service components (SCs). And it employs efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) interaction between two components. In our method, global QoS is guaranteed by the runtime QoS monitoring and dynamic adjusted two-dimensional orchestration plan.
