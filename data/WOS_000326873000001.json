In this paper, we consider the problem of testing exponentiality (which essentially implies no ageing) against positive ageing which is captured by the fairly large class of new better than used in expectation (NBUE) distributions. These tests of exponentiality against NBUE alternatives are discussed and compared. The empirical size of the tests is obtained by simulations. Power comparisons for different popular alternatives are done using Monte Carlo simulations. These comparisons are made for both small and large sample sizes. The paper concludes with a discussion in which suggestions are made regarding the choices of the test when a particular alternative is suspected.", "paper_title": "Tests for exponentiality against NBUE alternatives: a Monte Carlo comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000326873000001"}
