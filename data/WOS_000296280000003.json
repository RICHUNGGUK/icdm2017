This trend has led to a new paradigm-large-scale virtual manufacturing environment (LSVME). It supports networked and distributed virtual manufacturing to meet manufacturing system requirements. Since it contains a large number of virtual components, an effective data structure and collaborative construction methodology are needed. A metaearth architecture is proposed as the data structure for representing LSVME. This architecture consists of virtual space layer, mapping layer, library layer and ontology layers, which describe interaction among virtual components and has the ability to analyze the characteristics of virtual environment. In addition, it increases reusability of virtual components and supports self-reconfiguration for manufacturing simulation. A heuristic construction method based on graph theory is proposed using this architecture. It prevents redundant design of virtual components and contributes to an effective construction scheduling technique for collaborative designers.", "paper_title": "A self-configurable large-scale virtual manufacturing environment for collaborative designers", "paper_id": "WOS:000296280000003"}
