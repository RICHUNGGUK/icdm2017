In particular, this study investigated the variation in polar/hydrophobic pattern induced on the P-CD alone (i.e. =without the ligand) by the inclusion of four ligands having different lipophilicities and small size. Results indicate that, in the presence of guests with log P > 0, the hydrophobicity of PCD increases in the cavity and its surroundings on the primary face. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
