Because of the considerably high degree of exact curves on surfaces, approximation algorithms are preferred in CAD systems. To approximate the exact curve with a reasonably low degree curve which also lies completely on the B-spline surface, an algorithm is presented in this paper. The Hausdorff distance between the approximate curve and the exact curve is controlled under the user-specified distance tolerance. The approximate curve is epsilon(T)-G(1) continuous, where epsilon(T) is the user-specified angle tolerance. Examples are given to show the performance of our algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
