The generalized dynamic model is based on our experimental findings that one of the bioimpedance parameters, stratum corneum resistance R-p, is inversely related to the stimulation current. The model is necessitated by the driver of our constant voltage driver (CVD)-based electrotactile haptic rendering system, which features closed-loop, load-aware (i.e. fingertip skin bioimpedance-aware) capability in contrast to constant-current-driver (CCD) systems. Relying on this model and on-line estimated bioimpedance parameters and by employing a direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC) method, the stimulation current output to the fingertip skin tracking a desired pulsed reference current is realized. The modeling and control results based on the generalized model are shown to be preliminarily valid from simulation when compared to experimental results. This work will be useful in developing a user friendly load-aware electrotactile haptic rendering system that is capable of adapting the stimulation current from changing electro-bioimpedance conditions of the fingertip skin.
