Our framework is based on a coarse-to-fine strategy, as we first get a coarse result allowed of some negative samples, then eliminate the negative samples step by step. In our framework, we make the most of the multi-channel information by employing a boosted soft segmentation algorithm. Additionally, we develop a multi-scale background subtraction method to obtain the coarse segmentation result. After subtracting the optical disc (OD) region from the coarse result, the HEs are extracted by a SVM classifier. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) propose an efficient and robust framework for automatic HEs segmentation; (2) present a boosted soft segmentation algorithm to combine multi-channel information; (3) employ a double ring filter to segment and adjust the OD region. We perform our experiments on the pubic DIARETDB1 dateset, which consists of 89 fundus images. The performance of our algorithm is assessed on both lesion-based criterion and image-based criterion. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and robust.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION OF HARD EXUDATES IN FUNDUS IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000316902600012"}
