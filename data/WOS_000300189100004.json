This scheme is based on video mosaicing. For that, we are going to start by describing the mosaicing technique in order to illustrate the contribution of this technique in video watermarking. In fact, mosaicing allows to select an interesting area where the mark should be embedded. The idea is to insert the same mark into the same pixels which represent the same physical point. This is exactly the information which can be provided by a mosaic image at least for the located points in the scene background. Next, we present extensive experimental simulations which prove the watermark imperceptibility and robustness against several video attacks.", "paper_title": "Collusion, MPEG4 compression and frame dropping resistant video watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189100004"}
