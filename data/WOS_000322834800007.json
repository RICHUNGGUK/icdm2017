Dynamic differential evolution (DDE) and self-adaptive dynamic differential evolution (SADDE) are stochastic-type optimization approach that aims to minimize a cost function between measurements and computer-simulated data. These algorithms are capable of retrieving the location, shape, and permittivity of the dielectric cylinder in a slab medium made of lossless materials. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is employed for the analysis of the forward scattering. The comparison is carried out under the same conditions of initial population of candidate solutions and number of iterations. Numerical results indicate that SADDE outperforms the DDE a little in terms of reconstruction accuracy. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
