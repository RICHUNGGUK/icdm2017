It shows both analytically and computationally that the reformulation promotes faster convergence to an optimal solution in application to a linear program and to the relaxation of an integer program at each node in the branch-and-bound tree. Further, it shows that this reformulation subsumes and generalizes prior approaches that have been shown to improve the rate of convergence in special cases.", "paper_title": "A generalization of column generation to accelerate convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000269859100006"}
