Virtual-architecture overlays have partially addressed these problems, but previous work focuses mainly on heavily pipelined applications with minimal control requirements. We expand previous work by enabling more flexible control via overlay architectures for finite-state machines. Although not appropriate for control-intensive circuits, the presented architectures reduced compilation times of control changes in a convolution case study from 7 hours to less than 1 second, with no performance overhead and an area overhead of 0.2%.", "paper_title": "Finite-State-Machine Overlay Architectures for Fast FPGA Compilation and Application Portability", "paper_id": "WOS:000355679800016"}
