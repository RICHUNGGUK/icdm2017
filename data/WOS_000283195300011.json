It would be desirable if operation and project models are vertically integrated in practice. However, existing discrete event simulation systems do not allow integrating operation and project models. This paper introduces an integrated simulation system named \"Construction Operation and Project Scheduling\" (COPS). COPS analyzes the productivity of construction operations as well as the performance of a project schedule individually and jointly. It creates operation models, maintains these models in its operation model library, conducts sensitivity analysis with different resource combinations, finds the optimal resource combination that satisfies the user's requirements relative to hourly production and hourly cost of the operation, feeds this information into a project schedule, and executes stochastic simulation-based scheduling. A case study is presented to demonstrate this integrated simulation system.", "paper_title": "Integrated Simulation System for Construction Operation and Project Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000283195300011"}
