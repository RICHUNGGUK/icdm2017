An n-level star-pyramid is formed by piling up star graphs of dimensions 1 to n in a hierarchy, connecting any node in each i-dimensional star, 1 < i <= n, to a node in the (i - 1)-dimensional star whose index is reached by removing the i symbol from the index of the former node in the i-dimensional star graph. Having extracted the properties of the new topology, featuring topological properties, a minimal routing algorithm, a simple but efficient broadcast algorithm, Hamiltonicity and pancyclicity, we then compare the network properties of the proposed topology and the well-known pyramid topology. We show that the star-pyramid has some more attractive properties than its equivalent pyramid. Finally, we propose two variants of star-pyramid, namely the generic star-pyramid and wrapped star-pyramid, as topologies with improved scalability, fault-tolerance, and diameter.
