The edge of chaos domain of the Zhabotinskii CNN was numerically determined according to a theory of complexity. The simulation of dynamic systems, with parameters taken from the edge of chaos domain as described in this study, can generate some interesting distribution patterns of component concentrations that plausibly characterize certain complex phenomena involved in hydrothermal mineralization.
