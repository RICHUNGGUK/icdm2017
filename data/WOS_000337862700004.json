Nevertheless, with new WSN applications, new QoS requirements appear, such as time constraints. Real-time applications require the packets to be delivered before a known time bound which depends on the application requirements. We particularly focus on applications which consist in alarms sent to the sink node. We propose Real-Time X-layer Protocol (RTXP), a real-time communication protocol. RTXP is a MAC and routing real-time communication protocol that is not centralized, but instead relies only on local information. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first real-time protocol for WSNs using an opportunistic routing scheme in order to increase the packet delivery ratio. In this paper we describe the protocol mechanisms. We give theoretical bounds on the end-to-end delay and the capacity of the protocol. Intensive simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions and allow to compare RTXP with a real-time scheduled solution. RTXP is also simulated under harsh radio channel, in this case, the radio link introduces probabilistic behavior. Nevertheless, we show that RTXP performs better than a non-deterministic solution. It thus advocates for the usefulness of designing real-time (deterministic) protocols even for highly unreliable networks such as WSNs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
