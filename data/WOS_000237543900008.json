Bluetooth scatternet is a set of piconets interconnected via bridge devices. Good interpiconet schedulings are necessary for bridge devices to switch among piconets they participate in. This paper proposes an interpiconet scheduling algorithm named \"Traffic-Aware Scatternet Scheduling\" ( TASS), for bridges in Bluetooth scatternets. According to masters' traffic information, TASS can adaptively switch the bridge to high traffic load masters, and increase the usage of the bridge. In addition, TASS can reduce the number of failed \"unsniffs\" and the overhead of \"bridge switch wastes\" to further increase overall system performance. Simulation results show that TASS outperforms existing interpiconet scheduling in both network throughput and adaptability for various traffic loads.", "paper_title": "A traffic-aware scheduling for Bluetooth scatternets", "paper_id": "WOS:000237543900008"}
