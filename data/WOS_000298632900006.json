In order to understand the spatial aspect of the jamming problem, we consider a jamming model that takes into account the relative distance of the jammer from the vehicles. We formulate the problem as a zero-sum pursuit-evasion game between a jammer and a team of players with players possessing heterogeneous dynamics. We use Isaacs' approach to arrive at the equations governing the optimal strategies of the team of players. Finally, we obtain the optimal trajectories in the neighborhood of termination by numerically simulating the strategies for some variants of the problem.", "paper_title": "Spatial approaches to broadband jamming in heterogeneous mobile networks: a game-theoretic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632900006"}
