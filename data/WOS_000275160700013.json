Building on the success of the first competition in 2002, this sequel aimed to further develop research activity in the area of educational timetabling. The broad aim of the competition was to create better understanding between researchers and practitioners by allowing emerging techniques to be developed and tested on real-world models of timetabling problems. To support this, a primary goal was to provide researchers with models of problems faced by practitioners through incorporating a significant number of real-world constraints. Another objective of the competition was to stimulate debate within the widening timetabling research community. The competition was divided into three tracks to reflect the important variations that exist in educational timetabling within higher education. Because these formulations incorporate an increased number of \"real- world\" issues, it is anticipated that the competition will now set the research agenda within the field. After finishing in January 2008, final results were made available in May 2008. Along with background to the competition, the competition tracks are described here along with a brief overview of the techniques used by the competition winners.", "paper_title": "Setting the Research Agenda in Automated Timetabling: The Second International Timetabling Competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000275160700013"}
