In this paper, we prove the 20-year-old conjecture that TPTL is strictly more expressive than MTL. But we show that, surprisingly, the TPTL formula proposed by Alur and Henzinger for witnessing this conjecture can be expressed in MTL. More generally, we show that TPTL formulae using only modality F can be translated into MTL. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
