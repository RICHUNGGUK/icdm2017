It is meant for large-scale calculations in a basis of orthogonal orbitals for groups of LS terms of arbitrary parity. For Breit-Pauli calculations, all operators-spin-orbit, spin-other orbit, spin-spin, and orbit-orbit-may be included. For transition probabilities the orbitals of the initial and final state need not be orthogonal. A bi-orthogonal transformation is used for the evaluation of matrix elements in such cases. In addition to transition rates of all types, isotope shifts and hyperfine constants can be computed as well as g(j) factors.", "paper_title": "An MCHF atomic-structure package for large-scale calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000245881400006"}
