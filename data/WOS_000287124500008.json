However, those signals are inevitably contaminated by various artifacts. The analysis without considering the artifacts would lead to mis-interpretation results. Therefore, an available signal selection technique is necessary to be developed for obtaining accurate and reliable results. In this paper, a model of real-time data classification system for accurate analysis of neuro-biological signals was proposed. The proposed model can be utilized for various research purposes. As an example, a physical system to analyze the relationship between characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) was developed. The results indicated that the real-time system was effective for available signals selection. With the developed real-time system, the quality of signals can be monitored during the recording process.", "paper_title": "A REAL-TIME DATA CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR ACCURATE ANALYSIS OF NEURO-BIOLOGICAL SIGNALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500008"}
