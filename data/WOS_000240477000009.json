This definition is extended here to the general framework of Information Production Processes (IPPs), using a source-item terminology. It is further shown that in each practical situation an IPP always has a unique h-index. In Lotkaian systems h = T-1/alpha, where T is the total number of sources and alpha is the Lotka exponent. The relation between h and the total number of items is highlighted.", "paper_title": "An informetric model for the Hirsch-index", "paper_id": "WOS:000240477000009"}
