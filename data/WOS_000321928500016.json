We assume that interference is treated as noise by the decoders, and separate encoding is applied. First, a simple pair-wise channel condition for frequency division multiple access schemes to achieve all Pareto optimal points of the rate region is derived. It enables fully distributed global optimal decision making on whether any two users should use orthogonal channels. Next, we present an analytical solution to finding the maximum sum-rate in two-user symmetric frequency flat channels. Generalizing this solution to frequency selective channels, a convex optimization is established that yields the global optimum. Finally, we show that our method generalizes to K-user (K >= 2) weighted sum-rate maximization in asymmetric frequency selective channels, and we transform this classic non-convex optimization to an equivalent convex optimization in the primal domain.", "paper_title": "Optimal Spectrum Management in Multiuser Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000321928500016"}
