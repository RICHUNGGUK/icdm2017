This is a generalization and strengthening of the Slepian-Wolf theorem, which shows how to carry out such a simulation with low amortized communication in the case that M is a deterministic function of X. A caveat is that our simulation is interactive. As a consequence, we prove that the internal information cost (namely the information revealed to the parties) involved in computing any relation or function using a two party interactive protocol is exactly equal to the amortized communication complexity of computing independent copies of the same relation or function. We also show that the only way to prove a strong direct sum theorem for randomized communication complexity is by solving a particular variant of the pointer jumping problem that we define. This paper implies that a strong direct sum theorem for communication complexity holds if and only if efficient compression of communication protocols is possible. In particular, together with our result, a recent result of Ganor, Kol, and Raz implies that the strongest version of direct sum for randomized communication complexity is false.", "paper_title": "Information Equals Amortized Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900018"}
