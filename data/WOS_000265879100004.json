The architecture maintains data at a stable conformation, which is contrary to traditional data in-motion concept for QCA architectures. The memory architecture is based on an existing dual-phase-synchronized, line-based, one-bit QCA memory cell building block that provides size and latency improvements over other known one-bit memory cells through its novel clocking scheme. Read/write latencies up to similar to 2X lower than the existing tile-based architecture with three-phase, line-based memory cells are obtained. Simulations with QCADesigner and HDLQ are performed on a sample 4x8 bit memory architecture implementation.", "paper_title": "A Shift-Register-Based QCA Memory Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000265879100004"}
