In applications, in absence of a priori knowledge, it is possible to select the graph underlying a set of data through an appropriate model selection procedure. The recently proposed procedure, SINful, is appealing but sensitive to outliers, as it utilizes the sample estimator of the covariance matrix. A method to make the SINful procedure robust with respect to the presence of outlying observations, is proposed. This is based on the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator for the variance-covariance matrix. A simulation study shows the advantages of this method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
