In most welding simulations, the influence from geometric tolerances on parts is not taken into consideration, i.e., the simulations are based on nominal parts. In this paper, these two aspects, both crucial for predicting the final outcome of an assembly, are combined. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate a number of different non-nominal parts in a software for variation simulation. The translation and rotation matrices, representing the deviations from the nominal geometry due to positioning error, are exported to a software for welding simulation, where the effects from welding are applied. The final results are then analyzed with respect to both deviation and variation. The method is applied on a simple case, a T-weld joint, with available measurements of residual stresses and deformations. The effect of the different sources of deviation on the final outcome is analyzed and the difference between welding simulations applied to nominal parts and to disturbed (non-nominal) parts is investigated. The study shows that, in order to achieve realistic results, variation simulations should be combined with welding simulations. It does also show that welding simulations should be applied to a set of non-nominal parts since the difference between deviation of a nominal part and deviation of a non-nominal part due to influence of welding can be quite large.
