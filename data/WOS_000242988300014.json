Furthermore, the strength of beacon signals was also measured to decide whether or not to reserve resources for hand-off users, in order to reduce their dropping probabilities. Finally, we conducted several experiments to validate that our method could make use of the finite resources efficiently, thereby revealing better blocking probabilities and dropping probabilities than other methods.
