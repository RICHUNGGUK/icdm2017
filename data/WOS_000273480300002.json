The proposed solution uses Partition Trees to navigate through the image segments which are automatically defined at different spatial scales. Moreover, the system focuses on the navigation through ontologies for a semantic annotation of objects and of the parts that compose them. The tool has been designed under usability criteria to minimize the user interaction by trying to predict the future selection of regions and semantic classes. The implementation uses MPEG-7/XML input and output data to allow interoperability with any type of Partition Tree. This tool is publicly available and its source code can be downloaded under a free software license.", "paper_title": "GAT: a Graphical Annotation Tool for semantic regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480300002"}
