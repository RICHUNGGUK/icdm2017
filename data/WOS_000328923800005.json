First, we define a specific class of linear programming with many sparse constraints, i.e., row-column sparse constraint linear programming (RCSC-LP). In nature, the 1-norm SVM is a sort of RCSC-LP. In order to construct subproblems for RCSC-LP and solve them, a family of row-column generation (RCG) methods is introduced. RCG methods belong to a category of decomposition techniques, and perform row and column generations in a parallel fashion. Specially, for the 1-norm SVM, the maximum size of subproblems of RCG is identical with the number of Support Vectors (SVs). We also introduce a semi-deleting rule for RCG methods and prove the convergence of RCG methods when using the semi-deleting rule. Experimental results on toy data and real-world datasets illustrate that it is efficient to use RCG to train the 1-norm SVM, especially in the case of small SVs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
