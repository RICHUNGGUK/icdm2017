These graphs were first introduced by Matula and Kornerup in 1979 and further studied by Colbourn in 1982, and they have many interesting properties: they are minimally 3-colorable, uniquely Hamiltonian, maximally outerplanar and perfect. In this paper, we introduce a simple generation method for a Farey graph family, and we study analytically relevant topological properties: order, size, degree distribution and correlation, clustering, transitivity, diameter and average distance. We show that the graphs are a good model for networks associated with some complex systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
