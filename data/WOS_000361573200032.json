To resolve sub-cell structure, interface reconstruction is implemented within any cell that has more than one material. Therefore, the system of 3-T radiation diffusion equations is solved on two-and three-dimensional polyhedral meshes. The focus of the development is on the fully coupling between radiation and material, the treatment of nonlinearity in the equations, i.e., in the diffusion terms and source terms, treatment of the discontinuity across cell interfaces in material properties, the formulations for both transient and steady states, the property for large time steps, and second order accuracy in both space and time. The discontinuity of material properties between different materials is correctly treated based on the governing physics principle for general polyhedral meshes and full nonlinearity. The treatment is exact for arbitrarily strong discontinuity. The scheme is fully nonlinear for the full nonlinearity in the 3-T diffusion equations. Three temperatures are fully coupled and are updated simultaneously. The scheme is general in two and three dimensions on general polyhedral meshes. The features of the scheme are demonstrated through numerical examples for transient problems and steady states. The effects of some simplifications of numerical schemes are also shown through numerical examples, such as linearization, simple average of diffusion coefficient, and approximate treatment for the coupling between radiation and material.
