In this paper, we propose a new approach in which the Web is modeled as an asymmetric Hopfield Net. Each neuron in the network represents a Web page, and the connections between neurons represent the hyperlinks between Web pages. Web content analysis and Web link analysis are also incorporated into the model by adding a page content score function and a link score function. into the weights of the neurons and the synapses, respectively. A simulation study was conducted to compare the proposed model with traditional Web search algorithms, namely, a breadth-first search and a best-first search using PageRank as the heuristic. The results showed that the proposed model performed more efficiently and effectively in searching for domain-specific Web pages. We believe that the model can also be useful in other Web applications such as Web page clustering and search result ranking.", "paper_title": "Incorporating Web analysis into neural networks: An example in Hopfield Net searching", "paper_id": "WOS:000246090900005"}
