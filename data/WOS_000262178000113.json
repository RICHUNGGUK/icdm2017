The core idea of the proposed approach is to decompose ail image into four wavelet sub-bands and then apply NMF to the blocks of each sub-band, followed by ail eigendecomposition distortion step. The experimental results clearly show a better visual imperceptibility and ail excellent resiliency of the proposed watermarking scheme against intentional and geometric attacks.
