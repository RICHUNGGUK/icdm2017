The recently proposed CFWNN trained with ELM (CFWNN-ELM) has several promising features. But the CFWNN-ELM may have some redundant nodes due to the number of hidden nodes assigned a priori and the input weight matrix and the hidden node parameter vector randomly generated once and never changed during the learning phase. The introduction of DE into CFWNN-ELM is to search for the optimal network parameters and to reduce the number of hidden nodes used in the network. Simulations on several artificial function approximations, real-world data regressions and a chaotic signal prediction problem show some advantages of the proposed CWN-E-ELM. Compared with CFWNN-ELM, CWN-E-ELM has a much more compact network size and Compared with several relevant methods, CWN-E-ELM is able to achieve a better generalization performance.", "paper_title": "Composite Function Wavelet Neural Networks with Differential Evolution and Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000290580000003"}
