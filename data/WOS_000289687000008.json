The initial population of these elastic structures is mostly generated by assigning the material at random. This causes disconnected or unfeasible designs and further rule-based repairing can result in representation degeneracy. However, the problem-specific initial population can affect the performance of GAs like other operators. In this paper, a domain-specific initial population strategy is developed that generates geometrically feasible structures for path generating compliant mechanisms (PGCMs). It is coupled with the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) which has been customized for structural topology optimization. The performance of initial population strategy over random initialization using customized NSGA-II is checked on single and bi-objective optimization problems. Based on the results, it is observed that the custom initialization outperforms the random initialization by dominating all the solutions and exploring larger area of posed objectives. The elastic structures obtained by solving two examples of PGCMs using domain specific initial population strategy are also presented.", "paper_title": "Domain-specific initial population strategy for compliant mechanisms using customized genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000289687000008"}
