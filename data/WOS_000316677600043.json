It was found that oxazepam binds weakly to the fullerene cage via its carbonyl group. The binding of oxazepam to C-60 is affected drastically by nonlocal dispersion interactions, while vdW forces affect the corresponding geometries only a little. Furthermore, aqueous solution affects the geometries of the oxazepam approaching to fullerene slightly, while oxazepam binds slightly farther away from the nanocage. The results presented provide evidence for the applicability of the vdW-DF method and serve as a practical benchmark for the investigation of host-guest interactions in biological systems.", "paper_title": "First-principles vdW-DF investigation on the interaction between the oxazepam molecule and C-60 fullerene", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600043"}
