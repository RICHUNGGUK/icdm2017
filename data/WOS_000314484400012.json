This global system integrates a photovoltaic station, electric vehicles and a supervision base. The communication has been set up through a wireless network. This paper presents this project realized by different groups of foreign students working through an International Collaboration in Engineering Education. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on connecting technical research with engineering education. For a few years, the need of further research on renewable energies has leaded to the initiation of several student projects at the university. A group of co-operating foreign students working together within the framework of a technically innovative subject has been created through the international relations activity of the University of Artois, at IUT of Bethune (Institut Universitaire de Technologie), situated in the northern region of France. Findings - A prototype of the recharging station has been built The measures of the energetic performances showed a good efficiency. The data exchange through the wireless network is operating properly and a computer-based supervising unit is responsible for the coordination of the station/vehicle control. The established international collaboration has demonstrated the possibility of carrying out common students' projects. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is coming from the major subjects of sustainability such as renewable energies and transportation. A solar-based station has been built and supplies electric vehicles. The wireless communication has been applied in order to perform control on long distances. This international collaboration is an innovative way for enhancing the collaboration performance in engineering education.", "paper_title": "Wireless supervision on a photovoltaic recharging station", "paper_id": "WOS:000314484400012"}
