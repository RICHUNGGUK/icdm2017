Let phi be a counting monadic second order logic (CMSO) formula and t >= 0 be an integer. For a given graph G = (V, E), the task is to maximize vertical bar X vertical bar subject to the following: there is a set F subset of V such that X subset of F, the subgraph G[F] induced by F is of treewidth at most t, and the structure (G[F], X) models phi, i.e., (G[F], X) satisfies phi. We give an algorithm solving this optimization problem on any n-vertex graph G in time O(vertical bar Pi(G)vertical bar . n(t+4). f(t,phi)), where Pi(G) is the set of all potential maximal cliques in G and f is a function of t and phi only. Pipelined with the known bounds on the number of potential maximal cliques in different graph classes, there are a plethora of algorithmic consequences extending and subsuming many known results on polynomial-time algorithms for graph classes. We also show that all potential maximal cliques of G can be enumerated in time O(1.7347(n)). This implies the existence of an exact exponential algorithm of running time O(1.7347(n)) for many NP-hard problems related to finding maximum induced subgraphs with different properties.", "paper_title": "LARGE INDUCED SUBGRAPHS VIA TRIANGULATIONS AND CMSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000353967100003"}
