The proposed buffer achieves high-speed driving performance while drawing a low quiescent current during static operation. The circuit offers enhanced slewing capabilities with a limited power consumption by exploiting a slew detector which monitors the output voltage of the input differential amplifier and outputs an additional current signal providing slew-rate enhancement at the output stage. Post-layout simulations show that the proposed buffer can drive a 1 nF column line load with 8.5 V/mu s slew-rate and 0.8 mu s settling time, while drawing only 8 mu A static current from a 3V power supply.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED LOW-POWER HIGH-SPEED BUFFER AMPLIFIER WITH SLEW-RATE ENHANCEMENT FOR LCD APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469300001"}
