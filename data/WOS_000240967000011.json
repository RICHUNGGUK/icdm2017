The Newton algorithm is the most useful tool for solving non-linear equations. It consists of solving a series of linear system of equations (Jacobian system). In this article, we are adaptively defining tolerance of the Jacobian system. We prove the convergence of our method. Numerical experiment shows that compared to the traditional method our approach can save a substantial amount of computational work. The presented algorithm can be easily incorporated into an existing molecular dynamics simulator.", "paper_title": "Newton-Krylov algorithm with adaptive error correction for the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240967000011"}
