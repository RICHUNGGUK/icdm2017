In this scenario, the generalization error often hits a minimum in the middle of the incremental active learning procedure and then it starts to increase. In this paper, we address the problem of early labeling stopping in probabilistic classification for minimizing the generalization error and the labeling cost. Among several possible strategies, we propose to stop labeling when the empirical class-posterior approximation error is maximized. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Early Stopping Heuristics in Pool-Based Incremental Active Learning for Least-Squares Probabilistic Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261400004"}
