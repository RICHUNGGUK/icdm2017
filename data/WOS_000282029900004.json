Widespread Internet access in the early 1990s led to a dramatic acceleration of open source activity; but the success of a community open source project depends on the developers' voluntary participation. This paper investigates the social-relational factors, including developers' identification and obligation, shared goals, cognitive and affective trust, and their effects on open source software developer's participation. Data were collected from voluntary developers in open source projects. The research findings show that the social-relational factors are very important to promote developer's participation in an open source project. This research contributes empirically to the body of open source software research, and has practical implications for open source software development.", "paper_title": "Volunteers' Participation in Open Source Software Development: A Study from the Social-Relational Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000282029900004"}
