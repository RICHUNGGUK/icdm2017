This method has consistently resulted in more than one order-of-magnitude speedup compared with the traditional methods used in the SPICE engine. Nonetheless, the formulation of this Obreshkov-based approach assumed that the memory elements in the circuits are characterized by a linear constituent equation. The goal of this paper is to generalize this approach to handle memory elements that are described by nonlinear constituent equations.", "paper_title": "Formulation of the Obreshkov-Based Transient Circuit Simulator in the Presence of Nonlinear Memory Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000348228400009"}
