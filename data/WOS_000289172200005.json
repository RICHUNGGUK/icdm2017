It is also shown that there is no upper bound on the number of crossings in the control polygon for an unknotted Bezier curve. These examples complement known upper bounds on the number of subdivisions sufficient for a control polygon to be ambient isotopic to its Bezier curve. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
