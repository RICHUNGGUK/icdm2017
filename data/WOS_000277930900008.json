In this article, we explore the role of monitoring systems in small-scale housing for older people with dementia By incorporating principles of value-sensitive design in a human centered design process we developed a system for remote monitoring at night in dementia care The performance of the working system was evaluated in the real-life context of a nursing home and is currently being implemented in small-scale housing. Next to reporting the iterative design and evaluation of the monitoring system, we reflect upon the approach taken (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Who will watch (over) me?
