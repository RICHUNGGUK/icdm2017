The resulting primitive supports non-monotone access structure. In CP-SE, the decryptability of a ciphertext depends on whether or not the required attribute vectors are in the same affine space that also corresponds to the decryption key. This gives rise to many new applications, for example, SE supporting negation, hierarchical ABE and forward-secure ABE. In this paper, we present techniques for generic construction of CP-SE from ciphertext-policy inner product encryption (CP-IPE). Our techniques are property-preserving in the sense that if the CP-IPE scheme from which we derive our CP-SE scheme is fully secure, for example, then so is the resulting CP-SE scheme. Moreover, interestingly, we show that it is possible to perform transformation of the opposite direction, that is, how to construct a CP-IPE scheme given a CP-SE scheme.", "paper_title": "Spatial encryption supporting non-monotone access structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700002"}
