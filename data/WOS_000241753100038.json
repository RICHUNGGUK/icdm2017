The essential of the proposed method was to flatten the decreasing power spectrum of each image by using an adaptive low-pass and whitening filter. The act of low-pass filtering was just to reduce the effects of noise usually took place in the high frequencies. The act of whitening filtering was a special processing, which was to attenuate the low frequencies and boost the high frequencies so as to yield a roughly flat power spectrum across all spatial frequencies. The suggested method was computationally more economical than the geometric covariance matrix based PCA method. Meanwhile, the performance degradations accompanied with the computational economy improvement were fairly insignificant.", "paper_title": "Fast and adaptive low-pass whitening filters for natural images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100038"}
