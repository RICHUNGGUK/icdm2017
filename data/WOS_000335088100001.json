It spans from individual decision-making trade-offs such as deciding what to do next (sleep, eat, work, play), to complex scenarios including politics and business. The social sciences, psychology, economy, and biology study the nature of conflict, its consequences, and strategies to successfully deal with it. Over the last decades computer science has joined those disciplines and studies conflict from a computational perspective. This special issue presents a selection of the best papers presented at the First Workshop of Conflict Resolution in Decision Making (COREDEMA). The workshop focused on computational approaches that tackle conflict in order to provide new insights and explore potential applications. The workshop was jointly hosted with the 12th International Conference on Practical Applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (PAAMS) in Salamanca, Spain, from June 4 to 6, 2013.", "paper_title": "GUEST EDITORIAL: COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN DECISION MAKING: NEW ADVANCES AND DEVELOPMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335088100001"}
