In 2001, Lin et al. showed that the protocol is insecure and proposed an optimal strong-password authentication protocol called the OSPA protocol. However, Chen and Ku pointed out that both SAS and OSPA are vulnerable to stolen-verifier attack in 2002. Later, Lin, Shen, and Hwang proposed a modified OSPA protocol to repair the security law of OSPA protocol. In this paper, we propose a new strong-password authentication protocol that not only can withstand many possible attacks including a stolen-verifier attack, but that is also more efficient than the modified OSPA protocol.", "paper_title": "A new strong-password authentication scheme using one-way hash functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244781200013"}
