This paper presents novel techniques for blind separation of instantaneously mixed digital sources in noise circumstance, which is based on characteristics of digital signals. The blind separation and denoising algorithms include two steps. First, one of adaptive blind separation algorithms in existence is used to separate sources, but there still exists noise in the separating signals, and then, the second step is adopted to denoise according to the characteristics of digital signals. In the last simulations, the good performance is illustrated and the algorithm is very excellent.", "paper_title": "Blind separation of digital signal sources in noise circumstance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100125"}
