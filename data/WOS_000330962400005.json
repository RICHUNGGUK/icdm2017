By using bifurcation methods and numerical simulations, we examine the global structure of bifurcations of the model. Results are summarized in various two-parameter bifurcation diagrams with the stimulating current as the abscissa and the other parameter as the ordinate. We also give the one-parameter bifurcation diagrams and pay much attention to the emergence of periodic solutions and bistability. Different membrane excitability is obtained by bifurcation analysis and frequency-current curves. The alteration of the membrane properties of the Morris-Lecar neurons is discussed.", "paper_title": "Bifurcation analysis of a Morris-Lecar neuron model", "paper_id": "WOS:000330962400005"}
