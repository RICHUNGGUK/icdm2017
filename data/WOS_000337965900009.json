An interesting and practical situation is that instead of being continuously evaluated, the query may be evaluated at different degrees of continuity, e. g. every 2 seconds (close to continuous), every 10 minutes or at irregular time intervals (close to snapshot). Furthermore, the range query may be stacked under predicates applied to the returned objects. An example is the count predicate that requires the number of objects in the range to be at least gamma. The conjecture is that these two practical considerations can help reduce communication costs. We propose a safe region-based solution that exploits these two practical considerations. An extensive experimental study shows that our solution can reduce communication costs by a factor of 9.5 compared to an existing state-of-the-art system.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Range Queries with Predicates on Moving Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000337965900009"}
