Our approach is capable of modeling both physical forces and interactions between agents and obstacles, while also allowing the agents to anticipate and avoid upcoming collisions during local navigation. We combine velocity-based collision-avoidance algorithms with external physical forces. The overall formulation produces various effects of forces acting on agents and crowds, including balance recovery motion and force propagation through the crowd. We further extend our method to model more complex behaviors involving social and cultural rules. We use finite-state machines to specify a series of behaviors and demonstrate our approach on many complex scenarios. Our algorithm can simulate a few thousand agents at interactive rates and can generate many emergent behaviors.", "paper_title": "Velocity-based modeling of physical interactions in dense crowds", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400004"}
