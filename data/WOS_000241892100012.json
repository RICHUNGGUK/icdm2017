It is used in network detection to testify its efficiency in such mining task, including maximizing the similarity between normal association rule sets while minimizing the similarity between a normal and an abnormal association rule set. Experiment results show that IA-optiniization based fuzzy logic system can improve the performance of mining associate rules in network intrusion.", "paper_title": "Immune algorithm optimization of membership functions for mining association rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100012"}
