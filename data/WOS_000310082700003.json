Various modeling approaches result in communication problems, as well as redundancies and inconsistencies in system documentation. Thus, when modeling process-oriented enterprise applications seamless support of both expert groups is necessary. However, current business process management and workflow technologies are not fully integrated with user interaction, nor do they offer an appropriate data model. Based on the requirements of two industrial projects, we developed an integrated framework that combines the best practices from process-oriented and form-based approaches to overcome these shortcomings. The described framework supports the submit/response-style interaction paradigm and is independent of modeling languages and tools. In this work, we will present a detailed description of the proposed framework, its application to an industrial project and a discussion of related work.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR SEAMLESS MODELING OF BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS IN PROCESS-ORIENTED ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310082700003"}
