We aim to come up with an analysis model applicable to a production system, where the parts of products are manifold and any part is available with several suppliers, so as to establish an efficient scheme to select eligible suppliers in case that certain parts need to be replaced. Four steps are involved in the analysis model. In addition to the analysis of component parts with association graph, fuzzy theory and data T transfer are also employed, meanwhile, taking such assessment attributes as cost, quality and time into consideration, in order to effectively assess the efficiency of configuration change schemes. While selection of eligible suppliers has itself been a complex problem, however, time taken into account, multiple recurrences of the problem will make it even more difficult to find solution. Thus, we establish, by dint of genetic algorithms, a model to find solution which enables us to find near-optimal solution within a short period of time. The analysis model as well as the solution model has already been put into the case of TFT-LCD to assess its configuration change. All the potential component suppliers are appraised; all sorts of experiment parameters have been studied. The results suggest that the model can be used to assess configuration change of a complex product which may involve the replacement of several components. Furthermore, it can render a satisfactory solution. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
