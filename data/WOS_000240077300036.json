For the offline LBC problem, we first show its NP-hardness, then prove the approximation ratio of the First-Fit-Decreasing algorithm, and finally present an APTAS. For the online LBC problem, we give competitive analysis for the algorithms of Next-Fit, Worst-Fit, First-Fit, and a modified HARMONIC(M) algorithm. The CCMRBP problem is a generalization of the Maximum Resource Bin Packing (MRBP) problem [1]. For this problem, we prove that its offline version is no harder to approximate than the offline MRBP problem.", "paper_title": "On lazy bin covering and packing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300036"}
