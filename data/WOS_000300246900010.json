Our work is motivated by results of Csiszar and Narayan which highlight innate connections between secrecy generation by multiple terminals that observe correlated source signals and Slepian-Wolf near-lossless data compression. Explicit procedures for such constructions and their substantiation are provided. The performance of low-density parity check channel codes in devising a new class of secret keys is examined.", "paper_title": "Secret Key and Private Key Constructions for Simple Multiterminal Source Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900010"}
