All the agents will track or reject the signals generated by an exosystem (or an active leader). A systematic distributed design approach is proposed to handle output regulation via dynamic output feedback with the help of canonical internal model. With common solutions of regulator equations and Lyapunov functions, the distributed robust output regulation with switching interconnection topology is solved.", "paper_title": "ROBUST COORDINATION CONTROL OF SWITCHING MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS VIA OUTPUT REGULATION APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000297954400008"}
