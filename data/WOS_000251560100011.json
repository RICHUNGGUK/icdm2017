The asymptotic normality and strong consistency of the fuzzy least squares estimator (FLSE) are investigated; a confidence region based on a class of FLSEs is proposed; the asymptotic relative efficiency of FLSEs with respect to the crisp least squares estimators is also provided and a numerical example is given. Some simulation results are also presented to illustrate the behavior of FLSEs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
