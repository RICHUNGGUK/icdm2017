While several adaptive schemes have been studied in the literature, little effort has been made for their analysis due to difficulty in mathematical modeling. Our main contribution is the proposal of a methodology for analyzing the Markov chain that is created when modeling a simple adaptive bandwidth reservation mechanism. For this purpose, we decompose the Markov chain into two levels: intra-domain for the analysis of equilibrium states and inter-domain for the analysis of transient states. This hierarchical decomposition provides an exact solution with significantly reduced computational complexity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
