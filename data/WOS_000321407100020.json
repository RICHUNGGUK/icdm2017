The first control technique uses a robust hysteresis current controller; the second control strategy consists of a frequency-domain linear design of regulators on the basis of a small-signal averaged model of the converter, whereas the third control design method uses the input/output feedback linearization approach applied on the large-signal state-space averaged model of the converter. In order to verify and compare the performance of all control schemes, numerical simulations are carried out on a switching-functions-based model of the converter, which is implemented using Matlab/Simulink. The control systems are tested under both rated and disturbed operating conditions. The systems performance is evaluated in terms of source current total harmonic distortion (THD), input power factor, and DC voltage regulation toward load disturbances. (c) 2012 IMACS.
