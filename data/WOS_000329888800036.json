It considerably improves existing thresholding methods by efficiently modeling non-Gaussian and multi-modal class-conditional distributions using mixtures of generalized Gaussian distributions (MoGG). The proposed approach seamlessly: (1) extends the standard Otsu's method to arbitrary numbers of thresholds and (2) extends the Kittler and Illingworth minimum error thresholding to non-Gaussian and multi-modal class-conditional data. MoGGs enable efficient representation of heavy-tailed data and multi-modal histograms with flat or sharply shaped peaks. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world image segmentation show the performance of the proposed approach with comparison to recent state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
