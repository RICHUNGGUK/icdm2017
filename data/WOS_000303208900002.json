However the natural interface for sound editing has not been sufficiently studied. This article proposes an intuitive interface method in which sound sample is selected and edited by speaking sound-imitation words (onomatopoeia). An experiment with the method based on statistical models, which is generally used for pattern recognition, showed up to 99% in the accuracy of recognition. In the other experiment for sound editing, syllable segmentation was first executed, and then a syllabic time scale of sound samples was modified by the Synchronized Overlap-Add algorithm. The energy by the syllable was then modified according to utterances of sound-imitation words. The experiment showed that the proposed method, compared to modification by the whole, achieved about 20.4% and 65.6% relative improvement in the time displacement of peaks and syllabic boundaries between modified sound samples and sound-imitation utterances.", "paper_title": "Voice-Driven Sound Effect Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303208900002"}
