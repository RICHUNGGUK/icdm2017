To transfer power efficiently and safely in wireless power transfer system, information, such as frequency, required power and element values, need to be transmitted reliably. However, the bandwidth, which is used for exchanging information, is affected by the change of load at the receiver when it is charging. This paper investigates the effect of load fluctuation in data communication using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in resonant-type wireless power transfer systems. The equivalent circuit used in the transmitting and receiving antennas is a band pass filter (BPF) and its bandwidth is evaluated through circuit simulations. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the bit error rate (BER) performance is affected by the load fluctuation and the efficiency of power transfer.", "paper_title": "Effect of Load Fluctuation in Data Transmission for Wireless Power Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600020"}
