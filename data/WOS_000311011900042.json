In this letter, we apply a histogram modification framework to stereoscopic image enhancement. The proposed algorithm estimates the histogram of a stereo image pair without explicitly computing the pixel-wise disparity. Then, the histogram in the occluded regions is estimated and used to determine the target histogram of the stereo image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A New Histogram Modification Method for Stereoscopic Image Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900042"}
