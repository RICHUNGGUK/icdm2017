However, most existing schemes for location service incur a high overhead because of the periodic updates of location information. To address this issue, we propose a novel History information based Light Location Service (HLLS), using the temporal relationship among historical locations of mobile nodes in the network. In HLLS, location information of mobile nodes is propagated by Hello beacons locally, and the location query is performed with the aid of historical locations. In this way. HLLS can eliminate the tremendous periodical location updates and significantly reduce the overhead for location service. Using a combination of analytical modeling and extensive simulations, we show the effectiveness of HLLS in comparison with other approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
