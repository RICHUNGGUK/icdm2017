The use of the incremental equations simplifies the formation of the problem, while sequential linear programming provides a trusted tool for its solution. Examples from design for allowable stress, specified displacements, buckling, and optimal shape are included. It is concluded that these methods comprise a simple tool for use by the structural engineer.", "paper_title": "Structural optimization using incremental equations and sequential linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241551700006"}
