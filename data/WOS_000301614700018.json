It is used in noise-robust continuous speech recognition (CSR). As the noise robust techniques in isolated word speech recognition, the running spectrum analysis (RSA), the running spectrum filtering (RSF) and the dynamic range adjustment (DRA) methods have been developed. Among them, only RSA has been applied to a CSR system. This paper proposes an extended DRA for a noise-robust CSR system. In the stage of speech recognition, a continuous speech waveform is automatically assigned to a block defined by a short time length. The extended DRA is applied to these estimated blocks. The average recognition rate of the proposed method has been improved under several different noise conditions. As a result, the recognition rates are improved up to 15% in various noises with 10 dB SNR.", "paper_title": "A Noise-Robust Continuous Speech Recognition System Using Block-Based Dynamic Range Adjustment", "paper_id": "WOS:000301614700018"}
