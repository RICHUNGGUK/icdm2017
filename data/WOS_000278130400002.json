In the presented case, the best possible surface quality of a machined surface was taken as the primary technological aim. This paper shows how feature extraction from a 3D CAD model, and classification using a self-organizing neural network, are done. The experimental results presented in this paper suggest that the prediction of milling strategy using the self-organizing neural network (SOM) is effective.", "paper_title": "Intelligent prediction of milling strategy using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278130400002"}
