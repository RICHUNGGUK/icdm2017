Instances dwelling times (IDT) which consist of waiting times and handle times in a workflow model is a key performance analysis goal. In a workflow model the instances which act as customers and the resources which act as servers form a queuing network. Multidimensional workflow net (MWF-net) includes multiple timing workflow nets (TWF-nets) and the organization and resource information. This paper uses queuing theory and MWF-net to discuss mean value and probability distribution density function (PDDF) of IDT. It is assumed that the instances arrive with exponentially distributed inter-arrival times and the resources handle instances within exponentially distributed times or within constant times. First of all, the mean value and PDDF of IDT in each activity is calculated. Then the mean value and PDDF of IDT in each control structure of a workflow model is computed. According to the above results a method is proposed for computing the mean value and PDDF of IDT in a workflow model. Finally an example is used to show that the proposed method can be effectively utilized in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
