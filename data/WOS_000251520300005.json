Evidence suggests that seizure precursors may localize regions important to seizure generation on the IEEG and epilepsy treatment. However, current methods to detect epileptic precursors lack a sound approach to automatically select and combine G features that best distinguish epileptic events from background, relying on visual review predominantly. This work suggests GP as an optimal alternative to create a single feature after evaluating the performance of a binary detector that uses: (1) genetically programmed features; (2) features selected via GP; (3) forward sequentially selected features; and (4) visually selected features. Results demonstrate that a detector with a genetically programmed feature outperforms the other three approaches, achieving over 78.5% positive predictive value, 83.5% sensitivity, and 93% specificity at the 95% level of confidence.
