For three fixed distinct vertices s, a, b we study the correlation, in the combined probability space, of the events {a -> s} and {s -> b}. For G(n, p), we prove that there is a p(c) = 1/2 such that for a fixed p < p(c) the correlation is negative for large enough n and for p > p(c) the correlation is positive for large enough n. We conjecture that for a fixed n >= 27 the correlation changes sign three times for three critical values of p. For G(n, m) it is similarly proved that, with p = m/((n)(2)), there is a critical p(c) that is the solution to a certain equation and approximately equal to 0.7993. A lemma, which computes the probability of non existence of any l directed edges in G(n, m), is thought to be of independent interest. We present exact recursions to compute P(a -> s) and P(a -> s, s -> b). We also briefly discuss the corresponding question in the quenched version of the problem. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
