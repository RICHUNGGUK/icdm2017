Here we consider another simple special case of the stationary first-order moving average additive Gaussian noise channel and find the feedback capacity in closed form. Specifically, the channel is given by Y-i = X-i+ Z(i), i = 1, 2,..., where the input {X-i} satisfies a power constraint and the noise {Z(i)} is a first-order moving average Gaussian process defined by Z(i) = alpha Ui-1 + U-i, vertical bar alpha vertical bar <= 1, with white Gaussian innovations U-i, i = 0, 1,.... We show that the feedback capacity of this channel is CFB = -log x(o) where x(o) is the unique positive root of the equation px(2) = (1-x(2))(1-vertical bar alpha vertical bar x)(2) and rho is the ratio of the average input power per transmission to the variance of the noise innovation U-i. The optimal coding scheme parallels the simple linear signaling scheme by Schalkwijk and Kailath for the additive white Gaussian noise channel-the transmitter sends a real-valued information-bearing signal at the beginning of communication and subsequently refines the receiver's knowledge by processing the feedback noise signal through a linear stationary first-order autoregressive filter. The resulting error probability of the maximum likelihood decoding decays doubly exponentially in the duration of the communication. Refreshingly, this feedback capacity of the first-order moving average Gaussian channel is very similar in form to the best known achievable rate for the first-order autoregressive Gaussian noise channel given by Butman.", "paper_title": "Feedback capacity of the first-order moving average Gaussian channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200013"}
