Modern education stresses both theory and field experience. However, students are unlikely to obtain sufficient investment field experience in the present educational environment because of the enormous capital needs of financial operations. Thus, a key limitation of financial education is the removal of investment risks associated with money flow during investment practice. In order to remove these educational limitations, this paper proposes an investment simulations environment to exercise real market practices in financial and investment courses and proposes a referential application of scenario-based learning for investment learning. The investigation results indicate that IFILE learning is more effective, interesting and realistic than learning in the traditional classrooms.", "paper_title": "Design of Web-based financial learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400054"}
