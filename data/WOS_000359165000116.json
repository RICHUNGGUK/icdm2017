Compared with the existing neural networks for solving such problems, the proposed neural network has fewer neurons and a one-layer architecture. Further, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the continuous solution. By using differential inequality technique, the new neural network is shown to be globally exponentially convergent to optimal solution. Finally, recurring to the numerical method, simulation results with some applications show the effectiveness of the proposed neural network. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
