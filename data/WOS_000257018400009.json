Together, PCI Express and AS have the potential for building the next-generation interconnects. Furthermore, the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) in computing and communication environments is currently the focus of much discussion and research in the industry and academia. In this paper, we propose a framework to provide QoS based on bandwidth, latency, and jitter over AS, employing the mechanisms provided by AS. We also present several implementations for the output scheduling mechanism. Finally, we evaluate our proposals by simulation, comparing the performance of the schedulers that we propose and their implementation complexity.", "paper_title": "A framework to provide Quality of Service over Advanced Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000257018400009"}
