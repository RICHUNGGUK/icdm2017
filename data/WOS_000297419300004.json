The extant literature focuses mainly on one theory-complex adaptive systems-to support agile methods, although recent research indicates that the control theory and the adaptive structuration theory are also applicable. This article proposes that at least three other theories exist that are highly relevant: transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and expectancy theory. By employing these theories, a rigorous analysis of the Agile Manifesto is conducted. Certain agile values and principles find theoretical support and can be applied to enhance agility dynamic projects regardless of size; some agile principles find no theoretical support while others find limited support. Based on the analysis and the ensuing discussion, the authors propose a framework with five dimensions of agility: process, design, people, outcomes, and adaptation.", "paper_title": "Extending Agile Principles to Larger, Dynamic Software Projects: A Theoretical Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000297419300004"}
