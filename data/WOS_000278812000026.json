A general expression is derived for the DMT upper bound, which can be achieved by a compress-and-forward protocol at the relay, under certain assumptions. The DMT expression is given as the solution of a minimization problem in general, and an explicit expression is found when the relay channel is symmetric in terms of number of antennas, i.e., the source and the destination have n antennas each, and the relay has m antennas. It is observed that the static half-duplex DMT matches the full-duplex DMT when the relay has a single antenna, and is strictly below the full-duplex DMT when the relay has multiple antennas. Besides, the derivation of the upper bound involves a new asymptotic study of spherical integrals (that is, integrals with respect to the Haar measure on the unitary group u(n)), which is a topic of mathematical interest in itself.", "paper_title": "Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for the MIMO Static Half-Duplex Relay", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000026"}
