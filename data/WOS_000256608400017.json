The robot can translate as well as rotate. The path obtained from start to goal is the shortest in terms of the number of steps. The mapping of the algorithm to hardware is described. Results of efficient implementation on a Xilinx FPGA device show that the device can be operated at a clock rate of about 65 MHz. Such a high frequency of operation leads to computing a collision-free path on sample images of size 128 x 128 in less than 3 ms and hence the hardware can process images at a video rate. This is necessary for real-time path planning in a dynamic environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
