Context-aware mobile grid services that exploit information about user and device context are becoming one of the core components in mobile grid environment. This paper presents a contexts aware service provisioning in mobile grid. The paper describes device context information for context-aware services in the mobile device collaboration. An algorithm is proposed to dynamically deliver services to mobile grid users according to both user needs and current contexts. The algorithm decomposes global optimization problem into sub-optimizations. In the experiment, the performance evaluation of context aware service provisioning algorithm is conducted.
