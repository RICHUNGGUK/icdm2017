First, the power fading induced by chromatic dispersion is well described for DSB OFDM signals. Then we show by simulation and experiment that the power fading effect can be made negligible for an access network by employment of high-order modulation and a low radio frequency carrier and allocating subcarriers dynamically according to the power penalty. 20-Gbit/s DSB OFDM transmission over 26.7-km and 100-km standard single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated. Compared with single-sideband transmission, the DSB transmitter has a simpler structure, which reduces the access cost or complexity.", "paper_title": "Comparison of DSB and SSB Transmission for OFDM-PON [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000311794600013"}
