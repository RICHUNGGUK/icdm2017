It is an NP-hard problem which plays important roles in computing theory and in many real life applications. Chemical reaction optimization (CRO) is a new optimization framework, inspired by the nature of chemical reactions. CRO has demonstrated excellent performance in solving many engineering problems such as the quadratic assignment problem, neural network training, multimodal continuous problems, etc. This paper proposes a new chemical reaction optimization with greedy strategy algorithm (CROG) to solve KP01. The paper also explains the operator design and parameter turning methods for CROG. A new repair function integrating a greedy strategy and random selection is used to repair the infeasible solutions. The experimental results have proven the superior performance of CROG compared to genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA).
