These are evaluated on a database consisting of 3D surfaces of a section of the pelvic bone obtained from CT scans of 33 porcine carcasses. The superior model with respect to sparsity, reconstruction error and interpretability is found to be a varimax rotated model with a threshold applied to small loadings. The models describe the biological variation in the database and are used for developing robotic tools when automating labor-intensive procedures in abattoirs.", "paper_title": "Comparison of sparse point distribution models", "paper_id": "WOS:000282095900016"}
