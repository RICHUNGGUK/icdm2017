Design/methodology/approach - The resource distribution problems are formulated. For the typical mathematical model of a single production operation, the resource distribution algorithms are derived analytically or, when that is impossible, numerical procedures for finding solutions to distribution problems are suggested. Findings - The uncertain variables have been proved as a convenient tool for solving specific optimization problems in production management based on relational knowledge representation with unknown parameters. Originality/value - The paper presents analytical resource distribution and numerical algorithms for determining the optimal resource distribution, which may be applied in knowledge-based management-level decision systems for serial-parallel and parallel-serial structures of production systems.", "paper_title": "Decision making under uncertainty for a class of production systems with serial and parallel operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000257527600008"}
