When the mechanical response of the implant-bone system is analysed by means of numerical models, the effective mechanical properties of bone and the possible change as a function of spatial position must be carefully considered. The procedure presented provides for the attribution of the mechanical properties of bone, considered as anisotropic elastic material, as a function of the spatial position making use of Fourier series and polynomial functions. The procedure is implemented in a general purpose finite element software, adopted to develop biomechanical analyses of prosthetic systems. This procedure allows for an accurate representation of bone tissue properties. Results pertaining to the analysis of commercial oral implants show the potential of the method adopted.
