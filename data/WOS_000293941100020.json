The objective is to investigate the important factors that may affect the muco-ciliary transport and to understand better the underlying mechanics of some respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis. The numerical technique implemented in this study is the projection method combined with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) for prescribed ciliary beating patterns. A systematic study of the muco-ciliary transport measured in terms of the mean mucus velocity is performed by changing (i) the viscosity of the mucus, (ii) the cilia beat frequency, (iii) the numbers of cilia, (iv) the thickness of PCL, and (v) the surface tension at the interface between the mucus and PCL We conclude that the cilia beat frequency, the number of cilia, and the depth of PCL are the critical factors affecting the muco-ciliary transport. Moreover, the present results show that the velocity of mucus layer will be reduced when the length of cilia is larger than the depth of PCL. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
