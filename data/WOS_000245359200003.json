These novel MDs are used here in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies of tyrosinase inhibitors, for finding functions that discriminate between the tyrosinase inhibitor compounds and inactive ones. In total 14 models were obtained and the best two discriminant functions (Eqs. 32 and 33) shown globally good classification of 91.00% and 90.17%, respectively, in the training set. The test set had accuracies of 93.33% and 88.89% for the models 32 and 33, correspondingly. A simulated virtual screening was also carried out to prove the quality of the determined models. In a final step, the fitted models were used in the biosilico identification of new synthesized tetraketones, where a good agreement could be observed between the theoretical and experimental results. Four compounds of the novel bioactive chemicals discovered as tyrosinase inhibitors: TK10 (IC50 = 2.09 mu M), TK11 (IC50 = 2.61 mu M), TK21 (IC50 = 2.06 mu M), TK23 (IC50 = 3.19 mu M), showed more potent activity than L-mimose (IC50 = 3.68 mu M). Besides, for this study a heterogeneous database of tyrosinase inhibitors was collected, and could be a useful tool for the scientist in the domain of tyrosinase enzyme researches. The current report could help to shed some clues in the identification of new chemicals that inhibits enzyme tyrosinase, for entering in the pipeline of drug discovery development.", "paper_title": "Bond-based 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD approach for drug discovery: aiding decision-making in 'in silico' selection of new lead tyrosinase inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000245359200003"}
