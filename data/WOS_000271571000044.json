In the last couple of years, agent-based management systems have been widely used to monitor and control business design processes. In this paper, multi-agent architecture is proposed and applied to the workflow management system in ASE(1) (Advance Semiconductor Electronic) Inc., which is the world's well-known largest provider of independent semiconductor for manufacturing services in assembly and test. The proposed FIPA-OS autonomous workflow management system uses a workflow co-ordination mechanism and an agent integration mechanism to enable the routine daily jobs error handle. Our vision for extending the FIPA-OS architectural elements to cover the development and implementation of generic web-Centric collaborative applications concludes the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
