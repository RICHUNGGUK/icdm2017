In S(X) local spline quasi- interpolants are defined by linear combinations of integer translates of B {B-alpha, alpha is an element of Z(3)} and local linear functionals {Df (alpha), alpha is an element of Z(3)}. First a quasi- interpolant of differential type is proposed and its coefficient functionals are linear combinations of values of f with its partial derivatives at the center of the support of B-alpha. Then, by convenient discretisations of the above differential coefficients, three quasi- interpolants of discrete type with different properties are defined. In this case the coefficient functionals are linear combinations of values of f at specific points in the support of B-alpha. Upper bounds both for the norm of the discrete quasi- interpolation operators and for the approximation error are given. Finally, some numerical examples, illustrating the approximation properties of the proposed quasi- interpolants, are presented.", "paper_title": "Quasi-interpolation operators based on the trivariate seven-direction C (2) quartic box spline", "paper_id": "WOS:000294463100014"}
