The energy and energy-dissipation rate for the enhanced model are derived. It is also shown that the consistency error, relative to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the microscale of the enhanced model are less than those of the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model. The proposed model is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex problem and results show a qualitatively improved representation of the mean-square vorticity when compared to the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model. Numerical studies of the energy spectrum and the alignment between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the stretching tensor for three-dimensional turbulent flows with Re = 200 are used to explore the utility of the model. A benchmark problem of a two-dimensional channel flow over a step for Re = 600 also indicates that this model can be applied to more general flows than those involving periodic boundary conditions.
