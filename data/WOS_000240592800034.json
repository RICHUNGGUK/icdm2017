Since Benaloh and Tuinstra introduced this property, there has been a large amount of work devoted to the construction of receipt-free voting protocols. This paper provides a generic and uniform formalism that captures the notion of a receipt. The formalism is then applied to analyse the receipt-freeness of a number of voting protocols.", "paper_title": "Formalising receipt-freeness", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800034"}
