(1998) in Czech men. Methods. The validation was performed within the 20-year primary prevention study of atherosclerotic risk factors (STULONG) including 1417 middle-aged men from the Czech Republic (Prague). A total of 646 men examined in 1979-1988, and followed-up for ten years, were included into the validation study. The calibration and discrimination ability of the Framingham risk function in the Czech population were explored. Results: The estimated 10-year risk of CH D by the Framingham risk function was 12.8% in 646 men, significantly higher than the observed risk (16.4%), p = 0.013. The trend in the 10-year incidence of CHO was significantly increasing with quintiles of the estimated risk, p < 0.001. After the recalibration of the Framingham risk function, there was an insignificant difference between the estimated (18.2%) and observed (16.4%) risks of CHD, p = 0.320. The Framingham risk function classified men into those with and without CH D in the 10-year period with accuracy over 60%. Conclusions. Unlike some validation studies from Western Europe, the Framingham risk function significantly underestimated the 10-year CHD risk in the Czech Republic. In agreement with these studies, the incidence of CH D was significantly increasing across quintiles of the estimated risk.", "paper_title": "The Framingham risk function underestimated absolute coronary heart disease risk in Czech men", "paper_id": "WOS:000243757400012"}
