The discrete unit disk cover problem is a geometric version of the general set cover problem which is NP-hard. The general set cover problem is not approximable within c log vertical bar P vertical bar, for some constant c, but the DUDC problem was shown to admit a constant factor approximation. In this paper, we provide an algorithm with constant approximation factor 18. The running time of the proposed algorithm is O(n log n + m log m + m n). The previous best known tractable solution for the same problem was a 22-factor approximation algorithm with running time O(m(2)n(4)).", "paper_title": "ON THE DISCRETE UNIT DISK COVER PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000315158000002"}
