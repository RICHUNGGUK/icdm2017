The pooling problems were optimized using a piecewise linear scheme that activates appropriate under-and overestimators with a number of binary decision variables that scales linearly with the number of segments in the piecewise relaxation. Inspired by recent work (Vielma & Nemhauser, 2010; Vielma, Ahmed, & Nemhauser, 2010b), we introduce a formulation for the piecewise linear relaxation of bilinear functions with a logarithmic number of binary variables and computationally compare the performance of this new formulation to the best-performing piecewise relaxations with a linear number of binary variables. We have unified our work by developing APOGEE, a computational tool that globally optimizes standard, generalized, and extended pooling problems.
