Classical rough set theory is based on equivalent relation. It has been indicated that it could be generated to case with a similarity relation. So far, there has been theoretical investigations on roughness measure of fuzzy set based on equivalent relation. The intention of this paper is to go further and propose a measure of roughness of a type-2 fuzzy set based on similarity relation and prove some properties of this novel measure.", "paper_title": "Roughness of type-2 fuzzy set based on similarity relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351600008"}
