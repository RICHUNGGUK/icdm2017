We firstly exploit the planar-plus-an-isolated sensor array geometry (Li et al. in IEE Proc Radar Sonar Navig 143(5):295-299, 1996) to define a full rank cross-covariance matrix. Then we develop an efficient ESPRIT-like algorithm using the so-called propagator to estimate the steering vectors of electromagnetic vector sensor, without performing eigen-decomposition into signal subspaces. Finally, we compute the vector cross product to obtain the closed-form azimuth-elevation angle estimates. The new algorithm does not require 2D iterative searching, and is applicable to coherent (fully correlated) signals and spatially correlated noise. In addition, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced estimation precision by sparse array aperture extension, but suffers no DOA cyclical ambiguity. Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Efficient 2D DOA estimation of coherent signals in spatially correlated noise using electromagnetic vector sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000278470200003"}
