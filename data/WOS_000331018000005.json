Eleven MTW features are extracted from the acquired signals using four window functions, namely rectangular windows, Hamming windows, trapezoidal windows, and Slepian windows. Prominent features are selected using genetic algorithm and information gain based ranking. Four different classification algorithms, namely naive Bayes, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour, and linear discriminant analysis, are used for the study. Classifier performances with the MTW features are compared with the currently used time- and frequency-domain features. The results show a reduction in mean and median frequencies of the signals under fatigue. Mean and variance,of the features differ by an order of magnitude between the two cases considered. The number of features is reduced by 45% with the genetic algorithm and 36% with information gain based ranking. The k-nearest neighbour algorithm is found to be the most accurate in classifying the features, with a maximum accuracy of 93% with the features selected using information gain ranking.
