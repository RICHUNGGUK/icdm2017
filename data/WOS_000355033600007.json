This model approximates the stress and displacement fields in the domain and the displacement field on the static boundary. Legendre polynomials are used to define all approximation bases, in order to compute analytical solutions for all structural operators. It enables also the implementation of highly efficient p-refinement procedures. A material linear behaviour is assumed and to validate the model and to illustrate its potential, numerical tests are presented and compared with analytical and numerical solutions.
