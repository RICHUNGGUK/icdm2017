The matchmaking based on keywords easily leads to low precision, Meanwhile, the current semantic service discovery methods perform service I/O based profile matching, there exists no matchmaker that performs an integrated service matching by additional reasoning on logically defined preconditions, effects, Qos and so on. In this paper, the semantic web services are described based on Description Logics, and the services description model is designed, which describes the various aspects (such as IOPEs, Qos and so on) of the web services. So the services matchmaking is transformed into the match of concepts. The service match algorithm is proposed and the description logics reasoner RacerPro is adopted for Web services discovery. We show how the semantic matching between providers and a requester is performed by a case study.", "paper_title": "A Semantic Model for Matchmaking of Web Services Based on Description Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000272819800012"}
