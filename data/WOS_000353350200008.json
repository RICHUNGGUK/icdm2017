The accurate detection of iris eyelids and reflections is the prerequisite for the accurate iris recognition, both in near-infrared or visible spectrum measurements. The model adaptively learns its parameters on the iris texture part and subsequently checks for iris reflections using the recursive prediction analysis. The method is developed for color eye images from unconstrained mobile devices but it was also successfully tested on the UBIRIS v2 eye database. Our method ranked first from the 97+1 recent Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation contest alternative methods on this large color iris database using the exact contest data and methodology.
