In this paper, we apply differential evolution to the problem of extracting the optimal colours of a colour map for quantised images. The choice of entries in the colour map is crucial for the resulting image quality as it forms a look-up table that is used for all pixels in the image. We show that differential evolution can be effectively employed as a method for deriving the entries in the map. In order to optimise the image quality, our differential evolution approach is combined with a local search method that is guaranteed to find the local optimal colour map. This hybrid approach is shown to outperform various commonly used colour quantisation algorithms on a set of standard images.", "paper_title": "Optimal image colour extraction by differential evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000208451900010"}
