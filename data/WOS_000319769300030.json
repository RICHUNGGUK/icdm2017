This approach is called Bi-SOM (for Bi-clustering based on Self-Organizing Map). The main goal of bi-clustering aims to simultaneously group the rows and columns of a given data matrix. In addition, we propose in this work to deal with some issues related to this task: (1) the topological visualization of bi-clusters with respect to their neighborhood relation, (2) the optimization of these bi-clusters in macro-blocks and (3) the dimensionality reduction by eliminating noise blocks, iteratively. Finally, experiments are given over several data sets for validating our approach in comparison with other bi-clustering methods.", "paper_title": "Bi-clustering continuous data with self-organizing map", "paper_id": "WOS:000319769300030"}
