We show that Var(Z(n.kn),) = o((EZ(n),(kn))(2)) as n -> infinity if and only if k(n) = o(n(2/5)). In particular then, the weak law of large numbers holds for Z(n,kn) if k(n) = o(n(2/5)); that is, (n ->infinity lim) Z(n,kn)/EZ(n,kn) = 1, in probability. We also show the following approximation result for the uniform measure U-n on S-n. Define the probability measure mu(n;kn) on S-n by mu(n;kn) = 1/((n)(kn)) (x1 < x2 <)...(< xkn) Sigma U-n;x1,U-x2,U-...,U-xkn, where U-n;x1,U-x2....xkn denotes the uniform measure on the subset of permutations that contain the increasing subsequence {x(1),x(2),...,x(kn)}. Then the weak law of large numbers holds for Z(n,kn) if and only if (lim)(n ->infinity) vertical bar vertical bar mu(n;kn) - U-n vertical bar vertical bar = 0, where vertical bar vertical bar (.) vertical bar vertical bar denotes the total variation norm. In particular then, (*) holds if k(n) = o(n(2/5)). In order to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the second moment, we need to analyze occupation times of certain conditioned two-dimensional random walks.
