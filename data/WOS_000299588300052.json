Tang et al. proposed a class of Boolean functions in even variables with optimal algebraic degree, very high nonlinearity and optimal algebraic immunity. In this corresponding, we consider the concatenation of Tang's function and another Boolean function, and study its cryptographic properties. With this idea, we propose a class of I-resilient Boolean functions in odd variables with optimal algebraic degree, good nonlinearity and suboptimal algebraic immunity based on Tu-Deng's conjecture.", "paper_title": "A Class of 1-Resilient Functions in Odd Variables with High Nonlinearity and Suboptimal Algebraic Immunity", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300052"}
