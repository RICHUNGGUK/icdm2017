Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory and linear matrix inequality technique, a less conservative delay-dependent stability criterion is derived to guarantee the exponential stability of TSFDCNNs. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the supplementary requirement that the time derivative of time-varying delays must be smaller than one is released in the proposed delay-dependent stability criterion. Two illustrative examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy cellular neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641800019"}
