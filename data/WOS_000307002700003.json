This paper proposes a family of predictive methods adapted to digital pulse-width modulations for digital-controlled PFC operated under boundary current mode. The DPWM methods include leading-edge modulation, trailing-edge modulation and triangular modulation. For the proposed control method, the switching period retaining zero current switching is predicted and the turn-on period is determined by the voltage controller. Therefore, neither zero-current detection nor high-frequency A/D converter for current sampling is required for the proposed control method. Experimental results derived from a DSP-based controller are presented for confirmation. The power factor corrector is with 250 W power rating, 100 V/AC/50 Hz input, and 385 V/DC output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive digital-controlled PFC under boundary current mode control.", "paper_title": "A Family of Predictive Digital-Controlled PFC Under Boundary Current Mode Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000307002700003"}
