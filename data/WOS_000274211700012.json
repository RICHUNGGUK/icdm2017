The ill-posed nature of the tomographic reconstruction problem, however, limits the attainable resolution. Improvements in resolution and overall imaging performance can be achieved by forming image priors from geometric information obtained by a secondary anatomical or functional high-resolution imaging modality such as X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. A particular challenge in using image priors is to avoid the use of assumptions that may bias the solution and reduced the accuracy of the inverse problem. This is particularly relevant in FMT inversions where there is not an evident link between secondary geometric information and the underlying fluorescence biodistribution. We present here a new, two step approach to incorporating structural priors into the FMT inverse problem. By using the anatomic information to define a low dimensional inverse problem, we obtain a solution which we then use to determine the parameters defining a spatially varying regularization matrix for the full resolution problem. The regularization term is thus customized for each data set and is guided by the data rather than depending only on user defined a priori assumptions. Results are presented for both simulated and experimental data sets, and show significant improvements in image quality as compared to traditional regularization techniques.", "paper_title": "Data Specific Spatially Varying Regularization for Multimodal Fluorescence Molecular Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000274211700012"}
