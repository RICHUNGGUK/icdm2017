Inhomogeneous systems, where these characteristics fluctuate spatially, are poorly tracked when parameters are set globally. Results: We present a novel SPT approach that adapts the well-known nearest-neighbor tracking algorithm to the local density of particles to overcome the problems of inhomogeneity. Conclusions: We demonstrate the performance improvement provided by the proposed method using numerical simulations and experimental data and compare its performance with state of the art SPT algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive settings for the nearest-neighbor particle tracking algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700017"}
