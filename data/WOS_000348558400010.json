We prove that it is impossible for one to achieve the highest-existing efficiency index of fourth order and three function evaluations per step. Using the other model, which has been suggested by Zhou et al., we derive 53 unique methods of rational forms with the highest efficiency index, those including all known methods of the same efficiency index. Numerical comparisons are done to compare the performances of the methods, and for those with the best results, explicit formulae are given. The methods thus presented are superior in efficiency when compared with any existing methods.", "paper_title": "ON FOURTH-ORDER ITERATIVE METHODS FOR MULTIPLE ROOTS OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558400010"}
