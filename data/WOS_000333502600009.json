The time-varying transition probability uncertainty is described as a polytope set. Stochastic stability is analyzed for the underlying systems by Lyapunov function approach and a sufficient condition is derived to design controllers such that the resulting closed-loop system is stochastically stable and a prescribed H-infinity performance is also achieved. Furthermore, the attraction domain of this Markov jump system is estimated and evaluated. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the developed techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
