In this paper, the authors undertake an assessment of some of the common tools that have been designed to aid the aged in opening common packaging items with the aim of understanding their effectiveness. The study used a purpose built torque testing device embedded in a standard glass jar and asked participants to twist the lid of the device both unaided and with a tool and the maximum torque produced was noted. The study indicated that whilst some tools are effective, most however offer little or no benefit, as they do not overcome issues such as loss of dexterity and strength amongst the aged population.", "paper_title": "Understanding the use of tools for opening packaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000289362600008"}
