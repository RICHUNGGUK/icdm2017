In this paper we provide a survey of the main work on p-cycles to date. The characteristics of p-cycles and various types of protection provided by them are discussed. Finally, some possible extensions or enhancements of the p-cycle concept are discussed.", "paper_title": "p-Cycles: An Overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000274737100002"}
