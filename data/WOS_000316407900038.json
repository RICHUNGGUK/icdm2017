We argue that it is the symmetric-side channel. This connection is partially motivated by recent work, where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate a secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a shared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever used to simulate a symmetric-side channel. Here, we further show, in complete analogy to the role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side channel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently introduced mutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the extent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification. Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been recently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum channel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this nonadditivity and its relation to quantum privacy. In particular, we show that single-copy superactivation protocols with the erasure channel, which encompasses all examples of nonadditivity of the quantum capacity found to date, can be understood as a conversion of mutual independence into distillable entanglement.", "paper_title": "Public Quantum Communication and Superactivation", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900038"}
