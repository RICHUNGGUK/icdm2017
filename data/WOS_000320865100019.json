This paper presents two methods to obtain the inverse kinematics of a mobile robot. In the first method, two rows of the forward kinematics are selected, the inverse of these two rows is obtained, and later the inverse matrix is combined with the third row of the forward kinematics. In the second method, the pseudo-inverse matrix of the forward kinematics matrix is obtained. The comparison result of the two proposed methods is presented. Two simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed inverse kinematics algorithm.", "paper_title": "Inverse kinematics of a mobile robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100019"}
