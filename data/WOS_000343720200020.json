The intermolecular interactions between HNS and TNT were revealed by quantum chemistry calculations in detail, strong attractive forces were found between HNS and TNT. The solid interface models of TNT/HNS along three crystalline directions were studied, the distance between HNS molecule and TNT system was narrowed after optimization; the mechanical properties were calculated, showing the mechanism of the reinforcement.", "paper_title": "The effect of HNS on the reinforcement of TNT crystal: a molecular simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000343720200020"}
