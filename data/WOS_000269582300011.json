The permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the Drude dispersion model and taken into account in FDTD simulations using an auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method. It is shown that the correction of numerical material parameters and the slow switching-on of source are necessary to ensure stable and convergent single-frequency simulations. Numerical results from wideband simulations demonstrate that waves passing through a three-dimensional cloak experience considerable delay comparing with the free space propagations, as well as pulse broadening and blue-shift effects.
