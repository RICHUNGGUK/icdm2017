The propagation of the circle-polarized Gaussian Schell model beam is studied based on the cross-spectral density matrix. The results show that the state of polarization remains unchanged and the degree of polarization slightly increases upon propagation in a turbulent atmosphere. The analysis of the bit-error-rate performance shows that the CPolSK system has about a 3 dB lower requirement in signal-to-noise ratio than the on-off keying system. The modulation scheme will be helpful for practical free-space optical communication systems in the future.", "paper_title": "Circle Polarization Shift Keying With Direct Detection for Free-Space Optical Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408300011"}
