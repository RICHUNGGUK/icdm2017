However, as the main force of the ICT field, the mobile networks, are currently focusing on the capacity, variety and stability of the communication services, without paying too much severe concerns on the energy efficiency. The escalating energy costs and environmental concerns have already created an urgent need for more energy-efficient \"green\" wireless communications. In this paper, we survey and discuss various remarkable techniques toward green mobile networks, to mainly targeting mobile cellular networks. We also summarize the current research projects related to green mobile networks, along with the taxonomy of energy-efficiency metrics. We finally discuss and elaborate future research opportunities and design challenges for green mobile networks.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Green Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200002"}
