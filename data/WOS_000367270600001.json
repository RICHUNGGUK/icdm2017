Combining cloud computing with mobile technologies has enabled the healthcare service provider to offer continuous health data collection and physicians to conveniently monitor and assess users' health while they are at home. However, users' health data contain highly confidential information, and servers in the cloud are out of users' trusted domain. Therefore, users may be reluctant to take advantage of remote health monitoring systems before they make sure their data are properly protected. In this paper, we propose a secure continuous remote health monitoring system named SCRHM with the main component, a searchable encryption scheme supporting range searches for remote health monitoring system. With this scheme, remote health monitoring service provider is able to detect outliers over encrypted health parameters. Using analysis, we prove the correctness and security of the proposed scheme on privacy protection of users' health data. Via simulation experiments, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of computation and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "SCRHM: A Secure Continuous Remote Health Monitoring System", "paper_id": "WOS:000367270600001"}
