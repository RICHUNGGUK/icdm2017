However, PCM's limited write endurance restricts its immediate use as a replacement for DRAM. To extend the lifetime of PCM chips, wear-leveling and salvaging techniques have been proposed. Wear-leveling balances write operations across different PCM regions while salvaging extends the duty cycle and provides graceful degradation for a nonnegligible number of failures. Current wear-leveling and salvaging schemes have not been designed and integrated to work cooperatively to achieve the best PCM device lifetime. In particular, a noncontiguous PCM space generated from salvaging complicates wear-leveling and incurs large overhead. In this article, we propose LLS, a Line-Level mapping and Salvaging design. By allocating a dynamic portion of total space in a PCM device as backup space, and mapping failed lines to backup PCM, LLS constructs a contiguous PCM space and masks lower-level failures from the OS and applications. LLS integrates wear-leveling and salvaging and copes well with modern OSes. Our experimental results show that LLS achieves 31% longer lifetime than the state-of-the-art. It has negligible hardware cost and performance overhead.", "paper_title": "Hardware-Assisted Cooperative Integration of Wear-Leveling and Salvaging for Phase Change Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000318485400002"}
