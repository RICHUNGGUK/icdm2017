This paper investigates the problem of three-axis rigid spacecraft maneuver control. The rigid spacecraft model consisting of the dynamic and kinematics equation is firstly provided. This nonlinear model is converted into a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Then, based on the parallel distributed compensation scheme, a fuzzy state feedback controller is designed for the obtained T-S fuzzy model with considering the decay rate and input constraints. Next, sufficient conditions for the existence of such a controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities and the controller design is cast into a convex optimization problem subject to linear matrix inequalities constraints, which can be readily solved via Matlab LMI toolbox. At last, a design example shows that the time of spacecraft attitude maneuver is shortened and the input constraint is realized. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "FUZZY CONTROL OF RIGID SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE MANEUVER WITH DECAY RATE AND INPUT CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297519100007"}
