This contribution discusses the DPA-resistant implementation of two eSTREAM finalists using SABL logic styles. Particularly, two Feedback Shift Register (FSR) based stream ciphers, Grain v.1 and Trivium are designed in both BSim3 130nm and typical 350nm technologies and simulated by HSpice software. Circuit simulations and statistical power analysis show that DPA resistivity of SABL implementation of both stream ciphers has a major improvement. The paper presents the tradeoffs involved in the circuit design and the design for performance issues.", "paper_title": "On DPA-Resistive Implementation of FSR-based Stream Ciphers using SABL Logic Styles", "paper_id": "WOS:000260214800001"}
