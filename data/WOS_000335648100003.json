A real-time routing protocol for MWSN is an exciting area of research because messages are delivered according to their end-to-end deadlines. MWSN demands real-time routing in many applications including disasters fighting, forest fire detection and volcanic eruption detection. This paper proposes a novel idea of real-time that provides mobility and load distribution (RTMLD) for MWSN. RTMLD utilised corona mechanism and optimal forwarding metrics to forward the data packet in MWSN. It computes the optimal forwarding node based on RSSI, remaining battery level of sensor nodes and packet delay over one-hop. RTMLD ensures high packet delivery ratio and experiences minimum end-to-end delay in WSN and MWSN compared with baseline routing protocol. RTMLD has been successfully verified through test bed and simulation experiment.", "paper_title": "A real-time routing protocol with mobility support and load distribution for mobile wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335648100003"}
