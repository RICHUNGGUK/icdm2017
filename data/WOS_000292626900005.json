More general and practical continuous type of,sensor fault is considered here. Both prior known sensor faults and unknown sensor faults are investigated for satellite attitude control systems. Reliable controller based on a modified observer is realized by means of EMI, which guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system and reduces the conservatives of the system design. Numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "ROBUST OBSERVER BASED RELIABLE CONTROL FOR SATELLITE ATTITUDE CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH SENSOR FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900005"}
