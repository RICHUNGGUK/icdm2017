To implement a test, we first explore the null limiting distribution of the residual empirical process from ACD models and verify that it has an asymptotic expansion form that consists of the true empirical process and extra terms yielded by parameter estimation. Then, we show that under regularity conditions, the proposed entropy test approximately follows a distribution that is free from the parameter estimation. For illustration, a simulation study and real data analysis are conducted. In the implementation of the test, a parametric bootstrap method is employed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
