However these techniques are usually not provided with tools for end-users to efficiently use the produced summaries. This paper presents a first attempt to develop a querying tool for the SAINTETIQ summarization model. The proposed search algorithm takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of the SAINTETIQ summaries to efficiently answer questions such as \"how are, on some attributes, the tuples which have specific characteristics?\" Moreover, this algorithm can be seen both as a boolean querying mechanism over a hierarchy of summaries, and as a flexible querying mechanism over the underlying relational tuples.", "paper_title": "Querying a summary of database", "paper_id": "WOS:000236616100005"}
