Xie and C. C. J. Kuo, where the Zhu's chaos-based stream cipher is used to replace the 128-bit MD5 hash function as the secret key. The reason is that the Zhu's chaos-based stream cipher could output keystream of arbitrary length. We encrypted the extracted video compressed stream with various combination according to the demands. Therefore, a multiple security encryption scheme could be obtained. Experimental security analysis showed that it is of high security and able to withstand the attacks of ciphertext only, known plaintext and chosen plaintext. Besides, the compression performance and the computation time comparison among the selective encryption, all entropy encoder output encryption, and the original compressed bitstream without encryption were also examined.", "paper_title": "A CHAOS-BASED MULTIPLE SECURITY ENCRYPTION SYSTEM FOR COMPRESSED VIDEO", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400004"}
