These control strategies can accommodate some nonlinear characteristics by allowing the gains varied or rescheduled as a function of system states. In this paper, a novel fuzzy framework is developed to transfer this type of nonlinear controller to its fuzzy domain representation. It is proved that the resulting fuzzy controller is functionally exactly identical to the original control system. One of the benefits of the suggested approach is that it provides a well-defined prototype for the design of fuzzy control system. The resulting linguistic representation can facilitate investigation in linguistic terms into how the controller operates, whereas expert knowledge can be effectively implemented to improve control performance. The viability of the proposed mapping technique is demonstrated by using simulations corresponding to a flexible-link robot. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
