Through the development of a security ontology, developers locate the major security-related concepts relevant to their application context. Security patterns are then integrated with these concepts to provide tested solutions for accommodating security requirements.", "paper_title": "A framework for exploiting security expertise in application development", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700007"}
