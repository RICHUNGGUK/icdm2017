To explore the patterns among drug patents in the Orange Book, this study used patent bibliometric analysis. The productivity and impact are presented at the assignee level and applicant level, respectively, and the applicant's patent portfolio is further discussed. 2,033 drug patents are identified in this current study. Our findings indicate that the applicant's patent portfolio in the Orange Book is helpful in revealing the technological capability and patent strategy of the pharmaceutical incumbents. By linking drug data and patent information, this current study sheds light on patent research in the pharmaceutical industry.", "paper_title": "Tracking R&D behavior: bibliometric analysis of drug patents in the Orange Book", "paper_id": "WOS:000294839700008"}
