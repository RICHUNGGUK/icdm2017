Under the assumption of the feasibility of the considered control problem, a new procedure based on multilevel control techniques is developed to solve this optimization problem. It is shown that with the proposed technique, it is neither required to increase the dimensionality of the system due to time delays, nor use extra multipliers to handle the system constraints. Our results are applied to a practical control problem to show the efficiency of the developed algorithm in getting the optimal solution with great saving in calculation time.", "paper_title": "Multilevel technique for large scale LQR with time-delays and systems constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000016"}
