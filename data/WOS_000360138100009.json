The scope of the platform is to address the sustainability of energy production and use efficiency. A first prototype of this platform is under development in the framework of the French ANR Plate-Form(E) 3 project. Interoperability issues have been faced to design the platform. Best available candidate technologies for implementing the platform are also discussed. One architecture for facing the basic interoperability issues is also presented. A real industrial application case example is proposed to show the potential use of the proposed architecture.", "paper_title": "Toward an Interoperable Software Platform for Sustainable Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000360138100009"}
