Exact symbol error rate expressions are derived by using the moment-generating function-based analysis method. Upper bound expressions have been obtained in order to examine the asymptotic diversity order of transmit antenna selection/Alamouti scheme. Also, outage probability analysis of investigated systems has been given in order to examine the system capacity. Monte Carlo simulations have validated the analytical symbol error rate performance results.
