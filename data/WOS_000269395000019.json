These results are getten by an engineering innovation model which combines the multiple steps of the modified TRIZ method (MSMTM) and the TRIZ contradiction matrix clustering method (TCMC). In general, using TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) contradiction matrix, only a single improving feature is selected for the innovative invention improvement. However, in multiple engineering problems, the improvement object can not be reached if it only follows the above mentioned process. The MSMTM proposed in this study indicates that the main problem should be defined first. Then, the sub-problems which induced from the understanding solving, the main and the preliminary problems can be defined. Then, \"TCMC\" is adopted to select innovative rules and the engineering knowledge is matched to find the probably solution. Finally, all inventive rules should be combined and matched with the probably solutions, yielding a complete engineering innovation procedure. The TCMC used herein has the advantage of the fast selection of the corresponding worsening feature and the inventive rule, making the engineering innovation procedure more complete than tradition TRIZ method.", "paper_title": "INNOVATION PROCEDURE FOR POLISHING TIMES CALCULATIONS OF COMPENSATED CMP USING MULTIPLE STEPS OF THE MODIFIED TRIZ METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000019"}
