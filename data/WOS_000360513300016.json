In the last decade, a number of technological advances have stimulated an increased interest in this field. We survey the research in the area and present a comprehensive review of travel time modelling, applications and solution methods. In particular, we make a first classification in point-to-point and multiple-point problems. A second major classification is then performed with respect to the quality and evolution of information. Other criteria included: (i) node, arc or general routing; (ii) the possibility to choose the vehicle speed.
