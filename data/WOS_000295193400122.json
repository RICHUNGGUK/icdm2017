A newly successful RFID application can enhance their change in organization and to manage growth in an increasingly competitive environment. But, there is a high failure rate in new products development processes. Thus, RFID manufacturers need an effective tool to assist them to create novel RFID product functions. This study proposes a newly systematic approach called QT-Kano model which integrates three management tools, quality function deployment (QFD), the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), and a refined Kano's model, to create new product functions of RFID products. In QT-Kano model, QFD has firstly been used to transform customer demands into engineering quality characteristics. Secondly, based on the contradiction relationship between those engineering quality characteristics, the novel designed functions are created by TRIZ. Finally, to reduce the high failure rate in new products development processes, a refined Kano's model are applied to offer a better understanding from customer's viewpoint and to assist service designers focusing on the most important attributes that need to be improved. A real case of RFID product function development is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
