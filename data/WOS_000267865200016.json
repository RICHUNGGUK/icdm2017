However, the training time and, to a lesser extent, prediction time of SVMs on very large data sets can be very long. This paper presents a fast compression method to scale up SVMs to large data sets. A simple bit-reduction method is applied to reduce the cardinatity of the data by weighting representative examples. We then develop SVMs trained on the weighted data. Experiments indicate that bit-reduction SVM produces a significant reduction in the time required for both training and prediction with minimum loss in accuracy. It is also shown to typically be more accurate than random sampling when the data are not overcompressed.", "paper_title": "Fast Support Vector Machines for Continuous Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000267865200016"}
