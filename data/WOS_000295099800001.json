Although circuit-level solutions for some variation problems may be possible, they are prohibitively expensive and impractical for commodity processors, on which not only the consumer market but also an increasing segment of the business market now depends. Solutions at the microarchitecture level and even the software level, on the other hand, overcome some of these circuit-level challenges without significantly raising costs or lowering performance. Using examples drawn from our Alarms Project and related work, we illustrate how collaborative design that encompasses circuits, architecture, and chip-resident software leads to a cost-effective solution for inductive voltage noise, sometimes called the dI/dt problem. The strategy that we use for assuring correctness while preserving performance can be extended to other variation problems.", "paper_title": "Resilient Architectures via Collaborative Design: Maximizing Commodity Processor Performance in the Presence of Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000295099800001"}
