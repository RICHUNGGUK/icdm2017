The nonlinear system is approximated by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy linear model. The approximation error between the nonlinear system and the fuzzy linear model is considered as one part of the uncertainty in the uncertain nonlinear system. The time varying uncertainties are assumed to have the format which enables the design of the coefficient matrix of the sliding function to satisfy a sliding coefficient matching condition. With the sliding coefficient matching condition satisfied, a parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode controller (PDFSC) is designed. The stability and the sliding mode of the fuzzy sliding control system are guaranteed. Also, the nonlinear system is shown to be invariant on the sliding surface. Moreover, the chattering around the sliding surface in the sliding mode control can be reduced by the proposed design approach. Simulation results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy sliding mode controller.", "paper_title": "Parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode control for nonlinear mismatched uncertain systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244305200002"}
