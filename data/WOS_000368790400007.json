The IMLE method takes into account both computational cost and estimation accuracy. The associated gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the MLE cost function are derived. The characteristics of the proposed joint discriminator are analyzed based on the properties of the MLE cost function, gradient vector, and Hessian matrix. The effectiveness of IMLE is verified by Monte Carlo simulation.", "paper_title": "A novel joint navigation state error discriminator based on iterative maximum likelihood estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000368790400007"}
