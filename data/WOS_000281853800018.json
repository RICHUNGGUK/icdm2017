Previous work by the authors dealt with algebraic MLS surfaces, and proposed a resampling strategy based on defining the new points at the intersections of the MLS surface with a suitable set of rays. That strategy has very low memory requirements and is easy to parallelize. In this article new resampling strategies with reduced CPU-time cost are explored. The basic idea is to choose as set of rays the lines of a regular, Cartesian grid, and to fully exploit this grid: as data structure for search queries, as spatial structure for traversing the surface in a continuation-like algorithm, and also as approximation grid for an interpolated version of the MLS surface. It is shown that in this way a very simple and compact resampling technique is obtained, which cuts the resampling cost by half with affordable memory requirements.", "paper_title": "Resampling Strategies for Deforming MLS Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000281853800018"}
