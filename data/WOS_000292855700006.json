Two different theoretical models are applied, namely: a thermodynamic model and an Ising like model including molecular vibrations. A combination two already existing Ising like models - one including the effect of an external magnetic field and the other taking molecular vibrations into account - is outlined and discussed. In all calculations a field dependency of the Spin Crossover transition temperature T-1/2 is evident. An external magnetic field induces a downward shift of T-1/2. This corresponds to results of high magnetic field experiments and thermal expansion measurements [1, 2].", "paper_title": "Mean Field Modelling of FeII Spin Crossover Systems in a Magnetic Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700006"}
