Our present work demonstrates a successful real implementation of extended Kalman filter (EKF) based SLAM algorithm for indoor environments, utilizing two web-cam based stereo-vision sensing mechanism. The vision-sensing mechanism is a successful development of a real algorithm for image feature identification in frames grabbed from continuously running videos on two cameras, tracking of these identified features in subsequent frames and incorporation of these landmarks in the map created, utilizing a 3D distance calculation module. The system has been successfully test-run in laboratory environments where the robot is commanded to navigate through some specified waypoints and create a map of its surrounding environment. Our experimentations showed that the estimated positions of the landmarks identified in the map created closely tallies with the actual positions of these landmarks in real-life.
