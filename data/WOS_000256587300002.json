One model is the standard cops and robber vertex-searching model with complete visibility. The second model differs from the preceding one only in that none of the searchers can see the intruder. The third model is a vertex-searching model in which searchers and an intruder move simultaneously and none of the searchers can see the intruder. The fourth model is simultaneous edge searching with an arbitrarily fast intruder. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
