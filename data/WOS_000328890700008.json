Rather, it is acquired through (linear) projection measurements, such as tomographic projections, interferometric measurements, coded-aperture measurements, and random projections associated with compressed sensing. This paper describes a new methodology for rapid and accurate estimation of the level set from such projection measurements. The key defining characteristic of the proposed method, called the projective level set estimator, is its ability to estimate the level set from projection measurements without an intermediate reconstruction step. This leads to significantly faster computation relative to heuristic \"plug-in\" methods that first estimate the function, typically with an iterative algorithm, and then threshold the result. The paper also includes a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method, which utilizes results from the literature on concentration of measure and characterizes the estimator's performance in terms of geometry of the measurement operator and l(1)-norm of the discretized function.", "paper_title": "Level Set Estimation from Projection Measurements: Performance Guarantees and Fast Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000328890700008"}
