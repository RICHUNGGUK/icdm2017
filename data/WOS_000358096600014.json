The model considers the bending strains in the ice deposit, the adhesive force at the ice-cable interface and the cohesive force within the ice. It is implemented into finite element analysis by setting a critical vertical acceleration corresponding to inertia forces overcoming the adhesive/cohesive forces on the ice chunk. The model is validated by results from reduced and real scale de-icing tests of glaze ice but the approach can apply to different types of atmospheric icing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
