During the optimisation iterations, the proposed method automatically introduces internal cavities and does not rely on an initial guess topology with pre-existing holes. The zero level set contours describing both the external geometry and the internal cavities are converted to non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) for smooth boundary element meshing at each iteration. The optimal geometries generated by the proposed method for two-dimensional cases closely resemble to those available in the literature for a range of benchmark examples in the field of topology optimisation.
