The CRN is made up of the licensed (primary) service stations which can share their spectrum resources with the unlicensed (secondary) stations. The objective is to provide wireless access to the secondary stations on a best effort basis without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for the primary stations. To accomplish this we employ a simple two-step procedure. In the first step the spectrum resources are allocated to primary stations to maximize the QoS for the primary users. In the second step the spare service capacity of the primary channels is distributed among the secondary stations to maximize the QoS of the secondary users. The proposed theoretical framework adheres closely with the LTE specification. The corresponding resource allocation algorithm does not involve additional network signaling over the wireless medium, and improves the overall QoS in the network. These advantages of the proposed approach for resource allocation make it ready for implementation in a real network. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
