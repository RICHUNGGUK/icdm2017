The software tool is operational from the first design phases and allows to study coupled phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The described design methodology is based on the association of analytical and numerical approaches. A coupled electromagnetic-thermal model is used for the analytical study. The numerical one uses the finite element method. Findings - The sequential implementation of the two approaches highlights their complementarities and improves the time consuming and the reliability of the design process. The thermal coupling allows to anticipate the overheating of the machine and to take it into account in the design process. Research limitations/implications - The simplifying assumptions made in the analytical model degrade the accuracy of temperature calculation. Practical implications - This is a useful tool for electric machines manufacturer planning. to obtain a fast and reliable solution in response to datasheet specifications. Originality/value - This paper describes a multidisciplinary design methodology which is performed by coupling methods and software tools at the aim to take advantage of each one.", "paper_title": "A coupled electromagnetic-thermal model for the design of electric machines - Association of analytical and numerical approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000244470900015"}
