We have implemented a C++ library and its graphical interface for MS-Windows, named wREFERASS, to facilitate the study of complex reaction mechanisms at the strict steady-state. The C++ library is freely available and could be used directly in any program language as a library function call. We have tested the program with very complex enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanisms and found its performance to be satisfactory. The program wREFERASS along with instructions and many examples, can be downloaded from http://oretano.iele-ab.uclm.es/similar to fgarcia/wREFERASS/", "paper_title": "wREFERASS: Rate Equations for Enzyme Reactions at Steady State under MS-Windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500002"}
