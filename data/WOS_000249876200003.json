Despite the fact that some components of this process have been described in the literature, the complete model of the whole process has not been proposed. In this paper a Petri net based model of the body iron homeostasis is presented. Recently, Petri nets have been used for describing and analyzing various biological processes since they allow modeling the system under consideration very precisely. The main result presented in the paper is twofold, i.e., an informal description of the main part of the whole iron homeostasis process is described, and then it is also formulated in the formal language of Petri net theory. This model allows for a possible simulation of the process, since Petri net theory provides a lot of established analysis techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
