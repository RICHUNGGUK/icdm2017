The task of identifying water eddies in sea surface temperature maps (SST) is time-consuming for oceanographers due to the large number of SST available. This motivates the present investigation aiming to develop an automatic system capable of performing that task. The system developed consists of a pre-processing stage where a vectorial field is calculated using an optical flow algorithm with one SST map and a matrix of zeros for input. Next, a binary image of the modulus of the vectorial field is created using an iterative thresholding algorithm. Finally, five edge points of the binary image, classified according to their gradient vector direction, are randomly selected and an ellipse corresponding to a water eddy fitted to them.", "paper_title": "Automatic water eddy detection in SST maps using random ellipse fitting and vectorial fields for image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200011"}
