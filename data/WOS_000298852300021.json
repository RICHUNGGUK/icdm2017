For a set S of points in a\"e (d) , a t-spanner is a sparse graph on the points of S such that there is a path in the spanner between any pair of points whose total length is at most t times the distance between the points. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a spanner whose update time depends solely on the number of points in S. In particular, we show how to maintain a (1+epsilon)-spanner with O(n/epsilon (d) ) edges, where points can be inserted to S in an amortized update time of O(log n) and deleted from S in an amortized update time of (O) over tilde (n(1/3)). As a by-product of our techniques we obtain a simple incremental algorithm for constructing a (1+epsilon)-spanner with O(n/epsilon (d) ) edges in constant doubling dimension metric spaces whose running time is O(nlog n).", "paper_title": "Fully Dynamic Geometric Spanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000298852300021"}
