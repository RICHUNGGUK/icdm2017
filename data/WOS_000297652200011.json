In order to solve a large-scale obstacle problem, the use of parallelism is necessary. In this work we present a parallel synchronous iterative algorithm to solve this problem and its asynchronous version. For the considered problem, the convergence of parallel synchronous and asynchronous algorithms is analysed in a general framework. Finally, computational experiments on GRID'5000, the French national grid, are presented and analysed. They allow us to compare both synchronous and asynchronous versions with local and distributed clusters.", "paper_title": "Parallel solution of the obstacle problem in Grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000297652200011"}
