Massive CO2 injection into saline aquifers may cause multi-scale phenomena such as pressure buildup in a large scale, CO2 plume evolution in a medium scale and salt precipitation in a small scale. In this study, three-dimensional simulations are performed to investigate the propagation of pressure and the impact of salt precipitation on the process of large scale CO2 injection into the saline aquifers. Apart from the different scales of the processes, the numerical results show clearly different behaviours of the pressure changes in saline aquifers with different boundaries. Different types of salt precipitation occur adjacent to the injection well, presenting distinct impacts on the fluid flow. Affected by salt precipitation, the porosity and permeability are reduced, leading to declined transportation and degraded injectivity with different boundary conditions. The interplay between pressure buildup and solid saturation is compared in saline aquifers with different boundary conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
