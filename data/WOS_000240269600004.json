In order to avoid the rapid increase in kernel parameters, as the problem dimensionality increases, we factorize the kernels using a linear ICA algorithm. We apply the algorithm to a number of real-world cases, and show the advantage of the Edgeworth-expanded kernels in clustering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
