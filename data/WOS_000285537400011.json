With attacks on data-intensive applications becoming an ever more serious threat, intrusion tolerant database systems are a significant concern. The main objective of such systems is to detect attacks, and to assess and repair the damage in a timely manner. This paper focuses on efficient damage assessment and repair in distributed database systems. The complexity caused by data partition, distributed transaction processing, and failures makes intrusion recovery much more challenging than in centralized database systems. This paper identifies the key challenges and presents an efficient algorithm for distributed damage assessment and repair.
