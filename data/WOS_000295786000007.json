We discuss generic design considerations as well as the practical system implementation. We developed the system using semantic web technology, including modular ontologies developed in the OWL web ontology language, the OWL Java application programming interface and an automated logic reasoner. We discuss how the system enables to tailor patient information collection according to personalized medical context. The use of ontologies at the core of the system's architecture permits to efficiently manage a vast repository of preoperative assessment domain knowledge, including classification of surgical procedures, classification of morbidities and guidelines for routine preoperative tests. Logical inference on the domain knowledge according to individual patient's medical context enables personalized patients' reports consisting of a risk assessment and clinical recommendations such as relevant preoperative tests.", "paper_title": "Using OWL ontologies for adaptive patient information modelling and preoperative clinical decision support", "paper_id": "WOS:000295786000007"}
