FH-RSVP uses unicast sender-oriented RSVPs with HMIPv6 protocol and makes anticipated reactive resource reservations based on fast handover principles when an intra-site handoff can happen to WLAN access radio medium. Simulation results show that our proposal achieves better QoS guarantees than MRSVP in terms of setup time for the resource reservation path, throughput and packet losses. Furthermore, FH-RSVP is more efficient than MRSVP in terms of reservation blocking, forced termination and session completion probabilities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
