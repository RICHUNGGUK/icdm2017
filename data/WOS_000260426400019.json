In 1972, Khodak claimed to provide upper and lower bounds for the achievable redundancy rate, however, he did not offer explicit construction of such codes. In this paper, we first present a constructive and transparent proof of Khodak's result showing that for memoryless sources there exists a code with the average redundancy bounded by D(-5/3), where D is the average delay (e.g., the average length of a dictionary entry). We also describe an algorithm that constructs a VV length code with a small redundancy rate for large D. Then, we discuss several generalizations. We prove that the worst case redundancy does not exceed D(-4/3). Furthermore, we provide similar upper bound for Markov sources (of order 1). Finally, we consider bounds that are valid for almost all memoryless; and Markov sources for which the set of exceptional source parameters has zero measure. In particular, for all memoryless sources outside this exceptional class, we prove there exists a VV code with the average redundancy rate bounded by D(-4/3-m/3+epsilon) and the worst case redundancy rate bounded by D(-1-m/3+epsilon), where rn is the cardinality of the alphabet. We complete our analysis with a lower bound showing that for all VV codes the average and the worst case redundancy rates are at least D(-2m-1-epsilon) for almost all memoryless sources in the sense that the set of exceptional source parameters has zero measure. We prove these results using techniques of Diophantine approximations.", "paper_title": "On the Construction of (Explicit) Khodak's Code and Its Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000260426400019"}
