These operations can generally be referred as similarity search in metric space. In this paper, a new index construction algorithm is proposed for similarity search in metric space. The new data structure, called bu-tree (bottom-up tree), is based on constructing the index tree from bottom-up, rather than the traditional top-down approaches. The construction algorithm of bu-tree and the range search algorithm based on it are given in this paper. And the update to bu-tree is also discussed. The experiments show that bu-tree is better than sa-tree in search efficiency, especially when the objects are not uniform distributed or the query has low selectivity.", "paper_title": "A bottom-up distance-based index tree for metric space", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500064"}
