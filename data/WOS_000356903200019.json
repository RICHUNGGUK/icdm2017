The capability to calculate LFMM potentials has been provided by extending the functional forms of the Tinker package as well as by integrating routines for calculating the ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE), which is central to LFMM. The capabilities of the implementation are illustrated by both static calculations on the two spin states of [Fe(NH3)(6)](2+) and on [Cu(NH3)(m)](2+) (m = 4, 5, 6) and dynamic (LFMD) simulations of an FeN6-type spin-crossover compound. In addition to showing that results obtained with the Tinker-LFMM implementation are consistent with those of experiment and other computational methods and programs, we note that whereas LFMM is able to handle the conventional tetragonal Jahn-Teller distortion of the bond distances in [Cu(NH3)(6)](2+), the LFSE term is also necessary in order to obtain even qualitatively correct coordination geometries for the two lower-coordinate copper complexes.", "paper_title": "Integration of Ligand Field Molecular Mechanics in Tinker", "paper_id": "WOS:000356903200019"}
