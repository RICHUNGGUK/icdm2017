These logics generalize many interesting known formalisms, including modal logic and the mu-calculus, as well as conjunctive queries and monadic Datalog. We show that satis fiability and finite satis fiability are decidable for both fragments, and we pinpoint the complexity of satis fiability, finite satis fiability, and model checking. We also show that the unary negation fragment of first-order logic is model-theoretically very well behaved. In particular, it enjoys Craig Interpolation and the Projective Beth Property.", "paper_title": "UNARY NEGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000327472100025"}
