To this end, self-optimizing networks (SONs) provide a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardized framework for self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing in LTE networks. Alcatel-Lucent is positioning extended SON as an extension of the SON concept to include the end-to-end network environment, including the application domain and user equipment (UE) clients, as well as associated network and user policies to enable complex optimizations to be applied for specific users and/or applications. This paper presents the drivers for LTE SON, Alcatel-Lucent's vision for SON, and the evolution towards extended SON with representative use cases and a discussion of the proposed architecture.
