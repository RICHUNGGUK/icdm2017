Usually, it is desirable to put forward a formula of the number of spanning trees for various graphs, which is not only interesting in its own right but also in practice. Since some large graphs can be composed of some existing smaller graphs by using the product of graphs, the number of spanning trees of such large graph is also closely related to that of the corresponding smaller ones. In this article, we establish a formula for the number of spanning trees in the lexicographic product of two graphs, in which one graph is an arbitrary graph G and the other is a complete multipartite graph. The results extend some of the previous work, which is closely related to the number of vertices and Lapalacian eigenvalues of smaller graphs only.", "paper_title": "The number of spanning trees in a new lexicographic product of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700010"}
