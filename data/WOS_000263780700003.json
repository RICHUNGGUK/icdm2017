A gain-directed document pair selection method that measures how much we can learn by revealing judgments of selected document pairs is designed. We use the estimation of term co-occurrence probabilities as a clue for finding informative document pairs. Term co-occurrence probabilities are considered in the semi-supervised document clustering process to capture term-to-term dependence relationships. In the semi-supervised document clustering, each cluster is represented by a language model. We have conducted extensive experiments on several real-world corpora. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
