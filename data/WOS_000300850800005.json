Our preconditioner can be applied both to the original and to the reduced Schur complement problem. Combined with a suitable iterative method, the number of iterations required to solve the preconditioned system will have the same dependency on the mesh size as for the preconditioner applied to the Poisson problem. The presented theory is demonstrated by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Continuous preconditioners for the mixed Poisson problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300850800005"}
