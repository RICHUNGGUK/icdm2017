The analysis of each possible configuration demands the joint action of several technicians, consuming substantial time and money. During initial design of the project, simplified procedures are usually adopted which may compromise the quality of the base configuration. In this paper we will present a global overview of the OPAH model, which was developed to surpass these limitations. This global model performs the optimization of project configuration, This model uses non-linear programming optimization to analyze the multipurpose operation of the hydropower plant. It uses a numeric simulation model of unsteady flow under pressure to analyze the hydraulic circuit. It uses an economical and financial simulation model that takes in to account the project risk associated to hydrologic and market variability, the financial capacity of the investor and the fiscal aspects.
