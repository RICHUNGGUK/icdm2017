The parametric uncertainty is assumed to be norm bounded. By applying the Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition on the existence of robust passive controllers is given. With the help of linear matrix inequality (LMI), robust passive controllers are designed such that the closed-loop system is robust stable and satisfies the passive performance. Furthermore, a convex optimization problem with LMI constraints is formulated to design robust passive controller with the maximum dissipation rate. A numerical example demonstrates the validity of this method.", "paper_title": "Robust passive control for T-S fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300019"}
