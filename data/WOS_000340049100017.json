The methylC track dynamically integrates the level of methylation, the position and context of the methylated cytosine (i.e. CG, CHG and CHH), strand and confidence level (e.g. read coverage depth in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data). Investigators can access and integrate these information visually at specific locus or at the genome-wide level on the WashU EpiGenome Browser in the context of other rich epigenomic datasets.", "paper_title": "methylC Track: visual integration of single-base resolution DNA methylation data on the WashU EpiGenome Browser", "paper_id": "WOS:000340049100017"}
