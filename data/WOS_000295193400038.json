The proposed method includes two phases. One is the divisive approach of piecewise linear approximation based on the middle curve of original time series. Apart from the attractive results, it can create line segments to approximate time series faster than conventional linear approximation. Meanwhile, high dimensional space can be reduced into a lower one and the line segments approximating the time series are used to calculate the similarity. In the other phase, we utilize the main idea of DDTW to provide another similarity measure based on the line segments just we got from the first phase. We empirically compare our new approach to other techniques and demonstrate its superiority. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
