In this paper, we present a novel approach for tracking and catching operation of space robots based on learning and transferring human control strategies (HCS). We firstly use an efficient support vector machine (SVM) to parameterize the model of HCS, and then develop a new SVM-based leaning structure to improve HCS in tracking and capturing control. The approach is fundamentally valuable in dealing with some problems such as small sample data and local minima, which makes it efficient in modeling, understanding and transferring its learning process. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is useful and feasible in tracking trajectory and catching objects autonomously.", "paper_title": "Learning control for space robotic operation using support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000176"}
