Commun. Rev. 8 (2) (2004) 50-65]. The problem is to color all the edges in a graph with maximum number of colors under the following q-Constraint: for every vertex in the graph, all the edges incident to it are colored with no more than q (q is an element of Z, q >= 2) colors. We show that the algorithm is a 2-approximation for the case q = 2 and a (1 + 4q-2/3q(2)-5q+2)-approximation for the case q > 2 respectively. The case q = 2 is of great importance in practice. For complete graphs and trees, polynomial time accurate algorithms are found for them when q = 2. The approximation algorithm gives a feasible solution to channel assignment in multi-channel wireless mesh networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
