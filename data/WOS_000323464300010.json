To validate the numerical method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, benchmark problems of flow past a single and two tandem cylinders are employed, with the numerical results in a good agreement with the available literatures. Then the study concentrates on the flow characteristics of two groups of cases, respectively, with incidence angle alpha = 0 degrees and alpha = 45 degrees. By changing the spacing ratios L/D from 1.5 to 4.0 (L is the center-to-center distance and D the cylinder diameter), the flow characteristics, including the flow patterns, statistical force parameters such as the drag and lift coefficients as well as wake oscillation frequencies (Strouhal numbers) are investigated. Numerical results show that in each case there are around three wake flow patterns which are more related with the spacing ratio. In addition, the force parameters are highly affected by the flow patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
