In this paper, we report on our 'brute-force attack' of the RERS 2012 and 2013 Challenges. We connected the RERS problems to two state-of-the-art explicit state model checkers: LTSMIN and Spin. Apart from an effective compression of the state vector, we did not analyze the source code of the problems. Our brute-force approach was successful: it won both editions of the RERS Challenge.", "paper_title": "Thoughtful brute-force attack of the RERS 2012 and 2013 Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000209673300003"}
