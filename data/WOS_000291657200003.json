The functional electrical stimulation cycling system (FES-CS) is useful for hemiplegic patients to make the muscles of stroke patients be under hybrid activation. The raw electromyography (EMG) takes down the residual muscle force of stroke subjects; and the peak-to-peak of stimulus EMG indicates the force enhancement benefiting from electrical stimulation. This research proposed an EMG feedback control protocol of FES-CS, which includes a physiological signal recorder, a FPGA control module, DAC and electrical stimulation circuits. Using the strength of real-time EMG signal obtained from patients as a feedback to control the stimulation output intensity of FES cycling system.", "paper_title": "An EMG Feedback Control Functional Electrical Stimulation Cycling System", "paper_id": "WOS:000291657200003"}
