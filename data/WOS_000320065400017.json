INstruct combines the scale of available high-quality binary protein interaction data with the specificity of atomic-resolution structural information derived from co-crystal evidence using a tested interaction interface inference method. Its web interface is designed to allow for flexible search based on standard and organism-specific protein and gene-naming conventions, visualization of protein architecture highlighting interaction interfaces and viewing and downloading custom 3D structurally resolved interactome datasets.", "paper_title": "INstruct: a database of high-quality 3D structurally resolved protein interactome networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320065400017"}
