All nodes in Boolean network are represented in terms of semi-tensor product. First, we give the concept of inner synchronization and observe that all nodes in a Boolean network are synchronized with each other. Second, we investigate the outer synchronization between a driving Boolean network and a corresponding response Boolean network. We provide not only the concept of traditional complete synchronization, but also the anti-synchronization and get the anti-synchronization in simulation. Third, we extend the outer synchronization to asynchronous Boolean network and get the complete synchronization between an asynchronous Boolean network and a response Boolean network. Consequently, theorems for synchronization of Boolean networks and asynchronous Boolean networks are derived. Examples are provided to show the correctness of our theorems.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of Boolean Networks with Different Update Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000346629600017"}
