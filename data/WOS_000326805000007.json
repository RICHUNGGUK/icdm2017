A major concern is how to evolve a general and an encompassing framework that guarantees users' satisfaction measured as Quality of Services (QoS). To obtain a higher QoS, effective QoS perceived by subscribers (users) must conform to specified QoS agreements in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) document-a legal contract between the Grid Services Provider (GSP) and users. Sometimes the effective user QoS does not conform to the specifications in the SLA because of the vagueness in linguistic definitions in the SLA. Existing approaches overcommitted resources to meet QoS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic framework for calibrating a grid resources user-QoS that addresses the vagueness in linguistic definitions of the SLA document without overcommitting grid resources.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy Grid-QoS framework for obtaining higher grid resources availability", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000007"}
