In Milner's bigraphs the two dimensions are made explicit and represented as two loosely coupled structures: the place graph and the link graph. Here, bigraphs are compared with an earlier model, gs-graphs, originally conceived for modelling the syntactical structure of agents with alpha-convertible declarations. We show that gs-graphs are quite convenient also for the new purpose, since the two above mentioned dimensions can be recovered by considering only a specific class of hyper-signatures. With respect to bigraphs, gs-graphs can be proved essentially equivalent, with minor differences at the interface level. We argue that gs-graphs offer a simpler and more standard algebraic structure, based on monoidal categories, for representing both states and transitions. Moreover, they can be equipped with a simple type system to check the well-formedness of legal gs-graphs that are shown to characterise binding bigraphs. Another advantage concerns a textual form in terms of sets of assignments, which can make implementation easier in rewriting frameworks like Maude.", "paper_title": "On Hierarchical Graphs: Reconciling Bigraphs, Gs-monoidal Theories and Gs-graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457500004"}
