In fact, while this result is indeed trivial for languages defined by Alur and Dill's timed automata (the proof is an immediate extension of the one in the untimed case), it turns out that the construction is much more tricky when considering the most involved model of signal-event automata. While several constructions have been proposed in particular cases, it is the first time, up to our knowledge, that a construction working on finite and infinite signal-event words and taking into account signal stuttering, unobservability of zero-duration tau-signals and Zeno runs is proposed.", "paper_title": "Intersection of regular signal-event (timed) languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000241576400005"}
