It can compute the ground state in the defocusing case, for any number of equations with harmonic or quasi-harmonic trapping potentials, in spatial dimension one, two or three. The computation is based on a spectral decomposition of the solution into Hermite functions and direct minimization of the energy functional through a Newton-like method with an approximate line-search strategy.", "paper_title": "GSGPEs: A MATLAB code for computing the ground state of systems of Gross-Pitaevskii equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000315125500037"}
