FDPS, which divides partition space into many partitions that will attach to different classes automatically, is a novel technique for neural network classification. FNT is a neural network's structure which uses flexible tree model. The proposed method combines FDPS and FNT to overcome their respective problems by using the other's merit. In order to evaluate the performance of this method, four well-known data sets are used for classification test. Experiment results have shown that this method has favorable performance.
