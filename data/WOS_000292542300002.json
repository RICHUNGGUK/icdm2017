This work examines the comparison of the coefficient of variation without any assumptions about the underlying distribution. A family of tests based on the bootstrap method is proposed, and its properties are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed method is applied to chemical experiments with iid and non-iid observations.
