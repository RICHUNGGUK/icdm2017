(J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 139:153-176, 2006) for the numerical solution of high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations featuring in Navier-Stokes-Fokker-Planck systems that arise in kinetic models of dilute polymers. In the case of Poisson's equation on a rectangular domain in a\"e(2), subject to a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, the mathematical analysis of the algorithm was carried out recently by Le Bris, LeliSvre and Maday (Const. Approx. 30:621-651, 2009), by exploiting its connection to greedy algorithms from nonlinear approximation theory, explored, for example, by DeVore and Temlyakov (Adv. Comput. Math. 5:173-187, 1996); hence, the variational version of the algorithm, based on the minimization of a sequence of Dirichlet energies, was shown to converge. Here, we extend the convergence analysis of the pure greedy and orthogonal greedy algorithms considered by Le Bris et al. to a technically more complicated situation, where the Laplace operator is replaced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator of the kind that appears in Fokker-Planck equations that arise in bead-spring chain type kinetic polymer models with finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potentials, posed on a high-dimensional Cartesian product configuration space D=D (1)xa <-xD (N) contained in a\"e (Nd) , where each set D (i) , i=1,aEuro broken vertical bar,N, is a bounded open ball in a\"e (d) , d=2,3.", "paper_title": "Greedy Approximation of High-Dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000308957000002"}
