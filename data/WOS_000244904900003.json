Part of the internationalization effort is the ability to engineer applications to use dates and times that conform to local calendars yet can inter-operate with dates and times in other calendars, for instance between the Gregorian and Islamic calendars. tau ZAMAN is a system that provides a natural language-and calendar-independent framework for integrating multiple calendars. tau ZAMAN performs 'runtime-binding' of calendars and language support. A running tau ZAMAN system dynamically loads calendars and language support tables from XML-formatted files. Loading a calendar integrates it with other, already loaded calendars, enabling users of tau ZAMAN to add, compare, and convert times between multiple calendars. tau ZAMAN also provides a flexible, calendar-independent framework for parsing temporal literals. Literals can be input and output in XML or plain text, using user-defined formats, and in different languages and character sets. Finally tau ZAMAN is a client/server system, enabling shared access to calendar servers spread throughout the Web. This paper describes the architecture of tau ZAMAN and experimentally quantifies the cost of using a calendar server to translate and manipulate dates.
