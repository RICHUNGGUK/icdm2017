This is the node-weighted Steiner tree problem which will be studied in this paper. In general, this problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated by a polynomial time algorithm with performance ratio aln n for any 0 < a < 1 unless NPaS dagger DTIME(n (O(log n))), where n is the number of nodes in s. In this paper, we are the first to show that even though for unit disk graphs, the problem is still NP-hard and it has a polynomial time constant approximation. We present a 2.5 rho-approximation where rho is the best known performance ratio for polynomial time approximation of classical Steiner minimum tree problem in graphs. As a corollary, we obtain that there is a polynomial time (9.875+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for minimum weight connected dominating set in unit disk graphs, and also there is a polynomial time (4.875+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for minimum weight connected vertex cover in unit disk graphs.", "paper_title": "Node-weighted Steiner tree approximation in unit disk graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000271026900002"}
