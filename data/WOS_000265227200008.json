Estimation of ball movements is necessary to recognize interesting scenes such as goal scenes. It is, however, sometimes difficult to detect a ball using a simple color-based or shape-based method when the ball overlaps with multiple players and lines. We therefore developed a method of estimating a ball route during such overlaps by considering spatio-temporal relationships among players, lines, and the ball. The method can deal with difficult cases such as one in which a ball disappears at a player and reappears from another player. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
