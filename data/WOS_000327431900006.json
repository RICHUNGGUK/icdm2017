However, the application of distance-adaptive transceivers in metro networks, which are typically based on ring topologies and characterized by shorter distances and lower traffic volumes, is still an open research area both in terms of network resource savings and coherent technology requirements. This paper discusses and analyzes an optical metro ring network architecture with distance-adaptive coherent transceivers and formalizes the routing, modulation level, and spectrum assignment (RMLSA) optimization problem over such a network in order to evaluate the possible benefits introduced by the use of coherent technologies and of a spectrum grid of finer granularity in metro scenarios. Comparisons with legacy WDM systems show significant savings in terms of spectrum occupation and transceiver utilization.
