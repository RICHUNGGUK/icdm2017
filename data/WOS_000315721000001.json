Decision support tools (DSTs) developed for this purpose typically alert the anesthesia provider to existence of a problem but do not recommend a treatment plan. There is a need for a human-centered approach to the design and development of a crisis management DST. A hierarchical task analysis was conducted to identify anesthesia provider procedures in detecting, diagnosing, and treating a critical incident and a cognitive task analysis to elicit goals, decisions, and information requirements. This information was coded in a computational cognitive model using GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules) Language. An OR monitor interface was prototyped to present output from the cognitive model following ecological interface design principles. A preliminary assessment of the DST was performed with anesthesiology and usability experts. The anesthesiologists indicated they would use the tool in the perioperative environment and would recommend its use by junior anesthesia providers. Future research will focus on formal validation of the DST design approach and comparison of tool output to actual anesthesia provider decisions in real or simulated crises.", "paper_title": "A Cognitive Modeling Approach to Decision Support Tool Design for Anesthesia Provider Crisis Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000315721000001"}
