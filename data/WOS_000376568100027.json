In on-line transactions of the mobile commerce based on mobile Internet, the trust is the premise and key which makes transactions smoothly.. Trust measurement between entities involves in trading volume, transaction time, personal income of consumer entity and its risk attitude to trust, and so on, which is difficult to be given accurately quantitative calculation. To find out the essential features of this kind of trust relationship, combined with cognitive theory and methods of social network in real life, in the research background of mobile commerce in Mobile Internet, by the research on problems in MI, such as trust, influencing factors to trust and trust mechanism, based on multi-Agent system coordination theory, a dynamic trust calculation model based on mobile Agent is given. The model can achieve the qualitative and quantitative conversion of trust. In order to effectively prevent credit speculation and fraud of malicious user, the paper presents evaluation methods of special attributes and punishment methods of. trust. To implement incentive mechanism for achieving credibility, the paper defines the time-sensitive functions, which makes dynamic attenuation of the trust. The existing trust assignment methods of new users are improved, and a new method is proposed which sets dynamically initial trust of new users based on minimum trust of the previous system, and effectively resists moral hazard of discarding reputation information. Through leading the evaluation system of trading and weighting system into the multi-factor mechanism, the model reflects better the impact of subjective factors on trust calculation, such as individual preferences, risk attitudes, enhances the sensitivity of the trust algorithm on single property of transaction. The detailed theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the mechanism can effectively reveal and resolve the trust computing problem of mobile network transactions and provides a valuable new idea to transaction security in MI.", "paper_title": "Research on Transaction Security Mechanism of Mobile Commerce in Mobile Internet based on MAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000376568100027"}
