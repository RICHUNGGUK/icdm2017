The integration of WSN in industrial manufacturing process provides low cost industrial automation systems. The benefits of WSN include rapid deployment, self-organization, and being maintenance free. However, wireless sensor nodes are battery powered; replacing or recharging battery is usually impossible after deployment, which makes energy a scarce resource for WSN. Furthermore, in industrial applications, environment information is gathered and delivered in a timely manner, which makes traditional energy saving methods such as listen-sleeping duty approach less efficient. In this work, a novel dynamic address encoding scheme based on packet arrival rate is proposed; the scheme can reduce the protocol overhead by reducing MAC and network address size and thus saves energy needed for data transmission. The implementation of the scheme is fully distributed and needs little modification of the existing applications. Simulation results show the proposed scheme is efficient and robust on both the MAC layer and the network layer.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Dynamic Address Encoding Scheme for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000333586300001"}
