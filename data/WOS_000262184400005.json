The cdma2000 1xEV-DO standard provides high-speed wireless data services to mobile subscribers based on CDMA technology. In this paper, We Study the bandwidth utilization for the 1xEV-DO packet mode standard. In particular, we develop an analytical model for lowest-rate-first, highest-rate-first priority scheduling techniques, and two round-robin fair scheduling techniques over the reverse data channel in cdma2000 1xEV-DO. For these four scheduling techniques, the distribution of the mobile stations (MSs) among the possible data rates is modeled as a Mark.ov process. An analytical expression for the steady state system throughput is derived from the steady state distribution of the above Markov process. The developed model is Validated through simulations.
