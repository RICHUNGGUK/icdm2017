In a first experiment, 21 respondents rated 80 short samples of spontaneous speech produced by male teachers of Dutch originating from four areas in The Netherlands; samples were rated in terms of the expected regional origin of the speaker and the strength of his accent. In a second experiment, we computed the phonetic distance between two accent benchmarks (the Randstad accent, the allegedly lightest accent of Netherlandic Standard Dutch, and the Randstad speakers rated as the mildest in the first experiment) and all other speakers' accents. The subjective ratings were shown to correlate strongly with the phonetic measurements, but additional regression analysis revealed that subjective ratings of accent strength were also impacted by a number of speaker prestige variables. This indicates that the intrinsically quantitative process of accent strength perception (partly) depends on qualitative evaluations of speaker personality. Recommendations are made for a valid implementation of (native) accent strength in speaker evaluation experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
