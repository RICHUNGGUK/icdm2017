The voice signal processing module for F-IMEHD should be designed to compensate for the hearing loss of hearing impaired person and have the flexibility for compensating various hearing threshold level. So, the voice signal processing module has been designed and implemented to present the various frequency characteristics using the low-power micro processor, MSP43017169. The different voice signal path to the inner ear entrance was considered so that two voice signal would be combined in-phase using an all pass filter with a constant time-delay to improve the vibration of the ossicles.", "paper_title": "Design of a signal processing module with various filters characteristics for fully implantable middle ear hearing devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500026"}
