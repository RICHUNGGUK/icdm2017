This is done with the guarantee that the mapping depth of the circuit will not increase compared to the circuit with a single Vdd. This paper also presents an enhanced clustering algorithm that considers dual supply voltages, honoring the dual-Vdd mapping solution. To carry out various comparisons, we first design a single-Vdd mapping algorithm, named SVmap-2, which achieves a 3.8% total power reduction (15.6% dynamic power reduction) over a previously published low-power mapping algorithm, Emap [11]. We then show that our dual-Vdd mapping algorithm, named DVmap-2, can further improve total power savings by 12.8% over SVmap-2, with a 52.7% dynamic power reduction. Compared to the early single-Vdd version SVmap [14], DVmap-2 is 14.3% better for total power reduction. This is achieved through an ideal selection of the low-Vdd/high-Vdd ratio and the consideration of various voltage changing scenarios during the mapping process.", "paper_title": "Technology Mapping and Clustering for FPGA Architectures With Dual Supply Voltages", "paper_id": "WOS:000283453200005"}
