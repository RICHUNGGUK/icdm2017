With the exponentially growing protein sequence data, predictive methods using sequence information only for protein interaction site prediction have drawn increasing interest. In this article, we propose a predictive model for identifying protein interaction sites. Without using any structure data, the proposed method extracts a wide range of features from protein sequences. A random forest-based integrative model is developed to effectively utilize these features and to deal with the imbalanced data classification problem commonly encountered in binding site predictions. Results: We evaluate the predictive method using 2829 interface residues and 24 616 non-interface residues extracted from 99 polypeptide chains in the Protein Data Bank. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than two other sequence-based predictive methods and can reliably predict residues involved in protein interaction sites. Furthermore, we apply the method to predict interaction sites and to construct three protein complexes: the DnaK molecular chaperone system, 1YUW and 1DKG, which provide new insight into the sequence function relationship. We show that the predicted interaction sites can be valuable as a first approach for guiding experimental methods investigating protein-protein interactions and localizing the specific interface residues.", "paper_title": "Sequence-based prediction of protein interaction sites with an integrative method", "paper_id": "WOS:000263834600005"}
