As the deformation of the model is determined by the minimization of different energy components, the multiobjective methodology provides a natural solution to the minimization of the different energy components or objectives. This approach also provides a solution to the need of an experimental tuning of the weight of the energy parameters, which is also needed for each kind of image. We used a well established evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm, SPEA2, adapted to our application. The incorporation of the differential evolution approach in the SPEA2 algorithm allows a faster search of the Pareto Front, incorporating the main advantages of both algorithms and minimizing the designer decisions. The combined approach permits the correct segmentation of real images in the 2D and 3D domains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
