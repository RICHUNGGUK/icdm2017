Previous studies, empirical and theoretical evidences, and results from experiments indicate that there is a strong relationship between software reliability and coverage of program elements required to be exercised by structural testing criteria. This paper develops a binomial type coverage-based software reliability model through the definition of a coverage-based failure rate function. The Binomial software reliability Model Based on Coverage-BMBC-is proposed and discussed. In the BMBC test data between failures is used instead of time as independent variable; the model was assessed with test data from a real application, making use of the following structural testing criteria: all-nodes, all-edges, and potential-uses-a data-flow based family of testing criteria. The results from our experiments have shown that our modeling approach has some advantages over some traditional reliability models and points to a very promising research direction in software reliability.", "paper_title": "A binomial software reliability model based on coverage of structural testing criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000254743000004"}
