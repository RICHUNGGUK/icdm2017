It has been used to model neural structures like the olfactory bulb, whisker barrels, and the subthalamo-pallidal system. It is well-known that this system can exhibit an oscillatory behavior that is amplified by the presence of delays. In the absence of delays, the conditions for stability are well-known. The aim of our paper is to clarify these conditions when delays are included in the model. The first ingredient of our methods is a new necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of multiple equilibria. This condition is related to those for local asymptotic stability. In addition, a sufficient condition for global stability is also proposed. The second and main ingredient is a stability analysis of the system in the frequency-domain, based on the Nyquist criterion, that takes the four independent delays into account. The methods proposed in this paper can be applied to analyse the stability of the subthalamo-pallidal feedback loop, a deep brain structure involved in Parkinson's disease. Our stability conditions are easy to compute and characterize sharply the system's parameters for which spontaneous oscillations appear.", "paper_title": "Delay-induced oscillations in Wilson and Cowan's model: an analysis of the subthalamo-pallidal feedback loop in healthy and parkinsonian subjects", "paper_id": "WOS:000319348300002"}
