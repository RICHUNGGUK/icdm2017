By using the method of functional analysis, especially, the linear operator theory and the C-0 semigroup theory on Banach space, we prove the well-posedness and the existence of a positive solution of the system. And under some appropriate hypotheses, we study the asymptotic stability of solution of the system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
