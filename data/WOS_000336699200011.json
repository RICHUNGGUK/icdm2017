Let G = (V, E) be graph and let f : V -> (red, blue) be a 2-coloring. An edge e is an element of E is called red (blue) if both end-vertices of e are red (blue). For a 2-coloring f, let r(f)' and b(f)' be the number of red and blue edges and let mu(f)(G)= min{r(f)', b(f)'}. Let mu(G) be the maximum of mu(f)(G) over all 2-colorings. We introduce the parameterized problem k-LCP of deciding whether mu(G) >= k, where k is the parameter. We prove that this problem admits a kernel with at most 7k. Ahuja et al. (2007) proved that one can find an optimal 2-coloring on trees in polynomial time. We generalize this by showing that an optimal 2-coloring on graphs with tree decomposition of width t can be found in time O*(2(t)). We also show that either G is a Yes-instance of k-LCP or the treewidth of G is at most 2k. Thus, k-LCP can be solved in time O*(4(k)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
