A subset S subset of V is called a p-dominating set if each vertex not in S has at least p neighbors in S. The p-domination number gamma(p) (G) is the size of a smallest p-dominating set of G. The p-reinforcement number r(p) (G) is the smallest number of edges whose addition to G results in a graph G' with gamma(p) (G') < gamma(p) (G). In this paper, we give an original study on the p-reinforcement, determine r(p) (G) for some graphs such as paths, cycles and complete t-partite graphs, and establish some upper bounds on r(p) (G). In particular, we show that the decision problem on r(p) (G) is NP-hard for a general graph G and a fixed integer p >= 2.", "paper_title": "On the p-reinforcement and the complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000350685200004"}
