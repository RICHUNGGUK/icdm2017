Moreover, some corresponding properties of the three operators are investigated in detail. Furthermore, two fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches, respectively based on the WF-OWA operator and the OWF-OWA operator, are developed. Finally, an example is given to show their feasibility and validity, together with a comparison analysis.", "paper_title": "OWA aggregation over a continuous fuzzy argument with applications in fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making", "paper_id": "WOS:000341926700030"}
