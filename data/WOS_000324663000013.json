Aiming at the problem that how to classify T-splines this paper gives a mathematical analysis, and a sufficient condition of standard T-splines is also given. Then this paper presents an algorithm of determining the T-spline classification, and we can get the inherently mathematical properties of T-splines by the algorithm. At last, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm. The results in this paper play an important role in the research on T-spline theory and T-spline modeling algorithms.
