In this paper, a framework for admission control and session-level performance analysis is proposed by taking into account several factors such as channel reservation for handoff secondary users (SUs), buffers for handoff SUs and newly arriving SUs, limited buffer size, and queued SUs' leaving due to impatience. The whole system is modeled by a multi-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, where important session-level QoS performance metrics, i.e., dropping probability and blocking probability are derived.", "paper_title": "Admission Control in Cognitive Radio Networks with Finite Queue and User Impatience", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600008"}
