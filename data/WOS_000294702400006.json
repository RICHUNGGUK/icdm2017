This paper proposes a fast binary pattern based orientation estimation with nearest-neighbor search, which can reduce the computational complexity greatly. We also propose a classified post processing with adaptive averaging strategy to increase the accuracy of the estimated OF. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method can satisfy the strict requirements of the embedded applications over the conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "Practical Orientation Field Estimation for Embedded Fingerprint Recognition Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000294702400006"}
