Firstly we illustrate how to describe this ambiguous option pricing model by using set-valued differential inclusion and how to change the discussion of pricing bound problems of options into that of maximal and minimal conditional expectations. Secondly we discuss the properties of maximal and minimal conditional expectations, especially the representation theorem of maximal and minimal expectations. Finally we give the bounds of European option pricing by using above theorems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
