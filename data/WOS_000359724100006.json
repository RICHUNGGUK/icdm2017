Among all these methods, SR is a parameter-free global algorithm in nature which is mostly utilized to construct the correlations between samples to avoid some negative effects incurred by k-nearest neighbor (KNN) or some other methods. However, these SSL algorithms always lack obvious discrimination because of the ignorance of samples distribution. Meanwhile, some incorrect correlations are taken into consideration owing to the global feature of SR. To solve these two problems, a new SSL algorithm called locality structured sparsity preserving embedding (LSPE) is proposed in this paper. We add the local structured information to SR and construct correlations between samples. However, LSPE is an unsupervised method which wastes all label information. Therefore, LSPE is extended to semi-supervised LSPE (SLSPE) in this paper. SLSPE not only makes good use of the label information but also enhances the discriminative power of LSPE. Extensive experiments have been performed on three image datasets (CMU, COIL20, ORL) and two UCI datasets (Glass, Segment) to prove the efficiency of the LSPE and SLSPE.", "paper_title": "Locality Structured Sparsity Preserving Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000359724100006"}
