An odor sensor (electronic nose) is used to sample the odor signal and an ad-hoe algorithm allows to discriminate the finger skin odor from that of other materials such as latex, silicone or gelatin, Usually employed to forge fake fingerprints. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fake fingerprint detection by odor analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300036"}
