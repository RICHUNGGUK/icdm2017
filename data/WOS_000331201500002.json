Simulation models capable of accurately representing the behavior and properties of SDR devices operating in a networked environment thus become a prerequisite for both the evaluation of such networks as well as for providing a development platform for creating new cognitive capabilities. This paper describes our work in creating a network simulation model framework for software defined radios that takes into account some of the unique behaviors and requirements of SDRs not previously seen in purely hardware devices. Factors such as large and variable communication delays between software modules, contention to shared resources, such as CPU or memory, as well as continuous tuning and environment awareness functionality essential to SDR demand a different modeling approach as well as novel techniques that enable accurate scale testing.", "paper_title": "A software defined radio modeling framework for enabling cognitive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500002"}
