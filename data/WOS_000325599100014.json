Transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities are important factors that create unidirectional links. Majority of the internode data transfer mechanisms are designed to work on bidirectional links (i.e., due to the lack of a direct reverse path, handshaking cannot be performed between a transmitter and receiver) which render the use of unidirectional links infeasible. Yet, there are some data transfer mechanisms designed specifically to operate on unidirectional links which employ distributed handshaking mechanisms (i.e., instead of using a direct reverse path, a multi-hop reverse path is used for the handshake). In this study, we investigate the impact of both transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities on the lifetime of WSNs through a novel linear programming (LP) framework both for networks that utilize only bidirectional links and for those that can use bidirectional links as well as unidirectional links.
