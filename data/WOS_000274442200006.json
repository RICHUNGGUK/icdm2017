In particular, this is true in those proposals that leverage hash chains. When the reader and the tag get de-synchronized, possibly by an attacker, this paves the way to several denial of service (DoS) attacks, as well as threatening privacy (e.g., via the timing attack). Even if de-synchronization happens for non-malicious causes, this event has a negative effect on performances (for instance, slowing down the authentication process). In this paper, we provide a solution to cope with the de-synchronization between the tag and the reader when hash chains are employed. In particular, our solution relies on mutual reader-tag authentication, achieved via hash traversal and Merkle tree techniques. We show that this techniques applied to an existing security protocol for RFID systems, such as RIPP-FS, make timing attacks hard to succeed. Moreover, the proposed solutions can be transparently and independently adopted by similar security protocols as well to thwart timing attack and/or to provide reader-tag mutual authentication. Finally, extensive simulations show that our proposal introduces a negligible overhead to recover desynchronization.
