Mathematical programming techniques offer a general modeling framework for including environmental concerns in the synthesis and planning of chemical processes. In this paper, we review major contributions in process synthesis and supply chain management, highlighting the main optimization approaches that are available, including the handling of uncertainty and the multi-objective optimization of economic and environmental objectives. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities identified in the area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
