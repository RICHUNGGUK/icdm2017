The rectifier has a cross-coupled bridge configuration and is driven by a differential RF input signal. Since a rectifier needs an RF signal higher than the threshold voltage of transistors, we introduced a pre-biasing circuit to compensate for the threshold voltage. A low-voltage digital circuit, subthreshold voltage regulator, and low-power level shifter were introduced for reducing the power consumption of the pre-biasing circuit and increasing the driving voltage for the switches at the same time. The circuit simulations revealed that the pre-biasing circuit was effective in a low RF input power region. However, the output voltage was degraded in a high power region. Then, we combined the pre-biased rectifier in parallel with a non-biased rectifier. Three types of rectifiers consisting of LC matching circuits, three-stage rectifier cells, and biasing circuits were designed and fabricated using a 0.18-mu m mixed signal/RF CMOS process with one poly and six metal layers. The fabricated pre-biased rectifier operated in a region of RF input power of less than -15 dBm, while the non-biased rectifier could not operate in this region. The parallel combination of pre-biased and non-biased rectifiers effectively solved the drawback of the pre-biased rectifier in a high RF input power region.", "paper_title": "Design and fabrication of 2.4 GHz pre-biased rectifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000011"}
