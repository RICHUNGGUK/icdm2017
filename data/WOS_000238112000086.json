But the particles collapse so quickly that it exits a potentially dangerous stagnation characteristic, which would make it impossible to arrive at the global optimum. In this paper, a hybrid PSO with simulated annealing and Chaos search technique (HPSO) is adopted to solve this problem. The HPSO is proposed to train radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Benchmark function optimization and dataset classification problems (Iris, Glass, Wine and New-thyroid) experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Training RBF neural network with hybrid particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000086"}
