Therefore, ontology languages are nowadays themselves a source of heterogeneity. this demo, we present the SIRUP Ontology Query API (SOQA) [5] that has been developed for the SIRUP approach to semantic data integration [4]. SOQA is an ontology language independent Java API for query access to ontological metadata and data that can be represented in a variety of ontology languages. In addition, we demonstrate two applications that are based on SOQA: The SOQA Browser, a tool to graphically inspect all ontology information that can be accessed through SOQA, and SOQA-QL, an SQL-like query language that supports declarative queries against ontological metadata and data.", "paper_title": "The SIRUP ontology query API in action", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600085"}
