In this work, we model transformation optics in an inherently covariant fashion starting with a fundamental Lagrangian function. As an application, we present the construction of a flat reflectionless immersion lens whose superior performance is important to applications in bio- and nano-technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
