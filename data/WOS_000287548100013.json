This system is under consideration as the driving system for the two main axes of the proposed Thirty Meter Telescope that will be built in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The main objective of this work is the quantification of the effects of the curvilinear track of LSM arrays on the cogging force. The finite element analysis is carried out using planar cross sections, and the results found are used to find an approximate solution for the three-dimensional model. The results show that the presence of the curvilinear-configured track increases the cogging force of a single LSM significantly, while the presence of the array of LSMs interacts in limiting the increase in the cogging force. A geometric optimization in regards to the relative positions of the LSMs along the curvilinear tracks is subsequently carried out in order to reduce the total cogging force. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
