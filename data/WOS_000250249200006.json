We evaluate the performance of several quantum error correction (QEC) codes and find that teleportation failure rates of one percent or more are tolerable when two levels of the [[ 23, 1, 7]] code are used. We present an analysis of performing QEC on QEC-encoded states that span two quantum computers, including the creation of distributed logical zeros. The transfer of the individual qubits of a logical state may be multiplexed in time or space, moving serially across a single link or in parallel across multiple links. We show that the performance and reliability penalty for using serial links is small for a broad range of physical parameters, making serial links preferable for a large, distributed quantum multicomputer when engineering difficulties are considered. Such a multicomputer will be able to factor a 1,024-bit number using Shor's algorithm with a high probability of success.", "paper_title": "Communication links for distributed quantum computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000250249200006"}
