This study provides a review of the extant literature (1993-2011) on knowledge sharing drivers in software teams and establishes a classification framework using an organizational change perspective. A synthesis of the literature uncovers diverse themes and gaps in the existing body of knowledge, suggests several paths for advancing theory on knowledge sharing in software development contexts, and discusses implications for practitioners concerned with knowledge sharing in software development.
