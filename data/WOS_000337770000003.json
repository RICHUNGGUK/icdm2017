We propose a fuzzy stochastic partial differential system to approximate the NSPDSs based on fuzzy interpolation approach. Next, we develop a fuzzy stochastic spatial state space model to represent the fuzzy stochastic partial differential system by employing a semi-discretization finite difference scheme. Based on this model, we propose a robust fuzzy estimator-based stabilization controller to stabilize the NSPDSs. Furthermore, robust stochastic H infinity stabilization design is suggested to attenuate the effects of random external disturbances and measurement noise in the spatio-temporal domain from the area energy point of view. The LMI technique is applied to solve the issue of control gains and estimator gains of the controller by using a systematic control design procedure. Finally, a simulation is presented as an example to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the performance of the proposed robust fuzzy estimator-based stabilization design for the NSPDSs.
