The method is based on adaptive input data decomposition, parallel shape reconstruction in decomposed clusters using Kohonen Self-Organizing Map, which creates mesh representation of the input data. Afterwards, the sub-maps are joined together and the final mesh is re-optimized. Our method overcomes a problem of fitting one mesh to complex non-continuous shapes like building interiors. The method allows to process unordered data collected by mobile robots. The method is easily paralelizable and gives promising results.", "paper_title": "Building of 3D environment models for mobile robotics using self-organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400073"}
