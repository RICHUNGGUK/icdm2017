Unfortunately, this extension is not faithful in the sense that its semantics does not coincide with the standard one for the pi-calculus in the noise-free case. In this paper, we consider a simple variant of the pi-calculus, the asynchronous pi-calculus (A pi), which has been used for modeling some concurrent systems with asynchronous communication. To model these systems with noisy channels, we propose a faithful extension of A pi, called the A pi(n)-calculus. After giving a probabilistic transitional semantics of A pi(n), we introduce bisimilarity in A pi(n) and show that it is a partial input congruence. If a specification of a system is described as a process P in A pi and we view the behavior of P in A pi(n) as an implementation of the specification, then it is interesting to measure how far the behavior in A pi(n) is from that in A pi. We thus introduce the notion of reliability degree, which is based upon a new approximate bisimulation. We find that bisimilar agents may have different reliability degrees and even the agent with the greatest reliability degree may not be satisfactory. We thus appeal to Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem and show that reliability degrees can be improved by employing coding techniques.", "paper_title": "Reliability of Mobile Processes with Noisy Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000307119200001"}
