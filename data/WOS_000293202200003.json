The performance measures (responses) of different NTM processes usually include metal removal rate, surface roughness, radial overcut, tool wear rate, heat affected zone, etc. In this paper, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is employed to search out the optimal combinations of different operating parameters for three widely used NTM processes, i.e. electrochemical machining, electrochemical discharge machining and electrochemical micromachining processes. Both the single and multi-objective optimization problems for the considered NTM processes are solved using this algorithm. The results obtained while applying the ABC algorithm for parametric optimization of these three NTM processes are compared with those derived by the past researchers, which prove the applicability and suitability of the ABC algorithm in enhancing the performance measures of the considered NTM processes.
