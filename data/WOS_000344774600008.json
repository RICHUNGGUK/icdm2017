However, despite the importance of family-based samples analysis, few statistical methods for rare variant association analysis are available. Results: In this report, we propose a FAmily-based Rare Variant Association Test (FARVAT). FARVAT is based on the quasi-likelihood of whole families, and is statistically and computationally efficient for the extended families. FARVAT assumed that families were ascertained with the disease status of family members, and incorporation of the estimated genetic relationship matrix to the proposed method provided robustness under the presence of the population substructure. Depending on the choice of working matrix, our method could be a burden test or a variance component test, and could be extended to the SKAT-O-type statistic. FARVAT was implemented in C+ +, and application of the proposed method to schizophrenia data and simulated data for GAW17 illustrated its practical importance.", "paper_title": "FARVAT: a family-based rare variant association test", "paper_id": "WOS:000344774600008"}
