The main interest of our approach is that it constitutes a complete black-box technique that does not make any assumptions on the components of the underlying protocol and can thus be easily generalized to analyze many other proposals.", "paper_title": "METAHEURISTIC TRACEABILITY ATTACK AGAINST SLMAP, AN RFID LIGHTWEIGHT AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000302061000020"}
