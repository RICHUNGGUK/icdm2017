As a result, it is better suitable for some application scenarios than the two-pass counterpart. However, currently there are few ID-based one-pass authenticated key exchange protocols with a security proof in a formal model. The paper investigates the ID-based one-pass authenticated key exchange protocol in the enhanced Canetti-Krawczyk (eCK) model. We propose a new ID-based one-pass authenticated key exchange protocol IDOAKE, which is shown secure under Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption in the eCK model. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first provably secure ID-based one-pass authenticated key exchange in the eCK model.
