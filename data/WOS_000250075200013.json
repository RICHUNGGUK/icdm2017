The transportation problem (TP) is known as one of the important network problems. When the TP problem is associated with additional fixed cost for establishing the facilities or fulfilling the demand of customers, then it is called fixed charge transportation problem (fcTP). This problem is one of the NP-hard (IE/OR) problems that are difficult to solve using traditional methods. This paper aims to show the application of spanning tree-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach for solving nonlinear fixed charge transportation problem. Our new idea lies on the GA representation that includes the feasibility criteria and repairing procedure for the chromosome. Several numerical experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
