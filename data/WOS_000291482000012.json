The shape functions used in the meshless methods reproduce linear polynomials. The numerical integration rules are required to satisfy the so-called zero row sum condition of stiffness matrix, which is also used by Babuka et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng. 76:1434-1470, 2008). But the analysis presented there relies on a certain property of the approximation space, which is difficult to verify. The analysis in this paper does not require this property. Moreover, the Lagrange multiplier technique was used to handle the pure Neumann condition. We have also identified specific numerical schemes, diagonal elements correction and background mesh integration, that satisfy the zero row sum condition. The numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical results and test the accuracy of the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Theoretical analysis of numerical integration in Galerkin meshless methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000291482000012"}
