The particular difference in this study compared with other similar studies is the boundary conditions for the helical coil. Most studies focus on constant wall temperature or constant heat flux, whereas in this study it was a fluid-to-fluid heat exchanger. The purpose of this article is to assess the influence of the tube diameter, coil pitch and shell-side mass flow rate on shell-side heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger. Different characteristic lengths were used in the Nusselt number calculations to determine which length best fits the data and finally it has been shown that the normalized length of the shell-side of the heat exchanger reasonably demonstrates the desired relation.
