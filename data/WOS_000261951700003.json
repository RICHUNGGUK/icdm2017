In this paper, a class of new CCCs are constructed using design-theoretic techniques. The obtained codes are optimal in the sense of their sizes. This result is established, for the most part, by means of a result on generalized doubly resolvable packings which is of combinatorial interest in its own right.", "paper_title": "A class of optimal constant composition codes from GDRPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000261951700003"}
