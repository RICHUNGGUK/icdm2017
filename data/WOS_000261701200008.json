Of course, fleet planning is essential for system performance. This research uses a distributed fleet planning algorithm based on Multi-Agent System. which is suitable for the Cybernetic Transportation System, Each agent represents one driverless vehicle and transport tasks can be completed more efficiently through cooperation and competition among the agents. Furthermore, a simulated model of the Cybernetic Transportation System based on Multi-Agent System has been developed. The simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the traditional centralized planning algorithms investigated. The effects of the number of driverless vehicles and the road topology on the proposed fleet planning algorithm have also been investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
