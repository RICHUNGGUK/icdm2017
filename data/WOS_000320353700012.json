The proliferation of crimes involving computers has created a demand for special forensic tools that allow investigators to look for evidence on a suspect's computer by analyzing communications and data on the computer's storage devices. Motivated by the forensic process at Surete du Quebec (SQ), the Quebec provincial police, we propose a new subject-based semantic document clustering model that allows an investigator to cluster documents stored on a suspect's computer by grouping them into a set of overlapping clusters, each corresponding to a subject of interest initially defined by the investigator.
