To overcome this problem, it has been suggested to generate additional views by means of interpolation. The practicality of this approach is investigated in combination with a dedicated method for angular interpolation of 3-D sinogram data. For this purpose, a novel dedicated shape-driven directional interpolation algorithm based on a structure tensor approach is developed. Quantitative evaluation shows that this method clearly outperforms conventional scene-base interpolation schemes. Furthermore, the image quality trade-offs associated with the use of interpolated intermediate views are systematically evaluated for simulated and clinical cone-beam computed tomography data sets of the human head. It is found that utilization of directionally interpolated views significantly reduces streak artifacts and noise, at the expense of small introduce image blur.", "paper_title": "Directional View Interpolation for Compensation of Sparse Angular Sampling in Cone-Beam CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000267698100005"}
