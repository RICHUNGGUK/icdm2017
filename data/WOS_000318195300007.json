The integral control has a great advantage for maintaining zero steady-state error in constant disturbances. This is especially suitable for the converter systems, where the output voltage regulated at a desired value is emphasized. The controller is inferred from the constraint of the virtual-desired variables ('VDVs), which includes a control law with parallel distributed compensation (PDC) style and a specific compensator. Based on the membership functions satisfying a Lipschitz-like property, the controller gains and observer gains can be designed separately and obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The overall closed-loop system with quadratic stability is very robust to uncertainty and has powerful ability for error convergence. The sensorless controller is realized by digital signal processors (DSPs). The simulations and experimental results verify the feasibility of the novel scheme and show the satisfactory performance.", "paper_title": "Current-Sensorless Flyback Converters Using Integral T-S Fuzzy Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000318195300007"}
