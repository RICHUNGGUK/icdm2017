In these algorithms, the population is decentralized by partitioning it into many small collaborating subpopulations, arranged in a toroidal grid, and interacting only with its neighboring subpopulations. In this work, we study the simplest cEDA -the cellular univariate marginal distribution algorithm (cUMDA). In an attempt to explain its behaviour, we extend the well known takeover time analysis usually applied to other evolutionary algorithms to the field of EDAs. We also give in this work empirical arguments in favor of using the cUMDAs instead of its centralized equivalent.", "paper_title": "Theory and practice of cellular UMDA for discrete optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400025"}
