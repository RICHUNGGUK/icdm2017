In the previous researches, most of the scheduling schemes were focused on how to allocate computing resources efficiently. However, in the environment of wireless sensor networks, scheduling policy for power resources of mobile device is also essential as high power drain of mobile sensor device will lead to immediate non-functioning of device due to limited capacity of its battery, Sensor nodes can also be powered by rechargeable power resources such as solar cell or gravitation. In these cases, residual energy of rechargeable power resource is dynamic over time. This motivated us to design a scheduling policy based on rechargeable power resource for increasing the network life time and reducing the response time of service. In this paper, we present and evaluate six process scheduling schemes based on execution time and energy consumption of process.", "paper_title": "Process scheduling policy based on rechargeable power resource in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100053"}
