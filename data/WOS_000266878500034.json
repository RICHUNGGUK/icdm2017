The rate region is characterized for the 2-description case. It is shown that each supporting line of the rate region is achievable with a transform lattice quantization scheme. We show the optimal coding scheme has a natural spectral domain coding interpretation, which yields a reverse water-filling solution with a frequency-dependent water level instead of the flat water level as in the conventional single description case.", "paper_title": "Multiple Description Coding for Stationary Gaussian Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500034"}
