Causality is the user's perceived causal absorption in and use of a system's \"what-if\" and goal-seeking functions to determine the most robust negotiation strategies for a given problem. This study has three objectives: (1) to rigorously define the causality construct, (2) to identify the construct's antecedents, and (3) to learn how the construct applies to user acceptance of NSS. For this purpose, statistical tests were performed three times. The first test adopted 17 subjects for ease of test operation and selection of candidate items. The second test used 195 valid responses to finalize a construct of causality and analyze statistical validity. The third test garnered 480 responses to prove the hypothesized effects of causality on beliefs in salient technology, using a structural equation model (SEM) as an analytical tool. A survey of pertinent literature and a statistical analysis will prove that computer playfulness and personal innovativeness are effective determinants of causality, suggesting that causality can explain users' psychological processes when NSS are applied to problems.", "paper_title": "THE INFLUENCE OF CAUSALITY ON NEGOTIATION SUPPORT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281129300005"}
