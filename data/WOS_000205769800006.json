We assume that all nodes are applying power management technique based on the constant event sensing reliability required by the coordinator. Power management generates random sleep times by every node which in average fairly distributes the sensing load among the nodes. Key exchange is initiated by cluster coordinator after some given number of sensing packets have been received by the coordinator. We develop analytical model of key exchange integrated into the cluster's sensing function and evaluate the impact of frequency of key exchange on the cluster's energy consumption", "paper_title": "Analytical Model for Key Distribution in 802.15.4 Beacon Enabled Cluster", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769800006"}
