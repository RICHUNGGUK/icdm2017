It is found that the precise position of the protonation has little effect on the transport properties of H2Mo6O19, as it is established by investigating two different geometries. Furthermore we have discovered that H2Mo6O19 and H2W6O19 display similar conduction profiles with the main conduction mechanism being quantum tunneling. With a large energy gap and robust structural stability these molecules appear to be good candidate for high bias applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
