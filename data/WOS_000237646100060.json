This scheme uses network resources more efficiently and minimizes the backup path cost effectively. The proposed restoration scheme starts the recovery action at a selected node of a working LSP. At the LSP setup, the working and backup path bandwidth and cost are evaluated and a starting node of restoration is designated. By doing so, the restoration speed could be further increased and resource utilization could be maximized with guaranteed bandwidth. Simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that our scheme can provide fast restoration with acceptable delay and loss characteristics with higher restoration rate.", "paper_title": "MPLS alternate path restoration with guaranteed bandwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100060"}
