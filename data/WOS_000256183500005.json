The programs can do least squares fitting of term values relative to the lowest energy level within a single (2)Pi state, of combination differences between vibronic levels within a single (2)Pi state or of transitions between the levels of two different (2)Pi states. The algorithm allows for the inclusion of Renner-Teller, spin-orbit, vibrational anharmonicity, Fermi resonance and Sears resonance terms in the Hamiltonian matrices. The Windows program RT3, written in Visual Basic 6.0 with a Fortran DLL engine for the numerically intensive computations, facilitates the construction and editing of input files and comparisons of input and output. For very large calculations, the Fortran code may be run as a stand-alone program on mainframe or other computers, but the Windows version offers significant advantages for common usage.

The RT3 program, available in Windows and Fortran versions, can be used to calculate the vibronic energy levels of such systems and fit experimental data to a Hamiltonian that includes Renner-Teller, spin-orbit, vibrational anharmonicity, Fermi resonance and Sears resonance effects. Solution method: The RT3 program solves for the Renner-Teller levels of a (2)Pi state by diagonalizing large truncated Hamiltonian matrices whose elements are generated in a harmonic oscillator basis set. Given an initial input set of constants, the resulting energy levels can be used to least squares fit or predict vibronic term values (relative to the lowest energy level), combination differences between vibronic levels within a electronic state, and transitions between the vibronic levels of two different 2 F, states.
