In the process of constructing MSTs, we introduce a novel metric to measure a distance between keywords by applying an integration of the Pearson correlation and the query-based cosine similarity. From this work, we made several meaningful observations about the networks of relevant keywords. First, keyword networks in a search engine exhibit the small-world effect and the scale-free property. Second, only a few among relevant keywords in the order of popularity are positively correlated and there is no significantly positive or negative relationship for the rest of relevant keywords. Third, the degree of searching activity for relevant keywords varies depending on whether they are branded keywords or non-branded keywords as well as the characteristics of product categories. Fourth, the mean correlation coefficient for keyword impressions during slow season increases. Finally, both k(max) and the betweenness centrality for high-involvement products are higher than those for low-involvement products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
