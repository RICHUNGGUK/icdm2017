The WTA-ICA algorithm exploits the maximization of the sparse measure criterion as the cost function, and it extracts successfully palmprint features. The classification performance is implemented by the RBPNN. The RBPNN is trained by the orthogonal least square (OLS) algorithm and its structure is optimized by the recursive OLS (ROLS) algorithm. Experimental results show that the RBPNN achieves higher recognition rate and better classification efficiency with other usual classifiers.", "paper_title": "Palmprint recognition using ICA based on winner-take-all network and radial basis probabilistic neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000032"}
