It is necessary to service contents effectively in accordance with diverse environmental information of various terminals caused by the rapid development in communication devices. This various terminal information needs much time to generate the content for a server and much capacity to load in the server. Therefore the method to minimize response time and server capacity is required. This paper proposes a pre-service and post-transcoding method to provide a more rapid response time according to requirements of various terminals and illustrates the results of test system.", "paper_title": "Pre-service and post-transcoding schema for an adaptive PC to mobile web contents transcoding system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241159700012"}
