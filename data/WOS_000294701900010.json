A novel algorithm for source location by utilizing the time of arrival (TOA) measurements of a signal received at spatially separated sensors is proposed. The algorithm is based on total least-squares (TLS) method, which is a generalized least-squares method to solve an overdetermined set of equations whose coefficients are noisy, and gives an explicit solution. Comparisons of performance with standard least-squares method are made, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed TLS algorithm gives better results than LS algorithm.", "paper_title": "Total Least-Squares Algorithm for Time of Arrival Based Wireless Sensor Networks Location", "paper_id": "WOS:000294701900010"}
