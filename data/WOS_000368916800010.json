However, to exploit this potential, access tools are needed, which integrate data from heterogeneous sources and provide an effective user interaction. Moreover, historical archives can become a useful and attractive cultural resource, if they are exploited in popular contexts, such as education and tourism: Innovative ICT-based applications can employ documents, pictures, etc. to guide students and tourists in the discovery of interesting stories, connecting the present to the past, and providing a larger audience with a \"live\" access to original cultural heritage resources. In particular, we claim that this scenario can be enabled by providing ICT tools with a rich semantic layer, based on computational ontologies, in which the notions of event and role play a major role. Such a semantic layer can be further enriched by exploiting resources available in the Linked Open Data cloud.", "paper_title": "Ontologies and historical archives: A way to tell new stories", "paper_id": "WOS:000368916800010"}
