This iterative algorithm is designed to solve directly the non-linear Kohn-Sham equations for accurate discretization schemes involving a large number of degrees of freedom. It makes use of an acceleration scheme similar to what is known as RMM-DIIS in the electronic structure community. The method is illustrated with examples of convergence for large scale applications using a finite difference discretization and multigrid preconditioning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
