In contrast to conventional models, the vacation periods may be initiated after each service completion, and can be randomly terminated with certain probabilities that depend on the queue length. We first present exact queue-length and delay results for some specific cases and we derive stochastic bounds for a much richer set of scenarios. Using these, together with stochastic relations between systems with different vacation disciplines, we examine the scaled queue length and delay in a heavy-traffic regime, and demonstrate a sharp trichotomy, depending on how the activation rate and vacation probability behave as function of the queue length. In particular, the effect of the vacation periods may either (i) completely vanish in heavy-traffic conditions, (ii) contribute an additional term to the queue lengths and delays of similar magnitude, or even (iii) give rise to an order-of-magnitude increase. The heavy-traffic trichotomy provides valuable insight into the impact of the back-off algorithms on the delay performance in wireless random-access networks.", "paper_title": "Queues with random back-offs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333708400002"}
