In the present work, hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system was used to demonstrate the existence of parametric sensitivity with respect to the input parameter, the cooling water flow rate. The applications of parametric sensitivity analysis were used for detection of parametric sensitivity in a continuous stirred tank reactor using catalyses hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system. Also, theoretical investigation revealed that the effect of wall capacitance has definite influence on the dynamics of continuous stirred tank reactor. The continuous stirred tank reactor showed parametric sensitivity both in the regions of uniqueness and multiplicity, and a mathematical model was developed for the reactor. The numerically simulated results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
