Realizing the above mode of planning and the increasing demand for Geographical-Information & Communication Technology (Geo-ICT) applications in the rural systems in India, a prototype distributed collaboration tool, called GromyoVikas (rural development), has been developed to assist the rural extension community in their own decision-making processes in a more interactive, integrated and coordinated manner. GramyaVikas, evolved out of the needs assessment of the user community, is a secure and cost-effective system developed for defined users with open source (a) content management system and (b) Geographical information Systems. This web-based tool will help the users to share and retrieve data/information; communicate for taking mutual decisions; make useful queries on spatial and nonspatial database to identify candidate villages/entities; and generate various views or scenarios for different rural development schemes. Presently, this Geo-ICT tool is being developed in an Intranet environment. The resulting system is intended to assist the remote users in analyzing rural-informatics for rural development planning decisions online, with customized GIS tools to suit the requirements of a few line departments for decision-making.
