It is shown here that this characterization lifts to \"V-translations\" and \"V-single-valued-NFTs\", where V is an arbitrary monoid pseudovariety that is closed under reversal. More strikingly, two-way V-transducers are introduced, and the following three models are shown exactly equivalent to Eilenberg's classical notion of a bimachine when V is a group variety or when V is the variety of aperiodic monoids: V-translations, V-single-valued-NFTs and two-way V-transducers.
