The fuzzy controlled multimicrostrip antennas network is introduced for selecting among four antennas, the choice of which is most important in terms of received signal power. Because the values are approximate and imprecise, the integration of a fuzzy controller based on selection rules by an expert is adequate. System design through the steps necessary to validate its behavior before implementation include Petri-net modeling, simulation, and integration of optimized algorithms to minimize computation time and avoid possible system blockages.", "paper_title": "PETRI-NET MODELING AND PROTOTYPE OF A MULTIMICROSTRIP ANTENNAE NETWORK FUZZY CONTROLLED SYSTEM FOR PICOSATELLITES", "paper_id": "WOS:000326615700001"}
