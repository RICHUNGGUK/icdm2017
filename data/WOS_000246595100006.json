Automatic placement of labels in a graph is an NP-Hard problem, for which efficient heuristic solutions have been recently developed. In this paper, we describe a general framework for modeling, drawing, editing, and automatic placement of labels respecting user constraints. In addition, we present the interface and the basic engine of the Graph Editor Toolkit - a family of portable graph visualization libraries designed for integration into graphical user interface application programs. This toolkit produces a high quality automated placement of labels in a graph using our framework. A brief survey of automatic label placement algorithms is also presented. Finally we describe extensions to certain existing automatic label placement algorithms, allowing their integration into this visualization tool. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
