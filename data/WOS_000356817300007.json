Several studies are on stage but, generally, they do not consider competitive erects,paying attention only to specific agents and their impact. In this paper, it is suggested a different scheme. At first, it is proposed a formal model of competitive noxious effects. Second, by generalizing a previous algorithm capable of describing urban growth, it is developed a cellular automata (CA) model that provides the effective impact of a variety of pollutants. The final achievement is a simulation tool that can model pollution combined effects and their dynamical evolution in relation to anthropized environments.", "paper_title": "Can CA describe collective effects of polluting agents?", "paper_id": "WOS:000356817300007"}
