It is revealed that variations of rise/fall time and skew alter the behavior of coupled inductive lines under different switching patterns. We observe that crosstalk noise reduces with increasing signal skew, and the impact of skew variation on crosstalk noise is more prominent for lines with strong capacitive coupling. A performance comparison is done between power supply and ground line as inductive shield, and it is found that ground lines work better than power lines in inductive crosstalk minimization. The 100%-delay measurement technique has been proposed as opposed to the conventional 50%-delay method, and we notice that the 50%-delay technique underestimates the propagation delay for an inductive dominant line with varying signal slew times. Closed-form equations for propagation delay in terms of signal slew time have been derived, which are within 9% of HSPICE-simulated results for a set of interconnect structures. These expressions are simple, and accuracy increases with growing number of interconnect lines.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Impacts of Signal Slew and Skew on the Behavior of Coupled RLC Interconnects for Different Switching Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000273774700019"}
