A serialized fixed-size floating-point encoded tree parameter set consists of a set of auxiliary local and other global parameters. The main goal of paper is to lower problem dimensionality needed for encoding local parameters. For evolution simulation, differential evolution algorithm is used. The optimizer evolves a parameterized procedural model by fitting a set of its rendered images to a set of automatically preprocessed reference photo images. The reconstructed tree morphology is then used for reconstructed tree animation, to generate similar geometrical tree models based on similar morphology. Examples of reconstructed model animation are shown, such as simulation of its growth, sway in the wind, or adding leaves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
