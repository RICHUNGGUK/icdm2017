However, preventing tool wear and/or breakage is still a major concern. From the production process point of view, several undesirable consequences may arise, such as downtimes, increased production costs, loss of dimensional tolerances and even irreversible workpiece defects. In this sense, the present article presents a computer assistant, which provides information about the current drilling process system. In particular, the computer assistant detects both tool wear and material heterogeneities.", "paper_title": "A computer assistant for monitoring tool performance during the drilling process", "paper_id": "WOS:000308107500006"}
