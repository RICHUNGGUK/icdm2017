First, a self-generating method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to automatically construct a high performance fuzzy system. Some simulation results of an inverted pendulum control system are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed GA-based method in the fuzzy system design. Then, a fuzzy system design method by using VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is proposed so that the fuzzy system hardware implemented on an FPGA chip has a great flexibility and a high process speed. Moreover, a friendly-used software tool is developed to automatically generate VHDL codes for the users to easily design their fuzzy system hardware based on the proposed methodology. Finally, some experimental results are presented to illustrate the validity and the applicability of the design methodology.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of GA-based fuzzy system on FPGA chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000252065100005"}
