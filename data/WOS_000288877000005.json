Design/methodology/approach A survey method was used to collect data from 47 schools located at different regions: the coast, Andes. and jungle of Peru. The partial least square technique was used for data analysis. Findings It was found that \"e-learning motivation\" and \"social influence\" had a positive influence on behavioural intention, while \"facilitating condition\" had no effect on e-learning portal use. Furthermore. use behaviour had a positive influence on e-learning motivation. Also found was the moderating role of \"region\". Research limitations/implications The analysis is carried out in a single country. thus, caution should be taken in generalisation of the results. Practical implications The findings will help policy makers and practitioners in developing countries to better understand students e-learning motivation. Originality/value - By adopting the UTAUT model, a new construct of \"e-learning motivation\" is added, and applied to the South American context.", "paper_title": "E-learning motivation and educational portal acceptance in developing countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000288877000005"}
