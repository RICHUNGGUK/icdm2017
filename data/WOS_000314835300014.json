The objective of this comparison is to point out the advantages and drawbacks of the two modulators thereby allowing choosing the most suited for a given application. The metrics of comparison are the noise floor, power consumption, area and the effect of the non-idealities of all the basic blocks (i.e., operational transconductance amplifier, quantizer, switches and clocks). The comparative analysis shows that HP modulators are more suited for narrow band applications because of their immunity against DC-offset and flicker noise. For medium and wide band applications, LP modulators are preferred because of their higher robustness against switch imperfections and clock jitter.", "paper_title": "A comparison between high-pass and low-pass Delta Sigma modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000314835300014"}
