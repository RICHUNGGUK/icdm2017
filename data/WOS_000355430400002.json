POEM provides the following salient features: (a) it considers resource management not only between mobile devices and clouds, but also among mobile devices; (b) it utilizes the entire mobile cloud system as the mobile application running platform, and as a result, the mobile cloud application development is significantly simplified and enriched; and (c) it addresses the interoperability issues among mobile devices and cloud resource providers to allow mobile cloud applications running cross various cloud virtual machines and mobile devices. The proposed POEM solution is demonstrated by using OSGi and XMPP techniques. Our performance evaluations demonstrate that POEM provides a true elastic application running environment for mobile cloud computing.", "paper_title": "Establishing A Personal On-Demand Execution Environment for Mobile Cloud Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000355430400002"}
