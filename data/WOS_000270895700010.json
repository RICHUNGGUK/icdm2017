Exploitation of these developments is enhanced with the introduction of faster algorithms to transform photo currents into perfusion estimates using the first moment of the power spectrum. A time domain (TD) algorithm is presented for determining the first-order spectral moment. Experiments are performed to compare this algorithm with the widely used Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This study shows that the TD-algorithm is twice as fast as the FFT-algorithm without loss of accuracy. Compared to FFT, the TD-algorithm is efficient in terms of processor time, memory usage and data transport.", "paper_title": "Time domain algorithm for accelerated determination of the first order moment of photo current fluctuations in high speed laser Doppler perfusion imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000270895700010"}
