First, the setting of extreme points (ideal and anti-ideal points) in TOPSIS is redefined and extended for handling the multiple extreme points situation where a decision maker (DM) or multiple DMs can provide more than one pair of extreme points. Next, three different aggregation schemes are designed to integrate OWA into the TOPSIS analysis procedure. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach and the results are compared for different aggregation settings and confirm the robustness of rankings from different scenarios.
