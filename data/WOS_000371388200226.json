The LED lights illuminate their own attocells and convey video streams in the downlink to multiple mobile terminals (MTs). Three different transmission schemes are considered, namely: the unity frequency reuse, the higher frequency reuse factor-based transmission, and the novel vectored transmission. We then formulate the optimization problems aiming at minimizing the video distortion. This paper commences by evaluating the performance of the MT at specific positions and continues by characterizing the peak SNR (PSNR) degradation across the room. Finally, we quantify the average performance of multiple MTs randomly walking in the room. By investigating the PSNR degradation, the video rate achieved, the energy consumed, and the effects of buffering delay on the video distortion, we demonstrate that the proposed VLC system is capable of supporting high-quality multimedia transmissions.", "paper_title": "Video Streaming in the Multiuser Indoor Visible Light Downlink", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200226"}
