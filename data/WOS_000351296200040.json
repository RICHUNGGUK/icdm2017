This study proposes a multi-initiator simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm to maximize the total net revenue for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem with order acceptance and weighted tardiness. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MSA algorithm, computational experiments are performed and compared for a benchmark problem set of test instances with up to 500 orders. Experimental results reveal that the proposed heuristic outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm and obtains the best solutions in 140 out of 160 benchmark instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
