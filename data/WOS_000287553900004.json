However, previous results only focus on enlarged patterns, and do not allow shrunk patterns since they may disappear. In this paper, we give the definition and an efficient indexing algorithm for proportionally-scaled patterns that can be visually enlarged or shrunk. The proposed indexing algorithm takes O(vertical bar T vertical bar) time in its preprocessing phase, and achieves O(vertical bar P vertical bar+ U-p + logm) time in its answering phase, where vertical bar T vertical bar, vertical bar P vertical bar, U-p, and m denote the length of T, the length of P. the number of reported positions, and the length of T under run-length representation, respectively.
