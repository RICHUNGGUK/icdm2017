The method is based on hand shake formulation and developed for fast transient. This type of gluing permits to use SPH only in the region of interest. The SPH methods is often CPU time consuming, hence this coupling strategy is interesting provided one knows in advance where the critical zone is. The method is applied to the prediction of perforation of available reinforced concrete slabs experiments. A concrete damage model adapted to high strain rate is also described.
