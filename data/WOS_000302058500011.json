Let c(t)(n) be the size of the largest t-cancellative family on n elements, and let c(t)(n, r) denote the largest r-uniform family. We improve the previous upper bounds, e. g., we show c(2)(n) <= 2(0.322n) (for n > n(0)). Using an algebraic construction we show that c(2)(n, 2k) = Theta(n(k)) for each k when n -> infinity.", "paper_title": "2-Cancellative Hypergraphs and Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302058500011"}
