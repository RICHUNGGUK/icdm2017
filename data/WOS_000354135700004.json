It is a nontrivial task, since facial shapes vary significantly with facial expressions, poses or occlusion. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a discriminative deep face shape model that is constructed based on an augmented factorized three-way Restricted Boltzmann Machines model. Specifically, the discriminative deep model combines the top-down information from the embedded face shape patterns and the bottom up measurements from local point detectors in a unified framework. In addition, along with the model, effective algorithms are proposed to perform model learning and to infer the true facial point locations from their measurements. Based on the discriminative deep face shape model, 68 facial points are detected on facial images in both controlled and \"in-the-wild\" conditions. Experiments on benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed facial point detection algorithm against state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Deep Face Shape Model for Facial Point Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000354135700004"}
