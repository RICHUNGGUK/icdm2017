In computer software tests in component-based systems, such a DTA can be used to generate test suites that are capable of locating -way interaction faults and detect whether there are more than interaction faults. It is proved in this paper that an SSOA of strength , index and degree , or an SSOA, exists if and only if excepting possibly a handful of cases.", "paper_title": "Existence of super-simple OA(lambda) (3, 5, nu)'s", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444600012"}
