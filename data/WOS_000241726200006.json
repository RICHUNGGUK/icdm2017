D. project whose goal is to improve both the user interaction and the efficiency of XML databases. Based on structural summaries for indexing and visualizing the structure of XML data, we describe a highly interactive, intuitive GUI targeted at non-experts, and present sophisticated algorithms and data structures for efficient query evaluation which enable a smooth user interaction. Preliminary results illustrate how XML exploration, indexing, querying, caching, ranking and user feedback in XML databases can benefit significantly from the structural summaries.", "paper_title": "Enhancing user interaction and efficiency with structural summaries for fast and intuitive access to XML databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200006"}
