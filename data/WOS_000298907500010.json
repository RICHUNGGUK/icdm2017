All blocks of target image form a ring in a manner that the watermark of an image block is hidden in 1-LSB (least significant bit) of its next block NI, and the copy of this watermark is embedded into 2-LSB of another block whose position is determined by the position of NI. The validity of test image block is determined by comparing the number of inconsistent blocks in the block-neighborhood with that of its mapping block. Other detection result is generated in the same way comparing test block with copy block of its next block. The fusion of two detection marks improves tamper detection accuracy, while two copies of watermark provide a second chance for tamper recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the state of the art of tamper detection and tamper recovery and could keep high security strength. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
