For the PON part, an external cavity laser (ECL) and a directly modulated laser (DML) are used as optical sources for downlink and uplink, respectively. The OWC subsystem utilizes a visible light-emitting diode (LED) for downlink and an infrared LED (IR-LED) for uplink transmission. To enable high spectral efficiency (SE), high-speed transmission, and flexible multiple access with simplified optical network unit (ONU)-side digital signal processing (DSP), multilevel, multiband quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and hybrid 128/64/16 Nyquist single-carrier frequency domain equalization (N-SC-FDE) modulation are implemented in this paper. In terms of 62.5 MHz OWC N-SC-FDE signals, the system successfully delivered a further 140 cm indoor distance after transmitting over a span of 25 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) together with three subbands of 250 MHz PON signals. As a proof of concept, an integrated system of symmetrical full-duplex 5 Gb/s PON and 250 Mb/s OWC at each direction for three wired users and one wireless user is successfully achieved. The measured bit error ratios (BERs) for each user are all smaller than the 7% pre-forward-error-correction (pre-FEC) limit of 3.8 x 10(-3), which shows the promising potential and feasibility of this proposal to extend multiple services from metro areas to suburban areas.", "paper_title": "Symmetrical Full-Duplex Integrated Passive Optical Network and Optical Wireless Communication Transmission System", "paper_id": "WOS:000359582600004"}
