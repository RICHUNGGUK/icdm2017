In this paper, we introduce an automatic inpainting technique to remove undesired fence-like structures from images. Specifically, the proposed technique works on the RGBD images which have recently become cheaper and easier to obtain using the Microsoft Kinect. The basic idea is to segment and remove the undesired fence-like structures by using both depth and color information, and then adapt an existing inpainting algorithm to fill the holes resulting from the structure removal. We found that it is difficult to achieve a satisfactory segmentation of such structures by only using the depth channel. In this paper, we use the depth information to help identify a set of foreground and background strokes, with which we apply a graph-cut algorithm on the color channels to obtain a more accurate segmentation for inpainting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique by experiments on a set of Kinect images.", "paper_title": "Automatic inpainting by removing fence-like structures in RGBD images", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800017"}
