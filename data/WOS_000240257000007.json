Despite the reachability set is not recursive in general, FAST implements several innovative techniques such as acceleration and circuit selection to solve this problem in practice. In its latest version, the tool is built upon an open architecture: the Presburger library is manipulated through a clear and convenient interface, thus any Presburger arithmetics package can be plugged to the tool. We provide four implementations of the interface using LASH, MONA, OMEGA and a new shared automata package with computation cache. Finally new features are available, like different acceleration algorithms.", "paper_title": "FAST extended release (Tool paper)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240257000007"}
