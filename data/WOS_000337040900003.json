Both have been conceived to speed up operations that are currently accomplished by using engineering geodesy techniques and instruments. On the same time, proposed solutions are cheap and affordable. The first one is aimed at measuring relative deformations of transversal cross-section of tunnels. Some special targets are placed on the tunnel vault and their coordinates are measured by means of a small photogrammetric block made up of four images. A wire is used to setup the scale and to make all measurements comparable overtime. The second method can be applied for the measurement of vertical deformations along the longitudinal profile of tunnels. A new image-based approach called 'photogrammetric levelling' is discussed here, which is based on the metric rectification of each single image depicting a couple of special rods to be hung on levelling benchmarks. This technique can be used to replace traditional optical and digital level instruments. Both applications can be carried out by using a calibrated amateur camera. Some experiments in controlled and real environments allowed assessing performances and limitations of these techniques for operational surveys in tunnel monitoring.", "paper_title": "Photogrammetric techniques for monitoring tunnel deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040900003"}
