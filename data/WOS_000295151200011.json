Direct solution methods for optimal control problems treat them from the perspective of global optimization: i.e. perform a global search for the control function that optimizes the required objective. In this article we use a recently developed ecologically inspired optimization technique called Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) for solving such optimal control problems. Usually the direct solution method operates on discrete n-dimensional vectors and not on continuous functions. Consequently it can become computationally expensive for large values of n. Thus, a parameterization technique is required to represent the control functions using a small number of real-valued parameters. Typically, direct methods based on evolutionary computing techniques parameterize control functions with a piecewise constant approximation. This has obvious limitations both for accuracy in representing arbitrary functions, and for optimization efficiency. In this paper a new parameterization is introduced using Bezier curves, which can accurately represent continuous control functions with only a few parameters. It is combined with IWO into a new evolutionary direct method for optimal control. The effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by solving a wide variety of optimal control problems.
