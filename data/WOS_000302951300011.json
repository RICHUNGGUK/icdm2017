However, the question remains why the human AFP (HAFP), unlike rodent AFP, cannot bind free estrogens. Moreover, despite the fact that AFP was first discovered more than 50 years ago and is presently recognized as a \"golden standard\" among onco-biomarkers, its three-dimensional (3D) structure has not been experimentally solved yet. In this work using MODELLER program, we generated 3D model of HAFP on the basis of homology with human serum albumin (HSA) and Vitamin D-binding protein (VTDB) with subsequent molecular docking of DES to the model structure and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the complex obtained. The model constructed has U-shaped structure in which a cavity may be distinguished. In this cavity the putative estrogen-binding site is localized. Validation by RMSD calculation and with the use of PROCHECK program showed good quality of the model and stability of extended region of four alpha-helical structures that contains putative hormone-binding residues. Data extracted from MD simulation trajectory allow proposing two types of interactions between amino acid residues of HAFP and DES molecule: (1) hydrogen bonding with involvement of residues S445, R452, and E551; (2) hydrophobic interactions with participation of L138, M448, and M548 residues. A suggestion is made that immobilization of the hormone using a long spacer provides delivery of the estrogen molecule to the binding site and, thereby, facilitates interaction between HAFP and the hormone.", "paper_title": "MODELING OF THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF HUMAN ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN COMPLEXED WITH DIETHYLSTILBESTROL: DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000302951300011"}
