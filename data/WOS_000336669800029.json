One of the main design difficulties derives from the need to accurately tune the resonant tank and the operating conditions to achieve the desired performance. This is especially challenging in those applications in which either the resonant tank or the operating conditions are highly variable. This paper proposes and compares several implementations of online parametric identification algorithms to identify the resonant tank of power converters taking advantage of field-programmable gate array technology. The proposed implementations are based on the phase-sensitive detector algorithm, which ensures an accurate harmonic identification of the resonant load. The proposed identification system is tested using a resonant power converter prototype applied to induction heating systems, proving the feasibility and accuracy of this proposal.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Implementation of FPGA-Based Online Parametric Identification Algorithms for Resonant Power Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800029"}
