Information and communications technologies are perceived as the interface that integrates these topics. The main objective of this research is to develop a decision-support system based on core parameters affecting the performance of health-care facilities. This paper presents the preliminary development of a quantitative integrated health-care facility management model, subdivided into the following three interfaces: input, reasoning evaluator and predictor, and output. The model proposes the following five modules: maintenance, performance and risk, energy and operations, business management. and development. It offers projection of maintenance costs, performance, and risk of built facilities in the health-care sector. The model hypotheses are that age, occupancy, and environment affect the maintenance of the facility. These factors are quantitatively developed and analyzed for performance-based maintenance planning, employing an occupancy coefficient and a projection of performance indicator. Simulations of the facility coefficient for different combinations of occupancy and environment reveal that the occupancy level is a major factor that causes an augmentation of more than 18% in the allocation of resources for maintenance compared with standard occupancy. Prediction of the performance score of a building is carried out using a nonlinear pattern for the structural components and linear patterns for the rest of the components.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided healthcare facility management", "paper_id": "WOS:000248815800008"}
