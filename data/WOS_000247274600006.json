When M reduces to the set 2 = {0, 1), a (2, M)-fuzzy topology is called a fuzzifying topology after Ying. ostak introduced the notion (L, M)-fuzzy uniform spaces. The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between (2, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces and (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces as well as the relationship between (2, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces and pointwise (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces-the extension of Shi's L-quasi-uniform space in a Kubiak-Sostak sense. It is shown that the category of (2, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces can be embedded in the category of stratified (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces as a both reflective and coreflective full subcategory; and the former category can also be embedded in the category of pointwise (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-uniform spaces.
