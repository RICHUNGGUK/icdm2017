For a given n, we derive the optimal value of k that minimizes the total sensing error probability subject to the sensing accuracy, considering both the effective of sensing errors and the primary activities. According to the optimal k, we analyze the performance and compare with other schemes, which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700028"}
