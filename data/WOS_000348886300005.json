BDSC extends Yang and Gerasoulis's Dominant Sequence Clustering (DSC) algorithm; it uses sophisticated cost models and addresses both shared and distributed parallel memory architectures. We describe BDSC, its integration within the PIPS compiler infrastructure and its application to the parallelization of four well-known scientific applications: Harris, ABF, equake and IS. Our experiments suggest that BDSC's focus on efficient resource management leads to significant parallelization speedups on both shared and distributed memory systems, improving upon DSC results, as shown by the comparison of the sequential and parallelized versions of these four applications running on both OpenMP and MPI frameworks.
