On that occasion the superiority of L-valued topology over [ 0, 1]- valued topology is being discussed. We then show how the Hutton's concept evolved. After obvious identifications we can today say that [0, 1](L) is the tensor product [0, 1] circle times L of the lattices [0, 1] and L. An account of the consequences of this new view point is hoped to appear thereafter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
