Such topic is one of the important research fields in computer aided geometric design. The convexity preserving properties of the interpolating four-point ternary subdivision scheme are discussed in this paper. The conditions on the parameter of the scheme to preserve convexity are given. The parameter locates in the interval (1/15, 1/9). thus the limit Curve generated by the scheme is C-2.
