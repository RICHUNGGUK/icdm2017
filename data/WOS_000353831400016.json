It is sometimes necessary to generate a vector graphics form of raster images comprising such artwork with the expectation to obtain a simple output and plug it into a traditional workflow, to be further edited and arranged. Many such workflows support only linear gradients and our goal is to generate a standard vector form of the image that can fit such workflow. This vectorization process should be automatic with minimal user intervention. We present a simple image vectorization algorithm that detects regions of linear gradient in potentially noisy images and reconstructs the vector definition on the basis of that information. It uses a novel interval gradient optimization scheme to derive large regions of uniform gradient. We also demonstrate the technique on noisy and hand-drawn portraits.", "paper_title": "A vectorization framework for constant and linear gradient filled regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400016"}
