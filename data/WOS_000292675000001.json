RBF neural networks (NNs) are used to tackle unknown nonlinear functions, then the decentralized adaptive NN tracking controller is constructed by combining Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions and the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique along with the minimal-learning-parameters (MLP) algorithm. The stability analysis subject to the effect of input saturation constrains are conducted with the help of an auxiliary design system based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method. The proposed controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of all the signals in the closed-loop large-scale system, while the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. An advantage of the proposed control scheme lies in that the number of adaptive parameters for each subsystem is reduced to one, and three problems of \"computational explosion\", \"dimension curse\" and \"controller singularity\" are solved, respectively. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
