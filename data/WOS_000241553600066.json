To analyze the discrimination capabilities of the CASI data, principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis methods are used. We assess the performance of various classification techniques: Multi-layer perceptrons, radial basis function neural networks, and support vector machines. We also discuss the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions in the framework of precision viticulture.", "paper_title": "Hyperspectral image analysis for precision viticulture", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600066"}
