While scientists frequently use off-the-shelf analysis tools to process and manipulate data, current provenance techniques such as those based on scientific workflows are typically not able to trace internal data manipulations that occur within these tools. In this paper, we focus on one such off-the-shelf tool, MS Excel, which is used by many scientists; specifically, we propose in SituTrac, an automated in situ provenance approach for spreadsheet data in Excel. Our framework captures data provenance unobtrusively in the background, allows for user annotations, provides undo/redo functionality at various levels of granularity, presents the captured provenance in an accessible format, and visualizes captured provenance to support analysis of the provenance log. We highlight several motivating use case scenarios which show how provenance queries can be answered by our approach. Finally, case studies with an atmospheric science research group and a fisheries research group suggest that the automated provenance approach is both efficient and useful to scientists.
