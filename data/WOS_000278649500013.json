Cloud computing service providers must make sure enough resources are provided to meet users' demand, by either the provision of more than enough resource, or the provision of just-enough resource. This paper investigates the growth of the user set of a cloud computing service from statistic's point of view. The investigation leads to a simple model on the growth of the system in terms of users. This model provides a simple way to compute the scale of a system at a given time, thus allowing a cloud computing service provider to predict the system's scale based on the number of users and plan for the infrastructure deployment.", "paper_title": "Modeling User Growth for Cloud Scalability and Availability", "paper_id": "WOS:000278649500013"}
