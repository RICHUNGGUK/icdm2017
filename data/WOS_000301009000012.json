Previous methods estimate a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately than estimating them separately. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
