We first transform the tree to a string representing its postfix notation, and then present an algorithm based on the bottom-up technique to solve it. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases: the preprocessing phase and the phase where all subtree repeats are computed. The linear time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm are important parts of its quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
