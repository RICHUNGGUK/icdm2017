Crucial to this step is either detecting ridges from the gray-level image or binarizing the image and then extracting the minutiae. In this work, we firstly exploit the property of almost equal width of ridges and valleys for binarization. Computing the width of arbitrary shapes is a nontrivial task. So, we estimate the width using Euclidean distance transform (EDT) and provide a near-linear time algorithm for binarization. Secondly, instead of using thinned binary images for minutiae extraction, we detect minutiae straightaway from the binarized fingerprint images using EDT. We also use EDT values to get rid of spurs and bridges in the fingerprint image. Unlike many other previous methods, our work depends minimally on arbitrary selection of parameters.", "paper_title": "A combinatorial approach to fingerprint binarization and minutiae extraction using Euclidean distance transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000251720000003"}
