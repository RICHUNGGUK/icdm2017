By specification, IMS is the first implementation towards reaching converged communications which allows users to communicate with video, audio and multimedia content, via any fixed, mobile and wireless access network type, with controllable QoS. To enable IMS communications across heterogeneous networks, incorporating UMTS, WLAN and fixed IP access points, 3GPP and ETSI's TISPAN currently work on schemes for controlling bandwidth allocation at the service level by employing logical interfaces that carry SIP messages. This article analyzes how interconnection between such heterogeneous networks may be performed on real platforms. In this effort, special attention is paid to the way the various interconnection possibilities can affect end-to-end QoS provisioning. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
