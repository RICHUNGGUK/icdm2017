Here we are given a cache of size k and pages with arbitrary sizes and fetching costs. Given a request sequence of pages, the goal is to minimize the total cost of fetching the pages into the cache. Our main result is an online algorithm with competitive ratio O(log(2) k), which gives the first o(k) competitive algorithm for the problem. We also give improved O(log k)-competitive algorithms for the special cases of the bit model and fault model, improving upon the previous O(log(2) k) guarantees due to Irani [Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1997, pp. 701-710]. Our algorithms are based on an extension of the online primal-dual framework introduced by Buchbinder and Naor [Math. Oper. Res., 34 (2009), pp. 270-286] and involve two steps. First, we obtain an O(log k)-competitive fractional algorithm based on solving online an LP formulation strengthened with exponentially many knapsack cover constraints. Second, we design a suitable online rounding procedure to convert this online fractional algorithm into a randomized algorithm. Our techniques provide a unified framework for caching algorithms and are substantially simpler than those previously used.", "paper_title": "RANDOMIZED COMPETITIVE ALGORITHMS FOR GENERALIZED CACHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000303396500005"}
