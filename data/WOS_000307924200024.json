NLPCA, PCA and image processing are applied to the global ionospheric map (GIM) with transforms conducted for the time period 12:00-14:00 UT on 29 May 2008 when the wind was most intense. Results show that at a height of approximately 150-200 km the TEC anomaly using NLPCA is more localized; however its intensity increases with height and becomes more widespread. The TEC anomalies are not found by PCA. Potential causes of the results are discussed with emphasis given to vertical acoustic gravity waves. The approximate position of the typhoon's eye can be detected if the GIM is divided into fine enough maps with adequate spatial-resolution at GPS-TEC receivers. This implies that the trace of the typhoon in the regional GIM is caught using NLPCA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
