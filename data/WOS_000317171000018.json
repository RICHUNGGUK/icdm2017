The patterning method proposed here uses bicubic spline descriptions of surfaces undergoing flattening, followed by elastic analysis of strains arising from this process and from membrane pre-stress. The results, which ensure stress compatibility along panel edges, produce a cutting pattern and stress variation within it when the panel is assembled into the 3D form. They confirm a general relationship between panel width and stress deviation from the intended pre-stress reported in [1]. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
