To begin with, a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on dynamic censoring is employed to shorten sensing time and save unnecessary spectrum sensing energy. Then to jointly optimize the energy efficiency, the distortion constrained probabilistic transmission scheme is utilized. Afterwards the sensing threshold solving issue can be formulated as a nonlinear minmax optimization problem with the detection probability and false alarm probability constraints. Solving by the Matlab software with the free OPTI toolbox, simulation results demonstrate that significant energy can be saved via the the proposed joint optimization method in various mobile cloud scenarios.", "paper_title": "Joint Spectrum Sensing and Data Transmission Optimization for Energy Efficiency in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks: A Dynamic Cooperative Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200004"}
