It proposes that links among design moves and shifts between design arguments are of prime importance in exploration and the design space should accommodate and expose them. The primacy of self-generated representations in the form of free-hand sketches and the role of arbitrary visual stimuli as supporting design reasoning is introduced. The expositions lead to the conclusion that the design space should be conceived as a multilevel and multifacet construct that supports on the spot experimentation and provides essential feedback not only regarding designs, but also concerning the process of designing.", "paper_title": "Quo vadis, design space explorer?", "paper_id": "WOS:000236377800006"}
