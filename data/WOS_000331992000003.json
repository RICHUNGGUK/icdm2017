In this work, pharmacophore modeling and shape-based virtual screening were combined to predict new LXR beta-selective ligands. Out of the 10 predicted compounds, three displayed significant LXR activity. Two activated both LXR subtypes. The third compound activated LXR beta 1.8-fold over LXR alpha.", "paper_title": "Discovery of New Liver X Receptor Agonists by Pharmacophore Modeling and Shape-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000331992000003"}
