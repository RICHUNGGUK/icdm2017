The length transformations and the length transformation diagraphs of the hexagonal chains containing no nonzigzag segment, or containing exactly one nonzigzag segment, or containing exactly two nonzigzag segments, are introduced. In addition, some algorithms for ordering the hexagonal chains by Wiener numbers are established. A similar length transformation digraph and algorithm for ordering the CHSs with only one branch hexagon and with no kink is also given. Based on the length transformation digraphs and the algorithms, the above several classes of CHSs with h hexagons can be completely ordered for a given h. Furthermore, the catacondensed hexagonal systems with the second up to the thirty-third largest Wiener numbers are determined.", "paper_title": "Catacondensed hexagonal systems with large Wiener numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000235914500011"}
