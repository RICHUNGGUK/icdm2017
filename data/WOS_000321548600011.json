Fair exchange protocol plays an important role in electronic commerce in the case of exchanging digital contracts. In this paper, we propose a fair exchange protocol based on identity-based verifiably encrypted signatures. Our protocol involves an offline trusted third party which is only required when one entity attempts to cheat or crashes. The underlining identity-based verifiably encrypted signature scheme is proven secure under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption and is the first identity-based verifiably encrypted signature scheme provably secure against existential unforgeable under adaptive chosen message and identity attacks in the standard model.
