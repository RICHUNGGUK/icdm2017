The low sensitivity of the output current to supply voltage fluctuation and ground bouncing is achieved by operating the system in a rail-to-rail swing mode. High data rates are obtained by multiplexing at low-impedance nodes and inductive shunt peaking with active inductors. The fully differential configuration and bipolar signaling of the transmitter minimize the effect of both common-mode disturbances and electro-magnetic interferences exerted from channels to neighboring devices. The class AB operation of the transmitter minimizes its static power consumption. The proposed transmitter is implemented in a 1.2 V 0. 13 mu m CMOS technology and analyzed using Spectre from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM3v3 device models. Both pre and post-layout simulation results demonstrate that the transmitter conveys a sufficiently large differential output current that is insensitive to supply voltage fluctuation and ground bouncing at 10 Gb/s.", "paper_title": "A new CMOS class AB serial link transmitter with a low supply voltage sensitivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500011"}
