For the University Course Timetabling Problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to schedule events to timeslots based on cliques, each representing a set of events that could be scheduled in the same timeslot, which the algorithm constructs. Our algorithm has been tested on a set of well-known instances, and the experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and can compete with other effective algorithms.", "paper_title": "A clique-based algorithm for constructing feasible timetables", "paper_id": "WOS:000287492300007"}
