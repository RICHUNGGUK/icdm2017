A context refers to a situation or scenario of an application requiring specific domain knowledge. In particular, our focus is on the class of applications involving embedded fuzzy control. The domain knowledge therefore refers to fuzzy rules and memberships. The kind of applications being considered is real-time in nature, which necessitates the implementation of hardware for fuzzy inferencing. The chip architecture is described and details on the design of the chip is presented.", "paper_title": "A context switchable fuzzy inference chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000239553000007"}
