The following five step framework is presented and applied to a pilot self separation task: 1) identify entities critical to system design, development, and operation and define their goals and properties as they relate to the system being studied; 2) define a subset of functionality for evaluation (define an execution sequence); 3) map entity properties to the execution sequence to identify independent variables; 4) translate entity goals into a set of system goals that can be used to identify dependent measures; and 5) iterate through each step to ensure the models produced are internally consistent.", "paper_title": "Framework to Support Scenario Development for Human-Centered Alerting System Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327969300008"}
