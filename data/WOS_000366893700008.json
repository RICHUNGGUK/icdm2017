Blackwell's work on thresholds of vision of the human visual system did not explore some variables whose analysis would help to characterize more deeply the visual system. This paper extends Blackwell's results exploring new dimensions of the human visual system response including chromaticity of the stimuli, mono/binocular vision, and dark adaptation. Tests have been performed on a sample of 45 observers, with a simplified laboratory setup with respect to Blackwell and without specific hardware/software, producing results in terms of visual adaptation, monocular, and binocular vision and aging effects.", "paper_title": "Thresholds of Vision of the Human Visual System: Visual Adaptation for Monocular and Binocular Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000366893700008"}
