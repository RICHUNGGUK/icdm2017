This paper proposes a unified framework to detect rotation, reflection and translation symmetries simultaneously on unsegmented real-world images. The detection is performed based on affine invariant contour features, and is applicable under skewed imaging with distortions. Contours on a natural image are first matched to each other to find affine invariant matching pairs, which are then classified into three groups using a sign change criterion corresponding to the three types of symmetries. The three groups are used to vote for the corresponding symmetries: the voting for rotation utilizes a scheme of short line segments; the voting for reflection is based on a parameterization of axis equation, and the voting for translation uses a cascade-like approach. Experimental results of real-world images are provided with quantitative evaluations, validating that the proposed framework achieves desired performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
