Such protocols control who talks at what time sharing the common idea \"try to send your data and, if your message collides with another transmission, try resending later\". In the present paper we consider a time-slotted ALOHA model where users are allowed to renege before transmission completion. We focus on the scenario that leads to overload in the absence of impatience. Under mild assumptions, we show that the fluid (or law-of-large-numbers) limit of the system workload coincides a.s. with the unique solution to a certain integral equation. We also demonstrate that the fluid limits for distinct initial conditions converge to the same value as time tends to infinity.", "paper_title": "Fluid limits for an ALOHA-type model with impatient customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000308727400004"}
