This paper provides a data reconstruction method based on Identifier/Locator Separation Architecture. Through introducing the non-collision hashing multi-bit Trie-tree algorithm, this method constructs Port Trie-tree and Identifier Trie-trees to accomplish the fast classification of packets in the multi-path parallel transmission mechanism. Besides, this method achieves the analysis and reconstruction of the packets with the multithreading scheme based on the CPU efficiency balancing. Experiments show that this method has high performance efficiency and a favorable success rate of data reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Research on Data Reconstruction Method Based on Identifier/Locator Separation Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000293730200001"}
