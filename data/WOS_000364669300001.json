The main purpose of designing these protocols is to improve the network lifetime and particularly the stability period of the underlying network. In MHEER, the node with the maximum energy in a region becomes cluster head (CH) of that region for that particular round (or cycle) of time and the number of the CHs in each round remains the same. Our techniques out perform the well-known existing routing protocols: LEACH, TEEN, and DEEC in terms of stability period and network lifetime. We also calculate the confidence interval of all our results which helps us to visualize the possible deviation of our graphs from the mean value. We also implement sink mobility on HEER and MHEER. We refer to them as HEER-SM and MHEER-SM. Simulation results show that HEER-SM and MHEER-SM yield better network lifetime and stability region as compared to the counterpart techniques. We have also carried out simulations with 500 and 1000 nodes in the same field dimensions besides 100 nodes. Simulations prove that the proposed schemes show the same behavior with 500 and 1000 nodes; that is, HEER and MHEER are scalable as well.", "paper_title": "Towards Network Lifetime Maximization: Sink Mobility Aware Multihop Scalable Hybrid Energy Efficient Protocols for Terrestrial WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000364669300001"}
