Web services technologies are considered as the main units for SOA, for both intra- and inter-enterprise communication. Nevertheless, SOA does not have information about the events that occurs in business processes, which represents the main characteristics of supply chain management. Taking this into account, this paper proposes a middleware-oriented integrated architecture with the use of semantic features (concretely with the use of Linked Data) as data provider to offer a brokerage service for the procurement of products in a Supply Chain Management (SCM). As main contributions, our system provides a hybrid architecture that combines features of both SOA and EDA between several others. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
