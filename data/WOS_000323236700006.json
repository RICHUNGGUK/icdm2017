The proposed procedure performs path delay testing and checks if the slack is larger than a threshold value using selectable delay embedded in basic elements (BE). If the slack is smaller than the threshold, a pair of BEs to be replaced, which maximizes the path slack, is identified. Experimental results with two application circuits mapped on a coarse-grained architecture show that for aging-induced delay degradation a small threshold slack, which is less than 1 ps in a test case, is enough to ensure the delay fault prediction.", "paper_title": "Field Slack Assessment for Predictive Fault Avoidance on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700006"}
