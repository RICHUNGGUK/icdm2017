In this paper, we present a novel framework for NDV retrieval, which explores the parallel power of two promising techniques: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and MapReduce. With the power of the proposed framework, various key algorithms in the field of computer vision, such as K-Means clustering, bag of features, inverted file index with hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency, are applied to NDV retrieval. Experimental results on the benchmark CC_WEB_VIDEO NDV dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly speed up processing huge amounts of video repositories.", "paper_title": "GPU-based MapReduce for large-scale near-duplicate video retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000364493700017"}
