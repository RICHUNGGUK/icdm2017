In this paper we present some variants of Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP), which is considered one of the state of the art texture descriptors for human action classification. The standard LBP-TOP operator is defined as a gray-scale invariant texture measure, derived from the standard Local Binary Patterns (LBP). It is obtained by calculating the LBP features from the xt and yt planes of a space-time volume. Our LBP-TOP variants combine the idea of LBP-TOP with Local Ternary Patterns (LTP). The encoding of LTP is used for the evaluation of the local gray-scale difference in the different planes of the space-time volume. Different histograms are concatenated to form the feature vector and a random subspace of linear support vector machines is used for classifying action using the Weizmann database of video images. To the best of our knowledge, our method offers the first set of classification experiments to obtain 100% accuracy using the 10-class Weizmann dataset. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
