A unique feature of DJH is a joint design for the optical layer monitoring plane and survivable routing, where monitoring trails (m-trails) are launched and can possibly reuse the spare capacity reserved for protection lightpaths (P-LPs). We demonstrate how the proposed scheme determines the working lightpath and the corresponding P-LP(s), along with the configuration of the alarm code table at each node for each newly arrived connection request, where the targeted all-optical restoration can be fully ensured. Extensive simulation is conducted to examine the proposed DJH scheme in terms of blocking probabilities and compare it with a couple of previously reported counterparts, namely a p-cycle-based dynamic routing scheme and a failure dependent protection-based survivable routing scheme without considering all-optical monitoring. We verify the proposed scheme and disclose insights on its performance behaviors.", "paper_title": "On Achieving All-Optical and Signaling-Free Failure Restoration Under Dynamic Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000328989300006"}
