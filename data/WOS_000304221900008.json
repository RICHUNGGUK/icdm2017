WSEs try to build query profiles of their users, in order to increase the accuracy of the results provided to users and also to fine-tune advertising. Profiling the query interests of users clearly encroaches on their privacy. There are several anti-profiling approaches in web search, among which those relying on peer-to-peer profile obfuscation stand out. In this paper, we analyze the multi-hop peer-to-peer profile obfuscation game, in which a peer forwards her query to a second peer, who may submit it on behalf of the first peer or just forward it to a third peer, and so on. We describe several privacy utility functions for peers (query-level entropy, category-level entropy, hierarchical variance, privacy for location-based queries) and a rational protocol in terms of a generic privacy utility function. It turns out that rational behavior leads peers to help each other. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
