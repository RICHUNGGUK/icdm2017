From recent results in Mathematical Fuzzy Logic and following [44], we develop a Fuzzy Description Logic based on the fuzzy logic of a finite BL-chain. The constructors of the languages presented in this paper correspond to the connectives of that logic (containing an involutive negation, Monteiro-Baaz delta and hedges). The paper addresses the hierarchy of fuzzy attributive languages; knowledge bases and their reductions; reasoning tasks; and complexity. Our results regarding decidability together with a summary of the known results related to computational complexity are of particular interest. In Appendix B we also provide axiomatizations for expansions of the logic of a finite BL-chain considered in the paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
