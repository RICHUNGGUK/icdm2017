It is shown here how the so-called Normalized Maximized Likelihood (nMDL) introduced in 1171 can be tailored to provide control of the detection performances in terms of probability of false alarm. Numerical experiments conducted on realistic simulated optical spectroscopy signals evidence that the nMDL approach outperforms standard information criteria in terms of model selection performances. Moreover, the ability to control false alarm rates with the proposed modified nMDL criterion is demonstrated on simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
