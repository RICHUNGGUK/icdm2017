We prove that there are no non-trivial 5-(v, k, 1) designs admitting a block-transitive group of automorphisms that is of affine type. Moreover, we show that the corresponding non-existence result holds for 4-(v, k, 1) designs, except possibly when the group is 1-D affine. Our approach involves a consideration of the finite 2-homogeneous affine permutation groups.", "paper_title": "Block-transitive designs in affine spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000276079800010"}
