Some important properties such as bond dissociation enthalpy, density, natural bond orbitals, thermodynamic parameters, molecular orbital energy and burning rate were then calculated. The simulation results revealed that these compounds exhibit excellent performance, with significant superiority over traditional oxidants found in propellants.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the thermodynamic and burning properties of oxygen-rich hydrazine derivatives-green and powerful oxidants for energetic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000319362500043"}
