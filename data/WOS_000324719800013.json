One is called Proximate Energy Optimal Servo (PEOS) and the other is called Energy-Optimal Model Predictive Control (EOMPC). The PEOS approach is based on the Proximate Time Optimal Servo (PTOS) control algorithm whose parameters are optimized in order to achieve energy efficient behavior. The EOMPC approach developed based on the Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control (TOMPC) approach achieves energy optimal performance by minimizing the energy losses in the object function. The two developed approaches are applied to a robot playing badminton and compared to two existing control approaches: the Proximate Time Optimal Servo (PTOS) and the Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control (TOMPC). The robot is still able to intercept most of the opponent shuttles on time, while a significant reduction of the energy consumption is demonstrated in both cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
