Up to now, structure-based investigations for identifying inhibitors of this enzyme have not explicitly accounted for active site flexibility. In the present study, by combining replica exchange molecular dynamics with network and cluster analyses, we identified reliable LDHA conformations for structure-based ligand design. The selected conformations were challenged and validated by retrospective virtual screening simulations.", "paper_title": "Collecting and Assessing Human Lactate Dehydrogenase-A Conformations for Structure-Based Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000327747200002"}
