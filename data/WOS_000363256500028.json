In particular, for each prime power q no smaller than the number of receivers, a linear solution over GF(q) can be efficiently constructed. In this paper, we reveal that a linear solution over a given finite field does not necessarily imply the existence of a linear solution over all larger finite fields. In particular, we prove by construction that: 1) for every omega >= 3, there is a multicast network with source outdegree omega linearly solvable over GF(7) but not over GF(8), and another multicast network linearly solvable over GF(16) but not over GF(17); 2) there is a multicast network linearly solvable over GF(5) but not over such GF(q) that q > 5 is a Mersenne prime plus 1, which can be extremely large; 3) a multicast network linearly solvable over GF(q(m1)) and over GF(q(m2)) is not necessarily linearly solvable over GF(q(m1+m2)); and 4) there exists a class of multicast networks with a set T of receivers such that the minimum field size q(min) for a linear solution over GF(q(min)) is lower bounded by Theta(root vertical bar T vertical bar), but not every larger field than GF(q(min)) suffices to yield a linear solution. The insight brought from this paper is that not only the field size but also the order of subgroups in the multiplicative group of a finite field affects the linear solvability of a multicast network.", "paper_title": "Multicast Network Coding and Field Sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500028"}
