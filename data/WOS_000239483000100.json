A relatively pure speech signal can be obtained by applying noise canceling algorithms on some signals from microphone array. For suppressing correlated and uncorrelated noises, the proposed method doesn't perform the same processing, but analyze the natures of the background noises by calculating the correlation between the noisy signals during silence intervals firstly. If the additive noises are correlated, relatively pure speech component is separated by blind source separation (BSS) method. Otherwise, this speech component is estimated by beamforming and maximum a posterior (MAP) algorithm. Then, a voice activity detection method based on entropy is employed to determine whether this relatively pure speech signal is active or not. Finally, this VAD result is used as reference to produce those of all array signals. Simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A robust VAD method for array signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000100"}
