The transformation seems to originate from a growing interest in bibliometric topics. This is evident from a longitudinal study (1990-2012) of the bibliometric coupling strength between Scientometrics and other LIS-core journals (including JASIST). The cause of this gradual transformation is discussed, and possible explanations are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Bibliometric Evolution: Is the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology Transforming Into a Specialty Journal?", "paper_id": "WOS:000353654600015"}
