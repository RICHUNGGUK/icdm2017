In 1965 Knuth ( J Algebra 2: 182 - 217, 1965) constructed a further three finite semifields which are also two-dimensional over a weak nucleus, given the same parameter set ( K, sigma, mu, eta). Moreover, in the same article, Knuth describes operations that allow one to obtain up to six semifields from a given semifield. We show how these operations in fact relate these four finite semifields, for a fixed parameter set, and yield at most five non-isotopic semifields out of a possible 24. These five semifields form two sets of semifields, one of which consists of at most two non-isotopic semifields related by Knuth operations and the other of which consists of at most three non-isotopic semifields.", "paper_title": "On the Hughes-Kleinfeld and Knuth's semifields two-dimensional over a weak nucleus", "paper_id": "WOS:000249298700009"}
