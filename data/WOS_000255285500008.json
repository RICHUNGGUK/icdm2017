We use a two-step approach first to globally assign grey values and determine colour ordering, then second, to locally enhance the greyscale to reproduce the original contrast. Our global mapping is image independent and incorporates the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch colour appearance effect for predicting differences between isoluminant colours. Our multiscale local contrast enhancement reintroduces lost discontinuities only in regions that insufficiently represent original chromatic contrast. All operations are restricted so that they preserve the overall image appearance, lightness range and differences, colour ordering, and spatial details, resulting in perceptually accurate achromatic reproductions of the colour original.", "paper_title": "Apparent greyscale: A simple and fast conversion to perceptually accurate images and video", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500008"}
