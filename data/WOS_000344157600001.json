This problem is often underconstrained even when internal network characteristics such as link delays are modeled as additive constants. While it is known that the network topology can play a role in determining the extent of identifiability, there is a lack in the fundamental understanding of being able to quantify it for a given network. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying additive link metrics in an arbitrary undirected network using measurement nodes and establishing paths/cycles between them. For a given placement of measurement nodes, we define and derive the \"link rank\" of the network-the maximum number of linearly independent cycles/paths that may be established between the measurement nodes. We achieve this in linear time. The link rank helps quantify the exact extent of identifiability in a network. We also develop a quadratic time algorithm to compute a set of cycles/paths that achieves the maximum rank.", "paper_title": "On the Maximum Number of Linearly Independent Cycles and Paths in a Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000344157600001"}
