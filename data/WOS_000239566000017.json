The system, guided by the user, analyzes patterns of repetition in the source geometry and then pastes the geometry while increasing or decreasing the number of repetitions using scaling and deformation, which is controlled by two freehand strokes called handles. The system has two main advantages over existing methods:the entire copy-paste operation is controlled by the user's stroke input and thus can be specified easily without explicitly adjusting the parameters, and splitting the shape information into source geometry and handles can not only significantly reduce the amount of data required but also quickly change a scene's appearance while keeping its structure consistent.", "paper_title": "Copy-paste synthesis of 3D geometry with repetitive patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000017"}
