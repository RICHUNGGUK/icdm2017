The proposed method is based on a special structured data matrix, the singular vectors of the matrix and a special basis of the NS which is generated by some of these vectors. It is observed that the estimators are consistent and work quite well in terms of biases and mean square errors. It is also observed that the method can be used to estimate accurately the frequencies of the evanescent component of texture.", "paper_title": "Noise subspace approach for frequency estimation of two-dimensional harmonics in zero-mean multiplicative and additive noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000007"}
