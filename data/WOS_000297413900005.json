Each order corresponds to the movement of one pallet, all pickups must be completed before the first delivery, and the container cannot be repacked once packed. In this paper we improve the previously proposed exact method of Lusby et al. (Int Trans Oper Res 17 (2010), 637-652) through an additional preprocessing technique that uses the longest common subsequence between the respective pickup and delivery problems. The results suggest an impressive improvement, and we report, for the first time, optimal solutions to several unsolved instances from the literature containing 18 customers. Instances with 28 customers are also shown to be solvable within a few percent of optimality. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
