This investigation was carried out under various recognition conditions of different sound pressure levels of ambient noise, for different recognition tasks, such as continuous speech recognition and spoken word recognition, and using different recognition systems, i.e., systems with and without adaptation of the acoustic models to ambient noise. Experimental results showed that accurate simulation was not always achieved when dry sources with neutral talking style were used, but it could be achieved if the dry sources that include the influence of the Lombard effect were used; the simulation in the latter case is accurate, irrespective of the recognition conditions.", "paper_title": "Influence of Lombard Effect: Accuracy Analysis of Simulation-Based Assessments of Noisy Speech Recognition Systems for Various Recognition Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300007"}
