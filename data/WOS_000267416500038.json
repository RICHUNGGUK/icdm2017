Design/methodology/approach - L(2)[0, 1] was considered as solution space and the solution was projected to the subspaces of L(2)[0, 1] with finite dimension so that basis elements of these subspaces were orthonormal. Findings - In, this process, solution of Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equation is found by solving the generated system of nonlinear equations. Originality/value - Comparing the method with others shows that this system has less computation. In fact, decreasing of computations result from the modification.", "paper_title": "A modification. for solving Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equation by using wavelet basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500038"}
