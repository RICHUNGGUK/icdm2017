It is used in many domains Such as: computer-aided design, robotics, spatial planning, mathematical morphology, and image processing. We propose a novel algorithm, named the Contributing Vertices-based Minkowski Sum (CVMS) algorithm for the computation of the Minkowski SLIM of convex polyhedra. The CVMS algorithm allows to easily obtain all the facets of the Minkowski SLIM polyhedron only by examining the contributing vertices-a concept we introduce in this work, for each input facet. We exploit the concept of contributing vertices to propose the Enhanced and Simplified Slope Diagram-based Minkowski SLIM (ESSDMS) algorithm, a slope diagram-based Minkowski sum algorithm sharing some common points with the approach proposed by Wu et al. [Wu Y, Shah J, Davidson J. Improvements to algorithms for computing the Minkowski sum of 3-polytopes. Comput Aided Des. 2003; 35(13): 1181-92]. The ESSDMS algorithm does not embed input polyhedra on the unit sphere and does not need to perform stereographic projections. Moreover, the use of contributing vertices brings up more simplifications and improves the overall performance. The implementations for the mentioned algorithms are straightforward, use exact number types, produce exact results, and are based on CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. More examples and results of the CVMS algorithm for several convex polyhedra can be found at http://liris.cnrs.fr/hichem.barki/mksum/CVMS-convex. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
