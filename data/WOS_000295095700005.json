This problem is known in literature as Crew Scheduling Problem and, in particular in public transportation, it is designated as Bus Driver Scheduling Problem. We propose a new mathematical formulation of a Bus Driver Scheduling Problem under special constraints imposed by Italian transportation rules. Unfortunately, this model can only be usefully applied to small or medium size problem instances. For large instances, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is proposed. Results are reported for a set of real-word problems and comparison is made with an exact method. Moreover, we report a comparison of the computational results obtained with our GRASP procedure with the results obtained by Huisman et al. (Transp. Sci. 39(4):491-502, 2005).", "paper_title": "A Bus Driver Scheduling Problem: a new mathematical model and a GRASP approximate solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000295095700005"}
