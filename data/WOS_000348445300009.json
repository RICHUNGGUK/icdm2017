In order to handle this problem, this paper proposes a novel compressive sensing (CS) and dictionary learning based depth map super-resolution (SR) method, which transforms a low resolution depth map to a high resolution depth map. Different from previous depth map SR methods, this algorithm uses a joint dictionary learning method with both low and high resolution depth maps, and this method also builds a sparse vector classification method which is used in depth map SR. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for depth map super-resolution.", "paper_title": "Depth map Super-Resolution based on joint dictionary learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000348445300009"}
