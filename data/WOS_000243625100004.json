This technique constitutes a conceptually simple search strategy, and it is based on evaluating each possible solution from a given finite search space. The results obtained by enumeration are impractical for most computer platforms and researchers, but they exhibit a great interest because they can be used to be compared against the values obtained by stochastic techniques. We analyze here the use of a grid computing system to cope with the limits of enumerative search. After evaluating the performance of the sequential algorithm, we present, first, a parallel algorithm targeted to multiprocessor systems. Then, we design a distributed version prepared to be executed on a federation of geographically distributed computers known as a computational grid. Our conclusion is that this kind of systems can provide to the community with a large and precise set of Pareto fronts that would be otherwise unknown.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective optimization using grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000243625100004"}
