We take the view of 'map generalization as extrusion of data into an additional dimension'. For 2D objects the resulting vario-scale representation is a 3D structure, while for 3D objects the result is a 4D structure. This paper provides insights in: (1) creating valid data for the cube and proof that this is always possible for the implemented 2D tGAP generalization operators (line simplification, merge and split/collapse), (2) obtaining a valid 2D polygonal map representation at arbitrary scale from the cube, (3) using the vario-scale structure to provide smooth zoom and progressive transfer between server and client, (4) exploring which other possibilities the cube brings for obtaining maps having non-homogenous scales over their domain (which we term mixed-scale maps), and (5) using the same principles also for higher dimensional data; illustrated with 3D input data represented in a 4D hypercube. The proposed new structure has very significant advantages over existing multiscale/multi-representation solutions (in addition to being truly vario-scale): (1) due to tight integration of space and scale, there is guaranteed consistency between scales, (2) it is relatively easy to implement smooth zoom, and (3) compact, object-oriented encoding is provided for a complete scale range.", "paper_title": "Vario-scale data structures supporting smooth zoom and progressive transfer of 2D and 3D data", "paper_id": "WOS:000337185000002"}
