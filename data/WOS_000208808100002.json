We describe a Complex Automata model for in-stent restenosis, coupling bulk flow, drug diffusion, and smooth muscle cell models, all operating on different time scales. Details of the single scale models and of the coupling interfaces are described, together with first simulation results, obtained with a dedicated software environment for Complex Automata simulations. Preliminary results show that the model can reproduce growth trends observed in experimental studies and facilitate testing of hypotheses concerning the interaction of key factors.
