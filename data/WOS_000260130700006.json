However, the reference design cannot efficiently utilize the bandwidth. This paper proposes an equal-spacing-based (equal-SP) design to address the problem. In the equal-SP design, which generalizes the reference design, each stream is scheduled with equal spacing, and different streams are scheduled with different spacings. The equal-SP design not only keeps all advantages of the reference design (i.e., it is simple, easy to implement, and can guarantee the delay requirement), but it can also utilize the bandwidth more efficiently while being compatible with the standard.", "paper_title": "An Equal-Spacing-Based Design for QoS Guarantee in IEEE 802.11e HCCA Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260130700006"}
