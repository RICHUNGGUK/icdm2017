Previous researches have revealed that the overlay routing can improve user-perceived performance. However, it may also generate traffic unintended by ISPs, incurring additional monetary cost. In addition, since ISPs and end users have their own objectives respectively regarding traffic routing, overlay routing must be operated considering both standpoints. In the present paper, we propose a method to reduce inter-ISP transit costs caused by overlay routing from the both standpoints of ISPs and end users. To determine the relationships among ASes, which are required for ISP cost-aware routing, we construct a method to estimate a transit cost of overlay-routed paths from end-to-end network performance values. Utilizing the metric, we propose a novel method that controls overlay routing from the both standpoints of ISPs and end users. Through extensive evaluations using measurement results from the actual network environments, we confirm that the advantage of the proposed method whereby we can reduce the transit cost in the overlay routing and can control the overlay routing according to the objectives of both ISPs and end users.", "paper_title": "A Method to Reduce Inter-ISP Transit Cost Caused by Overlay Routing Based on End-to-End Network Measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600013"}
