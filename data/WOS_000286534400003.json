The few security schemes proposed so far are based on classical cryptography. In contrast, the present paper develops a new security solution, based on quantum cryptography. The scheme developed here comes with the advantages quantum cryptography has over classical cryptography, namely, effectively unbreakable keys and therefore effectively unconditionally secure messages. Our security system ensures privacy of the measured data field in the presence of an intruder who listens to messages broadcast in the field.", "paper_title": "Quantum security in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286534400003"}
