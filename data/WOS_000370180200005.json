However, D2D communications that are not properly designed may generate interference with existing cellular networks. In this paper, we study resource allocation and power control to minimize the probability of an outage and maximize the overall network throughput. We investigate three power control-based schemes: the Partial Co-channel based Overlap Resource Power Control (PC.OVER), Fractional Frequency Reuse based Overlap Resource Power Control (FFR.OVER) and Fractional Frequency Reuse based Adaptive Power Control (FFR.APC) and also compare their performance. In PC.OVER, a certain portion of the total bandwidth is dedicated to the D2D. The FFR.OVER and FFR.APC schemes combine the FFR techniques and the power control mechanism. In FFR, the entire frequency band is partitioned into two parts, including a central and edge sub-bands. Macrocell users (mUEs) transmit using uniform power in the inner and outer regions of the cell, and in all three schemes, the D2D receivers (D2DRs) transmit with low power when more than one D2DRs share a resource block (RB) with the macrocells. For PC.OVER and FFR.OVER, the power of the D2DRs is reduced to its minimum, and for the FFR.APC scheme, the transmission power of the D2DRs is iteratively adjusted to satisfy the signal to interference ratio (SIR) threshold. The three schemes exhibit a significant improvement in the overall system capacity as well as in the probability of a user outage when compared to a conventional scheme.", "paper_title": "Spectrum Reuse Schemes with Power Control for Device-to-Device Communication in LTE-Advanced Cellular Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200005"}
