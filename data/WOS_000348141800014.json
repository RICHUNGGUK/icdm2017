In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design that jointly considers the transmission mode/relay node selection (MRS) with power allocation (PA) to optimize the system rate. We first formulate an optimization problem for a cellular system, where the same frequency channel can be reused in different cells. A low complexity heuristic MRS scheme is proposed on the basis of the link and interference conditions of the source and potential relay nodes. Given the transmission mode and relay node (if the relaying mode is chosen) of each link, the transmit power of the source and relay nodes can be solved by geometric programming. This method for MRS and PA can achieve a close-to-optimum performance, but implementing the PA requires heavy signalling exchanged among cells. To reduce the signalling overheads, we finally proposed a heuristic and distributed method for MRS and PA inspired by some asymptotic analysis. Numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the rate performance of the proposed methods.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Resource allocations in relay-assisted cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141800014"}
