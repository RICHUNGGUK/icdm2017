The study is motivated by the need to address increased confidentiality and privacy concerns that arise with the use of the Internet, while realizing the benefits of data sharing. In this study, we develop a research issues framework based on a survey of existing literature. The framework is used to identify OR/MS research opportunities in disclosure prevention, record-linkage, and in the assessment of the impact of data sharing. Addressing these issues could enable organizations to securely share data. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
