Ranking model construction has been the focus of both the fields of information retrieval and machine learning, and learning to rank in particular has attracted much interest. Many ranking models have been proposed, for example, RankSVM is a state-of-the-art method for learning to rank and has been empirically demonstrated to be effective. However, most of the proposed methods do not consider about the significant differences between queries, only resort to a single function in ranking. In this paper, we present a novel ranking model named QoRank, which performs the learning task dependent on queries. We also propose a LSE (least-squares estimation) -based weighted method to aggregate the ranking lists produced by base decision functions as the final ranking. Comparison of QoRank with other ranking techniques is conducted, and several evaluation criteria are employed to evaluate its performance. Experimental results on the LETOR OHSUMED data set show that QoRank strikes a good balance of accuracy and complexity, and outperforms the baseline methods.
