We identified 269 transdermal peptides by the phage display technique and use them as the positive controls to develop and test machine learning models. Combinations of three descriptors with neural network architectures, the number of latent variables and the kernel functions are tried in training to make appropriate predictions. The capacity of models is evaluated by means of statistical indicators including sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC score). In the ROC score-based comparison, three methods proved capable of providing a reasonable prediction of transdermal peptide. The best result is obtained by SVM model with a radial basis function and VHSE descriptors. The results indicate that it is possible to discriminate between transdermal peptides and random sequences using our models. We anticipate that our models will be applicable to prediction of transdermal peptide for large peptide database for facilitating efficient transdermal drug delivery through intact skin.", "paper_title": "Machine learning study for the prediction of transdermal peptide", "paper_id": "WOS:000290576100005"}
