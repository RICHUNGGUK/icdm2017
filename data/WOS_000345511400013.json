In particular, for finite-alphabet memoryless channels, the exact random coding exponent of P-c is derived as a function of the total coding rate R-1 and the rate of each subcode R-2. Two different representations are given for this function and its basic properties are provided. We also characterize the region of pairs of rates (R-1, R-2) of full security in the sense of the random coding exponent of P-c, in other words, the region where the exponent of this achievability scheme is the same as that of blind guessing at the eavesdropper side. Finally, an analogous derivation of the correct-decoding exponent is outlined for the case of the Gaussian channel.", "paper_title": "Exact Correct-Decoding Exponent of the Wiretap Channel Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400013"}
