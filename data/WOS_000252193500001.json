This contention and collisions lead to low throughput and high power consumption. Although the stations can enter sleep mode, however they are forced to keep awake for full Beacon interval period if there are frames buffered for them. This long awake period leads to high power consumption. We have devised improved mechanisms that facilitate transmissions with reduced contention. We have defined a reservation period in which the senders reserve the channel by announcing the data frames to be transmitted to the Power Save (PS) stations. These announced frames are then transmitted collision-free in the following transmission period, leading to high throughput. The PS stations keep awake for short duration to receive these frames at predetermined periods, leading to high power saving. The mechanisms involve only software changes to the existing 802.11 protocol and can be implemented on the existing 802.11 WLAN cards. The average power consumption in our mechanisms is only 1/6th of the power consumed in the 802.11b protocol, with the stations consuming 84% lesser power. Our maximum throughput improved to 25% higher than the throughput of the 802.11b protocol. Our work also shows significant performance improvement over some related work in this area. Under conditions of optimal throughput, our improved protocol consumes 55% to 70% lesser power than SPAN protocol and has 3 to 5.8 times better Throughput/Energy consumption characteristics than DPSM protocol.", "paper_title": "A high throughput and low power ad-hoc wireless LAN protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000252193500001"}
