Let a, b be two distinct letters. The characteristic word f(alpha) of alpha is an infinite word whose nth letter is a (resp., b) if [(n + 1)alpha] - [n alpha] = 0 (resp., 1), n >= 1. For a factor omega of f(alpha), the location of omega is the set of all positions in f(alpha) at which omega occurs. The locations of all factors of f(alpha) have been determined by Chuan and Ho recently. In this paper, we obtain other formulas for the locations of factors of f(alpha), using the generalized Zeckendorf representation of nonnegative integers. These results are equivalent to the known results obtained by Chuan and Ho in the case alpha = 3-root 5/2. We compute the longest common prefix of any two suffixes of f(alpha) and compute the order number and location index of each factor of f(alpha), given its length and a position f(alpha) at which it begins.
