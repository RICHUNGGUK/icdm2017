These features, plus the ability to provide wireless broadband connectivity at a comparatively low cost, make WMNs a promising technology for a wide range of applications. While discussing the suitability of WMN technology for public safety and crisis management communication, this article highlights its strengths and limitations and points to current and future research in this context.", "paper_title": "Wireless mesh networks for public safety and crisis management applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000252175300005"}
