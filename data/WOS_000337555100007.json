In this paper, we regard feature selection as an efficiency evaluation process with multiple evaluation indices, and propose a novel feature selection framework based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The most significant advantages of this framework are that it can make a trade-off among several feature properties or evaluation criteria and evaluate features from a perspective of \"efficient frontier\" without parameter setting. We then propose a simple feature selection method based on the framework to effectively search \"efficient\" features with high class-relevance and low conditional independence. Super-efficiency DEA is employed in our method to fully rank features according to their efficiency scores. Experimental results for twelve well-known datasets indicate that proposed method is effective and outperforms several representative feature selection methods in most cases. The results also show the feasibility of proposed DEA-based feature selection framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
