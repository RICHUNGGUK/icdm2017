They are not exempt to have errors, which can be introduced inadventently during their development phase. Determining if a rule set is free of errors, involves to verify its correcteness. In this work, we first extend the error definitions given for production rules, in order to consider all the elements of ECA rules. After, we propose a method, based on CCPN, to detect them. Unlike other works, our approach is able to detect errors independently of initial marking.", "paper_title": "Knowledge verification of active rule-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400084"}
