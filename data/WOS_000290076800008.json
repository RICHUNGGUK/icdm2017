Therefore, when the within-class variances of two classes are different, the threshold biases toward the class with larger variance. As a result, partial pixels belonging to this class will be mis-classified into the other class with smaller variance. To address this problem and based on the analysis of Otsu threshold, this paper proposes an improved Otsu algorithm that constrains the search range of gray levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of new algorithm compared with Otsu method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
