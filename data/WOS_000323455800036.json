While previous works have mostly used tree structures, our algorithm constructs multiple random directed Hamiltonian cycles and disseminates content over the superposed graph of the cycles. We show that it is possible to achieve the maximum streaming capacity even when each peer only transmits to and receives from Theta (1) neighbors. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves the streaming delay of Theta (log N) when the streaming rate is less than (1 - 1/K) of the maximum capacity for any fixed constant K >= 2, where N denotes the number of peers in the network. The key theoretical contribution is to characterize the distance between peers in a graph formed by the superposition of directed random Hamiltonian cycles, in which edges from one of the cycles may be dropped at random. We use Doob martingales and graph expansion ideas to characterize this distance as a function of N, with high probability.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Streaming Over Multiple Random Hamiltonian Cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800036"}
