However, the actual architecture of a PDS is still not well defined. This paper proposes a PDS architecture based on a particular interpretation of the concept of stigmergy, where cooperation between production actors is achieved thanks to attributes (informational pheromones) attached to products. This stigmergic design pattern is presented. Agent-oriented components which implement it are presented, are firstly applied to a laboratory platform, and secondly on an industrial test-case.", "paper_title": "Another interpretation of stigmergy for product-driven systems architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600045"}
