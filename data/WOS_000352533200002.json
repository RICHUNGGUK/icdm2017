Multi-channel transmit arrays, driven in parallel, have been developed to increase the transmit field (B-1(+)) uniformity in this wavelength regime. However, the closely packed array elements interact through mutual coupling. This paper expands on the ability of a distributed planar filter (the \"magnetic wall\") to decouple individual elements in an entire array. A transmit RF coil suitable for neuroimaging at 7T was constructed. The transmit coil, composed of 10 individual surface coil elements, was decoupled with magnetic walls. A separate receive coil array was used for signal reception. The hardware and imaging performance of the transmit coil was validated with electromagnetic simulation, bench-top measurements, and in vivo MRI experiments. Analysis and measurements confirmed that the magnetic wall decoupling method provides high isolation between transmit channels, while minimally affecting the B-1(+) field profiles. Electromagnetic simulations confirmed that the decoupling method did not correlate to local specific absorption rate (SAR) \"hot spots\" or increase local-to-global SAR fractions in comparison to previously reported 7T multi-channel transmit arrays employing different decoupling methods.", "paper_title": "Design of a Parallel Transmit Head Coil at 7T With Magnetic Wall Distributed Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000352533200002"}
