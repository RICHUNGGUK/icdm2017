These include the Choquet integral, the Shilkret integral and the Sugeno integral, among others. Recently, a bipolar Choquet integral was proposed for cases in which the underlying scale is bipolar. In this paper we propose a bipolar Shilkret integral and a bipolar Sugeno integral. Moreover, we provide an axiomatic characterization of all three bipolar fuzzy integrals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
