Results: We have developed an algorithm that classifies all observed units of ASTI into an extendable set of distinct types (e.g. cassette type) by converting a collection of alignments between a genomic DNA sequence and cDNA sequences into binary description. This description system can uniquely and compactly encode not only typical patterns but also any rare patterns that are usually collectively assigned to 'others.' More than 150 distinct ASTI types were found when this system was applied to genome-wide detection of ASTI units in human and five other eukaryotes.", "paper_title": "Automated classification of alternative splicing and transcriptional initiation and construction of visual database of classified patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300010"}
