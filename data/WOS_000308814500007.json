The ME engine supports both normalized partial distortion search and adaptive search window adjustment. The former can reduce the computational complexity of ME to save power and area; the latter can avoid unnecessary accessing the external memory to lower the data bandwidth. The proposed engine has been implemented with UMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results show that, compared with traditional engines, the engine can achieve significant improvements of the hardware efficiency and the power efficiency respectively with a little throughput compromise.", "paper_title": "Architecture design of low-power motion estimation based on DHS-NPDS for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500007"}
