However, there is a short of schemes to develop and share design components effectively. Therefore, this paper presents a tool that generates a code with compatibility for design pattern to maximize reusability of design component. Presented tool constructs a library that stores explanation information of pattern and structure information of abstract type. Pattern structure information go through the process of instantiation which makes them fit for specific application. Instantiated structure information is generated as a XMI code through code generation template. XMI is supported as a transformed format from most case tools, so it is sure for compatibility.", "paper_title": "A study on automatic code generation tool from design patterns based on the XMI", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800093"}
