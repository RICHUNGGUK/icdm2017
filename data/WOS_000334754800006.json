Basing on the Taylor series expansion of the desired frequency response, a prefilter-subfilter cascaded structure can be derived. For the 1-D differentiating prefilters and the 2-D quadrantally symmetric subfilters, they can be designed simply by the least-squares method. Design examples show that the required number of independent coefficients of the proposed system is much less than that of the existing structure while the performance of the designed VFD 2-D filters is still better under the cost of larger delays.", "paper_title": "A new structure and design method for variable fractional-delay 2-D FIR digital filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000334754800006"}
