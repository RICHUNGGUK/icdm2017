The simplicity of the proof is due to the use of a stronger version of no violation of the causality principle. The proof is also extended to higher-dimensional Hilbert space, but for a special ensemble of states.", "paper_title": "A new proof of nonexistence of probabilistic quantum cloning machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175600011"}
