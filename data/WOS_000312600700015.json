In a recent work [J. ACM, 55 (2008), article 1], Yekhanin constructs a 3-query LDC with subexponential length. However, this construction requires a conjecture that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. In this paper, we give the first unconditional constant query LDC construction with subexponential codeword length. In addition, our construction reduces codeword length.", "paper_title": "3-QUERY LOCALLY DECODABLE CODES OF SUBEXPONENTIAL LENGTH", "paper_id": "WOS:000312600700015"}
