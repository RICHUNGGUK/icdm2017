They may enter and leave the sensing area at various speed and directions. They may even stop vocalizing at any time. The standard solution divides this problem into two steps: estimating the number of sources, followed by tracking their geo-kinematic states. Instead, we propose using the random set theory to jointly estimate both the number of sources and their geo-kinematic states. The random set theory is a mathematical framework that gives a complete picture of the joint estimation problem. With this framework, one can analytically develop a tracking system that is robust against node failures or dynamic multiple source scenario. To cover the common wireless sensing deployment strategy, we investigate two topologies: a uniform grid, and a distributed sub-array. With each topology, we validate the proposed tracking system solution with simulations. For the distributed sub-array topology, we use results from a controlled field experiment and found this approach to be both practical and robust.", "paper_title": "Tracking of Acoustic Sources Using Random Set Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100018"}
