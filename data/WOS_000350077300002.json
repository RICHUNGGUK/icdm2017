We consider four models: two concrete (Grzegorczyk-Lacombe and tracking computability), one abstract (approximability by a While program with \"countable choice\") and a new hybrid model: multipolynomial approximability. We show that these four models are equivalent, under the two assumptions: (1) the domain of f is the union of an effective exhaustion, i.e. a sequence of \"stages\", each of which is a finite union of disjoint rational open intervals, and (2) f is effectively locally uniformly continuous w.r.t. this exhaustion. These assumptions seem to hold for all unary elementary functions of real analysis, many of which are, of course, partial. We make a conjecture with regard to this. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
