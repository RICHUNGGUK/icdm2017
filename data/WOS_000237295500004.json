It involves three key technologies: Ubiquitous Computing, Ubiquitous Communications and Natural Interfaces. With the increase in context aware applications it is important to keep these technologies in mind. In this paper we present a context aware application in a conference site based on the identification process using RFID. Furthermore the highlights of this proposal are based on the \"ws\" concepts. Three environments are modelled applying the \"who\" to the \"when\" and \"where\" to reach the \"what\". In this sense certain services are offered to the conference attendees, some of which are characteristics of this technology and others are the result of a context aware application, the visualization services named \"Mosaics of Information\".", "paper_title": "Visualization services in a conference context: An approach by RFID technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295500004"}
