VM is one of the prominent approaches for offloading computational load to cloud server nodes. A challenging aspect of such frameworks is the additional computing resources utilization in the deployment and management of VM on Smartphone. The deployment of Virtual Machine (VM) requires computing resources for VM creation and configuration. The management of VM includes computing resources utilization in the monitoring of VM in entire lifecycle and physical resources management for VM on Smartphone. The objective of this work is to ensure that VM deployment and management requires additional computing resources on mobile device for application offloading. This paper analyzes the impact of VM deployment and management on the execution time of application in different experiments. We investigate VM deployment and management for application processing in simulation environment by using CloudSim, which is a simulation toolkit that provides an extensible simulation framework to model the simulation of VM deployment and management for application processing in cloud-computing infrastructure. VM deployment and management in application processing is evaluated by analyzing VM deployment, the execution time of applications and total execution time of the simulation. The analysis concludes that VM deployment and management require additional resources on the computing host. Therefore, VM deployment is a heavyweight approach for process offloading on smart mobile devices.", "paper_title": "A study on virtual machine deployment for application outsourcing in mobile cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000315162400020"}
