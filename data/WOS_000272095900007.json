In this paper, he established key dimensions of usability as well as approaches to integrating the testing of these dimensions, within the whole process of setting requirements. Essentially he argued for usability design as part of the system design process. This commentary describes the context of Professor Shackel's paper and reviews the influential ideas that appear in much subsequent work. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
