Consequently, a major challenge which arises in implementing the spectral/hp element methods is to design algorithms that perform efficiently for both low- and high-order spectral/hp discretisations, as well as discretisations in the intermediate regime. In this paper, we explain how the judicious use of different implementation strategies can be employed to achieve high efficiency across a wide range of polynomial orders. Furthermore, based upon this efficient implementation, we analyse which spectral/hp discretisation (which specific combination of mesh-size h and polynomial order P) minimises the computational cost to solve an elliptic problem up to a predefined level of accuracy. We investigate this question for a set of both smooth and non-smooth problems. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
