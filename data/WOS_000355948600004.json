Patent data for the top 100 assignees in three fields, \"Computer Hardware & Software\", \"Motors, Engines & Parts\", and \"Drugs & Medical\", were retrieved from USPTO for further analysis. The results reveal that traces are indeed valid and useful indicators for measuring technological performance and providing detailed technical information about assignees and the industry. In addition, we investigate the relationship between traces and three other indicators: patent citation counts, Current Impact Index and patent h-index. In comparison with the three other indicators, traces demonstrate unique advantages and can be a good complement to patent citation analysis.", "paper_title": "Measuring technological performance of assignees using trace metrics in three fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000355948600004"}
