Learning Objects Pool (LOP) built around the \"stock exchange\" metaphor, brings a new concept of Learning Objects Repositories pushing users motivation to produce good LOs as well as increasing the cooperation between users, either by submitting suggestions and comments or rating existing LOs. To achieve such high level of motivation and interest some kind of healthy competition is promoted, assigning credits to users and setting a value cost for each LO. This credit-based system rewards users that collaborate by creating LOs or by adding valuable information. It consequently increases the value of the most popular LOs, and also allows the creation of users and LOs rankings. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LOP system and, in particular, describes some application scenarios where, through configuration and parameterization we show the LOP's high levels of versatility.", "paper_title": "Application Scenarios for the Learning Objects Pool", "paper_id": "WOS:000269281800004"}
