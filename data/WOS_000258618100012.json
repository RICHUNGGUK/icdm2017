For each matching pursuit (MP) stage a different quantizer is used based on the probability distribution of MP coefficients. The quantizers; are optimized for a given rate budget constraint. Additionally, our proposed adaptive quantization scheme finds the optimal quantizers for each stage based on the already encoded inner product coefficients. Experimental results show that our proposed adaptive quantization scheme outperforms existing quantization methods used in matching pursuit image coding.", "paper_title": "Adaptive rate-distortion optimal in-loop quantization for matching pursuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100012"}
