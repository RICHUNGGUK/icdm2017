The model proposed in this paper is universal. A set of sufficient conditions ensuring global convergence and globally exponential convergence for the Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying and distributed delays are given. Most of the existing models and global stability results for Cohen-Grossberg neural networks, Hopfield neural networks and cellular neural networks can be obtained from the theorems given in this paper.", "paper_title": "Global asymptotical stability of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000029"}
