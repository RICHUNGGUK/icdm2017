Inspired by the successful application of KFA (Kernel Function Approximation) in classification problems, an approach of KFA-based normal condition domain description is proposed for outlier detection. By selecting the feature samples of normal condition, the boundary of normal condition can be determined. The outside of this normal domain is considered as the field of outlier. Experiment results indicated that this method can be effectively and successfully applied to gear crack diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Gear crack detection using kernel function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000059"}
