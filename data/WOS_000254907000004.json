All resources considered are renewable. The objective is to determine a mode and a start time for each activity so that all constraints are obeyed and the project duration is minimized. Project scheduling of this type occurs in many fields, for instance, construction industries. The proposed model has been inspired by the rectangle packing problems. In spite of the fact that it needs a feasible solution to start for conventional models, the new model has no need for a feasible solution to start. Computational results with a set of 60 test problems have been reported and the efficiency of the proposed model has been analyzed.", "paper_title": "A mathematical model for the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem with mode dependent time lags", "paper_id": "WOS:000254907000004"}
