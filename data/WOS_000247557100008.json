Researchers now-frequently exercise models formulated with sophisticated computer analyses to supplement empirically generated results and conduct extensive what-if exploratory studies for information formerly available solely from costly and time-consuming physical testing. Our research team is developing a modeling and analysis capability that features a scientific visualization toolkit called NYSCEDII CRS visualization module (NCVM). NCVM post-processes conventional crash simulation imagery, enabling modelers to visualize aspects of both the digital model and the sled-test simulation in an immersive visual environment. This paper describes NCVMs design and development in detail and illustrates its application to a series of sled tests conducted with a recent-production child restraint system and dummy occupant.", "paper_title": "Integration of scientific visualization with physical and digital modeling for improved child restraint system safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000247557100008"}
