Those sequences have a very simple structure, i.e., their trace representation has two trace monomial terms. In this paper, we present a proof for the conjecture. The mathematical tools employed are the second-order multiplexing decimation-Hadamard transform, Stickelberger's theorem, the Teichmuller character, and combinatorial techniques for enumerating the Hamming weights of ternary numbers. As a by-product, we also prove that the ternary sequences conjectured by Lin are Hadamard equivalent to ternary m-sequences.", "paper_title": "The Proof of Lin's Conjecture via the Decimation-Hadamard Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000340273700040"}
