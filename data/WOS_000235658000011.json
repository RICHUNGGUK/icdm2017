The collected data must be transmitted to the base station for further processing. Since network consists of sensors with limited battery energy, the method for data gathering and routing must be energy efficient in order to prolong the lifetime of network. LEACH and HEED are two of elegant energy efficient protocol to maximize the lifetime of sensor network. In this paper, we present CoDEED, a distributed energy efficient protocol. CoDEED clusters sensor nodes into groups and builds routing tree among cluster heads in which only root node communicates with the station directly. In addition, CoDEED introduces the idea of area coverage to reduce the number of work nodes within cluster in order to prolong network lifetime. Simulation results show that CoDEED performs better than LEACH and HEED.", "paper_title": "Distributed energy efficient data gathering with intra-cluster coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000011"}
