This software uses the SIMULINK library of MATLAB, which has proven to be an excellent choice in order to implement and solve the dynamic equations involved. The application allows for the representation of the behavior of a dynamic system analyzed through the Bond Graph theory in order to understand the dynamic equations and the physical phenomena involved. Based on block diagram of SIMULINK, the different \"bonds\" of Bond Graph can be integrated as SIMULINK blocks in order to generate the dynamic model. A few simple models are analyzed through this application. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
