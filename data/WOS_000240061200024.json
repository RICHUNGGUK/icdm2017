PEL consists in defining a class of minimal models, called partial equilibrium (p-equilibrium), inside a non-classical logic called HT2. In [4] it was shown that, on normal logic programs, p-equilibrium models coincide with Przymusinki's partial stable (p-stable) models. This paper begins showing that this coincidence still holds for the more general class of disjunctive programs, so that PEL can be seen as a way to extend WFS and p-stable semantics to arbitrary propositional theories. We also study here the problem of strong equivalence for various subclasses of p-equilibrium models, investigate transformation rules and nonmonotonic inference, and consider a reduction of PEL to equilibrium logic. In addition we examine the behaviour of PEL on nested logic programs and its complexity in the general case.", "paper_title": "Analysing and extending well-founded and partial stable semantics using partial equilibrium logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000240061200024"}
