We illustrate our deontic logic with a new formal analysis of the Prisoner's Dilemma, thereby showing that games can be studied fruitfully with our deontic logic. Finally, we prove a characterization theorem on conflicting obligations.", "paper_title": "Conflicting obligations in multi-agent deontic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626400015"}
