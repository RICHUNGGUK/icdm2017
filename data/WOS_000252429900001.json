Both packages are available on CRAN. An overview of ade4TkGUI is presented, and the pros and cons of this approach are discussed. We conclude that command line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI) are complementary. ade4TkGUI can be valuable for biologists and particularly for ecologists who are often occasional users of R. It can spare them having to acquire an in-depth knowledge of R, and it can help first time users in a first approach.", "paper_title": "Interactive multivariate data analysis in R with the ade4 and ade4TkGUI packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000252429900001"}
