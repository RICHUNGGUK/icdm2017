Existing approaches calculate the edge strength of a pixel locally, based on the variation in intensity between this pixel and its neighbors. Thus, they often fail to detect the edges of objects embedded in background clutter or objects which appear in only some of the bands. We propose SEDMI, a method that aims to overcome this problem by considering the salient properties of edges in an image. Based on the observation that edges are rare events in the image, we recast the problem of edge detection into the problem of detecting events that have a small probability in a newly defined feature space. The feature space is constructed by the spatial gradient magnitude in all spectral channels. As edges are often confined to small, isolated clusters in this feature space, the edge strength of a pixel, or the confidence value that this pixel is an event with a small probability, can be calculated based on the size of the cluster to which it belongs. Experimental results on a number of multispectral data sets and a comparison with other methods demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in detecting objects embedded in background clutter or appearing only in a few bands.
