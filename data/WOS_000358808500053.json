In order to ameliorate the existing results in the literature, a fuzzy observer-based output feedback controller, which relies on multi-samples normalized fuzzy weighting functions, is developed for relaxing the design conditions of observer-based output feedback control. Moreover, thanks to the special form of the developed observer-based output feedback controller, it is shown that all the designed parameters can be solved via a set of strict linear matrix inequalities, i.e., the drawback induced by the usual two-step method is resolved by means of a compromising way. Finally, the benefit of the proposed result is validated by using some numerical experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
