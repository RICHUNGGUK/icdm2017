While the majority of current social media research deals with active user analysis, there is very little work in understanding the dynamics of passive consumers and their influence. Our global scale Internet measurement of user access patterns of a diverse set of Internet media services indicates conclusively that majority of consumers are passive. In this paper, we develop a spatio-temporal mathematical model and the corresponding stochastic analysis to understand the passive consumer dynamics. Both discrete and continuous time analysis are presented. We also show how the analysis can be used to identify spatial points of influence, i.e., spatial locations that have maximum expertise or influence on a topic. The analysis takes into account, the initial level of consumption at each spatial location and the influence of different passive consumers at different geographic locations on each other. The effect of information noise is taken into account to derive fundamental limits of passive information consumption. Theoretical results are verified using real Internet measurement data. The large scale data have been made available for other researchers.", "paper_title": "Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Passive Consumption in Internet Media", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245300019"}
