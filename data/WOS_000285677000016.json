With the help of redundancy, the manipulator is able to approximate a secondary task while completing the main task. However, the success of the redundancy resolution relies on a proper choice of weights, that plays an important role in balancing the different components of the secondary task. In order to ensure the fulfillment of both the main and secondary tasks, the weights have to be tuned for each given manipulator-task. In this paper, a self-adaptation system is presented in replacement of the low-effective manual tuning of weights. The self-adaptation system is integrated into the twist decomposition algorithms, and is successfully applied to the examples of joint-limits and singularity avoidances as secondary task.
