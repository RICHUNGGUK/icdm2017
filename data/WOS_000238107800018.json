In contrast, cooperative processes emphasize the sharing of artefact, and its gradual evolution toward the final product, under the cooperative and concurrent activities of all the involved actors. This paper contrasts workflow and cooperative processes and shows that they are more complementary than conflicting and that, provided some extensions, both approaches can fit into a single tool and formalism. The paper presents Celine, a concurrent engineering tool that allows also to define and support classic workflows and software processes. We claim that the availability of both classes of features allows for the modelling and support of very flexible processes, closer to software engineering reality.", "paper_title": "Workflows and cooperative processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107800018"}
