The set of spheres associated to an ultrametric space has a tree structure that reflects a hierarchy on the set of equivalences associated to that space. We show that every ultrametric defined on a finite space is a linear combination of binary ultrametric and we introduce the notion of ultrametricity for dissimilarities, which has applications in many data mining problems.", "paper_title": "Several Remarks on Dissimilarities and Ultrametrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000361464800007"}
