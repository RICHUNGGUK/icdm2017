From the different methods and paradigms proposed to assess semantic similarity, ontology-based measures and, more specifically, those based on quantifying the Information Content (IC) of concepts are the most widespread solutions due to their high accuracy. However, these measures were designed to exploit a single ontology. They thus cannot be leveraged in many contexts in which multiple knowledge bases are considered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to achieve accurate IC-based similarity assessments for concept pairs spread throughout several ontologies. Based on Information Theory, our method defines a strategy to accurately measure the degree of commonality between concepts belonging to different ontologies this is the cornerstone for estimating their semantic similarity. Our approach therefore enables classic IC-based measures to be directly applied in a multiple ontology setting. An empirical evaluation, based on well-established benchmarks and ontologies related to the biomedical domain, illustrates the accuracy of our approach, and demonstrates that similarity estimations provided by our approach are significantly more correlated with human ratings of similarity than those obtained via related works.
