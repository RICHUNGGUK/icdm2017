The functions being approximated belong to weighted tensor product spaces with arbitrary weights gamma(u). We provide complexity upper bounds and sufficient conditions for polynomial and weak tractabilities expressed in terms of the properties of the weights gamma(u) and the complexity of the corresponding univariate approximation problem. These tractability conditions are also necessary for important types of weights including product weights. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
