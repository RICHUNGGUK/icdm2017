In this paper, we address the scheduling problem for a uniprocessor platform that is powered by a renewable energy storage unit and uses a recharging system such as photovoltaic cells. First, we describe our model where two constraints need to be studied: energy and deadlines. Since executing tasks require a certain amount of energy, classical task scheduling like earliest deadline is no longer convenient. We present an on-line scheduling scheme, called earliest deadline with energy guarantee (EDeg), that jointly accounts for characteristics of the energy source, capacity of the energy storage as well as energy consumption of the tasks, and time. In order to demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm, we evaluate it by means of simulation. We show that EDeg outperforms energy non-clairvoyant algorithms in terms of both deadline miss rate and size of the energy storage unit. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
