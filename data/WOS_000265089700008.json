The T-S fuzzy model is first applied to represent the nonlinear uncertain electrohydraulic suspension. Then, a fuzzy state feedback controller is designed for the obtained T-S fuzzy model with optimized H(infinity) performance for ride comfort by using the parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. The sufficient conditions for the existence of such a controller are derived in terms of linear matrix. inequalities (LMIs). Numerical simulations on a full-car suspension model are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained results show that the designed controller can achieve good suspension performance despite the existence of nonlinear actuator dynamics, sprung mass variation, and control input constraints.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Uncertain Electrohydraulic Active Suspensions With Input Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700008"}
