This work explores the existence of polynomial kernels for various path and cycle problems, by considering nonstandard parameterizations. We show polynomial kernels when the parameters are a given vertex cover, a modulator to a cluster graph, or a (promised) max leaf number. We obtain lower bounds via cross-composition, e.g., for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and related problems when parameterized by a modulator to an outerplanar graph. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
