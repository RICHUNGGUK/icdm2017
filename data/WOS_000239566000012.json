Users can input an important area where high accuracy is required, such as an affected area. The input area can be reflected as meshes with high level of details. By utilizing display tablet interfaces, surgeons are able to draw incision lines or boundaries between organs on an on-screen 3D model, just like they draw lines on paper in surgical planning procedures. Input lines can be reflected as boundaries between patches on free-form surfaces. Practical surgical simulators are also presented to evaluate the efficiency of our framework.", "paper_title": "Feature-preserving, accuracy-controllable freeform surfaces for web-based surgical simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000012"}
