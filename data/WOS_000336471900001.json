The algorithm solves a sequence of epsilon-constraint problems with a branch-and-bound algorithm to find a subset of non-dominated points that represents the set of all non-dominated points well in the sense of coverage or uniformity. At each iteration of the algorithm, one non-dominated point, determined by solving one epsilon-constraint problem, is added to the representation until it is guaranteed that the representation has the desired quality. Computational experiments on different problem types show the efficacy of the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
