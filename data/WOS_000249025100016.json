In the 2004 Shannon Lecture, McEliece presented an expression for the number of stopping sets of size three for a full-rank parity-check matrix of the Hamming code. In this correspondence, we derive an expression for the number of stopping sets of any given size for the same parity-check matrix.", "paper_title": "Complete enumeration of stopping sets of full-rank parity-check matrices of hamming codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100016"}
