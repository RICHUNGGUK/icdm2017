In this problem, the face images in the database and the query images captured on spot are acquired under quite different conditions or even using different equipments. Conventional approaches either treat the samples in a uniform model or introduce an intermediate conversion stage, both of which would lead to severe performance degradation due to the great discrepancies between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Common Discriminant Feature Extraction specially tailored to the inter-modality problem. In the algorithm, two transforms are simultaneously learned to transform the samples in both modalities respectively to the common feature space. We formulate the learning objective by incorporating both the empirical discriminative power and the local smoothness of the feature transformation. By explicitly controlling the model complexity through the smoothness constraint, we can effectively reduce the risk of overfitting and enhance the generalization capability. Furthermore, to cope with the nongaussian distribution and diverse variations in the sample space, we develop two nonlinear extensions of the algorithm: one is based on kernelization, while the other is a multi-mode framework. These extensions substantially improve the recognition performance in complex situation. Extensive experiments are conducted to test our algorithms in two application scenarios: optical image-infrared image recognition and photo-sketch recognition. Our algorithms show excellent performance in the experiments.", "paper_title": "Inter-modality face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400002"}
