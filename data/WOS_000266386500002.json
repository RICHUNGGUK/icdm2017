While this problem cannot be solved in an asynchronous system prone to t process crashes when t >= k, it can always be solved in a synchronous system; [t/k] + 1 is then a lower bound on the number of rounds (consecutive communication steps) for the non-faulty processes to decide. The condition-based approach has been introduced in the consensus context. Its aim was to both circumvent the consensus impossibility in asynchronous systems, and allow for more efficient consensus algorithms in synchronous systems. This paper addresses the condition-based approach in the context of the k-set agreement problem. It has two main contributions. The first is the definition of a frame work that allows defining conditions suited to the l-set agreement problem and the second is a generic synchronous k-set agreement algorithm based on conditions.", "paper_title": "Conditions for Set Agreement with an Application to Synchronous Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000266386500002"}
