Recent proposals attempt to improve DoS resistance by implementing a trade-off between the resources required for the potential victim(s) with the resources used by a prospective attacker. Such improvements have been proposed for the Internet Key Exchange (IKE), the just Fast Keying (JFK) key agreement protocol and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) protocol. In present article, we introduce probabilistic model checking as an efficient tool-assisted approach for systematically quantifying DoS security threats. We model a security protocol with a fixed network topology using probabilistic specifications for the protocol participants. We attach into the protocol model, a probabilistic attacker model which performs DoS related actions with assigned cost values. The costs for the protocol participants and the attacker reflect the level of some resource expenditure (memory, processing capacity or communication bandwidth) for the associated actions. From the developed model we obtain a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) via property preserving discrete-time semantics. The DTMC model is verified using the PRISM model checker that produces probabilistic estimates for the analyzed DoS threat. in this way, it is possible to evaluate the level of resource expenditure for the attacker, beyond which the likelihood of widespread attack is reduced and subsequently to compare alternative design considerations for optimal resistance to the analyzed DoS threat. Our approach is validated through the analysis of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). The HIP base-exchange is seen as a cryptographic key-exchange protocol with special features related to DoS protection. We analyze a serious DoS threat, for which we provide probabilistic estimates, as well as results for the associated attacker and participants' costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
