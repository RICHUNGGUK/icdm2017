As there is no general sensitivity measure that would capture all information on impact of input factors on model output, analysts tend to combine various measures to obtain a broader image of interactions between different modes. This article concentrates on the correlation ratio, demonstrates methods for calculating this quantity efficiently and accurately, and compares the results. A new method inspired by artificial intelligence techniques emerges as outperforming the familiar methods.", "paper_title": "Sample-based estimation of correlation ratio with polynomial approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253376200003"}
