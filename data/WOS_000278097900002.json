While many researches focused the attention to their analysis, little work has been done about the reduction of a physical system to the corresponding phase model. In this paper we show how, resorting to averaging techniques, it is possible to obtain the phase model corresponding to a given set of state equations. As examples, we derive the phase equations and investigate the synchronization properties of two popular nonlinear oscillators.", "paper_title": "PHASE MODEL REDUCTION AND SYNCHRONIZATION OF PERIODICALLY FORCED NONLINEAR OSCILLATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278097900002"}
