The proposed method reduces the number of calculations by making an extensive use of the RAM memory to store information about the particles' positions and distances. We have simulated clusters up to 5 . 10(6) particles in 2D and up to 1 . 10(6) particles in 3D and compared the calculation times with previous algorithms proposed in the literature. Our method scales t proportional to N-p(1.08), outperforming the current optimization techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
