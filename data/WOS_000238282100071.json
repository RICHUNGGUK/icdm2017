Multiple Classifier System (MCS) is one of the approaches that have been adopted in the detection of DoS attacks recently. Fusion strategy is crucial and has great impact on the classification performance of an MCS. However the selection of the fusion strategy for an MCS in DoS problem varies widely. In this paper, we focus on the comparative study on adopting different fusion strategies for an MCS in DoS problem.", "paper_title": "Empirical study on fusion methods using ensemble of RBFNN for network intrusion detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100071"}
