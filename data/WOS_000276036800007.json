The method combines conventional pattern generation with hazard-free state initialization. Any type of asynchronous circuit can be processed, and all stuck-at faults, even those inside state-holding elements, such as C-elements, are considered. The results on some of the largest benchmarks ever used for asynchronous circuit testing show fault coverage on the order of 99% with no area overhead for (quasi-) delay-insensitive datapath circuits.", "paper_title": "Initialization-Based Test Pattern Generation for Asynchronous Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000276036800007"}
