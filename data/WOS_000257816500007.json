Design/methodology/approach - First, based on previous literature, the paper builds sets of customer satisfaction factors for both e-commerce and m-commerce. Second, features of m-commerce are identified by comparing it with current e-commerce through decision tree (DT). Third, with the derived factors from DT,\"significant factors and relationships among the factors, m-satisfaction and m-loyalty are examined by in-satisfaction model employing structural equation model. Findings - The paper finds that m-commerce is partially similar in factors like \"transaction process\" and \"customization\" which lead customer satisfaction after connecting an m-commerce site, but it has unique aspects of \"content reliability\", \"availability\", and \"perceived price level of mobile Internet (m-Internet)\" which build customer's intention to the m-commerce site. Through the m-satisfaction model, \"content reliability\", and \"transaction process\" are proven to be significantly influential factors to m-satisfaction and m-loyalty. Research implications/limitations - The paper can be a meaningful step to provide empirical analysis and evaluation based on questionnaire survey targeting actual users. The research is based on a case study on digital music transaction, which is indicative, rather than general. Practical implications - The paper meets the needs to focus on customer under the fiercer competition in Korean m-commerce market. It can guide those who want to initiate, move or broaden their business to m-commerce from e-commerce. Originality/value - The paper develops a revised ACSI model to identify individual critical factors and the degree of effect.", "paper_title": "Customer satisfaction factors of mobile commerce in Korea", "paper_id": "WOS:000257816500007"}
