Web service recommendation can relieve users from tough work on service selection and improve the efficiency of developing service-oriented applications. Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering has been widely used for web service recommendation, in which similarity measurement and QoS prediction are two key issues. However, traditional similarity models and QoS prediction methods rarely consider the influence of time information, which is an important factor affecting the QoS performance of web services. Furthermore, it is difficult for the existing similarity models to capture the actual relationships between users or services due to data sparsity. The two shortcomings seriously devalue the performance of neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. In this paper, the authors propose an improved time-aware collaborative filtering approach for high-quality web service recommendation. Our approach integrates time information into both similarity measurement and QoS prediction. Additionally, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, a hybrid personalized random walk algorithm is designed to infer indirect user similarities and service similarities. Finally, a series of experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Time Aware and Data Sparsity Tolerant Web Service Recommendation Based on Improved Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791500011"}
