The results show that two different structures are possible in the 1: 2 ratio: in the first, the DMSO molecule interacts with both acid molecules (leading to a \"Y\" structure); in the second, the DMSO interacts with only one monoprotic acid. The second structure shows a lower stability per hydrogen bond. The spontaneities of the reactions to form the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes are greatly influenced by the X group of the linear acid. With the exception of HCN, all the reactions are spontaneous. In the 1:2 complexes with Y structure, we observed that the hydrogen atoms of the linear acid are coupled in symmetric and asymmetric modes, while this type of coupling is absent from the other 1:2 complexes.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen-bonded complexes between dimethyl sulfoxide and monoprotic acids: molecular properties and IR spectroscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000343888400004"}
