The reasons behind the establishment of the program are presented, and the evolution of the program over the past five years is described. Some of the initial difficulties encountered in setting up such a cross-disciplinary and relatively flexible program of this type are also pointed out.", "paper_title": "Computational science: An intermingling of science, mathematics, and computer science", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400026"}
