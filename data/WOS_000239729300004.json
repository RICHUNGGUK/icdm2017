The two-step algorithm relies on line-segment projections as calibration features, which are sinusoidal curves. We proposed a cylindrical line detection, based on the dual principle of the Hough transform. Moreover, the use of Plucker coordinates introduces some new characteristics in the calibration process. This kind of formalism allow a linearization of the cylindrical projection, which is non-linear in the usual way. Results obtained from this first step are used to evaluate one of the intrinsics, the other one being determined by a linear criterion minimization in the dual space, i.e. the sines magnitudes space.", "paper_title": "Hybrid stereo configurations through a cylindrical sensor calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239729300004"}
