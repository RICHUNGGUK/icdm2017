First, by employing a version of the Hermite-Biehler theorem applicable to quasi-polynomials, a complete set of all stabilising proportional-derivative parameters for first-order processes with constant time delay are obtained. Next, we provide an approach to design a robust PD controller to stabilise a first-order process with uncertain time delay, which lies inside a known interval.", "paper_title": "Proportional-derivative controllers for stabilisation of first-order processes with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000346067800010"}
