This paper focuses on leakage power reduction through automatic insertion of sleep transistors for power-gating. In particular, we propose a novel, layout-aware methodology that facilitates sleep transistor insertion and virtual-ground routing on row-based layouts. We also introduce a clustering algorithm that is able to handle simultaneously timing and area constraints, and we extend it to the case of multi-sleep transistors to increase leakage savings. The results we have obtained on a set of benchmark circuits show that the leakage savings we can achieve are, by far, superior to those obtained using existing power-gating solutions and with much tighter timing and area constraints.", "paper_title": "Row-Based Power-Gating: A Novel Sleep Transistor Insertion Methodology for Leakage Power Optimization in Nanometer CMOS Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000287671200010"}
