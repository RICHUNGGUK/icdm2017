These loops operate on arrays too large to fit in physical memory. The problem involves determining optimal tiling of loops and placement of disk I/O statements. This entails a search in an explosively large parameter space. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and use a discrete constraint solver to generate optimized out-of-core code. The solution generated using the discrete constraint solver consistently outperforms other approaches by up to a factor of four. Measurements on sequential and parallel versions of the generated code demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
