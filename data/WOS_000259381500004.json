We analyze a natural random walk on the edge-vertex graph of the polytope. The analysis makes use of the multicommodity flow technique of Sinclair [Combin Probab Comput 1 (1992), 351-370] together with ideas developed by Morris and Sinclair [SIAM J Comput 34 (2004), 195-226] for the knapsack problem, and Cryan et al. [SIAM J Comput 36 (2006), 247-278] for contingency tables, to establish that the random walk approaches the uniform distribution in time n(O(m2)). (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.
