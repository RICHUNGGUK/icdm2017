The proposed design is shown to be easily extendable to FIR filters with multibit coefficients of arbitrary sign. The area efficiency achieved in comparison to direct form realization is demonstrated by VLSI implementation examples, synthesized in TSMC 0.18-mu m single poly six metal layer CMOS process using state-of-art VLSI EDA tools. The possible saving in average power consumption is estimated using gate-level power analysis. Suggestions for applications and topics for further research Conclude the paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
