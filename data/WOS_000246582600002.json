Mergers were first introduced by Ta-Shma [28th STOC, pp. 276-285, 1996] and have proven to be a very useful tool in explicit constructions of extractors and condensers. In this work we present a new analysis of the merger construction of Lu et al [35th STOC, pp. 602-611, 2003]. We prove that the merger's output is close to a distribution with min-entropy rate of at least 6/11 delta. We show that the distance from this distribution is polynomially related to the number of additional random bits that were used by the merger (i.e., its seed). We are also able to prove a bound of 4/7 delta on the min-entropy rate at the cost of increasing the statistical error. Both results are improvements to the previous known lower bound of 1.2 delta (however, in the 1/2 delta result the error decreases exponentially in the length of the seed). To obtain our results we deviate from the usual linear algebra methods that were used by Lu et al and introduce techniques from additive number theory.", "paper_title": "An improved analysis of linear mergers", "paper_id": "WOS:000246582600002"}
