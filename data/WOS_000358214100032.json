The proposed audio watermarking method offers copyright protection based on analysis filterbank decomposition, psychoacoustic model and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The novel blind audio watermarking algorithm embeds the watermark bits in the final residue of the subbands in the transform domain. The watermarking system performance is optimized by selecting appropriate segment length for applying EMD process and by selecting the number of subbands for watermark embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust against various common signal processing manipulations while multiple watermark messages can be embedded.", "paper_title": "Empirical mode decomposition based blind audio watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100032"}
