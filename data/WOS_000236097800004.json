It is shown that stochastic relations are bisimilar provided they have congruences that generate each other; from this is derived that relations that have isomorphic factor spaces are bisimilar. Stochastic Kripke models are introduced for a modal logic and illustrated for some popular logics. The criterion developed here permits proving for the general case that Kripke models are bisimilar iff they accept exactly the same formulas.", "paper_title": "Stochastic relations: Congruences, bisimulations and the Hennessy-Milner theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236097800004"}
