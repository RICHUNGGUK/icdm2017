Based on a biomechanical characterization of lower-body dynamics, the model captures important physical properties of bipedal locomotion such as balance and ground contact. The model generalizes naturally to variations in style due to changes in speed, step-length, and mass, and avoids common problems (such as footskate) that arise with existing trackers. The dynamics comprise a two degree-of-freedom representation of human locomotion with inelastic ground contact. A stochastic controller generates impulsive forces during the toe-off stage of walking, and spring-like forces between the legs. A higher-dimensional kinematic body model is conditioned on the underlying dynamics. The combined model is used to track walking people in video, including examples with turning, occlusion, and varying gait. We also report quantitative monocular and binocular tracking results with the HumanEva dataset.", "paper_title": "Physics-Based Person Tracking Using the Anthropomorphic Walker", "paper_id": "WOS:000273242300008"}
