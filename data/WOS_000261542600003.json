It is found that it is very easy for the local DFD method to handle such moving boundary flow problems. This is because it does not need to move the mesh which is indeed needed in traditional methods. Numerical experiments show that the present numerical results agree very well with available data in the literature, and that the local DFD method is an effective tool for the computation of moving boundary flow problems.
