The performance of DTN convergence layer adapter (CLA) protocols over asymmetric space communication channels has not yet been comprehensively characterized. In this paper, we present an experimental performance evaluation of DTN CLA protocols for reliable data transport over a space communication infrastructure involving asymmetric channel rates, with particular attention to the recently developed Licklider transmission protocol (LTP) CLA (i.e., LTPCL). The performance of LTPCL is evaluated in comparison with other two reliable CLAs, TCP CLA and a hybrid of TCP CLA and LTPCL, for long-delay cislunar communications in the presence of highly asymmetric channel rates. LTPCL is also evaluated and analyzed in a deep-space communication scenario characterized by a very long link delay and lengthy link disruptions.", "paper_title": "Performance of DTN protocols in space communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000325773600016"}
