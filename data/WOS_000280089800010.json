In the side of fuzzy methods, a corresponding problem arises: will a small random perturbation of fuzzy input cause a big variance of fuzzy output? This paper study the robustness of fuzzy schemes in environments with random perturbations. It focuses on fuzzy algebraic operators, and proposes two methods to analyze their robustness in environments with random perturbations. The effectiveness and features of the methods are shown by simulations.", "paper_title": "Robustness of fuzzy operators in environments with random perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000280089800010"}
