The approach is based on the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method. Only a straight line is discretized that represents the through-thickness direction or the radial direction. The surrounding fluid is accounted for by employing a damping boundary condition that is based on the analytical description of the radiation impedance. Since the radiation impedance is a function of the wavenumber in the waveguide, an iterative solution procedure is applied. The algorithm is highly efficient while the results are in agreement with the Global Matrix Method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
