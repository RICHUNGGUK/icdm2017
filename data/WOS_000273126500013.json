By processing patterns as real-valued vectors and classifying similar if-then rules into clusters in long-term memory, the proposed system can store pattern-based if-then rules of propositional logic, including conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. Moreover, it achieves some important properties for intelligent systems such as incremental learning, generalization, avoidance of duplicate results, and robustness to noise. Results of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for intelligent systems for solving various tasks autonomously in a real environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
