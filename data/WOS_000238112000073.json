In the scheme, the model of cerebellar cortex is regarded as the feedforward controller. Specifically, a neural network and an estimator are adopted in the cerebellar cortex model which can predict the future state and eliminate faults caused by time delay. Then the new scheme was used to control inverted pendulum. The simulation experimental results show that the new scheme can learn to control the inverted pendulum for tracing successfully.", "paper_title": "A cerebellar feedback error learning scheme based on Kalman estimator for tracing in dynamic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000073"}
