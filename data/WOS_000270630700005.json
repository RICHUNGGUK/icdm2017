A system based on a combination of several different techniques is proposed. The system uses a missing-feature approach for improving crosstalk/noise robustness, a Wiener filter for speech enhancement, hidden Markov models for speech reconstruction, and speaker-dependent/-independent modeling for speaker and speech recognition. We develop the system on the Speech Separation Challenge database, involving a task of separating and recognizing two mixing sentences without assuming advanced knowledge about the identity of the speakers nor about the signal-to-noise ratio. The paper is an extended version of a previous conference paper submitted for the challenge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
