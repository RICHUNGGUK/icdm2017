Firstly, the boundary conditions are obtained by rebuilding central gas flow shape in BF based on computer graphics. Secondly, the CFD model is built based on turbulent model by analyzing the features of gas flow. Finally, a method which can get the numerical solutions of themodel is proposed by using CFD software ANSYS/FLUENT. The proposed model can reflect the changes of the gas flow distribution, and can help to guide the operation of furnace burdening and to ensure the BF stable and smooth production.", "paper_title": "Modeling of High Temperature Gas Flow 3D Distribution in BF Throat Based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200014"}
