We checked that in practice, by customizing the functional programming language Wall for web development. Customizations include support for web document types, web data access functions, textual templates, web dialogs and extension of transactional mechanisms to web session data. Prototype implementations of Wall are developed. Our experience shows that application of Wail in the web development domain is fully justified and that web development may benefit from functional programming languages in both education and production.
