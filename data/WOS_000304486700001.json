The core techniques are the ALE-based variational multiscale (ALE-VMS) method, the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space-Time formulation, and the stabilized space-time FSI technique. The special techniques include methods for calculating an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, prestressing of the blood vessel wall, a special mapping technique for specifying the velocity profile at an inflow boundary with non-circular shape, techniques for using variable arterial wall thickness, mesh generation techniques for building layers of refined fluid mechanics mesh near the arterial walls, a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, the Sequentially-Coupled Arterial FSI technique and its multiscale versions, techniques for the projection of fluid-structure interface stresses, calculation of the wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, arterial-surface extraction and boundary condition techniques, and a scaling technique for specifying a more realistic volumetric flow rate. With results from earlier computations, we show how these core and special FSI techniques work in patient-specific cardiovascular simulations.", "paper_title": "Space-Time and ALE-VMS Techniques for Patient-Specific Cardiovascular Fluid-Structure Interaction Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000304486700001"}
