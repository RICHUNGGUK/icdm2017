A subgraph H for a metric space X is called a k-vertex-fault-tolerant t-spanner ((k,t)-VFTS or simply k-VFTS), if for any subset SaS dagger X with |S|a parts per thousand currency signk, it holds that d (Ha-S) (x,y)a parts per thousand currency signta <...d(x,y), for any pair of x,yaXa-S. For any doubling metric, we give a basic construction of k-VFTS with stretch arbitrarily close to 1 that has optimal O(kn) edges. In addition, we also consider bounded hop-diameter, which is studied in the context of fault-tolerance for the first time even for Euclidean spanners. We provide a construction of k-VFTS with bounded hop-diameter: for ma parts per thousand yen2n, we can reduce the hop-diameter of the above k-VFTS to O(alpha(m,n)) by adding O(km) edges, where alpha is a functional inverse of the Ackermann's function. Finally, we construct a fault-tolerant single-sink spanner with bounded maximum degree, and use it to reduce the maximum degree of our basic k-VFTS. As a result, we get a k-VFTS with O(k (2) n) edges and maximum degree O(k (2)).", "paper_title": "Sparse Fault-Tolerant Spanners for Doubling Metrics with Bounded Hop-Diameter or Degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400004"}
