However, a mass of wireless recourse will be occupied and spectrum efficiency will be decreased to feedback channel quality indication (CQI) of all users in every subcarrier or chunk for adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Thus numerous limited feedback schemes are proposed to reduce the system overhead. The recently proposed compressive sensing (CS) theory provides a new framework to jointly measure and compress signals that allows less sampling and storage resources than traditional approaches based on Nyquist sampling. In this paper, we proposed two novel CQI feedback schemes based on general CS and subspace CS, respectively, both of which could be used in a wireless OFDM system. The feedback rate with subspace CS is greatly decreased by exploiting the subspace information of the underlying signal. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with the same feedback rate, the throughputs with subspace CS outperform the discrete cosine transform (DCT) based method which is usually employed, and the throughputs with general CS outperform DCT when the feedback rate is larger than 0.13 bits/subcarrier.", "paper_title": "Novel schemes of CQI Feedback Compression based on Compressive Sensing for Adaptive OFDM Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000290145200005"}
