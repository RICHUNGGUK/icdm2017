By selecting a value for the scalar parameter g, a member of this family is determined for which all parts of the model are configured accordingly. In this regard, a specific configuration for FRMs as well as an appropriate derivative-based iterative identification procedure are proposed. While preserving the high modeling capability of FRMs, the proposed model configuration along with the proposed identification algorithm alleviate both the lack of analyzability and the possible existence of hard conflicts between the rules in the rule-base. Furthermore, high relative errors in output computations are prevented using the proposed scheme. The modeling scheme is applied finally to the Box-Jenkins gas furnace benchmark problem as well as a new classification problem. The results are verified by simulation.", "paper_title": "Introducing g-normal fuzzy relational models", "paper_id": "WOS:000361484700007"}
