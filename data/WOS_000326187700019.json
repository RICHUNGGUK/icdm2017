I discuss two different research initiatives-design of real-time, immersive multimedia feedback environments for stroke rehabilitation; exploratory environments for events that exploited the user's ability to make connections. I discuss the issue of foundations: the question of multisensory integration and superadditivity; the need for identification of \"first-class\" Multimedia problems; expanding the scope of Multimedia research.", "paper_title": "Experiential Media Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326187700019"}
