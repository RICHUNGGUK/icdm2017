However, with the characteristics of openness and fast-spreading, Micro-Blog can quickly turn a point of view into public opinion. Therefore, Micro-blog opinion evolution and trends prediction has become the focus of people's attentions. This paper develops a Micro-Blog public opinion trends forecasting system using BP neural network. This system can collect and processes data automatically and forecast the tendency of Micro-Blog public opinion.", "paper_title": "A Forecasting System of Micro-Blog Public Opinion Based on Artificial Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000365933900006"}
