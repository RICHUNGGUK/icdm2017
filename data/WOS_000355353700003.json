Thus, the principal component analysis (PCA) method, which is able to produce diagrams of objects as a function of PC scores, was able to distinguish and group the NIRS from the many different types of potato sample. Other methods such as the radial basis function-partial least squares (RBF-PLS) as well the successive projection algorithm (SPA) combination, distinguished the purple and white sweet potato varieties from each other as well as, importantly, from the different adulterated purple sweet potato samples. Furthermore, the total anthocyanin (TA) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) parameters were also analysed quantitatively in these samples, and high residual prediction deviation (RPD) values were noted. Also, the two recognition methods, k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were able to discriminate the sweet potato samples. Thus, overall this work demonstrated that NIRS combined with chemometrics methods can be employed for the identification of purple sweet potato, white sweet potato and their adulterated samples; in addition, quantitative analysis for TA and TM in such samples can be successfully performed.
