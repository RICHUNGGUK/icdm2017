If a (nu, k, lambda, n) difference set D of order n = p(b) exists in an abelian group with cyclic Sylow p-subgroup S, then p is an element of {2, 3} and |S| = p. Furthermore, either p = 2 and nu equivalent to lambda equivalent to 2 (mod 4) or the parameters of D belong to one of four families explicitly determined in our main theorem.", "paper_title": "On Lander's conjecture for difference sets whose order is a power of 2 or 3", "paper_id": "WOS:000277338400007"}
