In this paper, we propose an Energy-Efficient Opportunistic Localization (EEOL) scheme to satisfy the requirement of positional accuracy and power consumption. We explore the idea of opportunistic wakeup probability to wake up an appropriate numbers of sensor nodes, while ensuring the high positional accuracy. Sensor nodes can be triggered by the opportunistic wakeup probability sent from the user. Through utilizing this method, the number of active sensors in the sensing range of the user is decreased, and the power consumption is significantly reduced. Theoretical analysis has been presented to evaluate the performance of EEOL. Simulation results show that EEOL confirms our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Opportunistic Localization with Indoor Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500003"}
