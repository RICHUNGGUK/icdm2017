Conditional expectations and trace vectors are notions that have been part of operator algebra theory for several decades. We show that the theory of conditional expectations and trace vectors is intimately related to that of private quantum channels. Specifically we give a new geometric characterization of single qubit private quantum channels that relies on trace vectors. We further show that trace vectors completely describe the private states for quantum channels that are themselves conditional expectations. We also discuss several examples.", "paper_title": "PRIVATE QUANTUM CHANNELS, CONDITIONAL EXPECTATIONS, AND TRACE VECTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652200004"}
