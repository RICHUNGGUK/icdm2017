However, the cloud data centre downtime has negatively affected the quality of cloud service. Many researchers have studied the problem of cloud service reliability assurance. However, there is a shortage of tools that enable researchers to evaluate their newly proposed cloud service reliability enhancement mechanisms. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose FTCloudSim as a reliable cloud data centre simulation system based on the basic functionalities of CloudSim. FTCloudSim provides an extensible interface to help researchers implement new cloud service reliability enhancement mechanisms. In addition, FTCloudSim can also study the behaviour of the newly proposed mechanisms. We demonstrate the capabilities of FTCloudSim by using five reliability enhancement mechanisms. The results indicate the benefits of our proposed simulation system.", "paper_title": "FTCloudSim: support for cloud service reliability enhancement simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000364816800001"}
