In this study, we examine the perceptions of adopters and non-adopters of online shopping in terms of demographic profile, consumer expectations of online stores, advantages and problems of online shopping and transaction cost. In addition, we also examine the types of products purchased, frequency of online purchase and the extent of communication with e-commerce vendors. The findings are useful in explaining consumers' buying behaviour in the electronic marketplace. Implications of the results are discussed.", "paper_title": "To buy or not to buy online: adopters and non-adopters of online shopping in Singapore", "paper_id": "WOS:000242102000006"}
