Once these entities are highlighted, additional external information allowing to refine this characterization within knowledge bases (e.g. the fact that semantic concepts sky and sun corresponding to these entities often co-occur) is ignored due to the difficulty of integrating it a priori within these static approaches. We formulate the hypothesis that this information is important in the process of highlighting the semantic visual content and propose an architecture based on image agents, abstract structures representing the visual entities of the image content, which integrate it dynamically. For this, we investigate the formation of semantic concepts within a population of multimedia agents. We first propose a learning framework linking the automatically-extracted visual content to these agents. We then develop an architecture allowing the communication of image agents about the perceived semantic concepts by taking into account the external information incrementally. We validate our proposition in a system-based evaluation framework on a corpus of real world color photographs.
