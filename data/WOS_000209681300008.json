It is shown that if the power of sending signal is large enough, positive secrecy rate can be achieved even when the eavesdropper's channel quality is better than the main channel. Closed-form solution of the achievable secrecy rate is derived.", "paper_title": "Secret Wireless Communication with Public Feedback by Common Randomness", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300008"}
