Under some hypothesis, the study of noncommutative GRS codes over finite rings leads to the fact that GRS codes over commutative rings have better parameters than their noncommutative counterparts. Also, GRS codes over finite fields have better parameters than their commutative rings counterparts. But we also show that given a unique decoding algorithm for a GRS code over a finite field, there exists a unique decoding algorithm for a GRS code over a truncated power series ring with a better asymptotic complexity. Moreover, we generalize a lifting decoding scheme to obtain new unique and list decoding algorithms designed to work when the base ring is, for example, a Galois ring or a truncated power series ring or the ring of square matrices over the latter ring.", "paper_title": "On Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes Over Commutative and Noncommutative Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800043"}
