The comparisons between the Franck-Condon factor simulated spectra and the measured photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) of Cui and co-workers help to search for the ground-state structures. The results showed that D-2 molecule tends to be dissociated on aluminum clusters and forms the radial Al-D bond with one aluminum atom. By studying the evolution of the binding energies, second difference energies and HOMO-LUMO gaps as a function of cluster size, we found Al2D2, Al6D2 and Al7D2 clusters have the stronger relative stability and enhanced chemical stability. Also, considering the larger adsorption energies of these three clusters, we surmised that Al-2, Al-6 and Al-7 may be the better candidates for dissociative adsorption of D-2 molecule among the clusters we studied. Furthermore, the natural population analysis (NPA) and difference electron density were performed and discussed to probe into the localization of the charges and reliable charge-transfer information in AlnD2 and AlnD2 clusters.
