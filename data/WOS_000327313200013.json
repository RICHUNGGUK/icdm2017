As compared to lumped parameter approaches, the strategy is to resolve the collision between particles for hard-core forces and to use a mean field treatment for soft-and long-ranged forces. The numerical strategy adapts the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme to handle interatomic and electrostatic interactions.", "paper_title": "SIMULATING NANOFLUIDS VIA THE WEIGHTED DENSITY LATTICE BOLTZMANN APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313200013"}
