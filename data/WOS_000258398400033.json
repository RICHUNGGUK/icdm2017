The phenomenon is called the quantum wipe effect. Here, this effect is reviewed and the analytical proof for a model system consisting of a one-qubit system coupled to a fast dissipating environment is extended to an environment at a thermal equilibrium.", "paper_title": "Coherence conservation of a qubit coupled to a dissipating thermal environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400033"}
