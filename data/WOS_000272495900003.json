When the workpieces or fixtures are redesigned or the robot workstation layout is changed, the result of prior off-line programming cannot be reused. With the thought of CAD/CAPP/CAM integration, this paper presents a feature mapping algorithm, which converts the design features of the workpieces to the machining features of the seams. Then a motion navigation method based on feature mapping in a simulation environment is proposed. This method comprises initial position guiding and seam tracking. For initial position guiding, a motion path with the least energy consumption is generated based on the weighted optimal control; then the path is revised for avoiding obstacles by setting the path tags dynamically. For seam tracking, the seam is dispersed into discrete welding points; then the welding gun moves through each point according to the welding sequence. The method is implemented in the development of an off-line programming simulation system. Industrial cases of the welding robot workcell layout for automobile door frames show the method can make the off-line programming much more effective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
