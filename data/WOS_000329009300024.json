However, applied to high resolution images, the contrast enhancement method entails high computation costs mostly due to histogram computations. Therefore, this letter proposes a parallel histogram calculation algorithm using the column histograms and difference histograms to reduce histogram computations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for histogram-based image contrast enhancement.", "paper_title": "An Efficient O(1) Contrast Enhancement Algorithm Using Parallel Column Histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300024"}
