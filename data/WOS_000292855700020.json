It takes exponential time to solve classical Ramsey number problem with traditional electronic computers. In this paper, we propose a new DNA computing algorithm based on the divide and conquer algorithm to solve the classical Ramsey number problem efficiently. The new algorithm is made up of a subspace generator, a parallel searcher, a subspace searcher and the Ramsey number generator. With the use of divide and conquer algorithm, the new DNA computing algorithm can be scaled-up to solve much greater size and harder Ramsey number problems compared to the existing algorithms. In addition, the space-efficient and error-tolerant ability can also be improved. By this approach, we have shown that DNA computing has vast potential for solving NP-complete problems.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach for the Classical Ramsey Number Problem on DNA-Based Supercomputing", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700020"}
