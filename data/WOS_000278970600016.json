The emphasis is on the artifacts eliminating for photorealistic synthesis especially near object boundaries. In contrast to conventional techniques which ignore geometry errors, we first categorize the artifact cases and depth modes. Furthermore, this paper infers the complementarity principle of the artifacts from left and right references. This complementarity guarantees the effectiveness of our reliability-based synthesis. The reliability reasoning is crucial for artifacts reduction. The reliable and unreliable areas from different views can be correctly labeled. Then artifacts caused by unreliable pixels from one reference can be replaced by the reliable pixels from the other reference. As a final result, artifacts of novel view are demonstrated to be significantly reduced on different multiview sequences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
