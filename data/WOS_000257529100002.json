E. (2004). A model of contextual interactions and Contour detection in primary visual cortex. Neural Networks, 17, 719-735] has been significantly improved to include two fundamental additional aspects. i.e., multi-scale decomposition and attention. The model incorporates two independent paths for Visual processing corresponding to two different scales. Attention from higher hierarchical levels works by modifying different properties of the network: by selecting the portion of the image to be scrutinized and the appropriate scale, by modulating the threshold of it gating mechanism, and by modifying the width and/or strength of lateral inhibition. Through computer simulations of real complex and noisy black-and-white images, we demonstrate that appropriate selection of the above factors allows accurate analysis of image contours at different levels, from global perception of the overall objects without details, clown to a fine examination of minute particulars (Such as the lips in it face or the fingers of a hand). Attentive reconfiguration of lateral inhibition plays a key role in the analysis 4 images at different detail levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
