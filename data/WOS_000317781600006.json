This paper presents a divide-and-conquer quadrangulation approach that exploits such global structural information. Given a model represented in triangular mesh, we first segment it into a set of submeshes, and compare them with some predefined quad mesh templates. For the submeshes that are similar to a predefined template, we remesh them as the template up to a number of subdivisions. For the others, we adopt the wave-based quadrangulation technique to remesh them with extensions to preserve symmetric structure and generate compatible quad mesh boundary. To ensure that the individually remeshed submeshes can be seamlessly stitched together, we formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem and design a heuristic solver to optimize the subdivision numbers and the size fields on the submesh boundaries. With this divider-and-conquer quadrangulation framework, we are able to process very large models that are very difficult for the previous techniques. Since the submeshes can be remeshed individually in any order, the remeshing procedure can run in parallel. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can preserve the high-level structures, and process large complex surfaces robustly and efficiently.", "paper_title": "A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Quad Remeshing", "paper_id": "WOS:000317781600006"}
