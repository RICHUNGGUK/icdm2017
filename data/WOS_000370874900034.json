We generalize prior work on hardware tagging by considering a generic architecture that supports software-defined policies over metadata of arbitrary size and complexity; we introduce several novel microarchitectural optimizations that keep the overhead of this rich processing low. Our model thus achieves the efficiency of previous hardware-based approaches with the flexibility of the software-based ones. We demonstrate this by using it to enforce four diverse safety and security policies-spatial and temporal memory safety, taint tracking, control-flow integrity, and code and data separation-plus a composite policy that enforces all of them simultaneously. Experiments on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks with a PUMP-enhanced RISC processor show modest impact on runtime (typically under 10%) and power ceiling (less than 10%), in return for some increase in energy usage (typically under 60%) and area for on-chip memory structures (110%).", "paper_title": "Architectural Support for Software-Defined Metadata Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000370874900034"}
