This allows us to combine the advantages of both representations. On the one hand, the implicit representation is used to guide the topology of the parametric curve and to formulate additional constraints, such as range constraints. On the other hand, the parametric representation helps to detect and to eliminate unwanted branches of the implicitly defined curves. Moreover, it is required for many applications, e.g., in Computer Aided Design. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
