Since there exist problems of finite samples and uncertain data in complex fuzzy fault system, the input and output variables are described as fuzzy numbers. Then by integrating the fuzzy theory, wavelet analysis theory and v-support vector classifier machine, fuzzy wavelet v-support vector classifier machine (FW nu-SVCM) is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of FW nu-SVCM, genetic algorithm (GA) is also applied to optimize unknown parameters of FW nu-SVCM. A diagnosing method based on FWv-SVCM and GA is put forward. The results of the application in car assembly line diagnosis confirm the feasibility and the validity of the diagnosing method. Compared with the traditional model and other SVCM methods, FW nu-SVCM method requires fewer samples and has better diagnosing precision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
