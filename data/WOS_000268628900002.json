One experiment described the effects on retrospective reproductions of sudden and gradual modulations to close and distant keys. The results showed that modulations elicit time underestimations as an inverse function of interkey distances, with a major impact for sudden modulations. A proposed vectorial model - \"Expected Development Fraction\" (EDF) - describes the development of expectations when an interkey distance is traversed during a certain time interval. This expected development is longer than the perceived duration, leading to underestimation of the time.", "paper_title": "Tonal Modulation and Subjective Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000268628900002"}
