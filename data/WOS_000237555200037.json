It is based on the combination of two ideas: the patch-based approach, and non-parametric tests of distributions. Our method can reliably detect texture edges using only local information. Therefore, it can be computed as a preprocessing step prior to segmentation, and can be very easily combined with parametric deformable models. These models furnish our system with smooth boundaries and globally salient structures.", "paper_title": "Patch-based texture edges and segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200037"}
