Other than the process of product design, the representation and share of parts family information and part feature information are paid more attention in web-based parts library. Based on research of a web-based parts library system, some key technologies are put forward in this paper, which are a web-based part data description norm on data dictionary, a feature-based neutral representation of part geometric information and a hoops-based visualization method of part feature model. All these realize the share of information of parts library in and among enterprises. The above achievements are used in China National 863 High-Tech Project. Besides, the achievements have been embodied in the international standard raised by China National Institute of Standardization and provided the technical foundation to propose the international standards with Chinese independent intellectual property right.
