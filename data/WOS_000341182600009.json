Changes in user requirements cause changes in schemas used in the systems and changes in the schemas subsequently make existing documents invalid. In this work, we study two tightly coupled problems-schema evolution and document adaptation. The presented approach extends an existing conceptual model for evolution of XML applications towards document adaptation, by introducing a formal framework for detecting changes between two versions of a schema. From the detected changes it is possible to create a script that transforms documents valid against the old version of the schema to documents valid against its new version.", "paper_title": "Efficient adaptation of XML data using a conceptual model", "paper_id": "WOS:000341182600009"}
