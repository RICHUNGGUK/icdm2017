However. a proper modeling of the mobile cellular network cannot ignore the existence of repeated calls. Moreover, real systems often operate in varying environment conditions. In this paper, we show how the matrix-analytic formalism gives one the ability to construct and study versatile cellular mobile networks with user retrials operating in random environment. More concretely, we investigate two four-dimensional. Markovian models which allow us to represent two different options for the use of the guard channel concept. We put emphasis on the numerical evaluation of the redial behavior and the environmental factors on the system performance. This implies the performance analysis of a variety of descriptors including blocking probabilities (handover and fresh calls), mean average analysis, and waiting time in orbit. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
