We also assume that an intruder uses a single resource with limited budget to interrupt the flow of a single commodity through the network within a given time limit of T. A new formulation based on the concept of Temporally Repeated Flow (TRF) is presented. The problem is then solved using Benders' decomposition. Another solution method, based on the most vital arcs in a network is also discussed. Finally, some computational results are reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
