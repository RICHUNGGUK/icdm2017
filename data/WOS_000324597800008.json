According to our framework, only a single reference image, without any knowledge of the 3D geometry or material information of the input face, is needed. To transfer the illumination effects of a reference face image to a normal lighting face, we first decompose the lightness layers of the reference and the input images into large-scale and detail layers through weighted least squares (WLS) filter with adaptive smoothing parameters according to the gradient values of the face images. The large-scale layer of the reference image is filtered with the guidance of the input image by guided filter with adaptive smoothing parameters according to the face structures. The relit result is obtained by replacing the large-scale layer of the input image with that of the reference image. To normalize the illumination effects of a non-normal lighting face (i.e., face delighting), we introduce similar reflectance prior to the layer decomposition stage by WLS filter, which make the normalized result less affected by the high contrast light and shadow effects of the input face. Through these two procedures, we can change the illumination effects of a non-normal lighting face by first normalizing the illumination and then transferring the illumination of another reference face to it. We acquire convincing relit results of both face relighting and delighting on numerous input and reference face images with various illumination effects and genders. Comparisons with previous papers show that our framework is less affected by geometry differences and can preserve better the identification structure and skin color of the input face.", "paper_title": "Face Illumination Manipulation Using a Single Reference Image by Adaptive Layer Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800008"}
