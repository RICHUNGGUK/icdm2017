Models of SMS use information about the timing of preceding stimuli and responses to predict when the next response will be made. This article compares the theoretical structure and empirical predictions of four two-parameter models proposed in the literature: Michon (Timing in temporal tracking, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1967), Hary and Moore (Br J Math Stat Psychol 40:109-124, 1987b), Mates (Biol Cybern 70:463-473, 1994a; Biol Cybern 70:475-484, 1994b), and Schulze et al. (Mus Percept 22:461-467, 2005). By embedding these models within a general linear framework, the mathematical equivalence of the Michon, Hary and Moore, and Schulze et al. models is demonstrated. The Mates model, which differs from the other three, is then tested empirically with new data from a tapping experiment in which the metronome alternated between two tempi. The Mates model predictions are found to be invalid for about one-third of the trials, suggesting that at least one of the model's underlying assumptions is incorrect. The other models cannot be refuted as easily, but they do not predict some features of the data very accurately. Comparison of the models' predictions in a training/test procedure did not yield any significant differences. The general linear framework introduced here may help in the formulation of new models that make better predictions.", "paper_title": "A general linear framework for the comparison and evaluation of models of sensorimotor synchronization", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338900001"}
