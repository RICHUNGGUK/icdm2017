Grippers of such transplanters spend a considerable amount of time shuttling between the source and target trays during replugging. Therefore, work efficiency of transplanters can be significantly improved by tour planning. In this study, performances of the ant colony algorithm (ACA), the genetic algorithm (GA), and the common sequence method (CSM) in replugging tour planning were compared. Two types of seedling trays, with 50 and 200 cells, were used. The ACA and the GA were found to have more advantages than the CSM in total tour lengths for one tray. Moreover, the ACA performed better than the GA when the numbers of empty cells and healthy seedlings in the target and source trays, respectively, increased. When a 20 x 10 tray was used, the average length of the ACA decreased by 6000.9 mm compared with that of the GA and by 13058.4 mm compared with that of the CSM after finishing 40 empty cells in one tray. The average run times of the GA and the ACA in MATLAB (R2012a) were 0.32 and 0.94 s, respectively. These results meet real-time operation requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
