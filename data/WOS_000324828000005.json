Its relative standard deviation is 1.4 % based on measurements performed over 23 samples from a single batch. The requirement of low process sensitivity is met together with the very low power consumption of 290 nW, at the cost of a large area occupation of 0.245 mm(2). Key to obtain this result are the use of the \"classical\" bipolar bandgap topology, which can be optimized for low-power/low-spread operation so as to outperform MOS-based bandgap circuits, and the use of devices that are intrinsically more stable towards process, such as diffusion resistors.", "paper_title": "Design of a nanopower current reference with reduced process variability", "paper_id": "WOS:000324828000005"}
