Different from the conventional works, we consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) which is a practical scenario for multiuser broadcast channels. We propose a robust regularized zero-forcing (RRZF) beamforming at the base station. Then we show that the RRZF outperforms zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized ZF (RZF) beamforming even as the number of users grows to infinity. Simulation results validate the advantage of the proposed robust RZF beamforming.", "paper_title": "Regularized Zero-Forcing for Multiantenna Broadcast Channels with User Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000021"}
