[5]. We then extend our analysis and show that the overall complexity of the zone of a low-degree algebraic surface, or of the boundary of an arbitrary convex set, in an arrangement of k convex polyhedra in 3-space with n facets in total, is also O(nk(1+epsilon)), for any epsilon > 0. Finally, we present a deterministic algorithm that constructs a single cell in an arrangement of this kind, in time O(nk(1+epsilon) log(3) n), for any epsilon > 0.", "paper_title": "A single cell in an arrangement of convex polyhedra in R-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000243074400003"}
