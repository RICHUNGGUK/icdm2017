Artificial features are extracted from vibration data of an accelerometer sensor to monitor and detect a crack fault or incipient failure seeded in an intermediate gearbox of a helicopter's main transmission. Classification accuracies for the artificial feature constructed from raw data exceeded 99% over training and independent validation sets. As a benchmark, GP-based artificial features constructed from conventional ones underperformed those derived from raw data by over 2% over the training and over 11% over the testing data.
