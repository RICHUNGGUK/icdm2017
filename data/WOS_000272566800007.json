With basic factors, we model the optimizing behavior of the A SIRS, establish queuing model to determine whether or not it meets throughput and offer easy-to-compute equations of AS/RS' utilization, the fraction, of DC cycles and mean storage/retrieval time. According to the computational comparison with the simulation, the proposed models give satisfactory results with very high accuracy. Although the results are derived for a given system., they can also be used in the design or evaluation Of new/proposed systems.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE OF AUTOMATED STORAGE/RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS UNDER STOCHASTIC DEMAND USING QUEUEING THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800007"}
