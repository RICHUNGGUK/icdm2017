To establish the optimized design flow, equations presenting the relationship between the specification and PLL loop parameters in terms of settling time, loop bandwidth, phase margin, and phase noise are summarized. The proposed design flow overcomes the settling time inaccuracy in conventional second-order approximation methods by obtaining the accurate relationship between settling time and loop bandwidth with the MATLAB Control System Toolbox for the fourth-order PLLs. The proposed flow also features the worst-case design by taking account of the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations in loop filter components, and considers the tradeoff between phase noise and area. The three-step optimization process consists of 1) the derivation of the accurate relationship between the settling time and loop bandwidth for various PVT conditions, 2) the derivation of phase noise and area as functions of area-dominant filter capacitance, and 3) the derivation of all PLL loop components values. The optimized design result is compared with circuit simulations using an actually designed fourth-order fractional-N PLL in a 1.8 V 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The error between the design and simulation for the setting time is reduced from 0.63 mu sec in the second-order approximation to 0.23 mu sec in the fourth-order optimization that proves the validity of the proposed method for the high-speed settling operations.", "paper_title": "Loop Design Optimization of Fourth-Order Fractional-N PLL Frequency Synthesizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261100018"}
