Compared to other authentication schemes, our proposed scheme aims to provide more functionalities and to resist well-known attacks. These crucial merits include (1) a user can freely choose and change his passwords; (2) our scheme provides mutual authentication between a server and a user; (3) it achieves user anonymity; (4) a server and a user can generate authenticated sessions keys. Moreover, our scheme can resist replay attacks, forgery attacks, insider attacks, reflection attacks, and parallel session attacks.
