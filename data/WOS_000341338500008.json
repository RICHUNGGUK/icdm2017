This paper makes three contributions to research on overcoming these problems in the context of enterprise DRE systems that use the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) quality-of-service (QoS)-enabled publish/subscribe (pub/sub) middleware over WANs. First, it codifies the limitations of conventional DDS implementations deployed over WANs. Second, it describes a middleware component called Proxy DDS that bridges multiple, isolated DDS domains deployed over WANs. Third, it describes the NetQSIP framework that combines multi-layer, standards-based technologies including the OMG-DDS, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and IP DiffServ to support end-to-end QoS in a WAN and shield pub/sub applications from tedious and error-prone details of network QoS mechanisms. The results of experiments using Proxy DDS and NetQSIP show how combining DDS with SIP in DiffServ networks significantly improves dynamic resource reservation in WANs and provides effective end-to-end QoS management.
