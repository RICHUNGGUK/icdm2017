First, we consider the temperature constrained T-via planning (TVP) problem on a given 3-D floorplan. Second, we integrate dynamic TVP into 3-D floorplanning process. Our main contribution and results can be summarized as follows. We solve the temperature constrained TV-P problem by solving a sequence of simplified interlayer and intralayer TVP subproblems. Each subproblem is formulated as convex programming problem and we derive nearly optimal solution for detailed T-via distribution. Based (in the TVP solution, we implement the integrated TVP and 3-D floorplanning algorithm in a two-stage approach. Before floorplanning, blocks are assigned into different layers by solving a sequence of knapsack problems. During floorplanning, T-vias are allocated with white space redistribution to optimize T-via insertion. Experimental results show that our TVP approach can reduce T-vias by 12% compared with a recent published work (J. Cong and Y. Zhang, \"Thermal via planning for 3-D ICs,\" in Proc. Int. Conf. Comput.-Aided Des., Nov. 2005, pp.745-752). Compared with the postfloorplanning optimization approach, integrating TVP into floorplanning process can reduce T-vias by 16 % with 21 % runtime overhead.", "paper_title": "Efficient thermal via planning approach and its application in 3-D floor-planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000245190500004"}
