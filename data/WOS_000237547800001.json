P-k, the letters P-1..... P-k occur in the window, in the same order as in mi, but not necessarily consecutivelv (they may be interleaved with other letters). Our main contribution here is an algorithm solving this problem on-line in time O(nq) with an MP-RAM model (which is a RAM model equipped with extra operations'). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
