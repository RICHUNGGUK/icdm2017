The new algorithms establish parallel, conventional PLS models based on all intervals of a set of spectra to take advantage of the information from the whole spectrum by incorporating parallel models in a way to emphasize intervals highly related to the target property. It is theoretically and experimentally illustrated that the predictive ability of these two stacked methods combining all subsets or intervals of the whole spectrum is never poorer than that of a PLS model based only on the best interval. These two stacking algorithms generate more parsimonious regression models with better predictive power than conventional PLS, and perform best when the spectral information is neither isolated to a single, small region, nor spread uniformly over the response. A simulation data set is employed in this work not only to demonstrate this improvement, but also to demonstrate that stacked regressions have the potential capability of predicting property information from an outlier spectrum in the prediction set. Moisture, oil, protein and starch in Cargill corn samples have been successfully predicted by these new algorithms, as well as hydroxyl number for different instruments of terpolymer samples including and excluding an outlier spectrum.
