To solve this complex problem, in this study first we propose the use of a general linear tril.evel programming (LTLP) subsequently, we develop a trilevel Kth-best algorithm to solve LTLP problems. A user-friendly trilevel decision support tool is also developed. A case study further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
