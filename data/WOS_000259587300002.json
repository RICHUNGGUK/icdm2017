By means of the finite element method, enhanced non-linear macroscopic constitutive laws are developed by taking into account changes in micro-structural configuration associated with the growth of micro-cracks and with contact between crack faces. Numerical simulations are carried out for the cases of a porous composite with edge cracks and of a debonded fibre reinforced composite, loaded along extension/compression uniaxial macro-strain paths. Micro-crack propagation is modelled by using an original methodology based on the J-integral technique in conjunction with an interface model taking into account the unilateral contact of crack faces. In the context of a micro-to-macro transition obtained by controlling the macro-deformation of the micro-structure, the effects of adopting three types of boundary conditions on the macroscopic constitutive law, namely linear deformation, uniform tractions and periodic deformations and anti-periodic tractions, are studied. As a consequence, the proposed method can be applied to a large class of problems including periodic, locally periodic and irregular composite materials. Micro-crack and contact evolution result in a progressive loss of stiffness and can lead to failure for homogeneous macro-deformations associated with unstable crack propagation.
