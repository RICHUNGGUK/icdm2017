The approach uses a lightweight ontology augmented with modifiers, contexts, and atomic conversions between the contexts. The WSDL descriptions of Web services are annotated to establish correspondences to the ontology. Given the naive Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) specification of the desired Web services composition with data interpretation conflicts, the approach can automatically detect the conflicts and produce the corresponding mediated BPEL. Finally, we develop a prototype to validate and evaluate the approach.", "paper_title": "A Context-Based Approach to Reconciling Data Interpretation Conflicts in Web Services Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000329031000001"}
