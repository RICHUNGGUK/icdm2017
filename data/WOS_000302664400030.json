In order to identify these dsDNA binding antibodies, the protein sequences of 42 dsDNA binding and 608 non-dsDNA binding antibodies were extracted from Kabat database and coded using five different physicochemical properties of their amino acids. Coded antibodies were used as the training patterns for five parallel general regression neural networks (GRNNs). Comparing the results obtained by the proposed method with other published results shows the efficacy of proposed approach.", "paper_title": "RECOGNIZING PATHOGENIC ANTIBODIES IN SLE USING GENERAL REGRESSION NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400030"}
