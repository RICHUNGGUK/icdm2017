The first stage of the receiver, utilizing the inherent structure of the STBC, consists of a bank of soft generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC)-based detectors, each for every STBC block, and intends to yield a more precise initial estimate of the transmitted symbols. In the second stage, the groupwise detection is conducted successively by using the matched filters (MFs) to simultaneously detect the two consecutive symbols in one STBC block with the removal of the soft interferences in between. Since the interferences have been faithfully reproduced and thoroughly annihilated, the new receiver can yield accurate symbol detection even with simple MFs. Moreover, some extreme cases regarding the soft information employed in the new receiver and its extension to the multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink are addressed as well. Conducted simulations show that the developed receiver, with modest computational load, can provide superior performance compared with pervious works, especially in the MU MIMO downlink.
