An approximate length of the digital curve is determined by calculating the length of the continuous B-spline curve. In the paper several examples are presented and the calculated lengths are compared to other methods found in the literature. The advantage of the proposed method is in the approximation of the digital curve with the continuous curve rather than with piecewise linear sections used by most other methods.", "paper_title": "Digital Curve Length Calculation by Using B-spline", "paper_id": "WOS:000281787900005"}
