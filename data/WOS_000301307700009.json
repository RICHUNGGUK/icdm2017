The batch centrifuges are the units in charge of mechanically separating the former from the latter guaranteeing the quality and efficiency of the process. A realistic first principles model of a batch sugar centrifuge is described in the context of a Sugar House object oriented generic library, specially designed for the training of control room personnel. The challenges posed by the hybrid continuous-discrete character of the model are particularly addressed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
