The SPADES project (Servicing Petascale Architectures and DistributEd System, 08-ANR-SEGI-025) is a consortium whose purpose is to promote new solutions to deal with a very large number of volatile and heterogeneous computing resources. For the aforementioned reasons, at the project's core, the service discovery has been envisioned as fully decentralized. More precisely, the proposed P2P service discovery system proposed within the SPADES project is based on the DLPT approach (Distributed Lexicographic Placement Table) providing distributed structures and algorithms for such a feature. In this paper, an implementation of the DLPT concepts into the middleware developed within the SPADES project, called SBAM (Spades BAsed Middleware), is devised. Furthermore, its actual deployment over a nation-wide grid system, as well as its performance are detailed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
