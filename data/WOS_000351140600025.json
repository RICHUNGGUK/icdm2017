This can be done by integrating in the ANN model all the available knowledge about the wear mechanism. This kind of model is referred to as a semi-physical neural model. One of the main advantages in building a semi-physical neural model is that its number of parameters is reduced compared with a standard ANN model. This is a very favourable property against the over-fitting inconvenience. In addition, via appropriate nonlinear transformations, the semi-physical neural model can be rendered linear with respect to the parameters that are to be determined. Consequently, a simple least square approximation can be used to determine the unknown parameters.", "paper_title": "Semi-physical neural network model for fretting wear estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351140600025"}
