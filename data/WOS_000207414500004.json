We review our early work in expressing object-oriented concepts based on the new Fortran90 constructs-foreign to most programmers at the time-our experimental work in applying them to various applications, the impact on the WG5/J3 standards committees to consider formalizing object-oriented constructs for later versions of Fortran, and work in exploring how other modern programming techniques such as Design Patterns can and have impacted our software development. Applications will be drawn from plasma particle simulation and finite element adaptive mesh refinement for solid earth crustal deformation modeling.", "paper_title": "The transition and adoption to modern programming concepts for scientific computing in Fortran", "paper_id": "WOS:000207414500004"}
