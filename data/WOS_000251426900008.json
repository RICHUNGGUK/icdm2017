Bibliometric maps showing the associations between the main concepts in the field are provided for the periods 1996-2000 and 2001-2005. Both the current structure of the field and the evolution of the field over the last decade are analyzed. In addition, a number of emerging areas in the fild are identified. It turns out that the computational intelligence can best be seen as a field that is structured around four important types of problems, namely control problems, classification problems, regression problemsm and optimization problems. Within the computational intelligence field, the neural networks and fuzzy systems sudfields are fairly intertwined, whereas the evolutionary computation subfield has a relatively independent postion.", "paper_title": "Bibliometric mapping of the computational intelligence field", "paper_id": "WOS:000251426900008"}
