This method considers human gait as a dynamical system and employs a few singular values obtained by means of Singular Spectrum Analysis applied to scalar measurements from the inertial sensor. Singular values can be interpreted as the approximate edge length of the bounding box wrapping the attractor in the latent space. Effects of different parameters on the gait recognition performance using patterns from 20 different subjects are analysed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
