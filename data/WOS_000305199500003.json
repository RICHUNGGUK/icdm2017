Therefore, the multicriteria evaluation of manufacturers according to environmentally consciousness may give important outputs for the government, companies and consumers. This study presents a framework for multicriteria evaluation of manufacturers. Initially the criteria for being an environmentally conscious manufacturer are determined and their importance ranking is maintained by using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Subsequently, the most important criteria are chosen and set as input variables for a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to get output values representing environmentally consciousness scores of manufacturers. The proposed multicriteria evaluation method is experimented with an numerical illustration The results of the numerical illustration implies that, the most important criteria for being an environmentally conscious manufacturer are; life cycle analysis, design for environment, environmentally conscious process planning, recycling and reducing the waste ate the source.", "paper_title": "Multicriteria Evaluation of Environmentally Conscious Manufacturers Under Fuzzy Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000305199500003"}
