Measurements show a 198 % locking range (6 MHz-1.3 GHz) for both division ratios at room temperature, covering the MICS band and 433 and 915 MHz ISM bands while consuming only 4.07 mu W from a 1 V supply at 400 MHz. The wide locking range and low power consumption makes it very suitable for ultra-low-power wireless systems. The divider is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process and occupies 45 mu m(2) of area.", "paper_title": "A 4 mu W dual-modulus frequency divider with 198 % locking range for MICS band applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000022"}
