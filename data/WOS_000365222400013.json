To cope with this reliability threat, we present an \"on-line transition-time binning method\" that aims to continuously detect excessive transition time occurring at a target die-to-die interconnect. Our method attaches a monitor to the termination end of each target interconnect. Any transition (rising or falling) is converted into a pulse-width first, which is then further compared to a dynamically tunable threshold for a binary pass/fail judgment. By multiple runs of transition-time monitoring while sweeping the threshold incrementally, the \"transition-time bin\" of each target interconnect can be derived and thereby a timing failure threat can be detected by a monitor center before it actually strikes.", "paper_title": "Nonintrusive On-Line Transition-Time Binning and Timing Failure Threat Detection for Die-to-Die Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000365222400013"}
