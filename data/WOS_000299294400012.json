In this paper, we investigate the joint power control, channel assignment, and radio interface selection for robust provisioning of link bandwidth in infrastructure multiradio multichannel wireless networks in presence of channel variability and external interference. To characterize the logical relationship between spatial contention constraints and transmit power, we formulate the joint power control and radio-channel assignment as a generalized disjunctive programming problem. The generalized Benders decomposition technique is applied for decomposing the radio-channel assignment (combinatorial constraints) and network resource allocation (continuous constraints) so that the problem can be solved efficiently. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution within a finite number of iterations. We have evaluated our scheme using traces collected from two wireless testbeds and simulation studies in Qualnet. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing schemes in providing larger interference margin, and reducing outage and packet loss probabilities.", "paper_title": "Robust Topology Engineering in Multiradio Multichannel Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299294400012"}
