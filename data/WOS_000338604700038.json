Analyzing this conduction facilitates the forecasting of future traffic situation; therefore, a navigation system can reduce traffic congestion and improve transportation mobility. This study describes a methodology for traffic conduction analysis modeling based on extracting important time-related conduction rules using a type of evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Network Programming (GNP). The extracted rules construct a useful model for forecasting future traffic situations and analyzing traffic conduction. The proposed methodology was implemented and experimentally evaluated using a large scale real-time traffic simulator, SOUND/4U. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
