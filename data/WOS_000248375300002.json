In this short paper, we provide a simple proof for the construction of a priority queue with a switch and fiber delay lines in Sarwate and Anantharam (Queueing Syst. Theory Appl. 53, 115-125, 2006). Our proof not only gives the insights needed to understand why such a construction works, but also leads to a more general result that recovers the result in Sarwate and Anantharam (Queueing Syst. Theory Appl. 53, 115-125, 2006) as a special case.", "paper_title": "A simple proof for the constructions of optical priority queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000248375300002"}
