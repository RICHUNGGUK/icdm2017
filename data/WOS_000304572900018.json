Avoiding the effects of inter symbol interference (ISI) over delay spread by the multipath fading channel is a primary purpose in the letter. To do this, the ISI-corrupted CP is excluded when a correlation function is devised for both schemes, achieving the improved performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods, the performance is compared with the conventional method and is evaluated by the mean square error (MSE), acquisition range of CFO, and complexity comparison.", "paper_title": "Joint Symbol Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Mobile-WiMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900018"}
