Both aspects of design and implementation of the algorithm are described using simulations on the ns-2 network simulator. The design stage is composed of two steps. First, a recursive system identification approach is proposed to capture the network delay dynamics from TCP source view. Second, the proposed modeling is employed to develop an adaptive model predictive TCP congestion control strategy in the absence of any explicit congestion notification. The characteristics and performance of AMP-TCP are investigated using several network simulations. Finally a modified version of the AMP-TCP, called Vegas-Like AMP-TCP, is proposed and compared with the well known TCP Vegas algorithm in term of providing the desired number of buffered in-flight packets in the network.
