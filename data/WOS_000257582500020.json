In this paper, we propose a framework to represent, compute, and reason about temporal relationships between such events. Since our model is based on fuzzy orderings of time points, it is not only suitable to express precise relationships between imprecise events (\"Roosevelt died before the beginning of the Cold War\") but also imprecise relationships (\"Roosevelt died just before the beginning of the Cold War\"). We show that, unlike previous models, our model is a generalization that preserves many of the properties of the 13 relations Allen introduced for crisp time intervals. Furthermore, we show how our model can be used for efficient fuzzy temporal reasoning by means of a transitivity table. Finally, we illustrate its use in the context of question answering systems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzifying Allen's temporal interval relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500020"}
