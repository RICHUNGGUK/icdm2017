The time delay is assumed to be of interval type. Attention is focused on the design of delay-dependent filters that guarantee the asymptotic stability in mean square and a prescribed noise attenuation level in an H sense for the filtering error dynamics. The delay-dependent H filter design scheme is proposed in terms of a linear matrix inequality. A numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "H infinity filtering for stochastic systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000283876900020"}
