The original host image is separated into overlapping blocks, to which the DCT is applied. Direct current (DC) coefficients are extracted from the transformed blocks to form a DC-map. A series of random positions are selected on the map and SVD is performed to construct an ownership share which is used for copyright verification. Simulation results are carried out, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed scheme against different image-manipulation attacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
