The conventional video streaming optimization methods generally neglect the harmony among different networking protocol layers. This paper proposes a cross-layer optimized texture plus depth based scalable 3D video streaming method to improve the expected 3D visual experience of the user by systematically considering the application layer texture-video/depth/FEC bit-rate allocation, MAC layer multi-channel allocation, and physical layer modulation and channel coding scheme (MCS) selection. In the cross-layer optimization, a networking-related 3D visual experience model which fuses the overlapped retinal view visual quality and depth sensation with mimicking human vision system is established to predict the 3D visual experience under the specific parameter configurations of different protocol layers. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed cross-layer optimized 3D video streaming method has been validated by subjective and objective experimental results. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
