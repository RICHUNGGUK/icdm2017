This method has the potential to produce realistic ambulatory estimations of those parameters during unconstrained walking. In this work, we want to evaluate the crude estimations of mean step length so obtained, for their possible application in the construction of an ambulatory walking distance measurement device. Two methods have been tested with a set of volunteers in 20 m excursions. Experimental results show that estimations of walking distance can be obtained with sufficient accuracy and precision for most practical applications (errors of 3.66 +/- 6.24 and 0.96 +/- 5.55%), the main difficulty being inter-individual variability (biggest deviations of 19.70 and 15.09% for each estimator). Also, the results indicate that an inverted pendulum model for the displacement during the single stance phase, and a constant displacement per step during double stance, constitute a valid model for the travelled distance with no need of further adjustments. It allows us to explain the main part of the erroneous distance estimations in different subjects as caused by fundamental limitations of the simple inverted pendulum approach.", "paper_title": "Ambulatory estimation of mean step length during unconstrained walking by means of COG accelerometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000272995400011"}
