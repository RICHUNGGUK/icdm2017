However, existing generic constructions focus on asymptotic gate count and circuit depth rather than actual values, producing fairly large circuits not optimized for specific C and M values. In this work, we develop such optimizations in a bottom-up fashion, starting with most convenient C values. When zero-initialized ancilla registers are available, we reduce the search for compact circuits to a shortest-path problem. Some of our modular-multiplication circuits are asymptotically smaller than previous constructions, but worst-case bounds and average sizes remain Theta(n(2)). In the context of modular exponentiation; we offer several constant-factor improvements, as well as an improvement by a constant additive term that is significant for few-qubit circuits arising in ongoing laboratory experiments with Shor's algorithm.", "paper_title": "CONSTANT-OPTIMIZED QUANTUM CIRCUITS FOR MODULAR MULTIPLICATION AND EXPONENTIATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000304380700001"}
