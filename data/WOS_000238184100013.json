This paper outlines guidelines and a step-by-step methodology on how VoIP can be deployed successfully. The methodology can be used to assess the support and readiness of an existing network. Prior to the purchase and deployment of VoIP equipment, the methodology predicts the number of VoIP calls that can be sustained by an existing network while satisfying QoS requirements of all network services and leaving adequate capacity for future growth. As a case study, we apply the methodology steps on a typical network of a small enterprise. We utilize both analysis and simulation to investigate throughput and delay bounds. Our analysis is based on queueing theory, and OPNET is used for simulation. Results obtained from analysis and simulation are in line and give a close match. In addition, the paper discusses many design and engineering issues. These issues include characteristics of VoIP traffic and QoS requirements, VoIP flow and call distribution, defining future growth capacity. and measurement and impact of background traffic.
