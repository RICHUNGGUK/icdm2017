The proposed facial surface description is based on a set of facial depth maps extracted by multiscale extended Local Binary Patterns (eLBP) and enables an efficient and accurate description of local shape changes; it thus enhances the distinctiveness of smooth and similar facial range images generated by preprocessing steps. The following matching strategy is SIFT-based and performs in a hybrid way that combines local and holistic analysis, robustly associating the keypoints between two facial representations of the same subject. As a result, the proposed approach proves robust to facial expression variations, partial occlusions, and moderate pose changes, and the last property makes our system registration-free for nearly frontal face models. The proposed method was experimented on three public datasets, i.e. FRGC v2.0, Gavab, and Bosphorus. It displays a rank-one recognition rate of 97.6% and a verification rate of 98.4% at a 0.001 FAR on the FRGC v2.0 database without any face alignment. Additional experiments on the Bosphorus dataset further highlight the advantages of the proposed method with regard to expression changes and external partial occlusions. The last experiment carried out on the Gavab database demonstrates that the entire system can also deal with faces under large pose variations and even partially occluded ones, when only aided by a coarse alignment process.", "paper_title": "3-D Face Recognition Using eLBP-Based Facial Description and Local Feature Hybrid Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000308711100012"}
