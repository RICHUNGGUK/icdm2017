However, only circuits that are mediated by specific GABAA receptors can selectively elicit OD plasticity, implying a role of local circuits involved in GABA inhibition in this process. In this study, in order to theoretically examine the effects of such local pathways associated with cortical inhibition on the induction of OD plasticity, we compared synaptic modification dynamics regulated by feedforward inhibition and those regulated by feedback inhibition. Feedforward inhibition facilitated competitive interactions between different groups of inputs conveying correlated activities, which were required for the emergence of experience-dependent plasticity. Conversely, feedback inhibition suppressed competitive interactions and prevented synapses from reflecting past sensory experience. Our results suggest that the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition regulates the timing and level of cortical plasticity by modulating competition among synapses. This result suggests an importance of activity-dependent competition in experience-dependent OD plasticity, which is in line with the results of previous experiments.", "paper_title": "A Model for Ocular Dominance Plasticity Controlled by Feedforward and Feedback Inhibition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738800014"}
