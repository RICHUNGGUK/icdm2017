But during compositing, how to discover suitable web services is a critical problem in design and implementing application-oriented web service technologies. The traditional keyword-based matchmaking approach is difficult to help developer to find suitable service. Current researches find that to attaching semantics to each registered service can help improve the precision of matchmaking. The improvement can help developer find more suitable service for business process. This paper proposes a novel approach of semantics-based matchmaking, which is named process-context aware matchmaking. The process-context aware matchmaking discovers the suitable service during web service composite modeling. During matchmaking, the approach utilizes not only semantics of technical process but also that of business process of a registered service, thus further improving the precision of matchmaking. We integrate the process-context aware matchmaking, with business-process-driven web service composition in an integrated development environment based on Eclipse. The performance evaluation shows that performance overhead of this novel approach is acceptable. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
