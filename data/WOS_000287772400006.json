We present a novel method for motion segmentation by learning the motion priors from exemplar motions to guide the segmentation. Instead of modeling the motion field explicitly, we decompose each video frame into a number of local patches and learn the spatio-temporal contextual relations among them, e.g., if their motion relationships are consistent with that from the training data. Based on a novel motion feature to measure the relative motion of two patches, the SVM classifier learns their pairwise relationship. We convert the motion segmentation problem to a binary labeling problem, and propose an iterative solution to group the local patches whose motions are consistent. Compared with other approaches, such as the graph cut and normalized cut methods, this new method is computationally more efficient and is able to better handle the inaccurate inference of pairwise relationships. Results on both synthesized and real videos show that our method can learn to segment different types of complex motion patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
