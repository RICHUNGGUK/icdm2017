Different damaging mechanisms in tension and compression are considered. The plastic flow is described by introducing a suitable yield function and evolution laws in terms of effective stresses. Small strain and displacement assumptions hold. A 4-node finite element is formulated with three degrees-of-freedom for each node and a predictor-corrector procedure is used to solve the damage-plastic evolutionary problem. The lateral response of walls under monotonic and cyclic horizontal actions is analyzed and a satisfactory description of the global response curves and damaging mechanisms is obtained.
