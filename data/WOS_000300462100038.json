This FSI-based model is established by loosely coupling a finite element method (FEM)-based computational structural dynamic (CSD) model and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD)-based insect dynamic flight simulator. The CSD model is developed specifically for insect flapping flight, which is capable to model thin shell structures of insect flexible wings by taking into account the distribution and anisotropy in both wing morphology involving veins, membranes, fibers and density, and in wing material properties of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios. The insect dynamic flight simulator that is based on a multi-block, overset grid, fortified Navier-Stokes solver is capable to integrate modeling of realistic wing-body morphology, realistic flapping-wing and body kinematics, and unsteady aerodynamics in flapping-wing flights. Validation of the FSI-based aerodynamics and structural dynamics in flexible wings is achieved through a set of benchmark tests and comparisons with measurements, which contain a heaving spanwise flexible wing, a heaving chordwise-flexible wing with a rigid teardrop element, and a realistic hawkmoth wing rotating in air. A FSI analysis of hawkmoth hovering with flapping flexible wings is then carried out and discussed with a specific focus on the in-flight deformation of the hawkmoth wings and hovering aerodynamic performances with the flexible and rigid wings. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the present FSI model in accurately modeling and quantitatively evaluating flexible-wing aerodynamics of insect flapping flight in terms of the aerodynamic forces, the power consumption and the efficiency.
