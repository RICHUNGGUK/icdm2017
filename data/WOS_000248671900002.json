This allow us to start from prototypes considering the interaction between input and output variables and taking into account the fuzzy nature of the TSK rules. To do so, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm based on MOGUL (a methodology to obtain Genetic Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems under the Iterative Rule Learning approach) has been developed to consider the interaction between input and output variables. The first stage performs a local identification of prototypes to obtain a set of initial local semantics-based TSK rules, following the Iterative Rule Learning approach and based on an evolutionary generation process within MOGUL (taking as a base some initial linguistic fuzzy partitions). Because this generation method induces competition among the fuzzy rules, a post-processing stage to improve the global system performance is needed. Two different processes are considered at this stage, a genetic niching-based selection process to remove redundant rules and a genetic tuning process to refine the fuzzy model parameters. The proposal has been tested with two real-world problems, achieving good results.
