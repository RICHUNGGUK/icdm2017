A knowledge based intelligent control method is proposed to coordinate the autonomous actions of the two teleoperated robots. In this method, each intelligent agent of the teleoperated robots has a model of other robots and a knowledge base of the task in a virtual distributed graphic predictive display system. Based on minimum distance query and collision detection, the autonomous motion of each robot is then planned via knowledge based reasoning to accomplish the given task. Experimental simulation results show that the method is effective for multiple robots to work coordinately.", "paper_title": "Intelligent coordinated control of multiple teleoperated robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900137"}
