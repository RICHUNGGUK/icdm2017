Design/methodology/approach - The proposed algorithms are related to the analysis of electrical machines using the methods of equivalent magnetic networks. The presented permeance and reluctance networks are formulated using FE methods. Attention is paid to the algorithms of electromagnetic torque calculation for 3D models. The virtual work principle is applied. The principle is adapted to the discrete network models. The network representations of Maxwell's stress formula are given. Findings - The proposed method of electromagnetic torque calculation can be successfully applied in the 3D calculations of rotating electrical machines. It can be used for scalar and vector potential formulations. The obtained results and their comparison with the measurements show that the method is sufficiently accurate. Originality/value - The presented formulas of electromagnetic torque calculation are universal and can be successfully applied in the FE analysis of electrical machines using nodal and edge elements.", "paper_title": "Electromagnetic torque calculation using magnetic network methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300003"}
