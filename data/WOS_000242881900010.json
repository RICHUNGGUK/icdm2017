The BPNN classifier performance exceeded that of random chance, with asymmetric 95% confidence intervals for A. (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) = (0.7532, 0.7790). Separation of current and former smokers was imperfect, as illustrated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, performance did not exceed that of a comparison classifier created using logistic regression. Attribute subset selection identified three novel attributes related to smoking cessation status. This study establishes the ability of backpropagation neural networks to classify a complex health behavior, smoking cessation. It also illustrates the hypothesis-generating capacity of data mining methods when applied to large population-based health survey data. Ultimately, BPNN classifiers of smoking cessation status may be useful in decision support systems for smoking cessation interventions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
