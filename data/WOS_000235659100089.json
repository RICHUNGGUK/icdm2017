The high usability of the Web service is becoming a new focus for research. According to the demands of Web services, we present a fault-tolerant Web services architecture named FTWS based on the service approach and the reflection approach. Its characteristics are: (1) The fault-tolerant mechanisms are transparent, easy to use and also flexibly customized; (2) The fault-tolerant properties are flexibly configured; (3) The target service programmers almost needn't to care the fault-tolerant mechanisms. The Architecture is set forth in detail in the article. The workflow of the system is narrated by three states of a fault-tolerant Web service.", "paper_title": "A fault-tolerant web services architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100089"}
