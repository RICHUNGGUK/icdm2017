Postural kyphosis in adolescence, which is an excessive rounding of the upper spine, may be one of the effects of poor standing and sitting habits. A smart garment, consisting of a harness and two data-sensor loggers, was developed to monitor and provide vibration feedback to wearers to improve their posture during daily activities. Laboratory tests verified that the garment could provide an accuracy of 2 +/- A 2A degrees during static measurement and 3 +/- A 2A degrees during stable or slowly changing posture activities and 4 +/- A 4A degrees during rapidly changing posture activities. Four volunteers wore the system for 3 h per day and for 4 consecutive days. The feedback was provided on the last 2 days and the kyphotic angle reduced by 8 +/- A 1A degrees and 8 +/- A 2A degrees on the last 2 days, respectively. Although the long-term effects of reminding the subjects' posture is still not clear, a short-term result shows promise that the smart garment may be able to improve the kyphosis.", "paper_title": "Development of a smart garment to reduce kyphosis during daily living", "paper_id": "WOS:000311510700005"}
