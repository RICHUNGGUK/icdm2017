First, we investigate the GLRAM and its associated coupled subspace analysis and then propose a new simplified algorithm, which is named as SGLRAM aiming at deriving the projection matrices for GLRAM. We implement all these algorithms (GLRAM SGLRAM) for face recognition on the ORL and YaleB databases and the experiments show that the SGLRAM can produce comparable high performance compared to the approached of two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) and GLRAM. However, it will cost much less time than the GLRAM in training and save more space than the 2DPCA in testing.
