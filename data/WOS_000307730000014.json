Kids, and Ask Kids on 30 queries that children formulated to find information for specific tasks. Retrieved hits on given queries were benchmarked to Google's and Yahoo! Kids' top-five ranked hits retrieved. Relevancy of hits was judged on a graded scale; precision was calculated using the precision-at-ten metric (P@10). Yahoo! and Bing produced a similar percentage in hit overlap with Google (nearly 30%), but differed in the ranking of hits. Ask Kids retrieved 11% in hit overlap with Google versus 3% by Yahoo! Kids. The engines retrieved 26 hits across query clusters that overlapped with Yahoo! Kids' top-five ranked hits. Precision (P) that the engines produced across the queries was P?=?0.48 for relevant hits, and P?=?0.28 for partially relevant hits. Precision by Ask Kids was P?=?0.44 for relevant hits versus P?=?0.21 by Yahoo! Kids. Bing produced the highest total precision (TP) of relevant hits (TP?=?0.86) across the queries, and Yahoo! Kids yielded the lowest (TP?=?0.47). Average precision (AP) of relevant hits was AP?=?0.56 by leading engines versus AP?=?0.29 by small engines. In contrast, average precision of partially relevant hits was AP?=?0.83 by small engines versus AP?=?0.33 by leading engines. Average precision of relevant hits across the engines was highest on two-word queries and lowest on one-word queries. Google performed best on natural language queries; Bing did the same (P?=?0.69) on two-word queries. The findings have implications for search engine ranking algorithms, relevance theory, search engine design, research design, and information literacy.", "paper_title": "Ranking, relevance judgment, and precision of information retrieval on children's queries: Evaluation of Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Yahoo!
