We have created DynaLearn, an intelligent learning environment that allows learners to acquire conceptual knowledge by constructing and simulating qualitative models of how systems behave. DynaLearn uses diagrammatic representations for learners to express their ideas. The environment is equipped with semantic technology components that are capable of generating knowledge-based feedback and virtual characters that enhance the interaction with learners. Teachers have created course material, and successful evaluation studies have been performed. This article presents an overview of the DynaLearn system.", "paper_title": "DynaLearn - An Intelligent Learning Environment for Learning Conceptual Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000336892000005"}
