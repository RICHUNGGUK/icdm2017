A coverage balancing based trust evaluation method for wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. First, nodes update the trust value of its neighbors by the neighbors' behaviors, and then we update working nodes through sleep mechanism to ensure the uniform distribution and the coverage density. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve nodes' lifetime, and it has higher detection rate and lower false alert rate compared with other trust evaluation methods, so it can ensure the network run safely.", "paper_title": "Coverage Balancing Based Trust Evaluation Method for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200035"}
