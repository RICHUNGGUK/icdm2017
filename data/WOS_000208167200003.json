We show that the problem, when simplified, is amenable to formal optimization techniques such as integer linear programming. However, the simplification process may lead to inaccurate models. To test the overall methodology, we feed the resulting architectures to VPR 5.0 and quantify their performance in comparison with traditional design methodologies. Our results show that the resulting architectures are better than those found using parameter sweep techniques. In addition, we show that these architectures can be further improved by combining the accuracy of VPR 5.0 with the efficiency of analytical techniques. This is achieved using a closed loop framework which iteratively refines the analytical model using the place and route outputs from VPR.", "paper_title": "Efficient Heterogeneous Architecture Floorplan Optimization using Analytical Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000208167200003"}
