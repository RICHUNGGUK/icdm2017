Importance sampling is efficient when the proposal sample distribution is well-suited to the form of the integrand but fails otherwise. The main reason is that the sample location information is not exploited. All sample values are given the same importance regardless of their proximity to one another. Two samples falling in a similar location will have equal importance whereas they are likely to contain redundant information. The Bayesian approach we propose in this paper uses both the location and value of the data to infer an integral value based on a prior probabilistic model of the integrand. The Bayesian estimate depends only on the sample values and locations, and not how these samples have been chosen. We show how this theory can be applied to the final gathering problem and present results that clearly demonstrate the benefits of Bayesian Monte Carlo.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian Monte Carlo Approach to Global Illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000272569400025"}
