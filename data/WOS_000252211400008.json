We aim to improve the accuracy of raindrop detection by averaging the test images and frame-matching the result Of raindrop detection in multiple adjoining frames. According to an evaluation experiment, raindrops were detected precisely enough for automatic wiper control by the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Detection of raindrops on a windshield from an in-vehicle video camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400008"}
