While random variability can be represented by probability distribution functions, imprecision (or partial ignorance) is better accounted for by possibility distributions (or families of probability distributions). Because practical situations of risk computation often involve both types of uncertainty, methods are needed to combine these two modes of uncertainty representation in the propagation step. A hybrid method is presented here, which jointly propagates probabilistic and possibilistic uncertainty. It produces results in the form of a random fuzzy interval. This paper focuses on how to properly summarize this kind of information; and how to address questions pertaining to the potential violation of some tolerance threshold. While exploitation procedures proposed previously entertain a confusion between variability and imprecision, thus yielding overly conservative results, a new approach is proposed, based on the theory of evidence, and is illustrated using synthetic examples.", "paper_title": "Joint propagation and exploitation of probabilistic and possibilistic information in risk assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241346100001"}
