This paper extensively reviews operational modal analysis approaches and related system identification methods. First, the mathematical models employed in identification are related to the equations of motion, and their modal structure is revealed. Then, strategies that are common to the vast majority of identification algorithms are discussed before detailing some powerful algorithms. The extraction and validation of modal parameter estimates and their uncertainties from the identified system models is discussed as well. Finally, different modal analysis approaches and algorithms are compared in an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study.", "paper_title": "System Identification Methods for (Operational) Modal Analysis: Review and Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000300487300002"}
