The history of Romanian espionage begins with opposing sides intercepting messengers and letters, and proceeds chronologically to the most sophisticated mathematical methods of encryption and decryption. This article aims to capture the essential ingredients of the evolution of espionage in Romania, with emphasis on the Romanian contribution to the development of espionage, and to discuss both the benefits and disservices that espionage has brought to various groups, countries, and all of humanity. There is one certainty regarding this information: The push to develop more efficient methods of espionage has substantially contributed to the advancement of science and technology.", "paper_title": "A Historical Survey of Romanian Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000353113100001"}
