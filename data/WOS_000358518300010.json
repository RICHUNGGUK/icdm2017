When using deterministic OPE, the ciphertexts will reveal the distribution of relevance scores. Therefore, Wang et al. proposed a probabilistic OPE, called one-to-many OPE, for applications of searchable encryption, which can flatten the distribution of the plaintexts. In this paper, we proposed a differential attack on one-to-many OPE by exploiting the differences of the ordered ciphertexts. The experimental results show that the cloud server can get a good estimate of the distribution of relevance scores by a differential attack. Furthermore, when having some background information on the outsourced documents, the cloud server can accurately infer the encrypted keywords using the estimated distributions.", "paper_title": "Security Analysis on One-to-Many Order Preserving Encryption-Based Cloud Data Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000358518300010"}
