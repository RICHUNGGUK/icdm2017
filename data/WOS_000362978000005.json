Refractions make them hard to compute, since screen locality does not correlate with spatial locality in the medium. In this paper, we give a new method for accurate computation of single scattering effects in a participating media enclosed by refractive interfaces. Our algorithm is based on the observation that although radiance along each camera ray is irregular, contributions from individual triangles are smooth. Our method gives more accurate results than existing methods, faster. It uses minimal information and requires no pre-computation or additional data structures.", "paper_title": "Accurate Computation of Single Scattering in Participating Media with Refractive Boundaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000362978000005"}
