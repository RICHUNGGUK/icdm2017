In fact, traditional human to human (H2H) communications are gradually falling behind the scale of necessity. Consequently, machine to machine (M2M) communications have surpassed H2H, thus drawing significant interest from industry and the research community recently. This paper first presents a four-layer architecture for internet of things (IoT). Based on this architecture, we employ the second generation RFID technology to propose a novel intelligent system for M2M communications.", "paper_title": "Towards smart city: M2M communications with software agent intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000322787800009"}
