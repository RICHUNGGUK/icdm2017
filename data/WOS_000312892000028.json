This is known as heterogeneous face recognition. To solve this problem, we propose a new method called discriminative spectral regression (DSR). The DSR maps heterogeneous face images into a common discriminative subspace in which robust classification can be achieved. In the proposed method, the subspace learning problem is transformed into a least squares problem. Different mappings should map heterogeneous images from the same class close to each other, while images from different classes should be separated as far as possible. To realize this, we introduce two novel regularization terms, which reflect the category relationships among data, into the least squares approach. Experiments conducted on two heterogeneous face databases validate the superiority of the proposed method over the previous methods.", "paper_title": "Regularized Discriminative Spectral Regression Method for Heterogeneous Face Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000028"}
