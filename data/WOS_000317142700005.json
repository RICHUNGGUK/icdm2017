One approach, which has been proved to be efficient in the similar problem for graphs with distance constraints, is to study operations to construct a uniquely realizable graph from a smaller one. In this paper, we extend a result of Jackson and Jordan on the unique realizability preservingness of the so-called \"1-extension\" in dimension 2 to all dimensions.", "paper_title": "1-EXTENSIONS AND GLOBAL RIGIDITY OF GENERIC DIRECTION-LENGTH FRAMEWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317142700005"}
