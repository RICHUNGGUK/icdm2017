In this paper, a novel and efficient layered rhombus-chain-connected haptic deformation model based on physics is proposed for an excellent haptic rendering. During the modeling, the accumulation of relative displacements in each chain structure unit in each layer is equal to the deformation on the virtual object surface, and the resultant force of corresponding springs is equivalent to the external force. The layered rhombus-chain-connected model is convenient and fast to calculate, and can satisfy real-time requirement due to its simplicity. Experimental study in both homogenous and non-homogenous virtual human liver and lungs based on the proposed model are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our model provides stable and realistic haptic feeling in real time. Meanwhile, the display result is vivid.", "paper_title": "Layered rhombus-chain-connected model for real-time haptic rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000329294400003"}
