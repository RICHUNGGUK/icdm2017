A reversible watermarking approach recovers the original image from a watermarked image after extracting the embedded watermarks. Without loss of generality, the proposed scheme segments an image of size 2(N) x 2(N) adaptively to blocks of size 2(L) x 2(L), where L starts from a user-defined number to 1, according to their block structures. If possible, the differences between central ordered pixel and other pixels in each block are enlarged to embed watermarks. The embedded quantity is determined by the largest difference in a block and watermarks are embedded into LSB bits of above differences. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive block size scheme has higher capacity than conventional fixed block sized method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
