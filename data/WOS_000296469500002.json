Firstly, based on decomposition of state space, Cauchy convergence principle, and inequality technique, some sufficient conditions ensuring the local exponential stability of 2(N) equilibrium points are derived. Secondly, some conditions are obtained for ascertaining equilibrium points to be locally exponentially stable and to be located in any designated region. Thirdly, the theory is extended to more general saturated activation functions with 2 r corner points and a sufficient criterion is given under which the SOCNNs can have (r+1)(N) locally exponentially stable equilibrium points. Even if there is no second-order interactions, the obtained results are less restrictive than those in some recent works. Finally, three examples with their simulations are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Multistability of Second-Order Competitive Neural Networks With Nondecreasing Saturated Activation Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000296469500002"}
