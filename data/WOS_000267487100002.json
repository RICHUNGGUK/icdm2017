Marbling is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar to marble or other stone, hence the name. The system is based on the physical model of the traditional marbling process. We simulate real marbling by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on the graphics processing unit. We employ a third-order accurate but fast Unsplit semi-Lagragian Constrained Interpolation Profile method to reduce the numerical dissipation while retaining the stability. To simulate very sharp interface lines among different paints, a simple yet effective transformation function is applied to the paint concentrations. Several intuitive interfaces are implemented to provide flexible control for users. Extensive experimental results are shown to demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "AtelierM plus plus : a fast and accurate marbling system", "paper_id": "WOS:000267487100002"}
