The molecular weights, viscosities of each component and the diffusivities can be tuned separately. An exact calculation for relaxation times of the cross-collision terms is derived, which makes the model to be consistent with the Stefan-Maxwell equations. The derivation also demonstrates that the tuning-molecular-weight strategy is only available for the ternary diffusion. The expressions of the fluxes and the boundary conditions are proposed. A simulation of the one-dimensional diffusion demonstrates that the second-order interpolation is better than the first-order one to deal with the different lattice speed. The simulation of Couette flow shows that the model behaves like a single fluid with high Schmidt number, and the components tend to flow independently with small Schmidt number. The model is validated by the simulation of one-dimensional diffusion and two-dimensional opposed jet flow, where the LBM results coincide well with the results of the Stefan-Maxwell equations. Finally, the diffusion in a porous media is simulated as an example of the application of the model. This lattice Boltzmann model is suitable for simulating multi-component convection-diffusion problems with complex boundary conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
