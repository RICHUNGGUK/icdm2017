Analytical expressions for the effective coefficients are obtained for the case of layered materials using the theory of homogenisation. Some properties of the homogenised materials are analysed. An efficient algorithm for the numerical determination of the effective coefficients is proposed. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
