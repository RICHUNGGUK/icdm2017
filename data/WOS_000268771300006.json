The finite element method uses low-order mixed finite elements in the Darcy and Stokes domains and special transition elements near the Darcy-Stokes interface to allow for tangential discontinuities implied by the Beavers-Joseph boundary condition. We design a multigrid method to solve the resulting saddle point linear system. The intertwining of the Darcy and Stokes subdomains makes the resulting matrix highly ill-conditioned. The velocity field is very irregular, and its discontinuous tangential component at the Darcy-Stokes interface makes it difficult to define intergrid transfer operators. Our definition is based on mass conservation and the analysis of the orders of magnitude of the solution. The coarser grid equations are defined using the Galerkin method. A new smoother of Uzawa type is developed based on taking an optimal step in a good search direction. Our algorithm has a measured convergence factor independent of the size of the system, at least when there are no disconnected vugs. We study the macroscopic effective permeability of a vuggy medium, showing that the influence of vug orientation; shape; and, most importantly, interconnectivity determine the macroscopic flow properties of the medium.", "paper_title": "A discretization and multigrid solver for a Darcy-Stokes system of three dimensional vuggy porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000268771300006"}
