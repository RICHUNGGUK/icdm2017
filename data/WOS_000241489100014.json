The new design addresses high-level abstractions suited for component-based image processing applications, in particular real-time image processing with high performance demands. The RIM framework, an implementation of this design, is gone through. It is explained how RIM can be adapted in applications, and integrated with other image libraries. It is also shown how it can be used to confirm some properties of widely used image formats.", "paper_title": "The RIM framework for image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100014"}
