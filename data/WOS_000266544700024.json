Such projections are used to discuss correlations, metamorphic reactions and the chemical evolution of rocks, melts or minerals. It can also project data into 2D plots. The CMAS 3D interface makes it easy to use, and does not require any knowledge of Matlab (R) programming. CMAS 3D uses data compiled in a Microsoft Excel (TM) spreadsheet. Although useful for scientific research, the program is also a powerful tool for teaching. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
