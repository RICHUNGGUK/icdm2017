Various probability models have been proposed to solve this task. One such model is the Plackett-Luce model, which parameterizes the preference level of each item by a real value. In this letter, the Plackett-Luce model is generalized to cope with grouped ranking observations such as movie or restaurant ratings. Since it is difficult to maximize the likelihood of the proposed model directly, a feasible approximation is derived, and the em algorithm is adopted to find the model parameter by maximizing the approximate likelihood which is easily evaluated. The proposed model is extended to a mixture model, and two applications are proposed. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model, numerical experiments with real-world data are carried out.", "paper_title": "A Grouped Ranking Model for Item Preference Parameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000280563600007"}
