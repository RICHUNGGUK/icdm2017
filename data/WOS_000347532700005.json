The study analyzes the effects of several implementation decisions on the execution time of the resulting evolutionary algorithm. The implementation decisions studied include: memory utilization (using dynamic vs. static variables and local vs. global variables), methods for ordering the population, code substitution mechanisms, and the routines for generating pseudorandom numbers within the evolutionary algorithm. The results obtained in the experimental analysis allow us to conclude that significant improvements in efficiency can be gained by applying simple guidelines to best program an evolutionary algorithm in C.
