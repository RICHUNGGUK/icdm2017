Among compounds with a P-C-P linkage, the most stable one is the 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphosphirene II.1, a three-membered heterocycle with a P=C unsaturation. The phosphavinylidene(oxo)phosphorane HP=C=P(O)H IV.5 (which has the same skeleton as the experimentally obtained Mes*P=C=P(O)Mes*) lies 36.30 kcal mol(-1) above it. The least stable compounds are carbenes; the singlet carbenes are more stable than the triplet ones.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of structural patterns in CH2OP2 isomers", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600018"}
