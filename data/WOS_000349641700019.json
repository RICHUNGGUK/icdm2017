Also, single/multi-objective optimizations are performed for a case-study machine with surface-mounted permanent magnets. Design/methodology/approach - First, an accurate magnetic equivalent circuit is developed which takes all the material such as iron saturation and PM parameters into account. Then, through a Fourier analysis, it is combined with the d-q model of PM synchronous machines to achieve an optimization framework including the developed torque, back-EMF and a number of design considerations. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed in the single/multi-objective design optimizations, which offers several design characteristics upon different desired outcomes. Findings - An analytical design framework for the optimization of permanent-magnet synchronous machines is developed in this paper that can effectively account for all material properties such as iron saturation and PM characteristics, and take into account the design considerations, all of which are shown as superiorities of the proposed approach over the existing method. In addition, the proposed framework is relatively simpler in terms of implementing. The model is verified by employing finite element method. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the influence of the design parameters on the machine performance, which provides valuable information for the designer of such devices. Finally, a GA is utilized to perform single/multi-objective optimization schemes whose objectives are minimizing the torque ripples, back-EMF total harmonic distortion and PM volume. Originality/value - The proposed framework is new approach that could be employed in the design optimization of PM synchronous machines. Contrary to existing method, it is simpler and more effective in taking the material properties such as iron saturation and PM characteristics into account.", "paper_title": "Simple nonlinear MEC-based model for sensitivity analysis and genetic optimization of permanent-magnet", "paper_id": "WOS:000349641700019"}
