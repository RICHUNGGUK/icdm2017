However, advanced searching for resources remains an open issue. The flooding technique used by some P2P systems is expensive in bandwidth usage, and shows a serious lack in scalability. Also, more efficient systems based on distributed hash tables (DHT) lack in query expressiveness and flexibility. This paper addresses this issue by discussing existing solutions, and proposing a novel approach to support advanced multi-keyword queries in the context of P2P systems. It extends the existing, and widely established DHT-based localization frameworks. This new approach provides an effective resource localization framework; it can substantially reduce bandwidth consumption and improve load balancing over the network. Moreover, various kinds of applications can be deployed on top of this generic framework. As a relevant use case, this paper describes a novel service discovery and management application.", "paper_title": "Enhanced DHT-based P2P architecture for effective resource discovery and management", "paper_id": "WOS:000248756400004"}
