We call this a human/computer learning network, whose core is an active learning feedback loop between humans and machines that dramatically improves the quality of both and thereby continually improves the effectiveness of the network as a whole. In this article we explore how human/computer learning networks can leverage the contributions of human observers and process their contributed data with artificial intelligence algorithms leading to a computational power that far exceeds the sum of the individual parts.", "paper_title": "eBird: A Human/Computer Learning Network to Improve Biodiversity Conservation and Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000336891700002"}
