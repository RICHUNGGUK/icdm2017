In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm is designed to obtain Boolean functions satisfying all the needed criteria: high nonlinearity, 1-resiliency, optimal algebraic degree, optimal (or suboptimal) algebraic immunity, and good immunity to fast algebraic attacks. These functions provide a good trade-off among the criteria to resist the known cryptanalytic techniques.
