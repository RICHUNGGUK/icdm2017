We consider the form-one-lane rule and the merge-lane rule that decide which car moves ahead when two cars in two different lanes are in front of a junction. We simulate the proposed cellular automaton model for both rules, and generate fundamental diagrams and car distribution examples. Then, we analyze experimental results and demonstrate that the proposed model reflects the real world traffic flow with a junction according to the considered rules. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
