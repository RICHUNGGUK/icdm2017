This ability represents basic motivation for using human gait as the means for biometric identification. Such biometric can be captured at public places from a distance without subject's collaboration, awareness or even consent. Although current approaches give encouraging results, we are still far from effective use in practical applications. In general, methods set various constraints to circumvent the influence factors like changes of view, walking speed, capture environment, clothing, footwear, object carrying, that have negative impact on recognition results. In this paper we investigate the influence of walking speed variation to different visual based gait recognition approaches and propose normalization based on geometric transformations, which mitigates its influence on recognition results. With the evaluation on MoBo gait dataset we demonstrate the benefits of using such normalization in combination with different types of gait recognition approaches.", "paper_title": "Transformation Based Walking Speed Normalization for Gait Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500008"}
