The conventional transfer-function generalized sidelobe canceller employs the non-stationarity characteristics of the speech signal to estimate the relative transfer function and thus is difficult to apply when the noise is also non-stationary. Under the assumption of W-disjoint orthogonality between the speech and the non-stationary noise, the proposed algorithm finds the speech-dominant time-frequency bins of the input signal by inspecting the system output and the inter-microphone time delay. Only these bins are used to estimate the relative transfer function, so reliable estimates can be obtained under non-stationary noise conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of the transfer-function generalized sidelobe canceller, while only sustaining a modest estimation error in adverse non-stationary noise environments.", "paper_title": "Robust Relative Transfer Function Estimation for Dual Microphone-Based Generalized Sidelobe Canceller", "paper_id": "WOS:000272392700022"}
