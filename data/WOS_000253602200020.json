The uniqueness of the criterion lies in the fact that, unlike the standard criterion based on the likelihood ratio test, it is expressed in terms of a geometrical quantity, the Hellinger distance, on the space of probability measures. In this paper, we generalize the randomness criterion to a wider class of geometrical quantities, the alpha-divergences with -1 < alpha < 1. The nonextendibility of the criterion across the boundaries alpha = +/- 1 is investigated in connection with the likelihood ratio test and information geometry.", "paper_title": "Randomness criteria in terms of alpha-divergences", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200020"}
