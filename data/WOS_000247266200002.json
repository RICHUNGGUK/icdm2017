SOA simulation can play an important role in SOA software development as it can be used to verify the SOA application models and to demonstrate runtime and collaborative behaviors of the SOA applications. SOA simulation differs from traditional simulation as it emphasizes on reusability, collaborative behaviors, and its unique model-driven development. This paper focuses on these issues and illustrates how these can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation in service-oriented software development", "paper_id": "WOS:000247266200002"}
