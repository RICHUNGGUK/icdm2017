This architecture is implemented in current mode on unquantized samples, to achieve high dynamic range that is suitable for high frequency applications. DHWT is performed on the incoming samples which are available continuously from a real-time system. In this implementation, data converters are not needed, that leads to a reduction in complexity and savings in area.", "paper_title": "A discrete time continuous level VLSI architecture in current mode to implement Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700035"}
