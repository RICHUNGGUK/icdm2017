This paper proposes a CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) extension, based on the implementation of erasure coding schemes, within the CFDP itself, in order to assure high reliability to the data communication even in presence of very critical conditions, such as hard shadowing, deep-fading periods and intermittent links. Different encoding techniques are considered and various channel conditions, in terms of Bit Error Ratio and bandwidth values, are tested. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
