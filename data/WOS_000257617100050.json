Rather than relying oil domain experts, this study aims to develop a hybrid approach including a mathematical programming model to optimize the testing job scheduling and all algorithm to specify the machine configuration of each job and allocate specific resources. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is also developed to solve the problem in a short time for implementation. The results of detailed scheduling call be graphically represented as timetables of testing resources in Gantt charts. The empirical results demonstrated viability of the proposed approach.
