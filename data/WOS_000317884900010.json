UMOEA/D adopts the uniform design method to set the aggregation coefficient vectors of the subproblems. Compared with MOEA/D, distribution of the coefficient vectors is more uniform over the design space, and the population size neither increases nonlinearly with the number of objectives nor considers a formulaic setting. The experimental results indicate that UMOEA/D outperforms MOEA/D and NSGA-II on almost all these many-objective test instances, especially on problems with higher dimensional objectives and complicated Pareto set shapes. Experimental results also show that UMOEA/D runs faster than NSGA-II for the problems used in this paper. In additional, the results obtained are very competitive when comparing UMOEA/D with some other algorithm on the multiobjective knapsack problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
