The adaptive beamformer is the best method for geometric source separation, but it suffers from a \"target signal cancellation\" problem in multi-path situations. We modified the HALS-NMF algorithm for decomposition into bases, and developed an interference suppression module in order to cancel the interference bases. A performance comparison between the proposed and subband GSC-RLS algorithm using a MATLAB (R) simulation was executed; the results show that the proposed system is robust in multi-path situations.", "paper_title": "Geometric Source Separation Method Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Interference Suppression", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300047"}
