The constituent waveforms are Golay complementary waveform's which have ideal ambiguity along the zero Doppler axis but are sensitive to nonzero Doppler shifts. We extend this construction to multiple dimensions, in particular to radar polarimetry, where the two dimensions are realized by orthogonal polarizations. Here we determine a sequence of two-by-two Alamouti matrices where the entries involve Golay pairs and for which the range sidelobes associated with a matrix-valued ambiguity function vanish at modest Doppler shifts. The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence plays a key role in the construction of Doppler resilient sequences of Golay complementary waveforms.", "paper_title": "Doppler resilient Golay complementary waveforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913400026"}
