The platform can establish the types of location patterns of lap splices (called lapping patterns) for the longitudinal reinforcements; calculate the length of every reinforcement; arrange the same sized reinforcements by length in decreasing order; choose the proper stock lengths for bar cutting; and determine the best lapping pattern with optimal stock length by the trial and error method or the linear programming approach, which can yield the most economical way to supply a proper stock length for cutting. Finally, the platform can automatically generate the shop drawing and schedule the reinforcements, which may be very useful for building construction and management.
