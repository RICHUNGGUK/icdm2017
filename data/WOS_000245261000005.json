We formulate a condition on resource requesting processes, called solidity that guarantees successful termination. Processes that do not satisfy this condition can be modified to become solid. We investigate performance of the resource management policy proposed by comparing it to the theoretically found optimum for the special case. Our method can be applied in, for example, project management systems, orchestration software and workflow engines. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
