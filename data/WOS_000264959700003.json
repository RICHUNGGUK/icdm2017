This ALE method is based upon the operator-split technique in which the material displacements and mesh displacements are uncoupled. A brief history of the ALE method is first presented and then special issues such as time-stepping, mesh refinement, energy absorbing boundaries, dynamic equilibrium checks and remapping of state variables are explained. The ALE method and the updated-lagrangian (UL) method are then used to analyse some geotechnical problems to examine the significance of inertia effects, large deformation and contact mechanics. The results show the efficiency of the ALE method for solving dynamic geotechnical problems involving large deformation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
