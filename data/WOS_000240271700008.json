This pseudo-convex decomposition is significantly sparser than either convex decompositions or pseudo-triangulations for planar point sets and simple polygons. We also introduce pseudo-convex partitions and coverings. We establish some basic properties and give combinatorial bounds on their complexity. Our upper bounds depend on new Ramsey-type results concerning disjoint empty convex k-gons in point sets.", "paper_title": "Decompositions, partitions, and coverings with convex polygons and pseudo-triangles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700008"}
