Although any curve on a Loop surface corresponding to a regular edge path is usually a piecewise quartic polynomial curve, it is found that the curve can be reduced to a single cubic B-spline curve under certain constraints of the local control vertices. Given a set of cubic B-spline curves, it is therefore possible to define a Loop surface interpolating the input curves by enforcing the interpolation constraints. In order to produce a surface of local or global fair effect, an energy-based optimization scheme is used to update the control vertices of the Loop surface subjecting to curve interpolation constraints, and the resulting surface will exactly interpolate the given curves. In addition to curve interpolation, other linear constraints can also be conveniently incorporated. Because both Loop subdivision surfaces and cubic B-spline curves are popularly used in engineering applications, the curve interpolation method proposed in this paper offers an attractive and essential modeling tool for computer-aided design.
