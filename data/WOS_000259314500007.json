Let x* be an efficient point. We propose a procedure computing a tolerance for each objective function coefficient, such that all these coefficients may simultaneously and independently vary within their tolerances while preserving the efficiency of x*. If x* is a non-degenerate basic solution, then the procedure runs in a polynomial time. Our method is also applicable for the intervals of multiobjective linear programming for checking the necessary efficiency of x*, i.e. whether x* is efficient for all the realizations of interval values.", "paper_title": "Computing the tolerances in multiobjective linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000259314500007"}
