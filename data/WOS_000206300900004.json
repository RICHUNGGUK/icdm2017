This strategy cannot robustly adapt to frequent unpredictable topology changes due to high mobility. Constant reconnections incur significant overhead making these schemes unsuitable for applications such as voice and video. To address these issues, we explore a connectionless paradigm in this paper. By leverage GPS technology, data packets are relayed along the general direction to packets' destination using different intermediate nodes at different times without having to first establish a connection. The performance of this solution is essentially unaffected by node mobility.", "paper_title": "Connectionless protocol: a localised approach to wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000206300900004"}
