By means of this mixed formula we analyze the index of differential-algebraic models of nonlinear uncoupled circuits in a very broad setting, namely, without assumptions on their topology, their passivity or the controlling variables for nonlinear resistors. In particular, our approach allows for a characterization of index two circuits in topologically degenerate settings, which had been so far elusive in the non-passive context. As a byproduct we address the unique solvability of mixed resistive circuits, a problem which also arises in connection to the so-called DC-solvability condition of dynamic circuits. For the sake of brevity, we discuss in less detail how to extend the analysis to problems with mixed descriptions in reactive devices.", "paper_title": "INDEX AND SOLVABILITY OF UNCOUPLED CIRCUITS: A CHARACTERIZATION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PASSIVITY, TOPOLOGY OR CONTROLLING STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000336384400011"}
