However, very little is done on the privacy of collection and transmission of keyboard and mouse data. In this paper, we develop a rule based data sanitization scheme to detect and remove personally identifiable and other sensitive information from the collected data set. Preliminary experiments show that our scheme incurs on average 5.69 % false negative error rate and 0.64 % false positive error rate. We also develop a data transmission scheme using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to guarantee privacy during transmission. Using these two schemes as a basis, we develop two distinct architectures for providing secure and privacy preserving data processing support for active authentication. These architectures provide flexibility of use depending upon the application environment.", "paper_title": "Secure and privacy preserving data processing support for active authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000361523800004"}
