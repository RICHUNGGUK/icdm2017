A standard argument proves that Omega(root cn) time is required to route n messages, where each message is generated by a distinct node and at most c messages are to be delivered to any individual node. The obvious approach of simply replicating each message into the appropriate number of unicast (single-destination) messages and routing these independently does not yield an optimal algorithm. We provide both randomized and deterministic algorithms for multicast routing, which use constant-size buffers at each node. The randomized algorithm attains optimal performance, while the deterministic algorithm is slower by a factor of O(log(2)n). We also describe an optimal deterministic algorithm that, however, requires large buffers of size O(c).", "paper_title": "Store-and-forward multicast routing on the mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000254920900005"}
