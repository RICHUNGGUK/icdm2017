In forward modeling, the outputs ( also known as the responses) are expressed as the functions of input variables ( also called the process parameters), whereas in reverse modeling, the latter are represented as the functions of the former. The above modeling may be required for an effective on-line control of a process. Statistical regression analysis can tackle the problem of forward modeling efficiently but it may not be always able to solve the problem of reverse modeling. The present work is a novel attempt to carry out the forward and reverse modeling of the said welding process using fuzzy logic-based approaches. The developed soft computing-based approaches are found to solve the above problem efficiently.", "paper_title": "Forward and reverse modeling in MIG welding process using fuzzy logic-based approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000255211400003"}
