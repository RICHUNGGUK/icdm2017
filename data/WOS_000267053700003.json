However, many current field practices at construction sites still rely on manual processes for asset tracking and information handling. Previous technologies, such as radio frequency identification and global positioning systems, do not provide a solution to automated asset tracking because of their limitations in terms of applicability and performance in a typical construction environment. This paper introduces a new development of an embedded sensor system for construction asset tracking by combining radio and ultrasound signals. We present the detailed hardware and software architecture and have implemented outdoor experiments to examine the accuracy and performance of the designed system. The results obtained showed the accurate distance and position estimation with enhanced networking flexibility. The findings and lessons learned from this research demonstrate the potential for future practical deployment of similar systems in many civil engineering applications.", "paper_title": "Embedded System for Construction Asset Tracking Combining Radio and Ultrasound Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000267053700003"}
