The center manifold reduction and normal form method are employed to study the bifurcation from zero singularity. We show that the coupling strength can induce both the pitchfork and transcritical bifurcations and the coupled delay has the most significant impact on these bifurcations. An example is applied to display the above results. Our investigation will contribute to the understanding of the influence of the time delay in signal transmission on the dynamics of coupled neurons. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
