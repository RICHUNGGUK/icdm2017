This is a capital issue in the practice of software engineering, since the total budget and human resources involved must be managed opti-mally in order to end in a successful project. In short, companies are principally concerned with reducing the duration and cost of projects, and these two goals are in conflict with each other. In this work we tackle the problem by using genetic algorithms (GAs) to solve many different software project scenarios. Thanks to our newly developed instance generator we can perform structured studies on the influence the most important problem attributes have on the solutions. Our conclusions show that GAs are quite flexible and accurate for this application, and an important tool for automatic project management. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
