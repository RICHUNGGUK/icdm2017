The intention of the model is not only to suggest a certain ISDM, but also to propose the properties an ISDM should have to suite the project or the organisation. It is designed in a way that facilitates experimentation with different project, organisation and ISDM properties. Based on the model we created a tool that has been applied on several cases in which we validated the correctness of its recommendations and established that it can have a significant positive contribution in the process of ISDM selection and in the process of improvement of existing ISDM.", "paper_title": "Selecting a Methodology for Business Information Systems Development: Decision Model and Tool Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000302206000008"}
