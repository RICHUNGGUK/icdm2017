Adjustable speed drives are very sensitive to power quality problems in particular to voltage sags, short-duration reductions in the rms voltage. This paper presents a multi-drive management strategy to mitigate voltage sags based on the self-kinetic process energy recovery. Simulation and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposition. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
