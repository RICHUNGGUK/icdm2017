The inherent small transconductance of the bulk-driven devices is enlarged using a positive feedback, improving also the noise performance. The amplifier is designed using standard 0.18 mu m n-well CMOS process. Although the amplifier is optimized for 0.8 V supply voltage, it is also capable to operate under supply voltage of 0.7 V. The amplifier consumes 130 mu A, performing 56 dB open-loop gain, 154 nV/root Hz input-referred spot noise at 100 kHz, 80 dB CMRR at 100 kHz and IIP3 equal to -4.7 dBV.", "paper_title": "0.8 V bulk-driven operational amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000277095700007"}
