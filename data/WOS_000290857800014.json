From the analysis, we find that the entanglement dynamics of the three-qubit states depends not only on the coupling strength between the system and the environment and the number of degrees of freedom of the environment but also on the tunneling matrix elements of the spin environment and the specific state of concern. Specifically, the entanglement dynamics of the GHZ state, the W state, and the Werner state have been analyzed in detail and the conditions to identify the decoherence-free subspaces of our model have been discussed.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT DYNAMICS OF THREE-QUBIT STATES UNDER A SPIN ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800014"}
