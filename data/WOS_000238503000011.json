Discretizations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are derived based on discretizations of the Boltzmann equation and consideration for the low Mach number limit. In the incompressible Navier-Stokes limit the discretizations reduce to explicit high-order numerical schemes. Numerical results for several test cases and comparisons with other well-known approaches are also presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
