It is well known that the limit computable functions on naturals are exactly those computable with the oracle for the halting problem. However, prefix (Kolmogorov) complexities defined with respect to these two models may differ. We introduce and compare several natural variations of prefix complexity definitions based on generalized Turing machines embodying the idea of limit computability, as well as complexities based on oracle machines, for both finite and infinite sequences.", "paper_title": "Prefix-like complexities and computability in the limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100009"}
