In this paper, we consider a similar problem with topological knowledge but in a distributed broadcast channel setting, i.e., a network where transmitter cooperation is enabled. We show that the topological information can also be exploited in this case to strictly improve the degrees of freedom (DoF) as long as the network is not fully connected, which is a reasonable assumption in practice. Achievability schemes from graph theoretic and interference alignment perspectives are proposed. Together with outer bounds built upon generator sequence, the concept of compound channel settings, and the relation to index coding, we characterize the symmetric DoF for the so-called regular networks with constant number of interfering links, and identify the sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the arbitrary network topologies to achieve a certain amount of symmetric DoF.", "paper_title": "Topological Interference Management With Transmitter Cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500024"}
