In the case of multimedia data, such as images and videos, fast querying and processing of the available information requires the annotation of the multimedia data with semantic descriptors, that is, labels. However, only a small proportion of the available data are labeled. The rest should undergo an annotation-labeling process. The necessity for the creation of automatic annotation algorithms gave birth to label propagation and semi-supervised learning. In this study, basic concepts in graph-based label propagation methods are discussed. Methods for proper graph construction based on the structure of the available data and label inference methods for spreading label information from a few labeled data to a larger set of unlabeled data are reviewed. Applications of label propagation algorithms in digital media, as well as evaluation metrics for measuring their performance, are presented.", "paper_title": "Graph-Based Label Propagation in Digital Media: A Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000354046600011"}
