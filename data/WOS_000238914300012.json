Their approach to networking makes no assumption that nodes will have end-to-end connectivity, which could be missing with extremely high-latency connections, if the nodes are only in con tact with one another infrequently, or if contacts are being continually disrupted. They also describe the main protocols the group is developing and-give examples of some pilot networks that use these protocols.", "paper_title": "When TCP breaks - Delay- and disruption-tolerant networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000238914300012"}
