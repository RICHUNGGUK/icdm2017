The proof links the timing channel to the point-process channel with instantaneous noiseless feedback. This point-process approach enables a study of timing channels that arise in multiserver queues, queues in tandem, and other simple configurations. Although the capacities of such channels remain to be found, the paper provides some analytical bounds and highlights a method to find achievable rates via simulations.", "paper_title": "Capacity of queues via point-process channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000238319400028"}
