In this paper, a new approach to construct a bivariate rational interpolation over triangulation is presented, based on scattered data in parallel lines. The main advantage of this method comparing with the present interpolation methods have two points: (1) the interpolation function is carried out by a simple and explicit mathematical representation through the parameter alpha; (2) the shape of the interpolating surface can be modified by using the parameter for the unchanged interpolating data. Moreover, a local shape control method is employed to control the shape of surfaces. In the special case, the method of \"Barycenter Value Control\" is studied, and numerical examples are presented to show the performance of the method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
