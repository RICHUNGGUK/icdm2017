A new linearity calibration technique enables use of a nearly minimum capacitor limited by kT/C noise. The ADC core without digital control blocks has been fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and consumes 118 mu W at 1.8 V power supply. Also, the active area of ADC core is realized to be 0.027 mm(2). The calibration improves the SNDR by 13.4 dB and the SFDR by 21.0 dB. The measured SNDR and SFDR at 1 kHz input are 55.2 dB and 73.2 dB respectively.", "paper_title": "A 0.027-mm(2) Self-Calibrating Successive Approximation ADC Core in 0.18-mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000003"}
