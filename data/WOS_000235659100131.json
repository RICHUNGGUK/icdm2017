To fully sharing potentially useful information within entire enterprise, there are growing needs of a generic, interoperable, and flexible infrastructure to integrate and coordinate information across corporate and individual desktops on semantic or knowledge level. In this context, we introduce ESD, a desktop information sharing infrastructure based on Semantic Grid vision to achieve adaptive and intelligence information sharing across enterprise corporate and personal desktops. A primary framework for ESD is introduced based on the analysis of key criteria in realizing the vision of an infrastructure for information sharing, management, searching, and navigating on desktop grid. Focuses of this position paper are placed on the background, vision and the outline of ESD approach.", "paper_title": "ESD: The enterprise semantic desktop", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100131"}
