In this paper, two new models (MWDCRP and MCRP) of multicast routing on WDM networks are studied. In these models, it is assumed that each switch on WDM network can perform 'drop,' 'continue' and 'drop and continue' operations. In MWDCRP, given the multicast request and the delay constraint, the goal is to find a minimal wavelength light-forest to route the multicast request under the delay constraint. In MCRP, the objective cost of the multicast routing problem has two components: one is the transmitting cost, the other is the number of used wavelengths. Given the WDM network and the multicast request, the goal is to find a minimal cost light-forest to route the multicast request. Since these problems are NP-hard, four heuristic algorithms (named as Maximal-Delay-First (MDF), miNimal-Delay-First (NDF), Farthest-Greedy (FG), and Nearest-Greedy (NG)) are proposed to solve these problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can generate good solutions.", "paper_title": "Heuristic Algorithms for Finding Light-Forest of Multicast Routing on WDM Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000262732000005"}
