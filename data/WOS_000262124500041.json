The pipe is assumed to be of finite length and the Winkler model to schematize soil-structure interaction is considered. With reference to the boundary conditions of end-constrained pipe the axial motions are discussed. Careful numerical integrations are performed in order to prevent undesirable oscillations close to the discontinuities. The main result emphasized by the numerical analysis is that end-constrained finite length pipelines are subject to strains greater than infinite length pipes, or free-end finite length pipes.
