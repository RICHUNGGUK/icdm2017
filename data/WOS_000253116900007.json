There is, therefore, a need to build an integrated quality data model to support all quality processes, sub-processes and activities throughout the whole life of a product and guarantee to trace quality data in the lifecycle. Here, evolution procedures of quality data in product lifecycle are analyzed based on the product evolution process. A multi-layered quality data model framework is proposed to support the product quality control in lifecycle and its evolution course. The model consists of six layers: general bill of material (GBOM), quality data carrier, quality processes, quality activities, quality objects and physical data. Mapped successively among these layers, quality data is integrated in the framework. Techniques and procedures of modeling are explained. Evolution relationship of quality data along the product evolution chain is discussed and data model expression based on UML is proposed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
