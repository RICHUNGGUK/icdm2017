Unauthorized reuse raises major security issues. IP mark(s) is embedded into a design for establishing the veracity of a legal IP owner/buyer. However, methods for trustworthy public verification of IP marks are not secure. For field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) designs, marks become prone to tampering, and even being overridden by an attacker's signature after public verification. In order to ensure trustworthy yet leakage-proof public verification based on the marks hidden in a FPGA design, we propose a zero-knowledge protocol Verify_ZKP. It is an interactive two-person game between the prover and the verifier. This protocol is fast, incurs no additional design overhead, and needs no centralized signature database. We establish that Verify_ZKP satisfies zero-knowledge property, and introduce statistical metrics to measure its robustness. We have simulated our protocol for IWLS'05 FPGA benchmarks. Experimental results on robustness and overhead are very encouraging.", "paper_title": "Secure Public Verification of IP Marks in FPGA Design Through a Zero-Knowledge Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400001"}
