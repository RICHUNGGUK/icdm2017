Using the relationship between the micro and macro variables, we obtain a dynamic model for heterogeneous traffic flow with the consideration of the friction effects. The analytical and numerical results show that the bicycle friction effect will reduce the car flow and speed and that the pedestrian friction effect will reduce the bicycle flow and speed, but the reductions are related to the bicycle and pedestrian density.", "paper_title": "A DYNAMIC MODEL FOR THE HETEROGENEOUS TRAFFIC FLOW CONSISTING OF CAR, BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469100002"}
