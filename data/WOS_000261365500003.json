It is derived from the concept of multiple levels of detail (LODs) in product information. A CAD model is decomposed into triangular meshes grouped by its design features. Aggregating the mesh data in different manners produces models at various LODs. The method allows incremental transmission of 3D model from a coarse representation to a finer one through a sequence of LODs specified by the sender. Each transmission only consists of the mesh difference between two LOD models. A prototyping platform with a proprietary client-server framework is developed using Java (TM) technologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. A lightweight client can progressively receive the streaming data while rendering the corresponding model without implementing complex CAD functions. A scenario of sharing product information among multiple participants in collaborative design illustrates the streaming process. This work provides a useful mechanism that improves the efficiency. effectiveness, as well as security in sharing large CAD files over the network. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
