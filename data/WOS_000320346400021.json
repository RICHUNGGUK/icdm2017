We have developed a system that automatically transforms the MAGE-OM model and microarray data stored in the ArrayExpress database into RDF format. Additionally, the system automatically enables a SPARQL endpoint. This allows users to execute SPARQL queries for retrieving microarray data, either from specific experiments or from more than one experiment at a time. Our system optimizes response times by caching and reusing information from previous queries. In this paper, we describe our methods for achieving this transformation. We show that our approach is complementary to other existing initiatives, such as Bio2RDF, for accessing and retrieving data from the ArrayExpress database. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
