We use this model to explore the impact of the three rules on supply chain performance and bankruptcy propagation under the conditions of external disruption, bank rate, and new firms entering the market. Our results identify the preferred trust rule as the supplier selection method that can in most cases best improve the total revenue of the whole supply chain network. In terms of firm bankruptcy, on the other hand, it is the preferred random rule that has the least impact and the preferred price rule that has the most. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
