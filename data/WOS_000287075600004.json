Logo typography is the most important written information of packaging. Among the packaging forms of commodities in the market, cylindrical packaging is in the majority. In the condition that the commodities are highly homogenous, packaging design has become an important factor in marking their difference. For example, changing the arched surface of cylindrical packaging is one of the feasible schemes. However, will different arched surface designs in cylindrical packaging with varied font features affect consumers' findability of the commodity? We investigated performance of the seven font features of logo typography combined with seven types of arched surface by means of experiment. The results of this study are as follows: (a) Interaction occurs between arched surface with different proportions and varied font features. (b) When logo typography is on the arched surface of a cylinder that has a ratio of horizontal axis to vertical axis between [3:5] and [2:5], varied font features will make significant difference in findability. (c) When the arched surface is greater (i.e. the ratio will become smaller, e.g., [2:51), the oblong typography is superior to square typography ([Balloon Bd BT (e.g., ABCD)]). (d) Optimum findability and discerning performance are achieved when the font feature used is a sans serif structure with equal strokes in thickness, according to the design principle of logo typography. If logo typography is put on the arched surface of an outstanding cylinder (when the visible arched surface is narrower), the fonts with strokes and structure like Script should be avoided as much as possible to keep off low findability.
