An observer-based FTC framework is proposed for the hybrid system with uncontrollable state-dependent switching and without full continuous state measurements. Two kinds of faults are considered: continuous faults that affect each mode and discrete faults that affect the mode transition. Sufficient conditions are given such that the hybrid system can be stabilised in the sense of LaSalle invariance principle. Simulation results of example of CPU processing control show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant control for a class of hybrid systems with uncontrollable switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033900007"}
