Mathematically it is a Fisher equation with an integral term describing this non-local competition. Due to this competition, an initially monomorphic population may split into two distinct sub-populations, hence exhibiting a branching capacity. This framework can be applied to various contexts where recognizers are competing for some signals. The pattern formation capacity of this model is investigated analytically and numerically.
