However, stringent QoS demands of multimedia applications entail studies on service-oriented radio resource management. This article systematically examines the design issues and the state of the art of multimedia downlink scheduling in the multicast/broadcast-based WiMAX system. We propose a viable end-to-end framework, connection-oriented multistate adaptation, by considering cross-layer adaptations in source coding, queue prioritization, flow queuing, and scheduling. Its performance is confirmed by simulations on important metrics, showing that the framed work can effectively accommodate heterogeneity in link variations, queue fluctuations, and reception diversities.", "paper_title": "DOWNLINK SCHEDULING FOR MULTIMEDIA MULTICAST/BROADCAST OVER MOBILE WiMAX: CONNECTION-ORIENTED MULTISTATE ADAPTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269217600013"}
