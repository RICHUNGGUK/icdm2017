Waste from electrical and electronic equipment contains hazardous materials that may have an impact on human environment and health if not properly managed. Therefore, governments should be concerned and be seeking ways to design the recovery and disposal networks to manage WEEE waste treatment strategies. The objective of this paper is to design a country level WEEE recovery network based on sustainable development in which economic, environmental and social issues are considered. A simulation optimisation model is developed to determine the best locations for the collection centres and also recycling plants for managing total WEEE in Iran, so that the government can simultaneously perform the trade-off between environmental issues and economical and social impacts. The proposed model was examined through an illustrative case study from Iran's current WEEE situation.", "paper_title": "Simulation-based optimisation of a sustainable recovery network for Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000319325400001"}
