The product quality with a continuous type is the supplier's private information and cannot be observed by the buyer. Furthermore, three strategies, named inspection, price rebate and effort, are simultaneously employed in the contract so as. to incentivize the supplier to improve his product quality. An inspection-based price rebate and effort contract model is developed with the purpose of maximizing the buyer's expected payoff. The optimal solution demonstrates that the second-best inspection ratio is the same as the first-best one. With respect to the supplier's optimal effort level, if the supplier's effort level and his product quality are substitutable, then his second-best effort level will be larger than the first-best one, while in the case of complement, it is smaller than the first-best level.
