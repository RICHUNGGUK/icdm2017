In practice, the harmonic characteristics of circuits are complicated and entangled. There are two kinds of harmonic sources that cause inverter output voltage waveform distortion: One is the PWM switching of inverter and the other is the nonlinear characteristics of the load. In general, PI feedback control by coefficient diagram method (CDM) is used to design the output voltage filter. The relation between the L-C value and the system time constant are described with the closed form and the filter values must be calculated repeatedly to satisfy the prescribed voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) of the system. Therefore, the MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Tool-box for the fuzzy logic control algorithm is proposed. The L-C value of the filter can be set to a fixed range in the nonlinear characteristic of the practical condition, to improve the harmonic of output voltage more effectively and to avoid repeated calculation.
