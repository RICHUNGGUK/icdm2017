The pyramid can be considered as the optimal unimodal approximation of rho relative to mu, and can be applied to hierarchical data segmentation. In this paper, we give efficient algorithms for a couple of two-dimensional pyramid construction problems.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for constructing a pyramid from a terrain", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800048"}
