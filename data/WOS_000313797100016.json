This paper describes a new lower bounding method for the CARP based on a set partitioning-like formulation of the problem with additional cuts. This method uses cut-and-column generation to solve different relaxations of the problem, and a new dynamic programming method for generating routes. An exact algorithm based on the new lower bounds was also implemented to assess their effectiveness. Computational results over a large set of classical benchmark instances show that the proposed method improves most of the best known lower bounds for the open instances, and can solve several of these for the first time.", "paper_title": "Improved lower bounds and exact algorithm for the capacitated arc routing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100016"}
