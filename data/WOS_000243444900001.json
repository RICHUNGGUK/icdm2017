The discretization strategy of DFD is that for any complex geometry, there is no need to introduce coordinate transformation and the discrete form of governing equations at an interior point may involve some points outside the solution domain. The functional values at the exterior dependent points are updated at each time step to impose the wall boundary condition by the approximate form of solution near the boundary. Some points inside the solution domain are constructed for the approximate form of solution, and the flow variables at constructed points are evaluated by the linear interpolation on triangles. The numerical schemes used in DFD are the finite element Galerkin method for spatial discretization and the dual-time scheme for temporal discretization. Some numerical results of compressible flows over fixed and moving bodies are presented to validate the local DFD method.
