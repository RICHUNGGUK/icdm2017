The proposed technique combines the benefits of fast radiation-induced fault detection with fast restoration of the device functionality and small area and power overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel approach significantly improves the availability in hostile radiation environments of FPGA-based designs. When implemented using a Xilinx XC2V1000 Virtex-II device, the presented technique detects and corrects single bit upsets and double, triple and quadruple multi bit upsets, occupying just 1488 slices and dissipating less than 30 mW at a 50MHz running frequency.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Self-Reconfiguration Capability to Improve SRAM-based FPGA Robustness in Space and Avionics Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000208167200008"}
