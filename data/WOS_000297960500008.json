In this experiment, six typical Mura types, negative spacer, positive spacer, line, v-band, light leakage, and curtain were tested, and 25 subjects reported whether the test and the reference patterns were the same or not. From the experimental results, the fitting functions of multiple JNDs for different Mura types were obtained, which were the non-linear curves. Furthermore, the Mura ranking standard system was proposed by finding out the fittest non-linear transformed function, and from which, any Mura defect was assigned to the corresponding Mura rank according to the counted JND value.
