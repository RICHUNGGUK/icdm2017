The proposed protocol is conducted based-on a comprehensive study and analysis intended to determine the effects of cache coherence protocols on the characteristics of cache memories. The outcomes of this analysis indicate that differences in handling dirty data items play an important role to make distinction in favor of or against a cache coherence protocol. Based on the primary results, the proposed protocol tries to enhance the reliability of caches by means of sharing management. Sharing is dynamically adjusted according to the operational mode of CPU. The experimental results show that proposed protocol leads to about 16 % improvements in MTTF, with no performance degradation and with negligible bandwidth and cache energy consumption overheads compared to previous works.", "paper_title": "Cache vulnerability mitigation using an adaptive cache coherence protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000337800400003"}
