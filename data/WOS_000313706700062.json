Grid impedance detection based on single harmonic current injection is reliable in three-phase impedance balanced grid. However, under impedance unbalanced condition, the harmonic voltage caused by the injected symmetric harmonic current is asymmetric, which affects the calculation of grid impedances and even leads to failed detection. The method based on dual-frequency harmonic current injection is injecting two non-characteristic symmetric harmonic currents, and then according to the different harmonic voltages caused by different frequency harmonic currents, all three-phase impedances can be calculated accurately. The implementing algorithm of the presented method is derived and its performance is analyzed in detail. Simulation and experiments are carried out under grid impedance balanced and unbalanced conditions. Theoretical analysis and experiment results proved that the proposed method is feasible.", "paper_title": "An Islanding Detection Method Based on Dual-Frequency Harmonic Current Injection Under Grid Impedance Unbalanced Condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700062"}
