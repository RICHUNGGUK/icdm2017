One of the specific problems occurring during integration is the resulting integrated scopes' requirements specifications become faulty while integrating two sets of software systems from two participating companies. The integrated scopes refer to the domains of information software systems, business policies, business processes, business rules, interface functions, and data that are being integrated in each participating company. Using a Transition-Directed Graph (TDG) representation, specified requirements involved in the integration will be represented in a form of TDG to be analyzed for faults. Five efficient algorithms are developed to identify faults in the resulting TDG formatted requirement specifications. Four correction algorithms are also developed to correct detected faults found in the TDG formatted requirements specifications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
