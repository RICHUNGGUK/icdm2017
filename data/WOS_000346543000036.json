The proposed approach is called IA_EDP, which stands for Immune Algorithm for Economic Dispatch Problem, and it uses two versions of a redistribution power operator which tries to keep feasible the solutions that it finds. The proposed approach is validated using eight problems taken from the specialized literature. Our results are compared with respect to those obtained by several other approaches. We also perform some statistical analysis in order to determine the sensitivity of our proposed approach to its parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
