Because our interface allows the user great freedom in how they choose to define regions-of-interest to examine and compare, the classic geospatial analytic issue known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) quickly arises. The user may delineate regions with unseen differences that can affect the fairness of the comparisons made between them. To alleviate this problem, our interface first alerts the user if it detects any potential unfairness between regions when they are selected for comparison. It then presents the dimensions with potential problematic outliers to the user for evaluation. Finally, it provides a number of semi-automated tools to assist the user in correcting their regions' boundaries to minimize the inequalities they feel could significantly impact their comparisons.", "paper_title": "Alleviating the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem within Probe-Based Geospatial Analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000280991300016"}
