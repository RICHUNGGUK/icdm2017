A contact path planner generates a sequence of six-dimensional poses and corresponding contact formations, while a hybrid robot controller expects a desired wrench, twist and the local wrench and twist subspaces. Our approach automatically converts a geometrical path description into a force based tasks specification for the hybrid controller, based on a user specified input of the magnitudes and the norms of the desired contact force and execution speed. The approach applies to all contact motions between known polyhedral objects, and is verified in real world experiments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
