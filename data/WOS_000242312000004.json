Previously published watershed segmentation algorithms required at least three global synchronization points: minima detection, labeling and flooding. This paper presents a new fully asynchronous algorithm, where pixels can compute their local data in parallel and independently from one another, and which requires only a unique final global synchronization point. This paper provides a formal demonstration of the convergence and correctness of this new parallel asynchronous algorithm using a mathematical model of data propagation in a graph: the associative net formalism. We demonstrate the simplicity of implementation of this algorithm on parallel processor arrays. We explore, simulate, and validate several configurations of the algorithm-architecture using a \"SystemC\" model. Simulations reveal an image segmentation rate up to 66,000 QCIF images/sec, i.e., a speed-up factor of more than 1,000 times compared with state of the art watershed algorithms. A fine grain processor array design using ST microelectronics 0.18 mu m CMOS technology confirms that this new approach is a breakthrough in the domain of real-time image segmentation.", "paper_title": "Parallel asynchronous watershed algorithm-architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000242312000004"}
