Collection of these proteins facilitates better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity and the rational drug discovery. Drug-induced toxicity related protein database (DITOP) is such a database that is intending to provide comprehensive information of DITRPs. Currently, DITOP contains 1501 records, covering 618 distinct literature-reported DITRPs, 529 drugs/ligands and 418 distinct toxicity terms. These proteins were confirmed experimentally to interact with drugs or their reactive metabolites, thus directly or indirectly cause adverse effects or toxicities. Five major types of drug-induced toxicities or ADRs are included in DITOP, which are the idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, the dose-dependent toxicities, the drug-drug interactions, the immunemediated adverse drug effects (IMADEs) and the toxicities caused by genetic susceptibility. Molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity and cross-links to related resources are also provided while available. Moreover, a series of user-friendly interfaces were designed for flexible retrieval of DITRPs-related information. The DITOP can be accessed freely at http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/databases/ADR/index.html.", "paper_title": "DITOP: drug-induced toxicity related protein database", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400024"}
