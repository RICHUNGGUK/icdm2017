Consequently, interesting insights into some puzzles, and into the approaches for solving them, have emerged. However, many puzzles have been neglected, possibly because they are unknown to many people. In this article, we survey NP-Complete puzzles in the hope of motivating further research in this fascinating area, particularly for those puzzles which have received little scientific attention to date.", "paper_title": "A survey of NP-complete puzzles", "paper_id": "WOS:000255840100003"}
