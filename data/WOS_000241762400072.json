It has been done using a module of the designed and implemented by authors GISness system. Three algorithms for solving TSP are available, including the proposed by authors an hybrid algorithm called 2optGAM. The results of research show that the algorithm is very prornising.", "paper_title": "GISness system for fast TSP solving and supporting decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400072"}
