Such models have a good biological motivation: an axon in a nervous system is a complex information processor of impulse signals. Because the structure of axon P systems is linear, the computational power of such systems has been proved to be greatly restricted; in particular, axon P systems are not universal as language generators. It remains open whether axon P systems are universal as number generators. In this paper, we prove that axon P systems are universal as both number generators and function computing devices, and investigate the number of nodes needed to construct a universal axon P system. It is proved that four nodes (respectively, nine nodes) are enough for axon P systems to achieve universality as number generators (respectively, function computing devices). These results illustrate that the simple linear structure is enough for axon P systems to achieve a desired computational power.", "paper_title": "On the Universality of Axon P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800016"}
