Design/methodology/approach - Based on a framework for analyzing scientific fields, as well as its application on LIS, aspects relating to the impact of contextual factors on research was identified and discussed based on information front, e.g. LIS institution web sites. The results were discussed, not only in relation to the framework primarily utilized, but also from a less disciplinary view on research organization, for analytical contrast. Findings - A close connection between academic affiliation and research orientation was found, reflected in organizational issues, media for communicating research and access to resources. This relates to general issues of levels of independence front other disciplines and lay groups, to what extent research is evaluated by intra-disciplinary standards and to the level of consensus on terminology and research processes. Research limitations/implications - Limiting the study to institutions in one particular geographical area, where several institutions being at an early stage of formalization, the possibility of reaching generalizable conclusions is limited. The strength of the conclusions is also somewhat restrained Clue to the nature oft he empirical material, being based on web documents with varying levels of exhaustability in terms of data provision. Originality/vallue - The intellectual organization of LIS research is well-known, whereas social and imstitutional aspects have been analyzed to a lesser degree; and with the differences in age and size of Nordic LIS institutions, they provide an interesting case of contemporary institutionalization of LIS research.", "paper_title": "Formalizing a discipline The institutionalization of library and information science research in the Nordic countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000260562100006"}
