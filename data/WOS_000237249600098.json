At the core of this system is a method for unsupervised partitioning of data for finding spatio-temporal patterns in climate data using kernel methods which offer strength to deal with complex data, For this purpose, a robust weighted kernel k-means algorithm incorporating spatial constraints is presented. The algorithm can effectively handle noise, outliers and auto-correlation in the spatial data, for effective and efficient data analysis, and thus can be used for predicting oil-palm yield by analyzing various factors affecting the yield.", "paper_title": "An intelligent system based on kernel methods for crop yield prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600098"}
