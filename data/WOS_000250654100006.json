We have proposed some extensions to the OGSA-DAI architecture and successfully implemented new mechanisms enabling secure communication and distributed data integrity along with fine-grain authorization and policy enforcement to minimize the complexity of the security right management. As a proof of concept some preliminary results of various performance tests of our solutions are also presented in this paper. We then analyze our achievements and describe future work and research.
