The method extends the traditional trust-region subproblem, TRS, approach that makes use of the L-curve maximum curvature criterion, a strategy recently proposed to find a good regularization parameter. We apply a parameterized trust region approach to estimate the region of maximum curvature of the L-curve and find the regularized solution. This exploits the close connections between various parameters used to solve TRS. A MATLAB code for the algorithm is tested and a comparison to the conjugate gradient least squares, CGLS, approach is given and analysed.", "paper_title": "Regularization using a parameterized trust region subproblem", "paper_id": "WOS:000256964400011"}
