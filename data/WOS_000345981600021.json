Also, we prove that if F is an obstinate filter, then F is a Boolean filter hence A/F is a Boolean algebra. Finally, we construct some algorithms for studying the structure of the finite BL-algebras and filters in finite BL-algebras.", "paper_title": "A new filter in BL-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000345981600021"}
