In this paper, a general class of memristive neural networks with discrete and distributed delays is introduced and studied. Some Lagrange stability criteria dependent on the network parameters are derived via nonsmooth analysis and control theory. In particular, several succinct criteria are provided to ascertain the Lagrange stability of memristive neural networks with and without delays. The proposed Lagrange stability criteria are the improvement and extension of the existing results in the literature. Three numerical examples are given to show the superiority of theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Lagrange Stability of Memristive Neural Networks With Discrete and Distributed Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098700004"}
