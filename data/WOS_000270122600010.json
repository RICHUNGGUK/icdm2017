When this test is repeated several times with the same polygon a data structure is necessary in order to reduce the linear time needed to obtain an inclusion result. In the literature different approaches, like grids or quadtrees, have been proposed for reducing the complexity of these algorithms. We propose a new data structure based on hierarchical subdivisions by means of tri-cones, which reduces the time necessary for this inclusion test. This data structure, named tri-tree, decomposes the whole space by means of tri-cones and classifies the edges of the polygon. For the inclusion test only the edges classified in one tri-cone are considered. The tri-tree has a set of properties which makes it specially suited to this aim, with a similar complexity to other data structures, but well suited to polygons which represent regions. We include a theoretical and practical study in which the new data structure is compared with classical ones, showing a significant improvement. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
