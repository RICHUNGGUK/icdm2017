To simultaneously achieve fine-grained access control on encrypted data and scalable user revocation, existing work combines attribute-based encryption (ABE) and proxy re-encryption (PRE) to delegate the cloud service provider (CSP) to execute re-encryption. However, the data owner should be online in order to send the PRE keys to the CSP in a timely fashion, to prevent the revoked user from accessing the future data. The delay of issuing the PRE keys may cause potential security risks. In this paper, we propose a time-based proxy re-encryption (TimePRE) scheme to allow a user's access right to expire automatically after a predetermined period of time. In this case, the data owner can be offline in the process of user revocations. The basic idea is to incorporate the concept of time into the combination of ABE and PRE. Specifically, each data is associated with an attribute-based access structure and an access time, and each user is identified by a set of attributes and a set of eligible time periods which denote the period of validity of the user's access right. Then, the data owner and the CSP are required to share a root secret key in advance, with which CSP can automatically update the access time of the data with the time that it receives a data access request. Therefore, given the re-encrypted ciphertext, only the users whose attributes satisfy the access structure and whose access rights are effective in the access time can recover corresponding data.
