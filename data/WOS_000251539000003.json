A criterion for the solvability and a method for finding all solutions of the equation are obtained. Over an arbitrary self-dual Brouwerian lattice, an equivalent condition for the unique solution, a necessary and sufficient condition for the minimal solution and a procedure for constructing minimal solutions less than or equal to any given solution of the equation are presented. It is shown that the results of the paper can be applied to the determination of generalized inverses of a matrix over an arbitrary Brouwerian lattice. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
