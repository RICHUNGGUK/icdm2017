Our contributions include ( 1) a two-stage design flow for 3D floorplanning, which scales down the enlarged solution space due to multidevice layer structure; ( 2) an efficient thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm with power distribution constraints; ( 3) a thermal via planning algorithm considering congestion minimization. Experiments results show that our approach is nine times faster with better solution quality compared to a recent published result. In addition, the thermal via planning approach is proven to be very efficient to eliminate localized hot spots directly.", "paper_title": "Efficient thermal-oriented 3D floorplanning and thermal via planning for two-stacked-die integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239055100004"}
