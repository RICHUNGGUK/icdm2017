Thus, many models and theories have been developed in order to effective and accurately manage trust and reputation in those communities. Nevertheless, very few of them take into consideration all the possible security threats that can compromise the system. In this paper, we present some of the most important and critical security threats that could be applied in a trust and reputation scheme. We will describe and analyze each of those threats and propose some recommendations to face them when developing a new trust and reputation mechanism. We will also study how some trust and reputation models solve them. This work expects to be a reference guide when designing secure trust and reputation models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
