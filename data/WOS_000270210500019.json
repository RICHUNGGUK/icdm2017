Design/methodology/approach - The optimal design (geometrical displacement and shielding current intensity and phase) for the mitigation of magnetic field produced by flat and trefoil configuration of the power line is carried out by means of genetic algorithm. Findings - Different layouts for the source (flat and trefoil configuration) and the shield (introduction of the phase splitting technique) are designed. The optimization parameters are the coordinates of the shield conductors and the transformer ratio of the magnetic core that couple the source and the shield. Moreover, physical constraints as maximum depth of excavation and geometric interference between cables were introduced in the optimization procedure. Originality/value - The paper deals with a very new technology for field mitigation called HMCPL. Actually, the base layout of the HMCPL does not need an optimal design. On the other hand, in some applications the base layout cannot be used, therefore, the introduction of an optimal design cannot be avoided. In this paper, the optimal design of several configurations is performed showing that the performances of the HMCPL are very interesting even if the base layout cannot be used.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of \"high magnetic coupling passive loop\" for power lines field mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500019"}
