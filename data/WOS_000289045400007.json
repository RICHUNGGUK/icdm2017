Design/methodology/approach - From the Bloch-Boltzmann-Peierls kinetic equations for the coupled system formed by electrons and phonons, an extended hydrodynamic model (HM) has been obtained on the basis of the maximum entropy principle. An electrothermal Monte Carlo (ETMC) simulator has been developed to check the above thermodynamic model. Findings - A 1D n(+) - n - n(+) silicon diode has been simulated by using the extended BM and the ETMC simulator, confirming the general behaviour. Research limitations/implications - The paper's analysis is limited to the 11) case. Future researches will also consider 2D realistic devices. Originality/value - The non-equilibrium character of electrons and phonons has been taken into account. In previous works, this methodology was used only for equilibrium phonons.", "paper_title": "Heat generation and transport in nanoscale semiconductor devices via Monte Carlo and hydrodynamic simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000289045400007"}
