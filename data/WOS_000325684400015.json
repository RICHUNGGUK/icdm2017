Fuzzy theory is useful to build simple, efficient, and effective solutions for this problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy method to reduce Gaussian and impulsive noise from color images. Our method uses one only filtering operation: a weighted averaging. A fuzzy rule system is used to assign the weights in the averaging so that both noise types are reduced and image structures are preserved. We provide experimental results to show that the performance of the method is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art filters.", "paper_title": "A Simple Fuzzy Method to Remove Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise From Color Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000325684400015"}
