The mixed time-delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. By using the Lyapunov functional method, linear matrix inequality approach and general convex combination technique, two novel sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of the networks. The proposed results, which do not require the boundedness, differentiability and monotonicity of the activation functions, can be easily checked via Matlab software. Moreover, they indicate that the stability behavior of neural networks is very sensitive to the time delay in the leakage term. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
