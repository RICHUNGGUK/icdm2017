This paper examines whether the hybrid model brings any performance benefits for clusters based on multicore processors. A molecular dynamics application has been parallelized using both MPI and hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming models. The performance of this application has been examined on two high-end multicore clusters using both Infiniband and Gigabit Ethernet interconnects. The hybrid model has been found to perform well on the higher-latency Gigabit Ethernet connection, but offers no performance benefit on low-latency Infiniband interconnects. The changes in performance are attributed to the differing communication profiles of the hybrid and MPI codes.", "paper_title": "HYBRID MESSAGE-PASSING AND SHARED-MEMORY PROGRAMMING IN A MOLECULAR DYNAMICS APPLICATION ON MULTICORE CLUSTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268097800002"}
