In this paper, starting from the ideas in Alcazar (2009) we address the analogous problem for families of space rational curves, also defined by means of a rational parametrization. Hence, the main result in the paper is an algorithm for computing the (finitely many) real values of the parameter where the topology of the family may change. The algorithm has been implemented in the computer algebra system Maple 13, with good practical results; several examples and timings are provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
