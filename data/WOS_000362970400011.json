The proposed fuzzy decision making method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods due to the fact that they cannot distinguish the preference order of alternatives in some situations. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy group decision making method is more flexible than the existing method due to the fact that the proposed method allows experts to evaluate a fuzzy target reflecting his/her attitude for increasing the flexibility. The proposed fuzzy decision making method and the proposed fuzzy group decision making method provide us with useful ways for decision making and group decision making in fuzzy environments, respectively.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy decision making and fuzzy group decision making based on likelihood-based comparison relations of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000362970400011"}
