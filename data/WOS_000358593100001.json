Among the various cost elements in operating a cloud computing infrastructure, power usage stands out prominently. In fact, how to reduce the power consumption of cloud computing platforms has received considerable attention of the cloud service provider as well as academic researchers. This paper proposes a power awareness scheduler (PAS) system to manage the resource scheduling based on power usage patterns in the cloud. By obtaining and analyzing the power consumption-load curve, PAS is able to make power-efficient virtual machine deployment for the cloud. Our implementation of the proposed PAS on OpenStack shows that PAS can reduce total power consumption by up to 17%.", "paper_title": "Power Consumption Based Cloud Scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000358593100001"}
