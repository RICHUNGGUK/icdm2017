The shells are assumed to be built using an advanced tow-placement machine, which allows in-plane steering of the fibers, resulting in a variable-stiffness structure. In this paper, different path definitions for variable-stiffness shells are provided and used to optimize conical shells for maximum fundamental frequency, while manufacturing constraints that apply for tow placement are taken into account in the process. The influence of manufacturing constraints on the performance is shown; and improvements of variable-stiffness conical shells over conventional, constant-stiffness shells are demonstrated.
