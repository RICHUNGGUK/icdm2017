The servers may become overloaded during temporary traffic peaks when more requests arrive than the server is designed for. An admission control mechanism rejects some requests whenever the arriving traffic is too high and thereby maintains an acceptable load in the system. This paper presents how admission control mechanisms can be designed with a combination of queueing theory and control theory. In this paper we model an Apache web server as a GI/G/1-system and then design a PI-controller, commonly used in automatic control, for the server. The controller has been implemented as a module inside the Apache source code. Measurements from the laboratory setup show how robust the implemented controller is, and how it corresponds to the results from the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Control-theoretic analysis of admission control mechanisms for web server systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000252830100004"}
