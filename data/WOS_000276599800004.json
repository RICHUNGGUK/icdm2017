We propose the first TNC model in the UC framework by first designing the TNC ideal functionality F(TNC), the EAP ideal functionality F(EAP) and the EAP-TNC ideal functionality F(E-PA). Then, we construct a trusted network connect protocol named TK-TNC that UC-realizes F(TNC) in the (F(EAP), F(E-PA))hybrid model. Subsequently, we perform a security analysis on protocol D-H PN given in the TCG specification and show that this protocol cannot securely realize the EAP-TNC ideal functionality and be resistant to an attack. Finally, we propose an alternative protocol using the twin Diffie-Hellman key-exchange technique, named protocol TD-H PN, which can securely realize the EAP-TNC ideal functionality in the (F(REG), F(CERT))-hybrid model.", "paper_title": "Universally composable secure TNC model and EAP-TNC protocol in IF-T", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800004"}
