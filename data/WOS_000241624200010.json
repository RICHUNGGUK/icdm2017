Workflow technology offers such a mean to realize automation of business processes. However, it is inappropriate to employ workflow technology alone for automating governmental processes that are typically of knowledge-intensive characteristics. In this paper, we study an approach of automating or semiautomating e-govemmental processes by combining workflow technology and knowledge management, especially semantic web technology such as OWL, SWRL. The proposed approach can be classified into several parts: (1) The government processes are modeled using UML activity diagram with extended UML profiles. (2) ne Problem-Solving-Method (PSM) tasks are represented with OWL-S. (3) The application ontology for applying for social security cards is developed in OWL. 4) Based on the proposed approach, the architecture of knowledge-driven e-governmental processes management system is presented and a prototype system is implemented using workflow engines, Jena and JESS.", "paper_title": "Supporting effective operation of e-governmental services through workflow and knowledge management", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200010"}
