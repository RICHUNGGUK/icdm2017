However, the original 802.11 MAC layer can not meet the requirements of modern wireless multimedia applications. Accordingly, the IEEE 802.15.3 standard has been proposed to increase the data rate in wireless multimedia applications whilst simultaneously reducing the cost and power consumption of the portable devices within the network. In this study, the 802.15.3 MAC protocol is implemented over an 802.11 MAN. In implementing the 802.15.3 superframes, the timing functions are accomplished using high-resolution timers such that the traditional CSMA/CA protocol can be retained. It is shown that the emulated 802.15.3 MAC layer is capable of supporting 12 full-duplex voice calls or 24 half-duplex voice calls, which is consistent with the theoretical VoIP capacity of 802.11b WLANs.
