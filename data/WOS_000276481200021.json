Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, we originally analyze the global robust exponential stability of discontinuous neural networks with time-varying delays in view of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Therefore, our results are brand new compared to previous literatures. A numerical example is given to validate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
