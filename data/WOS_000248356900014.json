The two kinds of curves share most of the properties as those of the Bezier curves and B-spline curves in polynomial space. In particular, they can represent exactly some remarkable transcendental curves such as the helix, the cycloid and the catenary. The subdivision formulae of these new kinds of curves are also given. The generations of the tensor product surfaces are straightforward. Using the new mathematics models, we present the control mesh representations of two classes of minimal surfaces.", "paper_title": "AHT Bezier curves and NUAHT B-spline curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900014"}
