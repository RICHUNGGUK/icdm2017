It is required to achieve two goals: high efficiency and availability. This paper presents a Replication Based Metadata Management System (RBMMS) as metadata server implemented in Global Distributed Storage System (GDSS). To address the above two goals RBMMS maintains a spares strongly connected graph to describe replica structure and relations among the replicas. The graph is used to propagate updating information and replica discovery in the process of replica addition and removal. Cache module is also implemented in RBMMS to further improve the performance of metadata access. The evaluation demonstrates that RBMMS attains high availability and efficiency of metadata management system.", "paper_title": "Replica based distributed metadata management in grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500140"}
