Two common approaches are often used, one based on low-level techniques to detect each object size, position and velocity, and other based on high-level techniques that deal with object appearance. None of these methods can deal with all possible problems in multiple-target tracking: environment occlusions, both total and partial, and collisions, such as grouping and splitting events. So one solution is to merge these techniques to improve their performance. Based on an existing hierarchical architecture, we present a novel technique that can deal with all the mentioned problems in multiple tracking targets. Blob detection, low-level tracking using adaptive filters, high-level tracking based on a fixed pool of histograms and an event management that can detect every collision event and performs occlusion recovery are used to be able to track every object during the time they appear within the scene. Experimental results show the performance of this technique under multiple situations, being able to track every object in the scene without losing their initial identification. The speed processing is higher than 50 frames, which allows it to be used under real-time scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
