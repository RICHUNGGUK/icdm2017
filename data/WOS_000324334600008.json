In this study as part of our investigation of the MurD bacterial target two recently discovered classes of the MurD ligase inhibitors were investigated resulting from the lead optimization phases of the N-sulfonamide d-Glu MurD inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on novel structural data, in conjunction with the linear interaction energy (LIE) method suggested the transferability of our previously obtained LIE coefficients to further d-Glu based classes of MurD inhibitors. Analysis of the observed dynamical behavior of these compounds in the MurD active site was supported by static drug design techniques. These results complement the current knowledge of the MurD inhibitory mechanism and provide valuable support for the d-Glu paradigm of the inhibitor design.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulation and linear interaction energy study of d-Glu-based inhibitors of the MurD ligase", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334600008"}
