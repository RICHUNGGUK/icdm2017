The network sample is first analyzed using standard complex network techniques to verify that it has similar properties to other web-derived complex networks. Content-based pairwise dissimilarity values between the musical data associated with the network sample are computed, and the relationship between those content-based distances and distances from network theory explored. Following this exploration, hybrid graphs and distance measures are constructed, and used to examine the community structure of the artist network. Finally, results of these investigations are shown to be mostly orthogonal between these distance spaces. These results are considered with a focus recommendation and discovery applications employing these hybrid measures as their basis.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Exploitation of Musician Social Networks for Recommendation and Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000293710300008"}
