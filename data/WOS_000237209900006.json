The approach has the advantage that in the associated algorithm, the preservation of constraints is built in automatically. One practical use of such an algorithm its its application to diffusion-tensor imaging, which in recent years has been shown to be a very fruitful approach to certain problems in medical imaging. The method in [3] is motivated by differential-geometric considerations, some of which are discussed briefly in [3] and in greater detail in [4]. We describe here certain geometric aspects of this approach that are not readily apparent in [3] or [4]. We also discuss what one can and cannot hope to achieve by this approach.", "paper_title": "Some differential-geometric remarks on a method for minimizing constrained functionals of matrix-valued functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237209900006"}
