The scheme resists geometric attacks (e.g., rotation, scaling, etc.,) and, within some limits, JPEG compression. The scheme uses a secret binary pattern to modify the chromatic distribution of the image.", "paper_title": "Color images watermarking based on minimization of color differences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800012"}
