For the selection of reliable data, fuzzy entropy through distance measure is proposed. The appropriateness of the proposed entropy is verified by the definition of entropy measure. To measure the fuzziness of 3-phase stator currents, membership functions are obtained by the Bootstrap method. Finally, the proposed entropy is applied to the membership function of 3-phase currents, and the fuzzy entropy values of phase current each are illustrated.", "paper_title": "Measure of certainty with fuzzy entropy function", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300017"}
