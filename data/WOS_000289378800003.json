In this paper, we introduce algorithms for set-theoretic operations like intersection, union, etc. on sets represented as balanced diets. We empirically analyse their performance and show that these algorithms can outperform previously known algorithms on sets, such as the ones implemented in OCaml's standard library.", "paper_title": "More on balanced diets", "paper_id": "WOS:000289378800003"}
