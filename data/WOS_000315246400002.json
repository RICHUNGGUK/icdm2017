We determine the computational complexity of the CHOOSABILITY problem restricted to H-free graphs for every graph H that does not belong to {K-1,K-3, P-1 + P-2, P-1 + P-3, P-4}. We also show that if H is a linear forest, then the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
