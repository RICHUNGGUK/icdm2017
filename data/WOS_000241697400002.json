The impact of terrain complexity represented by terrain steepness and orientation on derived parameters such as slope and aspect has been analysed. Experiments have been conducted to quantify the uncertainties created by digital terrain analysis algorithms. The test results show that (a) the RMSE of derived slope and aspect is negatively correlated with slope steepness; (b) the RMSE of derived aspect is more sensitive to terrain complexity than that of derived slope; and (c) the uncertainties in derived slope and aspect tend to be found in flatter areas, and decrease with increasing terrain complexity. The study shows that although primary surface parameters can be well defined mathematically, the implementation of those mathematical models in a GIS environment may generate considerable uncertainties related to terrain complexity. In general, when terrain is rugged with steep slopes, the uncertainty of derived parameters is quite minimal. While in flatter areas, the DEM-based derivatives, particularly the aspect, may contain a great amount of uncertainty, causing significant limitation in applying the analytical results.", "paper_title": "Terrain complexity and uncertainties in grid-based digital terrain analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241697400002"}
