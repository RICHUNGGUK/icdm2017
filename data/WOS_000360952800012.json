This work presents a novel procedure for simultaneously determining the optimal cluster structure for multivariate binary data and the subspace to represent that cluster structure. The method is based on a finite mixture model of multivariate Bernoulli distributions, and each component is assumed to have a low-dimensional representation of the cluster structure. This method can be considered as an extension of the traditional latent class analysis. Sparsity is introduced to the loading values, which produces the low-dimensional subspace, for enhanced interpretability and more stable extraction of the subspace. An EM-based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the proposed optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to a simulation study and real datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
