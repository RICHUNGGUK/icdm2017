Specifically, a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic force-feedback driving wheel interfaces with a PC to create a haptic Virtual Driving Environment (hVDE). Coupling this framework with parametric exercise/ movement protocols-structured as driving exercises along paths of varying complexity-is the key to the creation of an inexpensive, immersive, and yet individualized personal-movement trainer.", "paper_title": "Individualized interactive home-based haptic telerehabilitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239206500007"}
