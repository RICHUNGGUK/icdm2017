We introduce the notion of SVM-theta graphs, on which Lovasz theta function can be approximated well by a Support vector machine (SVM). We show that Erdos-Renyi random G(n, p) graphs are SVM-theta graphs for log(4)n/n <= p < 1. Even if we embed a large clique of size Theta(root np/1-p) in a G(n, p) graph the resultant graph still remains a SVM-theta graph. This immediately suggests an SVM based algorithm for recovering a large planted clique in random graphs. Associated with the theta function is the notion of orthogonal labellings. We introduce common orthogonal labellings which extends the idea of orthogonal labellings to multiple graphs. This allows us to propose a Multiple Kernel learning (MKL) based solution which is capable of identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs. Both in the planted clique case and common subgraph detection problem the proposed solutions beat the state of the art by an order of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Lovasz theta function, SVMs and Finding Dense Subgraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000335457100001"}
