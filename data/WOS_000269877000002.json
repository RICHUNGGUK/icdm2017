Based on our earlier research and a diary study of payments with an online payment system and with online banking systems of a reputable bank, we proposed a set of 12 interaction design guidelines. The guidelines have been applied during the implementation and redesign of a new payment system. An extensive experimental comparison of the original version of the system with the one designed according to the design guidelines has provided confirmation of the relevance and adequacy of these guidelines for designing online payment systems.", "paper_title": "Designing Internet-Based Payment Systems: Guidelines and Empirical Basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000269877000002"}
