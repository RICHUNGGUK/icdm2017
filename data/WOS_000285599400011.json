Improving the performance of these operations is generally achieved by means of integer recoding techniques, which aim at minimizing the scalars' density of nonzero digits. The hybrid binary-ternary number system provides both short representations and small density. In this paper, we present three novel algorithms for both single and double scalar multiplication. We present a detailed theoretical analysis, together with timings and fair comparisons over both tripling-oriented Doche-Ichart-Kohel curves and generic Weierstrass curves. Our experiments show that our algorithms are almost always faster than their widely used counterparts.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Binary-Ternary Number System for Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000285599400011"}
