We show that, with probability tending to 1 as n -> infinity, the final graph produced by this process has maximum degree O((n log n)(1/3)) and consequently size O(n(4/3)(log n)(1/3)), which are sharp up to constants. This confirms conjectures of Bohman and Keevash and of Osthus and Taraz, and improves upon previous bounds due to Bollobas and Riordan and Osthus and Taraz.", "paper_title": "The Final Size of the C-4-Free Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000297410400009"}
