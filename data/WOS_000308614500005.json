Biogeography is the study of distribution of species in nature. In this paper, BBO is modified by applying the concept of mutation as extended migration in phenomenon of mutation and prevention of similar habitats. Mutation as concept of extended migration is based on sharing of the information from best solution which controls the diversity among the population limited to the near feasible solution. These make the fine-tuning of the algorithm from one generation to next and converge fast. Fourteen standard benchmark functions are used to demonstrate the performance of MBBO. The results are compared with eight other population-based optimisation algorithms with discrete version of population. The experimental results are analysed using statistical two paired t-test. MBBO performance is also compared with other modified BBO algorithms. To show the capability of MBBO to solve the problems of continuous type, MBBO and other optimisation algorithms are applied as soil computing tool to calculate the resonant frequency of rectangular microstrip patch antennas of different dimensions having various substrate thicknesses.", "paper_title": "Modified biogeography-based optimisation (MBBO)", "paper_id": "WOS:000308614500005"}
