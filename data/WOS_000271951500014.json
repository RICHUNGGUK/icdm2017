The source has access to each of the transmit antennas through a finite-capacity link, and likewise the destination is connected to the receiving antennas via capacity-constrained channels (e. g., as for wired or time-division multiple access (TDMA) channels). Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the remote MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, it is assumed that transmitters and receivers are oblivious to the encoding function shared by source and destination. Assuming a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers), achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound (that holds also for codebook-dependent operation). Closed-form expressions are derived for large numbers of antennas (and in some cases large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)), and asymptotics of the achievable rates are studied with respect to either link capacities or SNR. Overall, the analysis points to effective transmission/reception strategies for the distributed MIMO channel at hand, which are optimal under specified conditions. In particular, it is concluded that in certain asymptotic and nonasymptotic regimes there is no loss of optimality in designing the system for nomadic applications (i.e., assuming oblivious transmitters and receivers). Numerical results validate the analysis.", "paper_title": "Distributed MIMO Systems for Nomadic Applications Over a Symmetric Interference Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000271951500014"}
