The proposed method enables various effects such as surface flow, capillary flow involving absorption and saturation of water, changes of the material properties caused by water saturation, and the deformable body dynamics including tearing. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces promising results.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Porous deformable shell simulation with surface water flow and saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319003500012"}
