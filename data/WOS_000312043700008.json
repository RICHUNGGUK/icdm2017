Mostly recently, Yoon et al. [27] proposed a new secure and efficient SIP authentication scheme in a converged VoIP network based on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC). In this paper, we first demonstrate that the recently proposed SIP authentication scheme is insecure against off-line password guessing attacks. Thereafter, we propose an enhanced SIP authentication scheme that enjoys provable security And yet our scheme is simple and efficient. Therefore, the end result is more suited to be a candidate for SIP authentication scheme.", "paper_title": "Secure and Efficient SIP Authentication Scheme for Converged VoIP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312043700008"}
