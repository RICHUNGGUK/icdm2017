We also propose an algorithm that can be used to improve upper bounds for the weighted earliness criterion and lower bounds for an earliness/tardiness problem. The computational tests show that the algorithm is superior to an initial heuristic schedule and an existing adjacency condition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
