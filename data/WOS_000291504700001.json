For such systems, distributed stability analysis and observer design presents several advantages with respect to centralized approaches, such as modularity, easier analysis and design, and reduced computational complexity. Applications include distributed process control, traffic and communication networks, and economic systems. In this paper, we propose sequential stability analysis and observer design for distributed systems where the subsystems are represented by Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models. The analysis and design are done sequentially for the subsystems, allowing for the online addition of new subsystems. The conditions are formulated as LMIs and are therefore easy to solve. The approach is illustrated on simulation examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
