In some applications, event times can be always observed, but types for some events may be missing. In this article, a semiparametric additive rates model is proposed for analyzing multivariate recurrent event data when event categories are missing at random. A weighted estimating equation approach is developed to estimate parameters of interest, and the resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. In addition, a lack-of-fit test is presented to assess the adequacy of the model. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well for practical settings. An application to a platelet transfusion reaction study is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
