In fact, when A, B or C is the newly marketed product, A > B boolean OR C shall be a very useful rule in some cases. Since the consequent item of this kind of rule is formed by a disjunctive composite item, we call this type of rules as the disjunctive consequent association rules. Therefore, we propose a simple but efficient algorithm to discover this type of rules. Moreover, when we apply our algorithm to insurance policy for cross selling, the useful results have been proven by the insurance company. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
