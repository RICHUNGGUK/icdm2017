Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study was carried out with data gathered by personal interview using a structured questionnaire. Relationships proposed in the theoretical model were estimated through structural equation models. In total, 811 users of social networks over 14 and residents in Spain were part of the sample. Findings - Results indicate that use attitude and the subjective norm, both TPB variables, directly and significantly influence social network loyalty. Thus, network loyalty can be achieved if the individual shows a favourable attitude towards use and receives positive feed-back (comments, opinions, etc.) from friends, acquaintances and other individuals in their environment. Perceived control has no influence on social network loyalty. Finally, this research highlights the importance of socialisation and entertainment as antecedents of social network attitude. Research limitations/implications - Social network use has been analysed globally and database includes users with very different profiles (e. g. Facebook and Tuenti) what may skew the results. Practical implications - Individuals access social networks to establish social links with friends/ family/acquaintances, seeking entertainment and fun, but they are never used to be fashionable or up-to-date. Given the importance of social relations, companies should motivate participation elements in their social networks profiles. Originality/value - The paper presents a model that explains the formation of loyal social network customers, integrating TPB and Uses and Gratifications Theory to enable understanding of the role of these networks in individuals' lives.", "paper_title": "Determinants of user behaviour and recommendation in social networks An integrative approach from the uses and gratifications perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000345148100009"}
