The system consists of a process agent that creates production schedule, AGV agents to generate collision-free routing for multiple AGVs, and a handling agent that determines motion planning for material handling system. Each agent repeats the information exchange and replanning until a feasible solution is derived. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by comparing the results of the proposed method and those of the conventional method. Experimental study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Distributed optimization method for simultaneous production scheduling and transportation routing in semiconductor fabrication bays", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000007"}
