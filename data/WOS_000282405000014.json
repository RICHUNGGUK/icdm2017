Its semantics mainly depends on several structural rules. Structural rules are convenient for specification, but inefficient for implementation. In this paper, we establish a new semantics for applied pi calculus based upon pure labeled transition system and propose a new formulation of labeled bisimulation. We prove that the new labeled bisimularity coincides with observational equivalence. A zero-knowledge protocol is given as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of this new semantics.
