In this paper we investigate the clustering of Iberian universities, resulting from the similarity in the number and specific nature of the scientific disciplines given by the Essential Science Indicators database. A further refining of the analysis, as provided by PCA, clearly reveals the relationship between the universities and the scientific disciplines in the main groups. Similarity between universities is not dictated only by the number of areas in the ranking, but also stems from the nature of the ranked scientific areas and the specific combination in each university.", "paper_title": "Iberian universities: a characterisation from ESI rankings", "paper_id": "WOS:000314753500026"}
