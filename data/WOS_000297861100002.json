Motivated learning drives a machine to develop abstract motivations and choose its own goals. ML also provides a self-organizing system that controls a machine's behavior based on competition between dynamically-changing pain signals. This provides an interplay of externally driven and internally generated control signals. It is demonstrated that ML not only yields a more sophisticated learning mechanism and system of values than reinforcement learning (RL), but is also more efficient in learning complex relations and delivers better performance than RL in dynamically-changing environments. In addition, this paper shows the basic neural network structures used to create abstract motivations, higher level goals, and subgoals. Finally, simulation results show comparisons between ML and RL in environments of gradually increasing sophistication and levels of difficulty. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
