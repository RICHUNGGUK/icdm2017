We describe an attack that enables the verifier to recover the full secret with essentially no computing power beyond what is required to run the protocol and after only a few iterations of it. We also describe variants of the attack that apply when some additional simple checks are performed by the prover.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of an efficient proof of knowledge of discrete logarithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238186800003"}
