First, the generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model (GFHM) is used to model unknown part of a chaotic system. Second, based on Lyapunov functional approach, a sufficient condition for a fuzzy hyperbolic controller and a state feedback controller is given such that the closed-loop system is asymptotic stable. Moreover, considering the influence of both approximation error and external disturbance, fuzzy hyperbolic H-infinity control scheme is addressed. All the results are given in terms of LMI forms, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by a simulation example.", "paper_title": "GFHM model and control for uncertain chaotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300006"}
