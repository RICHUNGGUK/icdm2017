We model the stress isolation problem as a topology optimization problem with multiple stress constraints in different regions. The shape equilibrium constraint approach is employed to effectively control the local stress constraints. The level set based structural optimization is implemented with the extended finite element method (X-FEM) for providing an adequately accurate stress analysis. Numerical examples of stress isolation design in two dimensions are investigated as a benchmark test of the proposed method. The results, from the force transmittance point of view, suggest that the guard \"grooves\" obtained can change the force path to successfully realize the stress isolation in the structure.", "paper_title": "Stress isolation through topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000335510400005"}
