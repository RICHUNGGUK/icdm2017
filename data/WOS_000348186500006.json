The e-learning program was built through the collaboration of a nurse educator and an informatics professor. The program was then developed according to the following steps: (1) building a visual interface, (2) scripting each unit, (3) preparing the course material and assessment tests, (4) using teaching software to record audio and video courses, (5) editing the audio recordings, (6) using instructional media or hyperlinks to finalize the interactions, (7) creating the assessment and obtaining feedback, and (8) testing the overall operation. The digital program consisted of five learning modules, self-assessment questions, learning cases, sharing experiences, and learning resources. Forty nurses participated in this study and fully completed the questionnaires both before and after the program. The knowledge and confidence levels in the experimental group were significantly higher over time than those of the comparison group. The results supported the use of educational technology to provide a more flexible and effective presentation method for continuing education programs.", "paper_title": "The Development and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Nursing Case Management E-Learning Program", "paper_id": "WOS:000348186500006"}
