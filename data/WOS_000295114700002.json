We apply two different scoring functions, both independently and in combination, to predict the binding affinity of ligands in the CSAR-NRC data sets. One reported here for the first time employs multiple chemical-geometrical descriptors of the protein-ligand interface to develop Quantitative Structure Binding Affinity Relationships (QSBAR) models. These models are then used to predict binding affinity of ligands in the external data set. Second is a physical force field-based scoring function, MedusaScore. We show that both individual scoring functions achieve statistically significant prediction accuracies with the squared correlation coefficient (R-2) between the actual and predicted binding affinity of 0.44/0.53 (Set1/Set2) with QSBAR models and 0.34/0.47 (Set1/Set2) with MedusaScore. Importantly, we find that the combination of QSBAR models and MedusaScore into consensus scoring function affords higher prediction accuracy than any of the contributing methods achieving R-2 values of 0.45/0.58 (Set1/Set2). Furthermore, we identify several chemical features and noncovalent interactions that may be responsible for the inaccurate prediction of binding affinity for several ligands by the scoring functions employed in this study.", "paper_title": "Combined Application of Cheminformatics- and Physical Force Field-Based Scoring Functions Improves Binding Affinity Prediction for CSAR Data Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000295114700002"}
