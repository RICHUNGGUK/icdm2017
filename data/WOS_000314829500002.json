Predicting links that will appear in them is one of the main approach to understand their dynamics. Only few works address the bipartite case, though, despite its high practical interest and the specific challenges it raises. We define in this paper the notion of internal links in bipartite graphs and propose a link prediction method based on them. We thoroughly describe the method and its variations, and experimentally compare it to a basic collaborative filtering approach. We present results obtained for a typical practical case. We reach the conclusion that our method performs very well, and we study in details how its parameters may influence obtained results.", "paper_title": "Internal link prediction: A new approach for predicting links in bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000314829500002"}
