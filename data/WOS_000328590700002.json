However, how to design an efficient reconstruction by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel \"undersampled\" correlation noise model to describe compressively sampled video signals, and present a maximum-likelihood dictionary learning based reconstruction algorithm for DCVS, in which both the correlation and sparsity constraints are included in a new probabilistic model. Moreover, the signal recovery in our algorithm is performed during the process of dictionary learning, instead of being employed as an independent task. Experimental results show that our proposal compares favorably with other existing methods, with 0.1-3.5 dB improvements in the average PSNR, and a 2-9 dB gain for non-key frames when key frames are subsampled at an increased rate.
