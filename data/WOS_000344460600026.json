They often work at multiple operating points due to different production and working conditions. To obtain a global model, the direct modeling and experiments in a large operating range are often very difficult. Motivated by the multi-modeling, a fuzzy-based spatio-temporal multi-modeling approach is proposed for nonlinear DPS. To obtain a reasonable operating space division, a priori information and the fuzzy clustering are used to decompose the operating space from coarse scale to fine scale gradually. To reduce the dimension in the local spatio-temporal modeling, the Karhunen-Loeve method is used for the space/time separation. Both multi-modeling and space/time separation can reduce the modeling complexity. Finally, to get a smooth global model, a three-domain (3D) fuzzy integration method is proposed. Using the proposed method, the model accuracy will be improved and the experiments become easier. The effectiveness is verified by simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
