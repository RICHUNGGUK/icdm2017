Characteristic function of a fuzzy variable is defined as the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral with respect to its credibility distribution function. In this paper, some mathematical properties of credibility distribution function are investigated. As a main result, continuity theorems of characteristic functions for fuzzy variables sequence are obtained.", "paper_title": "On continuity theorem for characteristic function of fuzzy variable", "paper_id": "WOS:000239481700012"}
