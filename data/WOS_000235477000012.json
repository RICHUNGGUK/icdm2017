Detecting such faults can cause a chip that operates correctly to be discarded as faulty. A solution proposed earlier was to mask output values where redundant faults are detected in the circuit with DFT, without masking other faults, which should continue to be detected. We investigate a complementary issue of generating test sets that require as little masking as possible. Our goal is to generate a test set that does not detect any redundant faults ( or detects as few redundant faults as possible), such that no output values ( or as few output values as possible) would have to be masked. We discuss the relationship of this problem to fault dominance. We then describe a specific procedure based on test selection for deriving test sets that detect as few redundant faults as possible while detecting all the other detectable faults.", "paper_title": "On generating tests that avoid the detection of redundant faults in synchronous sequential circuits with full scan", "paper_id": "WOS:000235477000012"}
