Our tool is aimed at determining the ancestry of unknown samples-typical of ancient DNA data-particularly when only low amounts of data are available for those samples.", "paper_title": "bammds: a tool for assessing the ancestry of low-depth whole-genome data using multidimensional scaling (MDS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000343083600017"}
