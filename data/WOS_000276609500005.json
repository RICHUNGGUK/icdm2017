Measurement of the aerodynamic force on a non-spinning rugby ball reveals that the side force coefficient depends on the position of the seam as well as the angle of attack. It was found from pressure-sensitive paint measurements that the seam of the ball is the trigger for initiating low pressure when the seam is situated around 60 degrees from the stagnation point. The flight trajectory of the fluctuating ball can be obtained by numerically integrating the six degree-of-freedom non-linear equations of motion. It was shown that a slower spinning ball fluctuates from side to side during flight because of the asymmetrical pressure distribution on the sides of the ball.", "paper_title": "Simulation of the trajectory of a punted rugby ball taking into account the asymmetrical pressure distribution caused by the seams", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500005"}
