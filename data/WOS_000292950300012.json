A novel Circular Adaptive Region of Interest (CAROI) method is proposed to analyze the Computed Tomography (CT) images of the brain. Our result indicates that for the emergency physicians and radiology residents, there is a significant improvement in sensitivity and specificity when using CAD (P < 0.005). A mathematical model is established incorporating the weighting of the feature changes. Our CAD scheme is promising for early detection of ischemic stroke and helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
