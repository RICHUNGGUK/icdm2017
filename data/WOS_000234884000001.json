Both isotropic and composite cylindrical shells filled with or subjected to a flowing fluid have been considered in this study. The structure may be uniform or non-uniform in the circumferential direction. The hybrid finite element approach, shearable shell theory and velocity potential flow theory have been combined to establish the dynamic equations of the coupled system. The set of matrices describing their relative contributions to equilibrium is determined by exact analytical integration of the equilibrium equations. The linear potential flow theory is applied to describe the fluid effects that lead to the inertial, centrifugal and Coriolis forces. The axisymmetric, beam-like and shell modes of vibrations in both cases of uniform and non-uniform cylindrical shells are investigated. Fluid elastic stability of a structure subjected to a flowing fluid is also studied. This theory yields the high and the low eigenvalues and eigenmodes with comparably high accuracy. Reasonable agreement is found with other theories and experiments.
