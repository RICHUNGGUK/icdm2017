It is known that the reachability problem for communication-free Petri nets is NP-complete. Lacking the synchronization mechanism the expressive power of communication-free Petri nets is somewhat limited. It is therefore importance to see whether the power of communication-free Petri nets can be enhanced without sacrificing their analytical capabilities. As a first step towards this line of research, in this paper our main concern is to investigate from the decidability/complexity viewpoint, the reachability problem for a number of variants of communication-free Petri nets, including communication-free Petri nets augmented with 'static priorities,' 'dynamic priorities,' 'states,' 'inhibitor arcs,' and 'timing constraints.'", "paper_title": "Reachability Analysis of Variants of Communication-Free Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630300001"}
