An effective neighborhood search algorithm (NSA) is proposed for the problem, in which a job permutation and a batch permutation are used to indicate the solution of two sub-problems, respectively. Each job permutation consists of several family-permutations for the representation of jobs from the same family. Two swaps are applied to two permutations to produce new solutions. NSA is applied to a number of instances and compared with some methods, and computational results validate the good performance of NSA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
