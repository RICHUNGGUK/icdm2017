(2007) [8] and Nikov et al. (2002) [34]. In the generalized setting, a (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) allows a sender to communicate one of n secrets to a receiver with the help of l servers. Specifically, the transfer task of the sender is distributed among l servers and the receiver interacts with k out of the l servers in order to retrieve the secret he is interested in. The DOT protocols we consider in this work are information-theoretically secure. The known (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) protocols require linear (in n) communication complexity between the receiver and servers. In this paper, we construct (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) protocols which only require sublinear (in n) communication complexity between the receiver and servers. Our constructions are based on information-theoretic private information retrieval. In particular, we obtain both a specific reduction from (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) to polynomial interpolation-based information-theoretic private information retrieval and a general reduction from (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) to any information-theoretic private information retrieval. The specific reduction yields (t, tau)-private (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) protocols of communication complexity O(n(1/[(k-tau-1)/t])) between a semi-honest receiver and servers for any integers t and tau such that 1 <= t <= k - 1 and 0 <= tau <= k - 1 - t. The general reduction yields (t, tau)-private (k, l)-DOT-((n)(1)) protocols which are as communication-efficient as the underlying private information retrieval protocols for any integers t and tau such that 1 <= t <= k - 2 and 0 <= tau <= k - 1 - t.
