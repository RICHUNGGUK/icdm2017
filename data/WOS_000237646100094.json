The related recent studies have shown their drawback in the performance of AAA procedure. This study suggests a novel approach extending to the Fast Handoff scheme, which will shorten authentication delay by using Assertion mechanism. It allows mobile nodes to access visited network resources efficiently. Our model with Assertion process is an efficient approach employing authentication procedure through mutual and secure authentication between the Visit AAA servers. Especially, when the distance or the network delay between V_AAA and Home Agent (HA) become longer, it outperforms rather than the previous approaches. The proposed scheme verifies its significant efficiency in terms of cost analysis through several simulated experiments.", "paper_title": "An efficient authentication mechanism for fast mobility service in MIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100094"}
