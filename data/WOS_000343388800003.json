The role of usability in reinforcing these direct and indirect security effects has also been tested. This study examines the reinforcement of previous relationships in highly usable contexts. To test this, a fictitious website was designed for a nonexistent clothing company directed at the segment of middle class consumers. Two blocks of changes were made to alter website usability: one concerning website speed and the other related to ease of use. Results for a study sample of 170 respondents show that in usable contexts (that is, with quicker, functional websites), when website security perceptions augment, this leads to stronger effects (in terms of pleasure, trust and perceived risk) thereby simultaneously increasing buying intention.", "paper_title": "How Can Secure Websites Improve Buying Intention?
