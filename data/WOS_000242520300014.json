We justify this replacement by the performances achieved using the ratified Medium Access Control protocol which has several flaws although its design is based on fairness. We will especially focus on power consumption because it is a widely required feature and is not dealt with efficiently in the current protocol. To solve the energy-efficiency problem while still maintaining good quality of service, we propose a TDMA-based Medium Access Control protocol, with enhanced features allowing to save energy such as deterministic scheduling and frame aggregation.
