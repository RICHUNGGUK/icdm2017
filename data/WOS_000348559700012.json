Whereas basic k-anonymity only protects against identity disclosure, t-closeness was presented as an extension of k-anonymity that also protects against attribute disclosure. We show here that, if not quite equivalent, t-closeness and epsilon-differential privacy are strongly related to one another when it comes to anonymizing data sets. Specifically, k-anonymity for the quasi-identifiers combined with epsilon-differential privacy for the confidential attributes yields stochastic t-closeness (an extension oft-closeness), with t a function of k and epsilon. Conversely, t-closeness can yield c-differential privacy when t = exp(epsilon/2) and the assumptions made by t-closeness about the prior and posterior views of the data hold. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
