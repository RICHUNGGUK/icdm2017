New in finite families of quantum symmetric and asymmetric codes are constructed. In particular, new quantum codes are obtained from binary BCH codes and MDS codes. These codes have known minimum distances and thus the relationship between the rate gain and minimum distance is given explicitly. The codes obtained are shown to have parameters better than those of previous codes. A number of known codes are special cases of the codes given here.", "paper_title": "SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC QUANTUM CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313300003"}
