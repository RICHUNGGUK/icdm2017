Under some essential restriction on the system growth, by the method of adding a power integrator, a continuous state-feedback controller is successfully designed, and the global asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proven with the help of an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasonskii functional. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "GLOBAL STABILIZATION FOR A CLASS OF HIGH-ORDER TIME-DELAY NONLINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500036"}
