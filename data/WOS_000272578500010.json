In a recent article in this journal, Monte Carlo analysis was employed to compare and contrast alternative DEA models that measure efficiency in the presence of exogenous variables. The methodology for comparison was flawed, calling into question the results presented. We introduce new second-stage models and compare and contrast them with simulated data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
