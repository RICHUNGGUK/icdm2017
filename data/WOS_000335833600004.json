As proof-of-concept we transmit data at 100 GHz carrier frequency using on-off keying modulation and heterodyne detection. The sub-THz carrier signals are generated by photo-mixing two optical carrier signals at different frequencies, extracted from an optical frequency comb. We introduce a novel system to stabilize the phase of the optical carrier signals. Error-free transmission is successfully achieved up to a bit rate of 8.5 Gbit/s at 100 GHz.", "paper_title": "Generation of Coherent Sub-Terahertz Carrier with Phase Stabilization for Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000335833600004"}
