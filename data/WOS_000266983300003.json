Second, log data can be used to train user models, which can then be applied to improve retrieval systems. This article presents a study of logs from PubMed(A (R)), the public gateway to the MEDLINEA (R) database of bibliographic records from the medical and biomedical primary literature. Unlike most previous studies on general Web search, our work examines user activities with a highly-specialized search engine. We encode user actions as string sequences and model these sequences using n-gram language models. The models are evaluated in terms of perplexity and in a sequence prediction task. They help us better understand how PubMed users search for information and provide an enabler for improving users' search experience.", "paper_title": "Modeling actions of PubMed users with n-gram language models", "paper_id": "WOS:000266983300003"}
