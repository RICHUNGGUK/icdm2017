Context-awareness is an important facet of pervasive service creation, which deals with the acquisition, rendering, representation and utilisation of context information. In this paper we tackle context-awareness at the application level dealing with the representation and utilisation of context by services. We propose a model-driven approach that facilitates the creation of a context modelling framework and simplifies the design and implementation of pervasive services. To conclude, we demonstrate the benefits of our model-driven approach via the creation of a pervasive museum service and its evaluation using selected software metrics.
