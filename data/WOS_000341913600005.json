These CPU/IO intensive analysis queries are complex and time-consuming but share common components. It is challenging to detect, share and reuse the common components among thousands of SQL-like queries. Previous solutions to MQO, heuristic or genetic based, are not appropriate for the large growing query set situation. In this paper, we develop a sharing system called LSShare using our proposed Lineage-Signature approach. By LSShare, we can efficiently solve the MQO problem in a recurring query set situation in the cloud. Our system has been prototyped in a distributed system built for massive data analysis based on Alibaba's cloud computing platform (http://www.alibaba.com/). Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "LSShare: an efficient multiple query optimization system in the cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000341913600005"}
