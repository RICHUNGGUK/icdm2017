This algorithm leads to the following applications for the general setting of unrelated parallel machines: (i) a bicriteria algorithm for a schedule whose weighted completion-time and makespan simultaneously exhibit the current-best individual approximations for these criteria; (ii) better-than-two approximation guarantees for scheduling to minimize the L-p norm of the vector of machine-loads, for all 1 < p < infinity; and (iii) the first constant-factor multicriteria approximation algorithms that can handle the weighted completion-time and any given collection of integer L-p norms. Our algorithm has a natural interpretation as a melding of linear-algebraic and probabilistic approaches. Via this view, it yields a common generalization of rounding theorems due to Karp et al. [1987] and Shmoys & Tardos [1993], and leads to improved approximation algorithms for the problem of scheduling with resource-dependent processing times introduced by Grigoriev et al.
