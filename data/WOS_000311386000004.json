Since the use of multiple beams simultaneously results in a poor performance of MDB when the number of users is not sufficiently large, the use of single-beam at a time is considered to avoid performance degradation due to the interference from other beams. Furthermore, in order to share a common precoder by multiple users, modulation division multiplexing (MDM) with a higher order modulation for MDB is discussed. Performance criteria for precoder and user selection are derived under the assumption that the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is used.
