It finds out high utility itemsets by considering both the profits and quantities of items in transactions. It may have a bias if items are not always on shelf. In this paper, we thus design a new kind of patterns, named high on-shelf utility itemsets, which considers not only individual profit and quantity of each item in a transaction but also common on-shelf time periods of a product combination. We also propose a two-phased mining algorithm to effectively and efficiently discover high on-shelf utility itemsets. In the first phase, the possible candidate on-shelf utility itemsets within each time period are found level by level. In the second phase, the candidate on-shelf utility itemsets are further checked for their actual utility values by an additional database scan. At last, the experimental results on synthetic datasets also show the proposed approach has a good performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
