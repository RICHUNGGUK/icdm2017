The role of (structured) tokens play send/receive statements, that arrive at random, which makes the distribution of edges change dynamically. In this sense a net is self- modyfying: although the set of agents- places is fixed, the channels and communicating actions vary in the course of the net activity. Problems of deadlock and fairness is investigated.", "paper_title": "Self-Modifying Nets for Synchronous, Connection-Oriented, Multicast Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615900004"}
