The developed method can be applied to any non-stationary time series of finite length and it guarantees that not only the marginal distributions but also the autocorrelation structures of observed and simulated time series are the same. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to check the performance of our method and to assess if the overall dynamics of the observed time series is preserved by the simulated realizations. The developed simulation method has also been applied to the real size data of cocoon filament, which can be reeled from a cocoon produced by a silkworm. Very good results have been achieved in all the cases considered in the paper.", "paper_title": "A simulation method for finite non-stationary time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000334334500011"}
