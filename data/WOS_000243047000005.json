As the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin represents the dark (inactive) state of the receptor, the details of GPCR activation are still unknown. In this molecular dynamics study we investigate how the homology model of the human adenosine A(3) receptor responds to ligand exposure. To this end we placed the homology model in a POPC membrane model. After equilibrating for 13 ns an agonist (Cl-IB-MECA) and an inverse agonist (PSB-10) were placed inside the putative binding pocket. In the following 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation we observed a different behaviour of the side-chain torsions of Trp243(6.48), depending on the presence or absence of the agonist or inverse agonist. This conformational change of Trp243 correlates with the assumed influence of ligands on receptor activation. Other predicted conformational changes of the receptor could not be observed yet. So Trp243 may represent the first switch in receptor activation.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulation of the human adenosine A(3) receptor: agonist induced conformational changes of Trp243", "paper_id": "WOS:000243047000005"}
