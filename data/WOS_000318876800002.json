Several approaches have been proved to be efficient in protecting basic scenarios. However, in scenarios requiring advanced features, such as advanced authorization capabilities, level of assurance facilities or effective privacy management, certain issues still need to be addressed. In this work, we propose an identity management infrastructure, based on the SAML, XACML and XKMS standards, which extends current approaches in order to achieve the required features. We include a performance analysis to show the feasibility of this architecture.", "paper_title": "Definition of an advanced identity management infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000318876800002"}
