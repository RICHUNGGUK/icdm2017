However, any real implementation will encounter de-coherence effects due to interactions with uncontrollable degrees of freedom. We present a complete characterization of the mixing properties of the hypercube QRW under a physically relevant Markovian decoherence model. hi the local decoherence model considered the non-unitary dynamics are modeled as a sum of projections oil individual qubits to an arbitrary direction oil the Bloch sphere. We prove that there is always classical (asymptotic) mixing in this model and specify the conditions under which instantaneous mixing always exists. And we show that the latter mixing property, as well as the classical mixing time, depend heavily on the exact environmental interaction and its strength. Therefore, algorithmic applications of the QRW on the hypercube, if they intend to employ mixing properties, need to consider both the walk dynamics and the precise decoherence model.", "paper_title": "COMPLETE CHARACTERIZATION OF MIXING TIME FOR THE CONTINUOUS QUANTUM WALK ON THE HYPERCUBE WITH MARKOVIAN DECOHERENCE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000269050200008"}
