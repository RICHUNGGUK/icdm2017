It can be viewed as an improvement of the intensity-based model whose dissimilarity term is based on minimization of the so-called sum of squared difference(SSD). In the proposed model, it is assumed that the residue of two images can be described as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Then we incorporate the features of variational regularization methods and expectation-maximization(EM) algorithm, and propose the new model. The novelty is the introduction of two weighting functions and some control parameters in dissimilarity term. The weighting functions could identify low and high contrast objects of the residue automatically and effectively, and the control parameters help to improve the robustness of the model to the choice of regularization parameters. By the introduced parameters and weighting functions, the algorithm could locally adjust the behavior of deformation in different contrast regions. Numerical experimental results of 2D synthetic and 3D MR brain images demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach compared with other methods.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model for Non-rigid Image Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000307772900005"}
