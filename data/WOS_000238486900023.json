Many of such controls have, apart from their control purpose, an inherent economic value component. This feature requires controls to pop-up into business value models, stating how actors create, trade and consume objects of economic value. In this paper, we provide guidelines that can be used to decide whether organizational controls should be part of a value model or not. We demonstrate these guidelines by a case study on the Letter of Credit procedure.", "paper_title": "Inter-organisational controls as value objects in network organisations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238486900023"}
