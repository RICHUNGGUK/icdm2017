However, in cell classification there are many unresolved issues that need to be addressed. Neuronal classification usually starts with grouping cells into classes according to their main morphological features. If one tries to test quantitatively such a qualitative classification, a considerable overlap in cell types often appears. There is little published information on it. In order to remove the above-mentioned shortcoming, we undertook the present study with the aim to offer a novel method for solving the class overlapping problem. To illustrate our method, we analyzed a sample of 124 neurons from adult human dentate nucleus. Among them we qualitatively selected 55 neurons with small dendritic fields (the small neurons), and 69 asymmetrical neurons with large dendritic fields (the large neurons). We showed that these two samples are normally and independently distributed. By measuring the neuronal soma areas of both samples, we observed that the corresponding normal curves cut each other. We proved that the abscissa of the point of intersection of the curves could represent the boundary between the two adjacent overlapping neuronal classes, since the error done by such division is minimal. Statistical evaluation of the division was also performed.", "paper_title": "On the classification of normally distributed neurons: an application to human dentate nucleus", "paper_id": "WOS:000290554500002"}
