The objective is to expand the work initiated in [Yee HC, Sjogreen B. Nonlinear filtering in compact high order schemes. In: Proceedings of the 19th ICNSP and 7th APPTC conference; 2005; J Plasma Phys 2006;72:833-36] and compare the performance of adaptive multistep filtering in compact high order schemes with adaptive filtering in standard central (non-compact) schemes for multiscale problems containing shock waves.
