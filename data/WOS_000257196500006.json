New boolean relations for the bits of the leading-zero count are derived that allow their computation to be performed using standard carry-lookahead techniques. Using the proposed approach various design choices can be explored and different circuit topologies can be derived for the design of the leading-zero counting unit. The new circuits can be efficiently implemented either in static or in dynamic logic and require significantly less energy per operation compared to the already known architectures. The integration of the proposed leading-zero counter with the leading-zero anticipation logic is analyzed and the most efficient combination is identified. Finally, a simple yet efficient technique for handling the error of the leading-zero anticipation logic is also presented. The energy-delay behavior of the proposed circuits has been investigated using static and dynamic CMOS implementations in a 130-nm CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Low-power leading-zero counting and anticipation logic for high-speed floating point units", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500006"}
