However, the creative processing additionally has the benefit if the new concepts of the computer games are widely used and discussed. We focus on understanding the ideas to be shared between the game designer and the game programmer in the game design. The research defines a graph-based representation of game scenarios is in terms of Event graph, State graph, and Action graph forms in order to minimize anomalies of game flow design. This method in our research can reduce unexpected and undesirable game situations. Also it reduces the mismatched information between the game designer and the game programmer in game-playing. Compared with the existing method such as storyboard, flowchart, and SSM, we demonstrate the viability of our game design methodology.", "paper_title": "A graph-based representation of game scenarios; methodology for minimizing anomalies in computer game", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800020"}
