We first survey recent research progress in applying RLNC in P2P content distribution and multimedia streaming, respectively. We then study the pollution attack, a primary type of security threat particularly relevant to RLNC, and present and compare some existing countermeasures. We finally discuss confidentiality and privacy issues in RLNC-enabled P2P applications as future research challenges.", "paper_title": "Random Linear Network Coding for Peer-to-Peer Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000282546100007"}
