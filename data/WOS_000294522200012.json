The multi-agent simulation model of malware spreading is designed based on the Scale-Free network theory, which focuses on the control of its spread. Through simulation experiments, it is found that the speed of malware spreading is inhibited with the increasing of long-lasting immunity node, and is accelerated with that of the infection rate. It is also found that the (learning) ability plays a decisive role on the control of malware spreading and the average connection has important impact on the speed of spreading. The results show that in order to control the spread of malware, internet users should enhance awareness of malware and solving ability, while the government should strengthen the supervision on the Internet and promote the development of security software through effective measures.", "paper_title": "A SIMULATION APPROACH TO THE CONTROL MECHANISM OF INDIVIDUAL AND WEB SITE IN MALWARE SPREAD", "paper_id": "WOS:000294522200012"}
