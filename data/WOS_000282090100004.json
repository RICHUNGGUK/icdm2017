We address the privacy issue of the distributed networked storage system. It is desired that data stored in the system remain private even if all storage servers in the system are compromised. The major challenge of designing these distributed networked storage systems is to provide a better privacy guarantee while maintaining the distributed structure. To achieve this goal, we introduce secure decentralized erasure code, which combines a threshold public key encryption scheme and a variant of the decentralized erasure code. Our secure distributed networked storage system constructed by the secure decentralized erasure code is decentralized, robust, private, and with low storage cost.", "paper_title": "A Secure Decentralized Erasure Code for Distributed Networked Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000282090100004"}
