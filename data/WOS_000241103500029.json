Otherwise, more suitable matchings can be found by using the semantics of these sources. In this way, semantic matching involves the task of finding similarities among overlapping sources by using semantic knowledge. In the last years, the ontologies have emerged to represent this semantics. On these lines, we introduce our ASeMatch method for semantic matching. By applying several NLP tools and resources in a novel way and by using the semantic and syntactic information extracted from the ontologies, our method finds complex mappings such as 1 - N and N - 1 matchings.", "paper_title": "ASeMatch: A semantic matching method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500029"}
