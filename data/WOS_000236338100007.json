These experiments successfully demonstrate the practicality of cyclic pursuit as a distributed control strategy for multiple wheeled-robot systems. The pursuit-based coordination algorithm was found to be Surprisingly robust in the presence Of unmodelled dynamics and delays due to sensing and information processing. Moreover, the findings of this research not only bode well for continuing research on pursuit-based coordination strategies, but also for other cooperative multirobot control techniques employing similar local interactions.
