In this paper we discuss the idea of programming as an activity that takes place within the temporal bounds of a real-time computational process and its interactions with the physical world. We ground these ideas within the context of livecoding - a live audiovisual performance practice. We then describe how the development of the programming environment \"Impromptu\" has addressed our ideas of programming with time and the notion of the programmer as an agent in a cyber-physical system.", "paper_title": "Programming With Time Cyber-physical programming with Impromptu", "paper_id": "WOS:000286595800050"}
