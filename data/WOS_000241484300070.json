Based on this analogy, we present a new Cellular Automata algorithm, termed Crystal, implementing fast, parallel, scalable and secure encryption systems. Our approach provides a design principle to ensure an invertible dynamics for arbitrary neighborhood. Thus, several variants of our CA can be devised so as to offer customized encryption-decryption algorithms. Considering larger data blocks improve both security and speed (throughput larger than 10Gbps on dedicated hardware).", "paper_title": "Discrete physics, Cellular Automata and cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300070"}
