We start with introducing a visual learning approach that uses genetic programming individuals to recognize objects. The process of recognition is generative, i.e., requires the learner to restore the shape of the processed object. This method is extended with a code reuse mechanism by introducing a crossbreeding operator that allows importing the genetic material from other evolutionary runs. In the experimental part, we compare the performance of the extended approach to the basic method on a real-world task of handwritten character recognition, and conclude that code reuse leads to better results in terms of fitness and recognition accuracy. Detailed analysis of the crossbred genetic material shows also that code reuse is most profitable when the recognized objects exhibit visual similarity.", "paper_title": "CROSS-TASK CODE REUSE IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING APPLIED TO VISUAL LEARNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000333245200014"}
