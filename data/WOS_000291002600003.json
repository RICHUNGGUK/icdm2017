Images associated with the travelogue always consist of the content and the style of textual information. Relying on this assumption, in this paper, we present a framework of travelogue enriching, exploiting both textual and visual information generated by different users. The framework aims to select the most relevant images from automatically collected candidate image set to enrich the given travelogue, and form a comprehensive overview of the scenic spot. To do these, we propose to build two-layer probabilistic models, i.e. a text-layer model and image-layer models, on offline collected travelogues and images. Each topic (e.g. Sea, Mountain, Historical Sites) in the text-layer model is followed by an image-layer model with sub-topics learnt (e.g. the topic of sea is with the sub-topic like beach, tree, sunrise and sunset). Based on the model, we develop strategies to enrich travelogues in the following steps: (1) remove noisy names of scenic spots from travelogues; (2) generate queries to automatically gather candidate image set; (3) select images to enrich the travelogue; and (4) choose images to portray the visual content of a scenic spot. Experimental results on Chinese travelogues demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach on tasks of travelogue enrichment and the corresponding scenic spot illustration.", "paper_title": "TRAVELOGUE ENRICHING AND SCENIC SPOT OVERVIEW BASED ON TEXTUAL AND VISUAL TOPIC MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291002600003"}
