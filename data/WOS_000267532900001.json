However, Tarski fixed-point theorem for the L-fuzzy complete lattices is proved in a different way from that by Lai and Zhang. Furthermore, some fuzzy powerset operators are suggested, they are not only generalizations of ordinary powerset operators, but also generalizations of L-valued Zadeh powerset operators, and their properties are discussed.
