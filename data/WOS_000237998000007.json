For the sectional feature based strategy, slicing, curve feature recognition and constrained fitting are introduced. This strategy emphasizes the advanced feature architecture patterns from 2D to 3D in reverse engineering. The surface feature based strategy relies on differential geometric attributes estimation and diverse feature extraction techniques. The methods and algorithms such as attributes estimation based on 4D Shepard surface, symmetry plane extraction, quadric surface recognition and optimization, extruded and rotational surface extraction, and blend feature extraction with probability and statistic theory are proposed. The reliable three-dimensional feature fabricated the valid substratum of B-rep model faultlessly. All the algorithms are implemented in RE-SOFT, a reverse engineering software developed by Zhejiang University. The proposed strategies can be used to capture the original design intention accurately and to complete the reverse modeling process conveniently. Typical industrial components are used to illustrate the validation of our feature-based strategies. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
