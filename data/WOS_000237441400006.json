Our approach differs from the most commonly used one where the determination of the broadcast tree depends on the source node, thus resulting in different tree construction processes for different source nodes. Using a single broadcast tree simplifies considerably the tree maintenance problem and allows scaling to larger networks. We first show that, using the same broadcast tree, the total power consumed for broadcasting from a given source node is at most twice the total power consumed for broadcasting from any other source node. We next develop a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the construction of a single broadcast tree. The performance analysis of the algorithm indicates that the total power consumed for broadcasting from any source node is within 2H(n-1) from the optimal, where n is the number of nodes in the network and H(n) is the harmonic function. This approximation ratio is close to the best achievable bound in polynomial time. We also provide a useful relation between the minimum-energy broadcast problem and the minimum spanning tree, which shows that a minimum spanning tree may be a good candidate in sparsely connected networks. The performance of our algorithm is also evaluated numerically with simulations.", "paper_title": "Minimum-energy broadcasting in multi-hop wireless networks using a single broadcast tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000237441400006"}
