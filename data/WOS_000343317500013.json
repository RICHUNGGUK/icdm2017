Commercial services will play an important role in drawing customers to VANETs. Therefore, service-oriented vehicular networks offer an effective and promising approach. To meet the diverse requirements of different users, fine-grained access control is essential. This paper aims to address security, privacy and billing issues in service-oriented vehicular networks. Taking advantage of a portable electronic currency, the proposed scheme mitigates the long authentication delay of the centralized AAA architecture. Variant attribute-based encryption ensures fine-grained access control and secure billing. Only vehicles possessing the proper service attributes and valid electronic currency are authorized to access the requested service file. The security properties of entity authentication, session key agreement, privacy, fraud electronic currency prevention, double-spending prevention, and nonrepudiated billing are achieved. Extensive analysis and simulations demonstrate that our scheme is a viable candidate to replace a centralized AAA architecture with a decentralized method for better scalability in service-oriented vehicular networks.", "paper_title": "PBS: A Portable Billing Scheme with Fine-Grained Access Control for Service-Oriented Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343317500013"}
