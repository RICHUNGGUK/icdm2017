The study first introduces the digital, virtual, intelligent trend of airplane assembly and reveals the status and problems of digital airplane assembly studies. The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) structure is then proposed for digital airplane assembly, and the real-time control issues are discussed. Then, the question of real-time control undertaken by a parallel robot is simplified to a control question with bounded time delay and complex interference, and a mathematical description is presented. Next, a robust H infinity controller with a disturbance degree of decay gamma is designed according to the mathematical description. Finally, a simulation is conducted. All of the experiment results show the feasibility of the above proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Control for CPS of Digital Airplane Assembly with Robust H-Infinity Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000364492100006"}
