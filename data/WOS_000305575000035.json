The active eavesdropper is a more powerful adversary than the classical eavesdropper. It can choose between two functional modes: eavesdropping the transmission between the legitimate parties (Ex mode), and jamming it (Jxmode)-the active eavesdropper cannot function in full duplex mode. We consider a conservative scenario, when the active eavesdropper can choose its strategy based on the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair's strategy, and thus, the transmitter and legitimate receiver have to plan for the worst. We show that conventional physical-layer secrecy approaches perform poorly (if at all), and we introduce a novel encoding scheme, based on very limited and unsecured feedback-the Block-Markov Wyner encoding scheme-which outperforms any schemes currently available.", "paper_title": "Half-Duplex Active Eavesdropping in Fast-Fading Channels: A Block-Markov Wyner Secrecy Encoding Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000035"}
