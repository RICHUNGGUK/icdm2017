Acoustic and contextual analysis is performed to characterize multilingual phonetic units for phone set creation. Acoustic likelihood is utilized for similarity estimation of phone models. The hyperspace analog to language ( HAL) model is adopted for contextual modeling and contextual similarity estimation. A confusion matrix combining acoustic and contextual similarities between every two phonetic units is built for phonetic unit clustering. The multidimensional scaling ( MDS) method is applied to the confusion matrix for reducing dimensionality. Experimental results indicate that the created phonetic set provides a compact and robust set that considers acoustic and contextual information for mixed-language or multilingual speech recognition.", "paper_title": "Generation of phonetic units for mixed-language speech recognition based on acoustic and contextual analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000248208300008"}
