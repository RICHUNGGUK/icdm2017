The decision version of this problemis known to be efficiently solved by a family of recognizer P systems with activemembranes with three electrical charges working in the maximally parallel way. We here work with a variant of P systems with active membranes without polarizations and present a uniform solution to CAP in the minimally parallel mode.", "paper_title": "Uniform Solution to Common Algorithmic Problem by P Systems Working in the Minimally Parallel Mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000349462400009"}
