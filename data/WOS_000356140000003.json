The intent is to share some personal memories about these remarkable researchers and humans, highlight their long-lasting research accomplishments and stress a visible impact on the fuzzy set community. The note elaborates on new and promising research avenues initiated by fuzzy regression and identifies future developments of these models emerging within the realm of Granular Computing and giving rise to a plethora of granular fuzzy models and higher-order and higher-type granular constructs.
