Funding bodies take various measures to increase the independence and quality of this process, sometimes leading to difficult combinatorial problems. We propose a novel method based on network flow theory to find assignments of evaluators to grant applications that obey the rules formulated by the Slovak Research and Development Agency.", "paper_title": "Assigning evaluators to research grant applications: the case of Slovak Research and Development Agency", "paper_id": "WOS:000334277800015"}
