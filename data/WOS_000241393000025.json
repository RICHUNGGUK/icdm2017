However, such disaster scenarios pose an interesting design challenge since the sensor nodes used to collect and communicate data may themselves fail suddenly and unpredictably, resulting in the loss of valuable data. Furthermore, because these networks are often expected to be deployed in response to a disaster, or because of sudden configuration changes due to failure, these networks are often expected to operate in a \"zero-configuration\" paradigm, where data collection and transmission must be initiated immediately, before the nodes have a chance to assess the current network topology. In this paper, we design and analyze techniques to increase \"persistence\" of sensed data, so that data is more likely to reach a data sink, even as network nodes fail. This is done by replicating data compactly at neighboring nodes using novel \"Growth Codes\" that increase in efficiency as data accumulates at the sink. We show that Growth Codes preserve more data in the presence of node failures than previously proposed erasure resilient techniques.", "paper_title": "Growth codes: Maximizing sensor network data persistence", "paper_id": "WOS:000241393000025"}
