The proposed algorithm evolves a population of antibodies based on the clonal selection and hypermutation principles. The membership function parameters and the fuzzy rule set including the number of rules inside it are evolved at the same time. Each antibody (candidate solution) corresponds to a fuzzy classification rule set. We compared our algorithm with other classification schemes on some benchmark datasets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed immune algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
