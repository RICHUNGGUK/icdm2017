In this article, we will consider a fundamental theoretical question: is it possible to find a unified adaptive control design method suited to various types of FLSs? In order to solve this problem, we will introduce scalers and saturators at the input and output terminals of FLSs to form the extended FLSs (EFLS). The scalers and saturators have adjustable parameters. By designing the updated laws of these parameters and the estimate values of the fuzzy approximate accuracies, stable adaptive fuzzy controllers can be realised for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown homogeneous drift functions and gains. The proposed design method is only dependent on the outputs of EFLS and the above updated laws, thus increasing its adaptability. The fuzzy control scheme introduced in this article is suitable for all fuzzy systems with or without fuzzy rules. Simulations will also be used to show the validity of the method proposed in this article.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control design for a class of nonlinear systems based on fuzzy logic systems with scalers and saturators", "paper_id": "WOS:000324683200026"}
