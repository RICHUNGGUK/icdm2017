This bound improves on Bennett [7]'s bound based on the Renyi entropy of order 2 because the bound obtained here uses the Renyi entropy of order 1 + s for s is an element of [0, 1]. This bound is applied to a wire-tap channel. Then, we derive an exponential upper bound for Eve's information. Our exponent is compared with Hayashi [8]'s exponent. For the additive case, the bound obtained here is better. The result is applied to secret key agreement by public discussion.", "paper_title": "Exponential Decreasing Rate of Leaked Information in Universal Random Privacy Amplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900064"}
