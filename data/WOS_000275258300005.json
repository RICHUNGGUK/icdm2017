Understanding how persons with disabilities access Web-based content is critical to accessible design. Recent research supports the use of a database-driven model for library Web development. Existing technologies offer a variety of tools to meet disabled patrons' needs, and resources exist to assist library professionals in obtaining and evaluating product accessibility information-from vendors. Librarians in charge of technology can best serve these patrons by proactively updating and adapting services as assistive technologies improve.", "paper_title": "Tending a Wild Garden: Library Web Design for Persons with Disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000275258300005"}
