The TWIN architecture possesses interesting properties, which may offer solutions for next-generation optical networks. Besides, TWIN has the ability to support quality of service (QoS) by controlling two important parameters: queueing delay and delay variance. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing scheduling algorithms in TWIN focused mainly on maximizing the throughput and ignored the consideration of QoS. We formulate the scheduling problem into an integer linear programming problem and propose a heuristic-virtual topology-based dynamic scheduling (VTBDS) algorithm to solve it fast and efficiently. Besides, we derive an analytical model for TWIN and investigate the performance of VTBDS in it. By means of simulations, we demonstrate that our model approximates the TWIN network very well, and VTBDS incurs smaller queueing delay and delay variance, which are advantageous for guaranteeing better QoS.
