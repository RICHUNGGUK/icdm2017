Design/methodology/approach - A total of 14 queries were submitted to Yehey! and Google. The top ten sites returned from each were examined for dates created and modified, domain name, the presence of dead or advertising links, the quality of the site as indicated by statements of responsibility and purpose as well as credentials, and overlap. Findings - Despite its promise of providing access to Filipino cyberspace, Yehey! fell short on most of the measures used to evaluate the two search engines. Originality/value - To date, little research has been conducted on local Asian search engines, despite the growth of internet use in the region.", "paper_title": "Searching locally: a comparison of Yehey! and Google", "paper_id": "WOS:000268705700007"}
