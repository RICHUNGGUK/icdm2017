Our results reveal that the catalog size and the content popularity distribution have a huge effect on the system performance. We show that users' cooperation can effectively reduce the servers' burden for a wide range of system parameters, confirming to be an attractive solution to limit the costs incurred by content providers as the system scales to large populations of users.", "paper_title": "How Much Can Large-Scale Video-on-Demand Benefit From Users' Cooperation?", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900012"}
