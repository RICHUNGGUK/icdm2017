However, source data are generally not under the control of the data integration process; thus, integrated data may violate global integrity constraints even in the presence of locally consistent data sources. In this scenario, it may be anyway interesting to retrieve as much consistent information as possible. The process of answering user queries under global constraint violations is called consistent query answering (CQA). Several notions of CQA have been proposed, e.g., depending on whether integrated information is assumed to be sound, complete, exact, or a variant of them. This paper provides a contribution in this setting: it uniforms solutions coming from different perspectives under a common Answer-Set Programming (ASP)-based core, and provides query-driven optimizations designed for isolating and eliminating inefficiencies of the general approach for computing consistent answers. Moreover, the paper introduces some new theoretical results enriching existing knowledge on the decidability and complexity of the considered problems. The effectiveness of the approach is evidenced by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Consistent query answering via ASP from different perspectives: Theory and practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000315867300005"}
