A PERT-type project, where activities require resources of various types with random duration, is considered. Each activity can be accomplished in one of several execution modes and each execution mode represents an alternative combination of resource requirements of the activity and its duration. The problem is to minimize the regular criterion namely project's makespan by obtaining an optimal schedule and also the amount of different resources assigned to each activity. The resource project scheduling model is strongly NP-hard, therefore a metaheuristic algorithm is suggested namely HMA. In order to validate the performance of new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, solutions are compared with optimal solutions for small networks. Also the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, for real world problems, in terms of solution quality and CPU time, is compared to one of the well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm of Hartmann (GAH). The computational results reveal that the proposed method provides appropriate results for small networks and real world problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
