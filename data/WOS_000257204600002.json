A feed forward backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) is designed for classifying a set of road lines through a supervised learning process, attempting to emulate a classification performed by a human expert for cartographic generalization purposes. The main steps of the process are presented in this paper: (a) experimental data selection; (b) segmentation of lines into homogeneous sections, (c) sections enrichment through a set of quantitative measures derived from a principal component analysis, and qualitative information derived from road network and road type; (d) expert classification of the sections; and finally (e) the ANN design, training and validation. The quality of results is analyzed by means of error matrices after a cross-validation process giving a goodness, or percentage of agreement, over 83%.", "paper_title": "Generalization-oriented road line classification by means of an artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000257204600002"}
