In the binary case, we operate on a given image with morphological operators in the so-called \"adjacency lattice,\" which is intimately related to the image's adjacency tree. These operators are generalized to grayscale images by means of the so-called \"shape-tree semilattice,\" which is based on the tree of shapes of the given image. Apart of reviewing their original definition, different algorithms for computing the shape-tree morphological operators are addressed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
