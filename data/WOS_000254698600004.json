Due to the potential low resolution and noise, it is challenging to detect such features. We propose systematic characterizations of the edges, corners and curves at the singularities of a mesh and develop algorithms to identify these geometrical features. Our algorithms can detect C-1 discontinuities as well as typical C-2 discontinuities. We present the analysis of correctness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally using stereolithographic (STL) meshes as well as coarse finite-element meshes of real-world objects.
