We have established a method to statistically examine segmental duration on the phone level in speech corpora. The two corpora represented in this study consist mainly of television news broadcasts and short texts read aloud by professional speakers. Previous studies conducted have been contradictory; there are reports of initial shortening in certain languages and lengthening in others. Our results are conclusive in neither way, but suggest a qualitatively differentiated behavior. We have observed lengthening of all utterance-initial vowels, diphthongs included, and shortening of phonologically long plosive (stop) consonants. No other speech sounds are significantly affected. These findings hold in both corpora, in despite of different speakers and annotators.", "paper_title": "Segmental duration in utterance-initial environment: Evidence from Finnish speech corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400055"}
