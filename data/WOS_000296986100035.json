The total cost function includes the costs of concrete, steel beam and shear studs. The design is based on AISC load and resistance factor design specifications and plastic design concepts. Here, six decision variables are considered for the objective function. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model in optimizing composite floor system designs, two design examples taken from the literature are studied. It is shown that use of the presented model results in significant cost saving. Hence, it can be of practical value to structural designers. Also the proposed model is compared to the original harmony search, its recently developed variants, and other meta-heuristic algorithms to illustrate the superiority of the present method in convergence and leading to better solutions. In order to investigate the effects of beam spans and loadings on the cost optimization of composite floor system a parametric study is also conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
