The h-extra connectivity of G is the cardinality of a minimum set S such that G - S is disconnected and each component of G - S has at least h + 1 vertices. The h-extra connectivity for h = 1, 2 of k-ary n-cubes are gotten by Hsieh and Chang (2012) [14] for k >= 4 and Zhu et al. (2011) [20] for k = 3. In this paper, we show that the h-extra connectivity of the 3-ary n-cubes for h = 3 is equal to 8n - 12, where n >= 3. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
