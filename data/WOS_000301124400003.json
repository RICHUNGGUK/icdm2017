For a WSN application to deduce an appropriate result it is necessary that the data received is clean, accurate, and lossless. WSN data cleaning systems exploit contextual associations existing in the received data to suppress data inconsistencies and anomalies. In this work we attempt to clean the data gathered from WSN by capturing the influence of changing dynamics of the environment on the contextual associations existing in the sensor nodes. Specifically, our work validates the extent of similarities among the sensed observations from contextually (spatio-temporally) associated nodes and considers the time of arrival of data at the sink to educate the cleaning process about the WSN's behavior. We term the data cleaning technique proposed in this work as time of arrival for data cleaning (TOAD). TOAD establishes belief on spatially related nodes to identify potential nodes that can contribute to data cleaning. By using information theory concepts and experiments on data sets from a real-time scenario we demonstrate and establish that validation of contextual associations among the sensor nodes significantly contributes to data cleaning.
