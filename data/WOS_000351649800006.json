Data collected from 250 respondents about their perceptions and usage of online blogs were analyzed to test six invariance hypotheses. The results indicate that the UTAUT instrument showed full or partial invariance for respondents' technology usage pattern and gender. With respect to prior IT knowledge, the UTAUT scales were found to be invariant for general IT knowledge but non-invariant for specific IT knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
