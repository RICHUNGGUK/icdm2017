In practice, understanding the link performance and its dynamics in the emerging BASN applications is very important to design reliable, real-time, and energy-efficient protocols. In this paper we study the link characteristics of body area sensor network (BASN) through extensive experiments with very realistic configurations. We evaluate the packet reception ratio, RSSI, LQI, and movement intensity of body under indoor and outdoor environments, all of which can provide direct insights to practical account.", "paper_title": "Link Characteristics Measuring in 2.4 GHz Body Area Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310893700001"}
