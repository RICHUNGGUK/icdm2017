The structure, calculation, and prediction process of WNN are proposed, and the improved details of IFOA are introduced, which can enhance the searching efficiency and improve the searching quality over the traditional fruit fly optimization algorithm. Finally, the WNN-IFOA model can obtain the least predicting errors compared with other existing models and shows better generality for the online melt index prediction from the experimental results.
