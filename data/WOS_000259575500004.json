The methodology proposed is inspired in Takens theorem and consists of an intelligent hybrid model composed of an artificial neural network combined with a modified genetic algorithm. Initially, the TAEF method finds the best fitted model to forecast the series and then performs a behavioral statistical test in order to adjust time phase distortions that may appear in the representation of some series. An experimental investigation conducted with relevant time series show the robustness of the method through a comparison, according to several performance measures, to previous results found in the literature and those obtained with more traditional methods.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent system methodology for time series forecasting with artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259575500004"}
