The stringent settling-time constraints of OFDM signals make conventional closed-loop feedback AGC impractical for WiMAX applications. This paper presents a novel fast-settling feed-forward automatic gain control (AGC) circuit designed for WiMAX receivers. The proposed AGC uses a switched coarse gain-setting followed by a continuous fine gain-setting to accelerate locking speed. The coarse gain-setting is performed without peak detection (PD) and the fine gain-setting is carried out by a one-step method both for shortened settling time. The chip is fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. The measurement results verify that the 48 dB AGC converges to the desired level within 1.2 mu s minimum settling time. Besides, the THD is 0.32-1.37 % and the power consumption is 5.2 mW accordingly.", "paper_title": "A feed-forward AGC circuit with 48 dB-gain range, 1.2 mu s minimum settling time for WiMAX receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500006"}
