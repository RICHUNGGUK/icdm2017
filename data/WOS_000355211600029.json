The method is conceived for distributed-generator-owning distribution network operators to find the optimal numbers and sizes of WTs among different potential combinations. MO-GA is used to select, among all the candidate buses, the optimal sites and sizes of WTs. A nondominated sorting GA II procedure is used for finding multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in a multiobjective optimization problem, while market-based OPF is used to simulate an electricity market session. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with an 84-bus 11.4-kV radial distribution system.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Benefits of Optimal Allocation of Wind Turbines for Distribution Network Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600029"}
