However, when the search depends heavily on human-expert's intuition, the task of managing the problem knowledge might be really difficult or even indefinable/impossible; the so-called interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) helps to mitigate this problem by enabling the human user to interact with an EA during the optimization process. Interactive MAs can be constructed as reactive models in which the MA continuously demands the intervention of the human user; this approach has the drawback that provokes fatigue to the user. This paper considers user-centric MAs, a more global perspective of interactive MAs since it hints possibilities for the system to be proactive rather than merely interactive, i.e., to anticipate some of the user behavior and/or exhibit some degree of creativity, and provides some guidelines for the design of two different models for user-centric MAs, namely reactive and proactive search-based schema. An experimental study over two complex NP-hard problems, namely the Traveling Salesman problem and a Gene Ordering Problem, shows that user-centric MAs are in general effective optimization methods although the proactive approach provides additional advantages.", "paper_title": "On user-centric memetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000313969400009"}
