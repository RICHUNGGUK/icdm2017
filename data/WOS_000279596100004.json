To this end, e-cognocracy allows for the consideration of several rounds during the resolution process. The linkability of votes, the intensity of preferences and the identification of the arguments that support choices, among other matters, require the design of a specific e-voting process the e-cognocracy, e-cognising. This paper presents various implementations of the technology, commencing with an initial proof of concept and going on to the use of smart cards to permit remote use of the system and influence the level of perceived confidence among users, eliminating the role of one of the confidence authorities formerly required to ensure appropriate system security.
