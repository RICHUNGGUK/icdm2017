One of the critical security issues is the revocation of misbehaving vehicles. While essential, revocation checking can leak private information. In particular, repositories receiving the certificate status queries could infer the identity of the vehicles posing the query and the target of the query. An important loss of privacy results from this ability to tie the checking vehicle with the query's target, due to their likely willingness to communicate. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Privacy-Aware revocation Mechanism (EPA) based on the use of Merkle Hash Trees (MHT) and a Crowds-based anonymous protocol, which replaces the time-consuming certificate revocation lists checking process. EPA provides explicit, concise, authenticated and unforgeable information about the revocation status of each certificate while preserving the users' privacy. Moreover, EPA reduces the security overhead for certificate status checking, and enhances the availability and usability of the revocation data. By conducting a detailed performance evaluation, EPA is demonstrated to be reliable, efficient, and scalable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
