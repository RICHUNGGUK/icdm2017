As an emerging behavioral biometric, mouse dynamics aims to address the authentication problem by verifying computer users on the basis of their mouse operating styles. This paper presents a simple and efficient user authentication approach based on a fixed mouse-operation task. For each sample of the mouse-operation task, both traditional holistic features and newly defined procedural features are extracted for accurate and fine-grained characterization of a user's unique mouse behavior. Distance-measurement and eigenspace-transformation techniques are applied to obtain feature components for efficiently representing the original mouse feature space. Then a one-class learning algorithm is employed in the distance-based feature eigenspace for the authentication task. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of 5550 mouse-operation samples from 37 subjects. Extensive experimental results are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, which achieves a false-acceptance rate of 8.74%, and a false-rejection rate of 7.69% with a corresponding authentication time of 11.8 seconds. Two additional experiments are provided to compare the current approach with other approaches in the literature. Our dataset is publicly available to facilitate future research.", "paper_title": "User Authentication Through Mouse Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000318595000002"}
