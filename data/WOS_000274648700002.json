The purpose of this paper is to articulate a strategy in which the perceived weakness can be seen as a source of strength. Design/methodology/approach - The text builds mostly on reflections on meta-theoretical and science-organisation literature. Ten distinct problems for the research field are identified and discussed in order to provide a viable strategy for the future. Findings - While it is common to suggest a convergent movement toward the idealised characteristics of the strong research discipline as a recipe against fragmentation, a strong convergent movement is suggested that feeds off the fragmented character of the field. What is commonly perceived as a weakness, the multidimensional character of the field, can be translated into a strategic resource. Originality/value - The paper provides a fresh perspective on the strategic situation of LIS.", "paper_title": "Turning weakness into strength: strategies for future LIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274648700002"}
