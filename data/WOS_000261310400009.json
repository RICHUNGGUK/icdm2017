We focus here on finding the best error-correcting. code with respect to a given database of biometric data. We propose a method that models discrepancies between biometric measurements as an erasure and error channel, and we estimate its capacity. We then show that two-dimensional iterative min-sum decoding of properly chosen product codes almost reaches the capacity of this channel. This leads to practical fuzzy commitment schemes that are close to theoretical limits. We test our techniques on public iris and fingerprint databases and validate our findings.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and Practical Boundaries of Binary Secure Sketches", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310400009"}
