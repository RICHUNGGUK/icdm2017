The analytic solutions of the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations are constructed in the series form. The convergence of the obtained series solutions is carefully analyzed. The velocity and temperature profiles are shown and the influence of the porosity parameter is discussed in detail. The validity of the obtained solutions is verified by the numerical results (fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and shooting method). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
