It has several unique advantages over traditional network simulators. This paper presents the novel design and implementation of its simulation engine. This paper focuses on how to combine the kernel re-entering and discrete-event simulation methodologies to execute simulations quickly. The performance and scalability of NCTUns are also presented and discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
