It is also known as the service interaction problem. FIs may occur between various types of services, ranging from signalling protocol features to value-added end-user services. The problem has been widely investigated for those types of services. However, sufficient attention has not been paid to operation, administration, management and provisioning (OAM&P) features like creating a new customer account or registering a new gateway as part of the network. The present paper addresses the detection of OAM&P FIs in Internet telephony architectures. The solution consists in an adapted version of a known FI detection method. A simple feature modelling language and an FI detection procedure are proposed. A validation with a case study is also reported.
