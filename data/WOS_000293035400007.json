In addition, the a priori definition of important groups is impossible. Structural diversity requires the analysis of the complete data space and the selection of the details there present. A single substructure cannot be considered sufficient when assigning compound toxicity. In contrast, if we consider all the substructures in the database as the elements of a complete collection and if we can build a working hierarchy, the identification of the best feasible result using the available data is possible. If the database includes several significant examples, the results will be valuable. The use of a fragment-based description of a mutagenicity database together with the realization of a general hierarchy allows for the identification of the moieties that control the toxifying/detoxifying action of each compound.", "paper_title": "Identification of Toxifying and Detoxifying Moieties for Mutagenicity Prediction by Priority Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400007"}
