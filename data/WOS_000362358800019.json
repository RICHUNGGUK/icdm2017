The group cooperative objective is to achieve finite-time formation control for the upper layer of leaders and containment control for the lower layer of followers. Two kinds of cooperative strategies, including centralized-distributed control and distributed-distributed control, are proposed for two types of switching laws: 1) random switching law with the dwell time and 2) Markov switching law with stationary distribution. Utilizing the state transition matrix methods and matrix measure techniques, some sufficient conditions are derived for asymptotical containment control and exponential almost sure containment control, respectively. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Cooperative Control for Multiagent Systems With Switching Directed Topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800019"}
