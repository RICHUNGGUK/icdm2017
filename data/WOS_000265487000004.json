One of the key design problems is the security in such heterogeneous networks, particularly over wireless networks with resource constraints. In this tutorial article we discuss a novel approach to addressing security issues, and articulate why and how 1D-based cryptography can be effectively applied to address various security problems in resource-constrained wireless networks.", "paper_title": "SECURING RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED WIRELESS AD HOC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265487000004"}
