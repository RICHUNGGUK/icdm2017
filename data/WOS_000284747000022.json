In this paper, first, the multi period problem is systematically classified and modeled. Next, a recursive formula for the total expected risk is presented, and an algorithm for optimal assignments in limited-cycle problems with multiple periods is proposed based on the branch and bound method. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown by investigating the calculation time of the computer. Finally, the optimal assignments are studied by numerical experiments and the property useful for the design of a production seat system is found. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
