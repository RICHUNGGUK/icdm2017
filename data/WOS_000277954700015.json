However, there are many situations where the job processing time deteriorates as time passes. In this note, we consider the makespan problems under the group technology with deteriorating setup and processing times. That is, the job processing times and group setup times are linearly increasing (or decreasing) functions of their starting times. For both linear functions, we show that the makespan problems remain polynomially solvable. In addition, the constructive algorithms are also provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
