The proposed method is the robust version of SVDD by assigning a weight to each data point, which represents fuzzy membership degree of the cluster computed by the improved PCM method. Accordingly, this paper presents the multi-classification algorithm based on the robust weighted SVDD, and gives the simple classification rule. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the effect of outliers and yield higher classification rate. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
