Variability can be accounted for in the construction specification for deterministic design and directly in reliability based design. Design methods and specifications to date adopt simplifications that do not take the variability of the columns fully into account. This paper uses both simple and advanced probabilistic methods to assess the performance/failure and system redundancy of dry soil mix columns. Reliability-based design methods and examples are given for the design of column strength and the adjustment of the column spacing to achieve a target probability of unacceptable performance or failure. An acceptance criteria chart is developed. The pull-out resistance tests on the DSM columns constructed for the Ballina Bypass motorway construction project in NSW Australia are compared to the chart to provide guidance with respect to acceptance criteria required to achieve the desired performance.
