Accurate segmentation of prominent facial features is accomplished by means of an extension of the Active Shape Model (ASM) approach, the so-called Active Shape Model with Invariant Optimal Features (IOF-ASM). Once the face has been segmented, a pose correction step is applied, so that frontal face images are synthesized. For the generation of these virtual images, we make use of a subset of the shape parameters. extracted from a training dataset and Thin Plate Splines texture mapping. Afterwards, sets of local features are computed from these virtual images. The performance of the system is demonstrated on configurations I and II of the XM2VTS database.", "paper_title": "Automatic pose correction for local feature-based face authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700037"}
