Single band watermarking method was proposed in Ref. 1. This paper develops the single band watermarking method and adds Human Vision System (HVS) to form six different multi-bands watermarking methods. With the increasing redundancy of watermark, the robustness of the algorithm will be investigated and comparative studies with the single band watermarking will be shown. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have great robustness against various imaging attacks.", "paper_title": "ROBUST WATERMARKING SCHEMES USING SELECTIVE CURVELET COEFFICIENTS BASED ON A HVS MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000284648400009"}
