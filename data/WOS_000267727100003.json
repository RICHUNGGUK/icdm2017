In contrast to the previous lattice Boltzmann model to the KdV equation, our method has higher-order accuracy. Two key steps in the development of this model are the addition of a momentum conservation condition. and the construction of a correlation between the first conservation law and the second conservation law. The numerical example shows the higher-order moment method can be used to raise the truncation error of the lattice Boltzmann scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
