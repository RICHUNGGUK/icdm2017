In measuring similarity and retrieving similar cases from a case base for minimum prediction error, it is a key process in determining the factors with the greatest weight among the attributes of cases in the case base. Previous approaches using experience, gradient search, fuzzy numbers, and analytic hierarchy process are limited in their provision of optimal solutions. This study therefore investigates a GA for weight generation and applies it to real project data. When compared to a conventional construction cost estimation model, the accuracy of the CBR- and GA-based construction cost estimation model was verified. It is expected that a more reliable construction cost estimation model could be designed in the early stages by using a weight estimation technique in the development of a construction cost estimation model.", "paper_title": "Preliminary Cost Estimation Model Using Case-Based Reasoning and Genetic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000283195300005"}
