In this paper, we introduce token buses to connect the nodes, instead of the single rings in the original e-textile token grid. The topology of the new network is described. And we also discuss the media access control protocols and the reliable operations. Simulation results show that the new e-textile communication network can improve the ability of C-textile applications to tolerate faults and provide the communicating services of less delay.", "paper_title": "A dependable communication network for e-textiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500125"}
