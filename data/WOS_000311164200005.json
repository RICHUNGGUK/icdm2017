Based on a robust GARCH model, the study finds that there are significant two-way volatility spillover effects: a positive volatility spillover effect from stock returns to abnormal message posting volume, and a negative volatility spillover effect from abnormal message posting volume to stock returns. The information exchange and communication on stock message boards have a certain role in stabilizing financial markets and improving investor's decision making on financial markets.", "paper_title": "IS THERE TWO-WAY ASYNCHRONOUS INFORMATION TRANSMISSION BETWEEN STOCK MARKETS AND STOCK MESSAGE BOARDS?", "paper_id": "WOS:000311164200005"}
