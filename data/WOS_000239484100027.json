The usual selfstabilizing model only allows for nodes to make decisions based on the states of their immediate neighbors. We provide a general polynomial transformation for constructing self-stabilizing algorithms which utilize distance-k knowledge, with a slowdown of n(O(log k)). Our main application is a polynomial-time self-stabilizing algorithm for finding maximal irredundant sets, a problem which seems to require distance-4 information. We also show how to find maximal k-packings in polynomial-time. Our techniques extend results in a recent paper by Gairing et al. for achieving distance-two information.", "paper_title": "Distance-k information in self-stabilizing algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000239484100027"}
