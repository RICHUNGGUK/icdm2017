Specifically, the idea of gait manifold learning is revisited to capture the gait variability among different individuals at both whole and part levels. A key issue is the selection of an appropriate distance metric to evaluate the dissimilarity between two gaits (either at whole or part levels) that determines an optimal manifold topology. Several metrics are studied and compared in terms of their effectiveness for gait manifold learning at both whole and part levels. This work involves one whole-based and two part-level gait manifolds by which three pairs of KGGM and VGGM can be learned and integrated for part-whole gait modeling. Moreover, a two-stage Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference algorithm is developed for video-based part-whole motion estimation. The proposed algorithm is tested on the HumanEva data and reaches state-of-art results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
