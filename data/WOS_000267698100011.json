Previously implemented RF-CDI techniques were only able to image a single slice transverse to the static magnetic field B(o). This paper describes the first realization of a multislice RF-CDI sequence on a 1.5 T clinical imager. Multislice RF current density images have been reconstructed for two phantoms. The influence of MRI random noise on the sensitivity of the multislice RF-CDI measurement has also been studied by theoretical analysis, simulation and phantom experiments.", "paper_title": "Multislice Radio-Frequency Current Density Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000267698100011"}
