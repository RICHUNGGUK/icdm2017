It is shown that an Abraham solvation equation with five descriptors can be used to correlate the experimental enthalpies of solvation to within Standard Deviations (SDs) of 2.70 kJ/mol (methanol), 2.53 kJ/mol (ethanol), and 2.34 kJ/mol (1-butanol). The derived correlations provide very accurate mathematical descriptions of the measured enthalpy of solvation data at 298 K, which in the case of methanol span a range of about 105 kJ/mol. Division of the experimental values into a training set and a test set shows that there is no bias in predictions, and that the predictive capability of the correlations is better than 3.0 kJ/mol.", "paper_title": "Enthalpy of solvation correlations for gaseous solutes dissolved in alcohol solvents based on the Abraham model", "paper_id": "WOS:000256208900010"}
