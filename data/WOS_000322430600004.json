It is an important input parameter of network traffic engineering and is very crucial for network operators. However, it is significantly difficult to obtain the accurate end-to-end network traffic. And thus obtaining traffic matrix precisely is a challenge for operators and researchers. This paper studies the reconstruction method of the end-to-end network traffic based on compressing sensing. A detailed method is proposed to select a set of origin-destination flows to measure at first. Then a reconstruction model is built via these measured origin-destination flows. And a purely data-driven reconstruction algorithm is presented. Finally, we use traffic data from the real backbone network to verify our approach proposed in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
