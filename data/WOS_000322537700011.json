In this paper we bring forward a refinement of this classification and show how the process semantics can be dealt with in a uniform way: based on the very natural concept of constrained simulation we show how we can classify the spectrum in layers; for the families lying in the same layer we show how to obtain in a generic way equational, observational, logical and operational characterizations; relations among layers are also very natural and differences just stem from the constraint imposed on the simulations that rule the layers. Our methodology also shows how to achieve a uniform treatment of semantic preorders and equivalences.", "paper_title": "UNIFYING THE LINEAR TIME-BRANCHING TIME SPECTRUM OF STRONG PROCESS SEMANTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000322537700011"}
