The filter adaptively changes the size of sliding window in accordance with noise intensity and noise-exclusive operation is performed only on noise-free pixels. These steps thus preserve the image details effectively. Judicious assessment of the previously restored pixels is made in order to use them in replacing the noisy pixels and further improve the efficiency of filter. With these possibilities, fuzzy switching median filter-based approach is also incorporated for improving the performance. Experimental results justified the efficacy of the proposed fuzzy-based filtering method qualitatively and quantitatively for twelve different highly corrupted noisy images, and showed significant improvement to existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive, Noise-Exclusive and Assessment-Based Fuzzy Switching Median Filter For High Intensity Impulse Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000367531700009"}
