MANETs are continuing to grow their interest in research environment and they are attracting attention for their potential use in several fields such as collaborative computing and disaster recovery environments. Considering mobility of the terminals, the topology changes rapidly and routing becomes a key process for operation of MANETs. In this paper, we analyze the performance of Better Approach To MANET (BATMAN) routing protocol in an outdoor bridge environment considering mobility and vertical communication. We implement two scenarios on our testbed and evaluate the performance in terms of throughput and packetloss.", "paper_title": "Experimental results from a MANET testbed in outdoor bridge environment considering BATMAN routing protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000325127200009"}
