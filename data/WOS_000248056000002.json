However, GUI systems are often challenging to test due to their complexity and special features. Traditional testing methodologies are not designed to deal with the complexity of GUI systems; using these methodologies can result in increased time and expense. In our proposed strategy, a GUI system will be divided into two abstract tiers-the component tier and the system tier. On the component tier, a flow graph will be created for each GUI component. Each flow graph represents a set of relationships between the pre-conditions, event sequences and post-conditions for the corresponding component. On the system tier, the components are integrated to build up a viewpoint of the entire system. Tests on the system tier will interrogate the interactions between the components. This method for GUI testing is simple and practical; we will show the effectiveness of this approach by performing two empirical experiments and describing the results found.", "paper_title": "A practical approach to testing GUI systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248056000002"}
