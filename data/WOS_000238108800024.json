We have designed, developed and evaluated a rich, semantic, human-centric model of trust that can handle the myriad of terms and intertwined meanings that defining trust has. This model of trust can be personalised on a per user basis and specialised on per domain basis. In this paper we present this model with accompanying experimental evaluation to support it and introduce a mechanism for the generation of personalised models of trust. Furthermore, we describe how this model has been utilised through the combination of a policy and trust sharing mechanism to empower trust based access control.", "paper_title": "The design, generation, and utilisation of a semantically rich personalised model of trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000238108800024"}
