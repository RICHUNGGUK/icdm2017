The objective is to shift the lightly damped inter-area modes toward the prescribed stability region. A lead-lag stabilizer is used to demonstrate this technique, in which a particular measure of stabilizer gain is considered as an objective function. Constraints of the problem for phase-lead and lag structures are derived. The objective function with the constraints is formed as a quadratic mathematical programming problem. For robust design, the parameters of the stabilizer are calculated under various operating conditions. Two types of SSSC-based stabilizer have been presented and designed. Numerical results including eigenvalue analysis and the nonlinear simulations on the 4- and 50-machine power systems are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust design of static synchronous series compensator-based stabilizer for damping inter-area oscillations using quadratic mathematical programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000276643100008"}
