The tree structure itself k constructed using the cover tree inethocl, v1iidi remains efficient in high dimensional spaces. We cOITIbine the model with Thompson sampling and approximate dynamic programming to obtain effective exploration policies in unkritAVri environments. The flexibility and computational simplicity of the model render it suitable for many reinforcement learning problems in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate this in an experimental comparison with a Gaussian process model, a linear model and simple least squares policy iteration.", "paper_title": "Cover Tree Bayesian Reinforcement Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000344638300013"}
