When data mining techniques are applied to these data, their uncertainty has to be considered to obtain high quality results. We present UK-means clustering, an algorithm that enhances the K-means algorithm to handle data uncertainty. We apply UK-means to the particular pattern of moving-object uncertainty. Experimental results show that by considering uncertainty, a clustering algorithm can produce more accurate results.", "paper_title": "Uncertain data mining: An example in clustering location data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600024"}
