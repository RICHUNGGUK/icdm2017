We formulate the problem using new quadratic models. Spectral relaxations, new semidefinite programming relaxations and linearization techniques are used to solve these problems. It has been shown that our proposed methods can obtain improved solutions. We also adapt our proposed techniques to the bipartite graph partitioning problem for biclustering.", "paper_title": "Multi-way clustering and biclustering by the Ratio cut and Normalized cut in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000300079100005"}
