Chromium plating features high levels of hardness and resistance to wear and it is due to these properties that they can be applied in a huge range of sectors. Resistance to corrosion of a hard chromium plate depends on the thickness of its coating, and its adherence and micro-fissures. This micro-fissured structure is what provides the optimal hardness of the layers. The hard chromium plating process is one of the most effective ways of protecting the base material against a hostile environment or improving the surface properties of the base material. However, in the electroplating industry, electroplaters are faced with many problems and undesirable results with chromium plated materials. Common problems faced in the electroplating industry include matt deposition, milky white chromium deposition, rough or sandy chromium deposition and insufficient thickness and hardness. This article presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the thickness of the layer in a hard chromium plating process. The optimization of the ANN was performed by means of the design of experiments theory (DOE). In the present work the purpose of using DOE is twofold: to define the optimal experiments which maximize the ratio of the model accuracy, and to minimize the number of necessary experiments (ANN models trained and validated).
