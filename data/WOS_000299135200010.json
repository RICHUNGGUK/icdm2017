However, DE is not free from the problems of stagnation and premature convergence. Hence, designing more effective search strategies to enhance the performance of DE is one of the most salient and active topics. This paper proposes a new method, called learning-enhanced DE (LeDE) that promotes individuals to exchange information systematically. Distinct from the existing DE variants, LeDE adopts a novel learning strategy, namely clustering-based learning strategy (CLS). In CLS, there are two levels of learning strategies, intra-cluster learning strategy and inter-cluster learning strategy. They are adopted for exchanging information within the same cluster and between different clusters, respectively. Experimental studies over 23 benchmark functions show that LeDE significantly outperforms the conventional DE. Compared with other clustering-based DE algorithms, LeDE can obtain better solutions. In addition, LeDE is also shown to be significantly better than or at least comparable to several state-of-art DE variants as well as some other evolutionary algorithms.", "paper_title": "Learning-enhanced differential evolution for numerical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000299135200010"}
