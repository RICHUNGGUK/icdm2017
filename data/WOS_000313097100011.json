The system is composed of both hardware and software components and is described in three steps. The first step is devoted to the description of the driving simulator and the developed software. The second step deals with the identification of the driver's visual search actions using computer vision. The latter are related to specific driving events such as blind spot checking and rear-view/lateral mirror verification. Based on the simulator's open module, the third step is concerned with the identification of car/road events (overtaking, crossing an intersection) and the mapping of these events with the driver's behavior. The proposed system will be used by a kinesiology research group for the evaluation and improvement of driver performances in a safe environment (driving simulator). In addition to the controlled environment, a modified version of the system also deals with real driving contexts (i.e. driving in a real car). Experimental results confirm both the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed cephalo-ocular analysis framework.", "paper_title": "A computer vision framework for the analysis and interpretation of the cephalo-ocular behavior of drivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000313097100011"}
