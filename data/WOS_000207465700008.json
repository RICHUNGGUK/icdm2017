Successful operation as an SoS requires communication among appropriate individuals and groups across enterprises through an effective protocol. This paper presents a position on the creation of a consortium of concerned system engineers and scientists worldwide to examine the problems and solutions strategies associated with SoS. The consortium could lead efforts in clarifying ambiguities and in seeking remedies to numerous open questions with respect to SoS analysis, SoS engineering (SoSE), as well as differences between systems engineering (SE) and SoSE. The mission of this consortium is envisioned to: 1) act as a neutral party; 2) provide a forum to put forth Calls to Action; and 3) establish a community of interest to recommend a set of solutions.", "paper_title": "A Case for an International Consortium on System-of-Systems Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000207465700008"}
