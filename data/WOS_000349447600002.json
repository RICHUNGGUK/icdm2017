The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of a zirconia-based crown in a lower canine tooth supporting removable partial denture (RPD) prosthesis, varying the bond quality of the veneer/coping interface. Microtomography (mu CT) data of an extracted left lower canine were used to build the finite element model (M) varying the core material (gold core - M-Au; zirconia core - M-Zi) and the quality of the veneer/core interface (complete bonded - M-Zi; incomplete bonded - MZi-NL). The incomplete bonding condition was only applied for zirconia coping by using contact elements (Target/Contact) with 0.3 frictional coefficients. Stress fields were obtained using Ansys Workbench 10.0. The loading condition (L=1N) was vertically applied at the base of the RPD prosthesis metallic support towards the dental apex. Maximum principal (sigma(max)) and von Mises equivalent (sigma(vM)) stresses were obtained. The sigma(max) (MPa) for the bonded condition was similar between gold and zirconia cores (M-Au, 0.42; M-Zi,M- 0.40). The incomplete bonded condition (MZi-NL) raised sigma(max) in the veneer up to 800% (3.23MPa) in contrast to the bonded condition. The peak of sigma(vM) increased up to 270% in the MZi-NL. The incomplete bond condition increasing the stress in the veneer/zirconia interface.", "paper_title": "Zirconia-based dental crown to support a removable partial denture: a three-dimensional finite element analysis using contact elements and micro-CT data", "paper_id": "WOS:000349447600002"}
