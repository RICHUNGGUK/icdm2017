In this paper we give an overview of these developments and show the tight connections between different types of convexity and optimality conditions for a large class of multiview geometry problems. We also show how the convexity properties are closely linked to different types of optimization algorithms for computing the solutions. Moreover, it is also demonstrated how convexity can be used for detection and removal of outliers. The theoretical findings are accompanied with illustrative examples and experimental results on real data.", "paper_title": "Generalized Convexity in Multiple View Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000280251900003"}
