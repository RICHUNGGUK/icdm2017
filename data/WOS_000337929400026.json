The study of mean-field models for systems with long-range interactions is another field in which the Vlasov equation plays an important role. We present the vmf90 program that performs numerical simulations of the Vlasov equation for this class of mean-field models with the semi-Lagrangian method. Program summary Program title: vmf90 Catalogue identifier: AESO_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AESO_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 7794 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 58 851 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 95. Computer: Single CPU computer. Operating system: No specific operating system, the program is tested under Linux and OS X. RAM: About 5 M bytes Classification: 1.5, 19.8, 19.13, 23. External routines: HDF5 for the code (tested with HDF5 v1.8.8 and above). Python, NumPy, h5py and Matplotlib for analysis. Nature of problem: Numerical resolution of the Vlasov equation for mean-field models (Hamiltonian Mean-Field model and Single Wave model). Solution method: The equation is solved with the semi-Lagrangian method and cubic spline interpolation. Running time: The examples provided with the program take 1 m 30 for the Hamiltonian-Mean Field model and 10 m for the Single Wave model, on an Intel Core i7 CPU @ 3.33 GHz. Increasing the number of grid points or the number of time steps increases the running time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
