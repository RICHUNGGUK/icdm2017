In the present paper we explore dynamics of bubbles for the Mullins-Sekerka problem. Using a set of ordinary differential equations for the radii and the centers, we numerically simulate the relevant interactions in both \"two-dimensional\" and \"three-dimensional\" settings. Our results illustrate how larger bubbles grow at the expense of smaller ones and highlight the role of additional factors such as the initial inter-bubble distance or weak asymmetries in the bubble position in the ensuing dynamics. One novel feature in comparison with earlier works is the possibility to continue for the three-dimensional case the simulation past the points where one of the bubbles disappears. (C) 2009 IMACS.
