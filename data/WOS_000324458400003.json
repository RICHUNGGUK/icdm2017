This article describes a study aiming to establish where a touchpad should be located within a right-hand drive vehicle. Sixteen participants (50:50 right/left handed) drove three routes in a right-hand drive simulator while following a lead vehicle at a perceived safe distance. At specific points, participants were asked to carry out three tasks of varying complexity using the touchpad. For each of the routes travelled, the touchpad was positioned in one of the three locations: in the centre console; in the door armrest and in the steering wheel. Differences in the performance and preferences of right-handed people vs. left-handed people were found. Right-handed people rated the door armrest location highly and made few glances towards this location while driving. In contrast, left-handed drivers were more positive towards the centre console location. The steering wheel location required a particularly high-visual demand. It is concluded that, for right-hand drive vehicles, a touchpad should be located in both the centre console and the door armrest to suit the diverse needs of the driver population.", "paper_title": "Designing touchpad user-interfaces for right-hand drive vehicles: an investigation into where the touchpad should be located", "paper_id": "WOS:000324458400003"}
