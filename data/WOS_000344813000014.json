The average utilization of cloud servers in most datacenters can be improved through virtual machine placement optimization. How to dynamically forecast the resource usage becomes a key problem. This paper proposes a scheduling algorithm called virtual machine dynamic forecast scheduling (VM-DFS) to deploy virtual machines in a cloud computing environment. In this algorithm, through analysis of historical memory consumption, the most suitable physical machine can be selected to place a virtual machine according to future consumption forecast. This paper formalizes the virtual machine placement problem as a bin-packing problem, which can be solved by the first-fit decreasing scheme. Through this method, for specific virtual machine requirements of applications, we can minimize the number of physical machines. The VM-DFS algorithm is verified through the CloudSim simulator. Our experiments are carried out on different numbers of virtual machine requests. Through analysis of the experimental results, we find that VM-DFS can save 17.08 % physical machines on the average, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems.", "paper_title": "Dynamic forecast scheduling algorithm for virtual machine placement in cloud computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000344813000014"}
