Former studies in different domains have focused on different aspects of trust to help trust building. Our focus is on exploring the effects of communication modes and information exchange channels on trust level in a computer-mediated collaborative remote design team. We describe trust building process in computer-mediated collaborative remote design and demonstrate how the influences were exerted by the combination of communication modes and information exchange channels. The results demonstrate which combination would be best for trust building in a certain condition of the remote settings. The propositions are formulized based on the analysis of the results, which would be critical to trust building in a remote collaborative design team using ICT.", "paper_title": "Studying the Effects of Information Exchange Channels in Different Communication Modes on Trust Building in Computer-mediated Remote Collaborative Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000304607900006"}
