A new communication model is needed to carry this kind of architecture. Mainly, the discontinuous coverage affects the way data are exchanged between mobile terminals and the network. Moreover, the short time the mobile terminal spends in the coverage area has a direct impact on the network performance. Thus, it is essential to avoid bandwidth wasting due to the overall delay by performing mobility prediction. A new mobility prediction protocol called the Distributed Neighbor Discovery Protocol (DNDP) is proposed. DNDP handles a neighbor graph table that dynamically configures itself according to the terminals' mobility. The simulation shows that the terminals service continuity is significantly improved thanks to DNDP.
