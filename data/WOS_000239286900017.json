Although edge sharpness and location is well preserved, important information, encoded in image features like textures or certain details, is often compromised in the process of denoising. We propose a mechanism that better preserves fine scale features in such denoising processes. A basic pyramidal structure-texture decomposition of images is presented and analyzed. A first level of this pyramid is used to isolate the noise and the relevant texture components in order to compute spatially varying constraints based on local variance measures. A variational formulation with a spatially varying fidelity term controls the extent of denoising over image regions. Our results show visual improvement as well as an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio over scalar fidelity term processes. This type of processing can be used for a variety of tasks in partial differential equation-based image processing and computer vision, and is stable and meaningful from a mathematical viewpoint.", "paper_title": "Variational denoising of partly textured images by spatially varying constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000239286900017"}
