This can be overcome by randomization tests. In this paper, the accuracy and power of a MANOVA randomization test are evaluated for one and two factors with interaction with simulated data from three distributions. The randomization test is based on the partitioning of sum of squares computed from Euclidean distances. In one-factor designs, sample size and variance inequality were evaluated. The results showed a high level of accuracy. The power curve was higher with normal distribution, lower with uniform, intermediate with lognormal and was sensitive to variance inequality. In two-factor designs, three methods of permutations and two statistics were compared. The results showed that permutation of the residuals with F-pseudo is accurate and can give good power for testing the interaction and restricted permutation for testing main factors.", "paper_title": "Properties of a randomization test for multifactor comparisons of groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000283067900005"}
