Different from the past work on the designs of cryptography algorithms and system infrastructures, we will propose a dynamic routing algorithm that could randomize delivery paths for data transmission. The algorithm is easy to implement and compatible with popular routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol in wired networks and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector protocol in wireless networks, without introducing extra control messages. An analytic study on the proposed algorithm is presented, and a series of simulation experiments are conducted to verify the analytic results and to show the capability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Routing with Security Considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000261175300005"}
