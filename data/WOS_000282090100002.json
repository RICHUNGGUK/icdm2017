Currently, no effective load balancing system is available to handle the inbound traffic in a multihomed stub network, where the traffic volume is unknown to the network and the route of the traffic is hard to control. In this paper, we propose ILBO, an inbound traffic load balancing mechanism to effectively balance the inbound traffic in a multihomed stub network. ILBO predicts and schedules the inbound traffic based on outbound traffic. It adopts a two-step traffic predictor to increase the prediction accuracy and also provides an inbound traffic control scheme that can guarantee the successful execution of the traffic scheduling. We have evaluated the effectiveness of ILBO in a trace driven simulation with real world traffic traces collected from multihomed stub networks.", "paper_title": "ILBO: Balance Inbound Traffic Dynamically in Multihomed Stub Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282090100002"}
