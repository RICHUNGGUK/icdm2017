This process, called two-step method, consists in (i) solving micro-scale equations on subdomains obtained from the full domain regular decomposition and (ii) solve a second upscaling with Darcy's law on the permeability fields obtained in the first step. The micro-scale equations used depend on the case studied. The two-step upscaling process is validated on randomly generated Darcy-scale permeability fields by measuring the numerical error induced by upscaling. The method is then applied to real domains obtained from sandstone micro-tomographic images. The method specificities due to pore-space structure are discussed. The main advantage of the two-step upscaling method resides in the drastic reduction of computational costs (CPU time and memory usage) while maintaining a numerical error similar to that of other upscaling procedures. This new upscaling method may improve permeability predictions by the use of finer meshes or larger sample volumes.", "paper_title": "Efficiency of a two-step upscaling method for permeability evaluation at Darcy and pore scales", "paper_id": "WOS:000369521700002"}
