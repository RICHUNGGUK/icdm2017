[3]. Unfortunately, the presentation of the first new model (called start/end-based formulation SEE) was not correct. More precisely, a set of necessary constraints representing the relative positioning of start and end events of activities was unintentionally omitted in the paper although it was present in the integer program used for the computational experiments. After presenting a counterexample showing the incorrectness, we provide a disaggregated and an aggregated variant of the set of necessary constraints, the disaggregated formulation yielding in theory a better linear programming relaxation. We present computational results showing that although the linear programming relaxations of both formulations yield equivalently poor lower bounds, the disaggregated formulation shows in average a better performance for integer solving of a well-known set of 30-activity instances.
