On the other hand, another framework is proposed to integrate typical multi-learner based approaches for problem solving, particularly on Gaussian mixture based data clustering and local subspace learning, multi-sets mixture based object detection and motion estimation, and multi-agent coordinated problem solving. Typical learning algorithms, especially those that base on rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL) and Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) learning, are summarized from a unified perspective with new extensions. Furthermore, the two different frameworks are not only examined with one viewed crossly from a perspective of the other, with new insights and extensions, but also further unified into a general problem solving paradigm that consists of five basic mechanisms in terms of acquisition, allocation, amalgamation, admission, and affirmation, or shortly A5 paradigm.
