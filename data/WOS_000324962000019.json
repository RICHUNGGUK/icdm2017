The principle characteristic of DJSSP considered in the paper is that the jobs arrive continuously in time and the attributes of the jobs, such as the release dates, routings and processing times are not known in advance, whereas in the classical job shop scheduling problem (CJSSP), it is assumed that all jobs to be processed are available at the beginning of the scheduling process. Reactive scheduling approach is one of the effective approaches for DJSSP. In the paper, a heuristic is proposed to implement the reactive scheduling of the jobs in the dynamic production environment. The proposed heuristic decomposes the original scheduling problem into a number of sub problems. Each sub problem, in fact, is a dynamic single machine scheduling problem with job release dates. The scheduling technique applied in the proposed heuristic is priority scheduling, which determines the next state of the system based on priority values of certain system elements. The system elements are prioritized with the help of scheduling rules (SRs). An approach based on gene expression programming (GEP) is also proposed in the paper to construct efficient SRs for DJSSP. The rules constructed by GEP are evaluated in the comparison of the rules constructed by GP and several prominent human made rules selected from literatures on extensive problem sets with respect to various measures of performance.
