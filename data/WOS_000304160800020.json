Specifically, we analyze the prediction structure used to achieve temporal, spatial, and quality scalability of scalable video coding (SVC) and show that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of SVC is a weighted combination of the bit rates assigned to all the streams. Our analysis utilizes the end user's preference for certain resolutions. We also propose a rate-distortion (R-D) optimization algorithm and compare its performance with that of a state-of-the-art scalable bit allocation algorithm. The reported experiment results demonstrate that the R-D algorithm significantly outperforms the compared approach in terms of the average PSNR.", "paper_title": "Interlayer Bit Allocation for Scalable Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160800020"}
