The resulting non commutative rings are no longer left and right Euclidean. Codes that are principal ideals in quotient rings of skew polynomial rings by a two sided ideals are studied. As an application, skew constacyclic self-dual codes over GR(4, 2) are constructed. Euclidean self-dual codes give self-dual Z(4)-codes. Hermitian self-dual codes yield 3-modular lattices and quasi-cyclic self-dual Z(4)-codes.", "paper_title": "Skew constacyclic codes over Galois rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000259353600003"}
