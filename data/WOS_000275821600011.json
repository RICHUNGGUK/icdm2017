We provide both informal and formal descriptions of selected problems, and compare the performance of selected state-of-the art first order theorem provers on them. Our analysis yields some surprising results, e.g., the theorem prover most often used by loop theorists does not necessarily yield the best performance.", "paper_title": "Automated theorem proving in quasigroup and loop theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000275821600011"}
