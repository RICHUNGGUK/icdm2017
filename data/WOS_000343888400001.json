CH3BrSiLi2 and C(SiH3)(3)BrSiLi2 have three possible structures, the p-complex, the plain, and the folded structures. The plain and the folded structures are different from those of known structures of silylenoids. The energy of the plain structure is the lowest and nearly equals to that of the folded structure. The plain and the folded structures, which can isomerize into each other, are the most stable and possibly detected ones in chemical reactions. The essential of the insertion reactions with Me3SiCl is the same. The insertion barriers are in the order of H2SiLiBr > C(SiH3)(3)BrSiLi2 > CH3BrSiLi2. TheC(SiH3)(3) group makes the insertion of C(SiH3)(3)BrSiLi2 more difficult.", "paper_title": "The structures and stability of silylenoids RBrSiLi2 (R=CH3, C(SiH3)(3))", "paper_id": "WOS:000343888400001"}
