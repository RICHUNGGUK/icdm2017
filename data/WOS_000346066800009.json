Joint moments are generally calculated using scaled generic musculoskeletal models. However, due to anatomical variability or pathology, such models may differ from the patient's anatomy, calling into question the accuracy of the resulting joint moments. This study aimed to quantify the potential joint moment errors caused by geometrical inaccuracies in scaled models, during gait, for eight test subjects. For comparison, a semi-automatic computed tomography (CT)-based workflow was introduced to create models with subject-specific joint locations and inertial parameters. 3D surface models of the femora and hemipelves were created by segmentation and the hip joint centres and knee axes were located in these models. The scaled models systematically located the hip joint centre (HJC) up to 33.6mm too inferiorly. As a consequence, significant and substantial peak hip extension and abduction moment differences were recorded, with, respectively, up to 23.1% and 15.8% higher values in the image-based models. These findings reaffirm the importance of accurate HJC estimation, which may be achieved using CT- or radiography-based subject-specific modelling. However, obesity-related gait analysis marker placement errors may have influenced these results and more research is needed to overcome these artefacts.", "paper_title": "Computed tomography-based joint locations affect calculation of joint moments during gait when compared to scaling approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066800009"}
