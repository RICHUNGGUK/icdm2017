First, the problem is reformulated in a fixed domain using the conformal mapping technique. Second, the problem is reduced to a single equation for the free surface. Third, this equation is solved using Petviashvili's iterations together with pseudo-spectral discretisation. This method has a super-linear complexity, since the most demanding operations can be performed using a FFT algorithm. Moreover, when this algorithm is combined with the multi-precision floating point computations, the results can be obtained to any arbitrary accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
