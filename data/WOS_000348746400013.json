In these applications the assumption of flow ideality is profoundly inaccurate and may lead to erroneous physical interpretations. As a consequence thereof, various thermodynamic models have been recently developed for real gases and a number of tools are by now available to accurately predict the thermodynamic properties of fluids in presence of relevant non-ideal effects. However, these thermodynamic libraries are frequently computationally inefficient when coupled with existing simulation codes, such as in process modeling and computational fluid-dynamics (CFD). An effective alternative is proposed in this paper. The equations of state embedded in the thermodynamic programs are used, at preliminary level, to construct a grid of nodes storing a subset of thermo-physical properties, i.e. v, s, e, k, mu, required by the method for a given region of interest. Then, an interpolation-based method is conceived for determining the remaining properties in any other point. A key feature is as follows: the nodal values of the basic thermodynamic quantities are used to locally construct, i.e., within each cell of the table, a model of the fundamental relation, assuming a differentiable functional form of at least C-2 class. The presented Look-up Table (LuT) approach is intrinsically consistent and guarantees thermodynamic stability, with inherent high accuracy and very limited computational costs, as demonstrated by the-quantitative examples reported in the paper. As a final step, the LuT method is coupled with two in-house flow solvers and applied to simulate real gas transonic flow in Organic Rankine Cycle turbines; a comprehensive assessment of the approach is provided by comparison with direct equations of state implementation.
