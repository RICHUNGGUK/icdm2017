To achieve this goal, our method performs color transfer in an illumination-independent domain that is relatively free of shadows and highlights. It first recovers an illumination-independent intrinsic reflectance image of the target scene from multiple color references obtained by web search. The reference images from the web search may be taken from different vantage points, under different illumination conditions, and with different cameras. Grayscale versions of these reference images are then used in decomposing the grayscale target image into its intrinsic reflectance and illumination components. We transfer color from the color reflectance image to the grayscale reflectance image, and obtain the final result by relighting with the illumination component of the target image. We demonstrate via several examples that our method generates results with excellent color consistency.", "paper_title": "Intrinsic Colorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100046"}
