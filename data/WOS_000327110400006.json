Along the lines of recent work on H-infinity norm computation for FOS, new extensions of the L-infinity and H-infinity. bounded real lemmas to FOS are given after stating the differences between those two norms. An H-infinity. state feedback control method based on the corresponding bounded real lemma is then proposed. The efficiency of this method is evaluated on numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
