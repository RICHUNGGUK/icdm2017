Developing an algorithm to identify W sites is an important work. And it is better if the algorithm could assign which PUS modifies the W sites. Here, we developed PPUS (http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/), the first web server to predict PUS-specific W sites. PPUS employed support vector machine as the classifier and used nucleotides around W sites as the features. Currently, PPUS could accurately predict new W sites for PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. PPUS is well designed and friendly to user.", "paper_title": "PPUS: a web server to predict PUS-specific pseudouridine sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000362846600020"}
