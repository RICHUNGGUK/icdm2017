Methods: The random-effect Poisson regression model was first proposed to deal with over-dispersion for data fraught with heterogeneity after making allowance for measured covariates. Boyesian acyclic graphic model in conjunction with Morkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique was then applied to estimate the parameters of both relevant covariates and random effect. Predictive distribution was then generated to compare the predicted with the observed for the Boyesian model with and without random effect. Data from repeated measurement of episodes among 44 patients with intractable epilepsy were used as an illustration. Results:The application of Poisson regression without taking heterogeneity into account to epilepsy data yielded a large value of heterogeneity (heterogeneity factor = 17.90, deviance = 1485, degree of freedom (df) = 83). After taking the random effect into account, the value of heterogeneity factor was greatly reduced (heterogeneity factor = 0.52, deviance = 42.5, df = 81). The Pearson chi(2) for the comparison between the expected seizure frequencies and the observed ones at two and three months of the model with and without random effect were 34.27 (p = 1.00) and 1799.90 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion: The Bayesian acyclic model using the MCMC method was demonstrated to have great potential for disease prediction while data show over-dispersion attributed either to correlated property or to subject-to-variability.", "paper_title": "Bayesian random-effect model for predicting outcome fraught with heterogeneity - An illustration with episodes of 44 patients with intractable epilepsy", "paper_id": "WOS:000242859600007"}
