In this paper, we develop a new dependent OWA operator, and study some of its desirable properties. The prominent characteristic of this dependent OWA operator is that it can relieve the influence of unfair arguments on the aggregated results. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the developed operator.", "paper_title": "Dependent OWA operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600018"}
