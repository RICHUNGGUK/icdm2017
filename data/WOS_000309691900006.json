The efforts are primarily hampered by challenges such as missing of stands, formal methodology and workflow model during archiving. Further deficits are failing to keep interoperation among archives, information loss without any sense of information decay etc. Objective of this research is to explore the LTP of various kinds of documents independent from the evolution of time and changes in techniques and digital environments. Basic requirements come from integration of storage management and information management, securing preservation of data, metadata, indexes, etc. This paper presents the evolutionary development of the LTP process for Governmental Archive Management and Knowledge Management with respect to above requirements. Effective search to resources and efficient storage/access on data, consistent user-interface, recovery drawing on co-location back-up, dynamic regulation on authentication and security management are tasks followed. Then, a pilot Semantic Data Grid and its annotation and service matching mechanisms are described, where the ontologism play a crucial role. Last but not least, experiences learned and the future works with respect to the semantic grid for LTP will be summarized.", "paper_title": "Developing Governmental Archival System on Semantic Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000309691900006"}
