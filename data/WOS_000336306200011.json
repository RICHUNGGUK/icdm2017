Using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulations, our group illustrated the process of fosfomycin induced conformational change of FomA. The detailed roles of the catalytic residues (Lys18, His58 and Thr210) during the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex were shown in our research. The organization functions of Gly53, Gly54, Ile61 and Leu75 were also highlighted. Furthermore, the cation-p interaction between Arg62 and Trp207 was observed and speculated to play an auxiliary role in the conformation change process of the enzyme. This detailed molecular level illustration of the formation of FomA center dot ATP center dot Mg center dot Fosfomycin complex could provide insight for both anti-biotic discovery and improvement of fosfomycin in the future.", "paper_title": "Fosfomycin Induced Structural Change in Fosfomycin Resistance Kinases FomA: Molecular Dynamics and Molecular Docking Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000336306200011"}
