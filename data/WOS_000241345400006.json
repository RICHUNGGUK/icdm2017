We present the UCPCD process and its background, and a selection of interactive theater tools that can be applied to UCPCD. Through a case study we introduce a practical implementation of these tools to UCPCD. The paper concludes by suggesting guidelines for using drama and dramaturgy in concept design activities. The key finding is that drama methods deepen the designers' involvement in the process and improve understanding of the user communities' behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
