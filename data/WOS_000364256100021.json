It is shown that our multigrid methods are optimal, which means the convergence rates of the methods are independent of the mesh size and mesh level, Moreover, our theoretical analysis and convergence results do not require regularity assumptions of the model problems. Numerical results are given to support our theoretical findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
