Within the framework of Continuous-time Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (CARMA) processes, we derive a necessary condition for the kernel to be non-negative, and propose a numerical method for checking the non-negativity of a kernel function. These results can be lifted to solving a similar problem with another approach to modeling volatility via the COntinuous-time Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (COGARCH) processes.", "paper_title": "A note on the non-negativity of continuous-time ARMA and GARCH processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263181200004"}
