Therefore, distributed and self-organized VoIP networks are emerging as the times require. Because of VoIP's cheapness and simplicity, many institutes forecast that it emerges as next spam entryway, like e-mail service. Especially, interconnected VoIP networks are self-organized and lack centralized authority. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called ADVS (Anti-Distributed Voice Spam), against SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) on the distributed and self-organized VoIP networks. ADVS presents a proper reputation model to evaluate end-user's past behavior and accumulate other users' referrals for detecting and filtering spam calls. In the VoIP network, ADVS acts as a middleware of VoIP proxy and constructs a DHT-based P2P network over call proxies and part of P2P-VoIP client to interlink each other and share end-user's reputation. At the end of the paper, we verify AVDS through building simulation test bed. The results of experiment show that ADVS could detect spam calls accurately and stably.", "paper_title": "ADVS: a reputation-based model on filtering SPIT over P2P-VoIP networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500006"}
