The nonlinearities in the different jump modes are initially parameterized by multilayer neural networks (MNNs), which lead to neural Markovian jump systems. A stochastic neural Lyapunov function (NLF) is used to analyze the stability of the resulting neural control MJSs. Then, based on this stochastic NLF and the neural model, a linear state feedback controller is designed to stabilize the closed-loop nonlinear system and guaranteed an upper bound of the system performance for all admissible approximation errors of the MNNs. The control gains can be derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a single link robot arm is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "NEURAL NETWORK BASED STOCHASTIC OPTIMAL CONTROL FOR NONLINEAR MARKOV JUMP SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400031"}
