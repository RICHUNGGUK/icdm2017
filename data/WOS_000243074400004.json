We assume of course that S covers M. While the general problem is NP-hard to solve, even approximately, here we consider some geometric special cases, where usually U = R-d. Combining previously known techniques [4], [5], we show that polynomial-time approximation algorithms with provable performance exist, under a certain general condition: that for a random subset R subset of S and nondecreasing function f (.), there is a decomposition of the complement U\\boolean OR(R) into an expected at most f (vertical bar R vertical bar) regions, each region of a particular simple form. Under this condition, a cover of size O(f(vertical bar C vertical bar)) can be found in polynomial time. Using this result, and combinatorial geometry results implying bounding functions f (c) that are nearly linear, we obtain o(log c) approximation algorithms for covering by fat triangles, by pseudo-disks, by a family of fat objects, and others. Similarly, constant-factor approximations follow for similar-sized fat triangles and fat objects, and for fat wedges. With more work, we obtain constant-factor approximation algorithms for covering by unit cubes in R-3, and for guarding an x-monotone polygonal chain.", "paper_title": "Improved approximation algorithms for geometric set cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000243074400004"}
