Grid computing, for dynamic share and collaboration among all kinds of resources, can provide a solution for optimizing video delivery. This paper proposes a conceptual system of video delivery grid. First, the paper provides the model of video delivery grid, and discusses how to select distributed services and create a service flow dynamically. Then, the paper describes the design of video delivery grid based on Globus. Moreover, the prototype of video delivery grid is implemented. The efficiency of this solution was shown by the experiments in the video conference system.", "paper_title": "The design method of a video delivery grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100087"}
