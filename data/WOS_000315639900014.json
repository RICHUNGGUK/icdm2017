It can be used as a power oscillator in the injection-locked transmitter of wireless biomedical sensor nodes (WBSNs) integrated into a wireless body area network. A prototype chip, implemented in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS process occupying 200 x 380 mu m, operates in the medical implantable communications service (MICS) band for medical implants. Measurement results show that the proposed ILO features a wide locking range of 800 MHz (150-950 MHz) at an input power of 0 dBm. More importantly, it has a high input sensitivity of -30 dBm to lock the 3-MHz bandwidth of the MICS band, while consuming only 660 mu W at 1-V supply. This ultralow power consumption enables autonomous WBSNs.", "paper_title": "Sub-mW LC Dual-Input Injection-Locked Oscillator for Autonomous WBSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900014"}
