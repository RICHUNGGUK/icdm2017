In case of LQR, the results are enhanced by inclusion of a minimum order state observer and a feed-forward controller. Since the dynamics of the feedback linearized system correspond to a certain class of linear systems, i.e. a system having more than one pole in excess to zeros, a simpler order quasi-linear feedback controller is applied. The designed controller guarantees asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectories Linder the constraints of physical limitations inherent in the system. A comparative Simulation study of the two approaches reveals the system's performance under various conditions.", "paper_title": "Autonomous vehicle following-performance comparison and proposition of a quasi-linear controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000255331000010"}
