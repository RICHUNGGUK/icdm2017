First, we compare by simulation the new architecture against a single priority MIN and demonstrate up to N times higher throughput for the high priority traffic in a hot spot situation, when N is the number of inputs. In addition, under uniform traffic assumption we show an increase in the low priority throughput, without any change in the high priority throughput. Moreover, while in the single priority system the high priority delay and its standard deviation are increased when low priority traffic is present, it is kept constant in the dual priority system. Finally, we introduce a new approach of long Markovian memory performance model to better capture the packets dependency in a single priority MIN under uniform traffic and extend this model for a dual priority MIN. Model results are shown to be very accurate.", "paper_title": "Two priority buffered multistage interconnection networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237092600003"}
