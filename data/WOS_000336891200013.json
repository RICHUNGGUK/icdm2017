In the proposed color CENTRIST descriptor, global structure characteristics are described by both gradients derived from intensity values and color variations between image pixels. The spatial pyramid scheme has also been adopted to convey information in different scales. Comprehensive studies based on various datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the color CENTRIST from different aspects, including the way to quantize the color space, selection of color space, and categorization performance on various datasets. We demonstrated that the color CENTRIST descriptor was not only easy to implement, but also reliably achieved superior performance over CENTRIST. An application was also proposed to demonstrate the possibility of applying the color CENTRIST in various domains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
