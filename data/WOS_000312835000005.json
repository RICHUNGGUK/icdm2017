The proposed baseband receiver applied in the system with two transmit antennas and one receive antenna aims to provide high performance in outdoor mobile environments. It provides a simple and robust synchronizer and an accurate but hardware affordable channel estimator to overcome the challenge of multipath fading channels. The coded bit error rate performance for 16 quadrature amplitude modulation can achieve less than 10(-6) under the vehicle speed of 120 km/hr. The proposed baseband receiver designed in 90-nm CMOS technology can support up to 27.32 Mb/s uncoded data transmission under 10 MHz channel bandwidth. It requires a core area of 2.41 x 2.41 mm(2) and dissipates 68.48 mW at 78.4 MHz with 1 V power supply.", "paper_title": "STBC-OFDM Downlink Baseband Receiver for Mobile WMAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000005"}
