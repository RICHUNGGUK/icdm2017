In fact, there is a large body of literature that investigates each of these as a stand-alone problem. In this regard, the air transportation design optimization problem can be viewed as an optimal system-of-systems (SoS) design problem. The resulting mixed variable programming problem may not be solvable using an all-in-one (AiO) approach because its size and complexity grow rapidly with increasing number of network nodes. In this work, we use a decomposition-based nested formulation and the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) optimization algorithm to solve the optimal SoS design problem. The two-stage expansion of a regional Canadian airline's network to enable national operations is considered as a demonstrating example.", "paper_title": "System-of-systems approach to air transportation design using nested optimization and direct search", "paper_id": "WOS:000355759200006"}
