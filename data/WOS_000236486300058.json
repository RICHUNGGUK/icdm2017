In this paper we apply the topographic ICA to gene expression time series data and compare it with the conventional ICA as well as the independent subspace analysis (ISA). Empirical study with yeast cell cycle-related data and yeast sporulation data, shows that TICA is more suitable for gene clustering.", "paper_title": "Topographic independent component analysis of gene expression time series data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300058"}
