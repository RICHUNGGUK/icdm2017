Due to the many-to-one traffic pattern in a multi-hop network, the nodes closer to the sink also help to relay data for those farther away from the sink, and hence they consume much more energy and tend to die faster. This paper proposes a sink-oriented layered clustering (SOLC) protocol to better balance energy consumption among nodes with different distances to the sink. In SOLC, the sensor field is divided into concentric rings, and the SOLC protocol consists of intra-ring clustering and inter-ring routing. We compute the optimal ring width and the numbers of cluster heads in different rings to balance energy consumption between intra-cluster data processing and inter-cluster data relaying. Cluster heads in a ring closer to the sink has smaller sizes than those in the rings farther away from the sink, and hence they can spend less energy for intra-cluster data processing and more energy for inter-cluster data relay. Simulation results show that the SOLC protocol can outperform several existing clustering protocols in terms of improved network lifetime.", "paper_title": "A Sink-Oriented Layered Clustering Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325870100006"}
