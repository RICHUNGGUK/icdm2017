The first Gray code for that set was introduced by Knuth (1975) 151, later, Ruskey presented a modified version of Knuth's algorithm with distance two, Ehrlich (1973) [3] introduced a loop-free algorithm for the set of partitions of {1,2,...,n}, Ruskey and Savage (1994) [9] generalized Ehrlich's results and give two Gray codes for the set of partitions of {1,2,...,n}, and recently, Mansour et al. (2008) [7] gave another Gray code and loop-free generating algorithm for that set by adopting plane tree techniques. In this paper, we introduce the set of e-restricted growth functions (a generalization of restricted growth functions) and extend the aforementioned results by giving a Gray code with distance one for this set: and as a particular case we obtain a new Gray code for set partitions in restricted growth function representation. Our Gray code satisfies some prefix properties and can be implemented by a loop-free generating algorithm using classical techniques: such algorithms can be used as a practical solution of some difficult problems. Finally, we give some enumerative results concerning the restricted growth functions of order d. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
