Users can express opinions and record daily life using microblogs. Microblogs that are posted by users indicate their interests to some extent. We aim to mine user interests via keyword extraction from microblogs. Traditional keyword extraction methods are usually designed for formal documents such as news articles or scientific papers. Messages posted by microblogging users, however, are usually noisy and full of new words, which is a challenge for keyword extraction. In this paper, we combine a translation-based method with a frequency-based method for keyword extraction. In our experiments, we extract keywords for microblog users from the largest microblogging website in China, Sina Weibo. The results show that our method can identify users' interests accurately and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Mining the interests of Chinese microbloggers via keyword extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000299768800006"}
