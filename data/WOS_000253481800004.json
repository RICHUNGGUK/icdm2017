We consider the framework of Franklin and Wright (J. Cryptol. 13(1):9-30, 2000): multicast communication and byzantine adversary. Franklin and Wright studied particular neighbor graphs with neighbor-disjoint paths. The aim of the present work is to drop this assumption and to give necessary and sufficient conditions on the neighbor graph allowing reliable and secure information transmission.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic reliability and privacy of communication using multicast in general neighbor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000253481800004"}
