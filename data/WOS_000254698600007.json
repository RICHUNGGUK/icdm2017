The proposed algorithm can reconstruct multiple simple curves that may be open, closed, and/or with sharp corners. The criteria for the curve reconstruction are based on two observations we have made concerning the human visual system: (1) two closest neighbors tend to be connected, and (2) sampling points tend to be connected into a smooth curve. To simulate these two observations, we use the neighborhood feature to connect the nearest neighbors and we present a statistical criterion to determine when two sample points should not be connected even if they are the nearest neighbors. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed for the sampling of curves so that they can be reconstructed by using the present algorithm. Numerous examples show that this algorithm is effective. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
