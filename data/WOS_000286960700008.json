The method includes loss of stability due to bifurcation and limiting behaviour. The optimization formulation is formulated as a mathematical programming problem and solved using gradientbased techniques. Buckling of a well-known cylindrical shell benchmark problem is studied and the solutions found in literature are proved to be incorrect. The nonlinear buckling optimization formulation is benchmarked against the traditional linear buckling optimization formulation through several numerical optimization cases of a composite cylindrical shell panel which clearly illustrates the advantage and potential of the presented approach.
