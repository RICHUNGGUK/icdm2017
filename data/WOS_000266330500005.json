In particular, few researchers have addressed the challenge to recognize noncooperative or even uncooperative subjects who try to cheat the recognition system by deliberately changing their facial appearance through such tricks as variant expressions or disguise (e.g., by partial occlusions). This paper addresses these problems within the framework of similarity matching. A novel perception-inspired nonmetric partial similarity measure is introduced, which is potentially useful in dealing with the concerned problems because it can help capture the prominent partial similarities that are dominant in human perception. Two methods, based on the general golden section rule and the maximum margin criterion, respectively, are proposed to automatically set the similarity threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed method in handling large expressions, partial occlusions, and other distortions is demonstrated on several well-known face databases.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition Under Occlusions and Variant Expressions With Partial Similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000266330500005"}
