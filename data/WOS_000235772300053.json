In this study, we utilise a novel approach to automatically segment out the ventricular system from a series of MR brain images and to recover the shape of hand outlines from a series of 2D training images. Automated landmark extraction is accomplished through the use of the self-organising model the growing neural gas (GNG) network which is able to learn and preserve the topological relations of a given set of input patterns without requiring a priori knowledge of the structure of the input space. The GNC based method is compared to other self-organising networks such as Kohonen and Neural Cas (NG) maps and results are given showing that the proposed method preserves accurate models.", "paper_title": "Automatically building 2D statistical shapes using the topology preservation model GNG", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300053"}
