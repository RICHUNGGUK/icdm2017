Such phenomenon has existed in practice for a long time, but there are no mathematical model that can explain it adequately. This paper utilizes multiple criteria and multiple constraint levels linear programming ((MCLP)-L-2) model and its extended techniques to explore the linear programming models with changeable parameters. The parameters include: unit profit, available resources, and input-output coefficients of production function. With those parameters changed with capital investment and/or time, we study how to find dynamic best solutions to make \"taking loss at the ordering time and making profit at the time of delivery\" feasible. For more general cases we also sketch a generalized mathematical programming model with changeable parameters and control variables.", "paper_title": "Linear programming models with changeable parameters - Theoretical analysis on \"taking loss at the ordering time and making profit at the delivery time\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000253476200002"}
