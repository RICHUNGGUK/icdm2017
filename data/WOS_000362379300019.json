Meshing functionals are discretized on simplicial meshes and the Jacobian matrix of the continuous coordinate transformation is approximated by the Jacobian matrices of affine mappings between elements. The advantage of this direct geometric discretization is that it preserves the basic geometric structure of the continuous functional, which is useful in preventing strong decoupling or loss of integral constraints satisfied by the functional. Moreover, the discretized functional is a function of the coordinates of mesh vertices and its derivatives have a simple analytical form, which allows a simple implementation of variational mesh generation and adaptation on computer. Since the variational mesh adaptation is the base for a number of adaptive moving mesh and mesh smoothing methods, the result in this work can be used to develop simple implementations of those methods. Numerical examples are given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
