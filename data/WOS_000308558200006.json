Furthermore, the 16 states obtained by removing two orthogonal states from any MU product triple cannot figure in a (hypothetical) complete set of seven MU bases. These results follow from exploiting the structure of MU product bases in a novel fashion, and they are among the strongest ones obtained for MU bases in dimension six without recourse to computer algebra.", "paper_title": "ON THE IMPOSSIBILITY TO EXTEND TRIPLES OF MUTUALLY UNBIASED PRODUCT BASES IN DIMENSION SIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000308558200006"}
