To generate business events, we need to address the performance issues in creating a large volume of event data. This paper proposes a new model for the tag life cycle and a fast generation algorithm for this model. We present the results of experiments with the generation algorithm, showing that it outperforms previous methods.", "paper_title": "Generation of Business Event Data Sets for Testing RFID Information Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000361655500005"}
