Association rule mining (ARM) methods are helpful in finding associational relationships between genes. However, classical association rule mining (CARM) algorithms extract only a subset of the associations that exist among different binary states; therefore can only infer part of the relationships on gene regulations. To resolve this problem, we developed an extended association rule mining (EARM) strategy along with a new way of the association rule definition. Compared with the CARM method, our new approach extracted more frequent genesets from a public microarray data set. The EARM method discovered some biologically interesting association rules that were not detected by CARM. Therefore, EARM provides an effective tool for exploring relationships among genes.", "paper_title": "An extended association rule mining strategy for gene relationship discovery from microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326873000012"}
