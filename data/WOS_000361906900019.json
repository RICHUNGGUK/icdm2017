Each agent in the MAS model is associated with five behavioral parameters, and we estimate their influences on the coupled models using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). This paper utilizes Hadoop-based Cloud Computing techniques and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) based variance decomposition approach for the improvement of GSA with large-scale socio-hydrological models. With the techniques, running 1000 scenarios of the coupled models can be completed within two hours with Hadoop clusters, a substantial improvement over the 42 days required to run these scenarios sequentially on a desktop machine. Based on the model results, GSA is conducted with the surrogate model derived from using PCE to measure the impacts of the spatio-temporal variations of the behavioral parameters on crop profits and the water table, identifying influential parameters.
