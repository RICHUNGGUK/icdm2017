Improving energy efficiency is now the primary design goal for all market segments of microprocessors from mobile to server. Specialized hardware accelerators, designed to run only a subset of workloads with orders of magnitude energy efficiency improvement, are seen as a potential solution. Selecting an ensemble of accelerators to best cover the workloads run on a platform remains a challenge. We propose metrics for accelerator selection derived from a detailed communication-aware performance model and present an automated methodology to populate this model. Employing a combination of characterized RTL and our selection metrics, we evaluate a set of accelerators for a sample application and compare performance to selections based on execution time and Pollack's rule. We find that the architecture selected by our communication-aware metric shows improved performance over architectures selected based on execution time and Pollack's rule, as they do not account for speedup being limited by communication.", "paper_title": "Metrics for Early-Stage Modeling of Many-Accelerator Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000320993000008"}
