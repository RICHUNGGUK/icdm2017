However, current QoE assessment focuses mainly on audiovisual quality in non-interactive applications, such as video-on-demand services. On the other hand, where experiments aim to quantify interactive quality, the focus is typically targeted at games, using an ad-hoc test setup to assess the impact of network variations on the playing experience. In this paper, we present a novel platform enabling the assessment of a broad range of interactive applications (e.g., thin client remote desktop systems, remotely rendered engineering applications, games). Dynamic reconfiguration of media encoding and decoding is built into the system, to allow dynamic adaptation of the media encoding to the network conditions and the application characteristics. Evaluating the influence of these automatic adaptations is a key asset of our approach. A range of possible use cases is discussed, as well as a performance study of our implementation, showing that the platform we built is capable of highly controllable subjective user assessment. Furthermore, we present results obtained by applying the platform for a subjective evaluation of an interactive multimedia application. Specifically, the influence of visual quality and frame rate on interactive QoE has been assessed for a remotely executed race game.", "paper_title": "Platform for real-time subjective assessment of interactive multimedia applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800034"}
