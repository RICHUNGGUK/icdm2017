An ambient intelligence based UbiCom is a pervasive system in which services have some intelligence in order to smoothly interact with users immersed in the environment. The motivation for this methodology is its application in UbiCom large-scale systems where large numbers of users are involved and in applications which deal with dangerous environments. In these cases, real tests are impractical and an artificial society is required. MABS allows building cheap and quick prototypes which can describe UbiCom systems. Analyzing these prototypes, if they are sufficiently descriptive, allows requisites violations in functionality of real UbiCom system designs to be discovered. MABSs and particularly the most descriptive ones can present very complex behaviors. Therefore, the MABS analysis obtained with the presented methodology is not trivial. Consequently, this paper also proposes two techniques for the analysis of general complex MABSs: forensic analysis and the use of simpler simulations. Moreover, the methodology proposes to inject elements of the actual UbiCom system in the simulated world to increase the confidence of the validation process. The proposal is illustrated with a detailed case study that considers a building on our campus and an AmI service for evacuation in case of fire. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
