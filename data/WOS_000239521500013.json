A lot of research therefore is being carried out to understand the nature of model transformations and find out desirable characteristics of transformation languages. In recent years, several transformation languages have been proposed. We present the RubyTL transformation language which has been designed as an extensible language-a set of core features along with an extension mechanism. RubyTL provides a framework for experimenting with features of hybrid transformation languages. In addition, RubyTL has been created as a domain specific language embedded in the Ruby programming language. In this paper we show the core features of the language through a simple example and explain how the language can be extended to provide more features.", "paper_title": "RubyTL: A practical, extensible transformation language", "paper_id": "WOS:000239521500013"}
