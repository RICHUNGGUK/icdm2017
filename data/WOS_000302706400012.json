This is particularly true in silhouette-based tracking where even visible parts cannot be tracked as long as they do not affect the object silhouette. Multiple cameras or motion priors can overcome this problem. However, multiple cameras or appropriate training data are not always readily available. We propose a framework in which the pose of 3-D models is found by minimising the 2-D projection error through minimisation of an energy function depending on the pose parameters. This framework makes it possible to handle occlusions and self-occlusions by tracking multiple objects and object parts simultaneously. Therefore, each part is described by its own image region each of which is modeled by one probability density function. This allows to deal with occlusions explicitly, which includes self-occlusions between different parts of the same object as well as occlusions between different objects. The results we present for simulations and real-world scenes demonstrate the improvements achieved in monocular and multi-camera settings. These improvements are substantiated by quantitative evaluations, e.g. based on the HumanEVA benchmark.", "paper_title": "Region-based pose tracking with occlusions using 3D models", "paper_id": "WOS:000302706400012"}
