This feature is achieved by locally building up the minimum-spanning tree (MST) at each peer using the information of the peer's logical neighbors which are either directly connected (1-hop) or 2-hops away. Using this interconnection structure among the peers, we design a new algorithm to distribute the contents information in the overlay by partitioning the identifier (ID) space among the peers. In this algorithm, each peer maintains a disjoint portion of the ID space. The ID space at a peer may be non-contiguous and each contiguous part is consecutive to the ID space of its directly connected neighbor peers. To route the file-lookup query, each peer builds up a binary search tree (BST) using the knowledge of the ID space of itself and of its directly connected neighbor peers. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms the existing approaches in term of routing overhead, average file-discovery delay, false-negative ratio and average path-stretch value.", "paper_title": "MANET adaptive structured P2P overlay", "paper_id": "WOS:000301870600003"}
