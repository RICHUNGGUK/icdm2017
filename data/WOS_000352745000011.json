Using a low resolution DEM for regional scale morphometric analysis is not an optimal choice, since attenuation of elevation will strongly affect the distribution of calculated parameters. Unless bounded by computational constraints, one should choose to derive basic morphometric parameters from higher resolution data, and resample it to a coarser resolution as needed.
