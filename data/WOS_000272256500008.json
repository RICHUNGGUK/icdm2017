Results and recommendations from interviews concerning engineering design curricula are presented for two major computer-aided design companies. The results described show that virtual reality technology has significant impacts oil academia and industry and that there are also significant interactions and relationships between the two entities. Implementation techniques and responses from students, faculty, and industry are presented. The article concludes with recommendations for current practice and areas for future research, which will promote effective use of virtual reality in engineering education.
