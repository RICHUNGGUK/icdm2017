Here, we present an easyto- use web interface for high-throughput Warp2D batch processing time alignment service using the Dutch Life Science Grid, reducing processing time from days to hours. This service provides the warping function, the sample chromatogram peak list with adjusted retention times and normalized quality scores based on the sum of overlapping peak volume of all peaks. Heat maps before and after time alignment are created from the arithmetic mean of the sum of overlapping peak area rearranged with hierarchical clustering, allowing the quality control of the time alignment procedure. Taverna workflow and command line tool are provided for remote processing of local user data.", "paper_title": "A high-throughput processing service for retention time alignment of complex proteomics and metabolomics LC-MS data", "paper_id": "WOS:000289301600027"}
