The design has been conceived as a scalable architecture: The advanced features can be added on top of a basic NI core implementing data packetization and conversion of protocols, frequency and data size between the connected Intellectual Property (IP) core and the on chip network. The NI can be configured to reach the desired tradeoff between supported services and circuit complexity.", "paper_title": "Design of an NoC Interface Macrocell with Hardware Support of Advanced Networking Functionalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000333471800008"}
