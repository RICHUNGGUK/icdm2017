However, the relationship between body movement and game engagement is not yet well understood. In this article, I consider how body movement affects the player's experience during game play. I start by presenting a taxonomy of body movements observed during game play. These are framed in the context of a body of previously published research that is then embedded into a novel model of engagement. This model describes the relationship between the taxonomy of movement and the type of engagement that each class of movement facilitates. I discuss the factors that may inhibit or enhance such relationship. Finally, I conclude by considering how the proposed model could lead to a more systematic and effective use of body movement for enhancing game experience.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Role of Body Movement in Player Engagement", "paper_id": "WOS:000312333900002"}
