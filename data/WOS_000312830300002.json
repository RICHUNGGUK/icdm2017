We describe the transducer architecture, comprising the bus interface, high-level communication controllers and buffer management blocks. The well-defined architecture of the transducer enables automatic generation of its Transaction-level and Register-transfer level (RTL) models. Moreover, the simple interface of the transducer provides for a well-defined software interface, making it easy to update the software after changes in MPSoC platform. Our experimental results show that MPSoC design for industrial-size applications, such as MP3 decoder and JPEG encoder, greatly benefits from automatic generation of transducer models. We found productivity gains of 9-23x due to significant savings in modeling effort. On the quality axis, we show that MPSoC communication design using automatically generated transducers has very little overhead in communication delay over a fully connected point-to-point communication architecture. Finally, we show that our automatically generated TLMs greatly reduce the system-level modeling time and provide a fast executable model for early functional validation.", "paper_title": "Automatic Generation of Transducer Models for Bus-Based MPSoC Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000312830300002"}
