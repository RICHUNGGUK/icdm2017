This model consists of an overall system dynamics (SD) model of the manufacturing enterprise and connected to it are a number of discrete event simulations for selected operational and tactical functions. SD modelling best fits the macroscopic nature of activities at the higher management levels while the discrete models best fit the microscopic nature of the operational and tactical levels in the supply chain. In addition, the impact of the decisions at the operational elements (e.g. factories/production lines) is analysed at the management level.", "paper_title": "Supply chain and hybrid simulation in the hierarchical enterprise", "paper_id": "WOS:000351166900006"}
