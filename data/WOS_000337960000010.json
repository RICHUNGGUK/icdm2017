It uses stigmergy as a strategy for clustering large datasets and, as a result, displays a typical behavior of complex systems: self-organization and global patterns emerging from the local interaction of simple units. This paper introduces a simplified version of KANTS and describes recent experiments with the algorithm in the context of a contemporary artistic and scientific trend called swarm art, a type of generative art in which swarm intelligence systems are used to create artwork or ornamental objects. KANTS is used here for generating color drawings from the input data that represent real-world phenomena, such as electroencephalogram sleep data. However, the main proposal of this paper is an art project based on well-known abstract paintings, from which the chromatic values are extracted and used as input. Colors and shapes are therefore reorganized by KANTS, which generates its own interpretation of the original artworks. The project won the 2012 Evolutionary Art, Design, and Creativity Competition.", "paper_title": "KANTS: A Stigmergic Ant Algorithm for Cluster Analysis and Swarm Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000337960000010"}
