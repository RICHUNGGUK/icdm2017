The idea success rate, idea performance evaluation, and customer lifetime value (CLV) are integrated. The CLV calculated can be regarded as the final evaluation index used to support idea screening decisions. Project with a larger CLV is preferable for further development. This enables greater market value and profits over the long term after product launch. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
