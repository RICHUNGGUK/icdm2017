In particular, temporal knowledge and models have been fundamental in describing the behavior of computational systems. However, knowledge acquisition of correct descriptions of a system's desired behavior is a complex task. In this paper, we present a novel neural-computation model capable of representing and learning temporal knowledge in recurrent networks. The model works in an integrated fashion. It enables the effective representation of temporal knowledge, the adaptation of temporal models given a set of desirable system properties, and effective learning from examples, which in turn can lead to temporal knowledge extraction from the corresponding trained networks. The model is sound from a theoretical standpoint, but it has also been tested on a case study in the area of model verification and adaptation. The results contained in this paper indicate that model verification and learning can be integrated within the neural computation paradigm, contributing to the development of predictive temporal knowledge-based systems and offering interpretable results that allow system researchers and engineers to improve their models and specifications. The model has been implemented and is available as part of a neural-symbolic computational toolkit.", "paper_title": "Learning and Representing Temporal Knowledge in Recurrent Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299082900024"}
