Fortunately, these wafer defects leave unique patterns due to their spatial dependence across wafer maps. It is thus possible to identify and predict them in order to find the point of failure in the manufacturing process accurately. This paper introduces a novel simplified subspaced regression framework for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps. It can achieve a test error comparable to or better than the state-of-the-artmachine-learning (ML)-based methods, while maintaining a low computational cost when dealing with large-scale wafer data. The effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by our experiments on real wafer defect datasets, achieving detection accuracy of 99.884% and R-2 of 99.905%, which are far better than those of any existing methods reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Simplified Subspaced Regression Network for Identification of Defect Patterns in Semiconductor Wafer Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100003"}
