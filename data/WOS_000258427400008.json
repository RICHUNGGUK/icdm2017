Under Lipschitz condition on the nonlinear part of such systems, a nonlinear adaptive observer is for the actuator fault diagnosis. Moreover, the convergence and its speed of the developed algorithm are also investigated. Finally, simulation results have been included to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new designed techniques.", "paper_title": "Adaptive observer based fault diagnosis for satellite attitude control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400008"}
