In this paper tissue-like recognizing membrane systems are presented. The idea is to consider that membranes are placed in the nodes of a graph, mimicking the cell intercommunication in tissues. In this context, polynomial complexity classes associated with recognizing membrane systems can be defined. We recall the definition for cell-like systems, and we introduce the corresponding complexity classes for the tissue-like case. Moreover, in this paper two efficient Solutions to the satisfiability problem are analyzed and compared from a complexity point of view.
