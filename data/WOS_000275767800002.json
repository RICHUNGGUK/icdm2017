This article proposes an, alternative method for segmenting the lung lobes It, is based on tubular tissue density, and is not . based on lobar fissure ea; traction. The tubular tissues are the peripheral blood vessels and peripheral bronchi Because tubular tissues do not exist on. the boundary between the lung lobes, our method determines the boundary by finding It continuous three-dimensional space In which tubular tissues are absent The boundary determination process is automatically performed using fuzzy control The proposal method was applied to five normal subjects, one patient with. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. anal one patient With, emphysema. The absolute mean. error of detecting lobar boundaries was 3 4 mm and that the volumetric accuracy for the proposed method was an absolute ratio of 3 8 and 5 9% for inspiration and expiration, respectively The proposed method us also applicable to MDCT images in. which. the lobar fissures cannot be distinguished", "paper_title": "LUNG LOBAR SEGMENTATION USING TUBULAR TISSUE DENSITY FROM MULTIDETECTOR-ROW CT IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800002"}
