This problem requires to synthesize a nondeterministic supervisor such that the supervised plant is bisimilar to a given specification. We assume that a supervisor can observe not only the event occurrence but also the current state of the plant, and introduce a notion of completeness of a supervisor which guarantees that all nondetenninistic transitions caused by events enabled by the supervisor are defined in the supervised plant. We define a notion of partial bisimulation between a given specification and the plant, and prove that it serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a bisirnilarity enforcing complete supervisor.", "paper_title": "Bisimilarity Control of Nondeterministic Discrete Event Systems under Event and State Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200014"}
