It is based on a 3-partite, 3-uniform, 4-regular hypergraph and contains rate R(c) = 3/4 constituent convolutional codes with overall constraint length 5. Although the code construction is based on low-complexity codes, the free distance of this construction, computed with the BEAST algorithm, is d(free) = 120, which is remarkably large.", "paper_title": "A Rate R=5/20 Hypergraph-Based Woven Convolutional Code With Free Distance 120", "paper_id": "WOS:000275999500011"}
