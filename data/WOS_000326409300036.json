With the proposed delivery format, various forms of stereoscopic video contents regardless of their encoding and composition types can be delivered over the current dynamic adaptive streaming scheme. In addition, the proposed delivery format supports dynamic and efficient switching between 2D and 3D sequences in an interoperable manner for both 2D and 3D digital devices, regardless of their capabilities. This letter describes the designed delivery format and shows dynamic interoperable applications for 2D and 3D mixed contents with the implemented system in order to verify its features and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Delivery Format for Unified Stereoscopic Video Content Transmissions over Dynamic Adaptive Streaming Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300036"}
