Then the W-1,W-1-seminorm estimate for partial derivative(Z,l)G*(Z) is derived. Finally, applying the triangle inequality and the error estimate of the finite element approximation, we obtain the W-1,W-1-seminorm estimate with order O(vertical bar ln h vertical bar(7/5)) for partial derivative(Z,l)G(Z)(h).", "paper_title": "The W-1,W-1-Seminorm Estimate for the Discrete Derivative Green's Function for the 5D Poisson Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000288527400016"}
