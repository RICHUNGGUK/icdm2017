As society depends critically on these cyber-physical infrastructures, their survivability assessment deserves more attention. In this overview, we first touch upon a taxonomy on survivability of cyber-physical infrastructures, before we focus on three classes of infrastructures (gas, water and electricity) and discuss recent modelling and evaluation approaches and challenges.", "paper_title": "Survivability Evaluation of Gas, Water and Electricity Infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000353999700002"}
