The crack initiation, propagation and breaking process of beam specimens are experimentally studied by producing the double inclined edge notches with different ligament angles in beams under four point bending. The effects of ligament angles on the shear fracturing path in the bridge areas of the double edge-notched beam specimens are studied. Moreover, the influence of the inclined edge notches on the shear-fracture behavior of double edge-notched beam specimens which represents a practical crack orientation is investigated. The same specimens are numerically simulated by an indirect boundary element method known as displacement discontinuity method. These numerical results are compared with the performed experimental results proving the accuracy and validity of the proposed study.", "paper_title": "Influence of the inclined edge notches on the shear-fracture behavior in edge-notched beam specimens", "paper_id": "WOS:000366648000006"}
