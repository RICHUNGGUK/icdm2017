Public key-based access control schemes are more attractive than symmetric-key based approaches due to high scalability, low memory requirement, easy key-addition/revocation for a new node, and no key pre-distribution requirement. Although Wang et al. recently introduced a promising access control scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), it is still burdensome for sensors and has several security limitations (it does not provide mutual authentication and is strictly vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks). This paper presents an energy-efficient access control scheme based on ECC to overcome these problems and more importantly to provide dominant energy-efficiency. Through analysis and simulation based evaluations, we show that the proposed scheme overcomes the security problems and has far better energy-efficiency compared to current scheme proposed by Wang et al.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Access Control Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000273441200008"}
