This paper presents a novel spatial model for the collective strategy diffusion in multiagent societies. In the model, the social distance between agents can be measured in a euclidian space; the authority of a social strategy is determined by not only the number but also the collective social positions of its overlaid agents; social strategies that have strong authorities are impressed on the other agents, and the agents will accept (partially or in full) or reject them based on their own social strategies and social positions. Moreover, the paper also considers the concurrent form in the collective diffusion and presents that an agent's social strategy is influenced not only by the diffusion that bears on itself but also by other concurrent diffusion processes that bear on other agents, and an agent will incline to the average social strategy of the whole system, which can make the system more unified. Finally, the paper uses queue orientation as a case to study the presented model.", "paper_title": "Concurrent Collective Strategy Diffusion of Multiagents: The Spatial Model and Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000267063800009"}
