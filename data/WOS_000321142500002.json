We have studied the operational features and the environment of e-Health services and we led to a framework structure that extends the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)/Parlay architecture, which is used for the deployment of standardized services over the next generation IP networks. We expanded the ETSI/Parlay architecture with new service capability features as well as sensor, profiling, and security mechanisms. The proposed framework assists the seamless integration, within the e-Health service structure, of diverse facilities provided by both the underlying communication and computing infrastructure as well as the patient's bio and context sensor networks. Finally, we demonstrate the deployment of a telemonitoring service in smart home environment based on the proposed framework architecture.", "paper_title": "A New Framework Architecture for Next Generation e-Health Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000321142500002"}
