Some useful MT models are special cases of our proposed model. To obtain maximum likelihood estimates, we use the expectation maximum algorithm with its E-step via the Gibbs sampler made feasible by Monte Carlo simulation and its M-step greatly simplified by a sequence of conditional maximization. Standard errors are evaluated by inverting a Monte Carlo approximation of the information matrix using Louis's method. The methodology is illustrated with a simulation study and a real example.", "paper_title": "The Monte Carlo EM method for estimating multivariate tobit latent variable models", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155600003"}
