This article focus on the traffic generated by a single source, providing an overview of what was done in the field and studying the statistical properties of the traffic produced by a personal computer, including analysis of the autocorrelation structure. Different distributions were fitted to the interarrival times, packet sizes, and byte count processes with the goal of singling out the ones most suitable for traffic generation.", "paper_title": "Source Traffic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000281799300010"}
