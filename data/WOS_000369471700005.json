Both instruments use bimanual writing or drawing gestures on graphic tablets. The voice signal is computed with the help of a parametric synthesizer, including a voice source model, consonantal noise models and series/parallel formant filters. Cantor Digitalis is a vowel and semi-vowel singing instrument. Digitartic allows for singing syllables, including plosives, fricative, liquid and nasal consonants. The issue of consonant gestures and musical beat synchronization is discussed. These instruments allow for expressive musical performances. They are regularly used for concerts.", "paper_title": "Gestural control of voice synthesis. The cantor digitalis and digitartic instruments", "paper_id": "WOS:000369471700005"}
