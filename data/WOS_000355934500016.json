An issue which has received widespread attention in rapidly growing field of DEA is the sensitivity and stability of the evaluating results to perturbations in the data. Due to the uncertainty of the data in real life, this paper will perform a sensitivity and stability analysis of the additive model with uncertain inputs and output. Some theories of the uncertain DEA model based on uncertainty theory will be given. It is followed by some computation methods of the stable regions to the efficient and inefficient DMUs. Finally, a numerical example will be presented to give an illustration of the sensitivity and stability analysis.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity and stability analysis of the additive model in uncertain data envelopment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000355934500016"}
