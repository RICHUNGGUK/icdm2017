Our goal is to develop a protocol in which acting honestly is a dominant strategy for sellers and that does not leak the true cost of the sellers, which is highly classified information that the sellers want to keep private. We first present a Vickrey-type protocol that can be used for multi-attribute procurement auctions. Next, we show how this protocol can be executed securely.", "paper_title": "Secure multi-attribute procurement auction", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500024"}
