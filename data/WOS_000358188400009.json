We provide a proof that the minimum weight perfect matching problem associated with running a particular class of topological quantum error correction codes on this array can be exactly solved with a 2-D square array of classical computing devices, each of which is nominally associated with a fixed number N of qubits, in constant average time per round of error detection independent of L provided physical error rates are below fixed nonzero values, and other physically reasonable assumptions. This proof is applicable to the fully fault-tolerant case only, not the case of perfect stabilizer measurements.", "paper_title": "MINIMUM WEIGHT PERFECT MATCHING OF FAULT-TOLERANT TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION IN AVERAGE O(1) PARALLEL TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188400009"}
