In particular P2P applications are expected to gain from ALTO, due to the many connections peers form among each other, often without taking network layer topology information into account. In this paper, we present results of an extensive intra-ISP trial with an ALTO-enhanced P2P filesharing software. In summary, our results show that-depending on the concrete setting and on the distribution of upload capacity in the network-ALTO enables an ISP to save operational costs significantly while not degrading application layer performance noticeably. In addition, based on our experience we are able to give advice to operators on how to save costs with ALTO while not sacrificing application layer performance at all.", "paper_title": "Experiences with large-scale operational trials of ALTO-enhanced P2P filesharing in an intra-ISP scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000313868100003"}
