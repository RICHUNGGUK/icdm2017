Load distribution strategies in using multiple interfaces for simultaneous data transmission have been studied. This paper presents a thorough literature review of various existing load distribution models, and classifies them in terms of their key functionalities such as traffic splitting and path selection. Based on a number of significant criteria such as the ability to balance load and to maintain packet ordering, along with several other issues, which affect network performance perceived by users, we analyze various examples of existing models, and then compare and identify their exhibited advantages as well as shortcomings.", "paper_title": "On Load Distribution over Multipath Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307170700003"}
