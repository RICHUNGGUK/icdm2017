The research adopts Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) for customers to make weight assessment on evaluation indexes of Health Management Center. Five major perspectives for customers' selection of Health Management Center are summarized, orderly including (1) Health Management Department (2) Personnel Service Department (3) Health Examination Service Department (4) Marketing Department (5) Environment Department. In addition, in the aspect of importance, \"regularly track recheck and provide timely medical service\", \"provide doctor's commentary and inspection report result and follow-up ambulatory care issues\" and \"reasonably charge\" are consider to be three major indexes in all weights. Research results can be submitted to relevant health examination institutes and personnel of the hospital for reference to earn the opportunity of developing new customers and improve service quality.
