Defined as a vector consisting of marginal distributions of chosen filter responses, local spectral histograms provide a feature statistic for both types of regions. Using local spectral histograms of homogeneous regions, we decompose the segmentation process into three stages. The first is the initial classification stage, where probability models for homogeneous texture and nontexture regions are derived and an initial segmentation result is obtained by classifying local windows. In the second stage, we give an algorithm that iteratively updates the segmentation using the derived probability models. The third is the boundary localization stage, where region boundaries are localized by building refined probability models that are sensitive to spatial patterns in segmented regions. We present segmentation results on texture as well as nontexture images. Our comparison with other methods shows that the proposed method produces more accurate segmentation results.", "paper_title": "Image and texture segmentation using local spectral histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200017"}
