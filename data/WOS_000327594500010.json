Cubic shaping and transmission at uniform average energy per antenna per time slot are important from the perspective of energy efficiency of STBCs. The shaping criterion demands that the generator matrix of the lattice from which each layer of the perfect STBC is carved be unitary. In this paper, it is shown that unitariness is not a necessary requirement for energy efficiency in the context of space-time coding with finite input constellations, and an alternative criterion is provided that enables one to obtain full-rate (rate of complex symbols per channel use for an transmit antenna system) STBCs with larger normalized minimum determinants than the perfect STBCs. Further, two such STBCs, one each for 4 and 6 transmit antennas, are presented and they are shown to have larger normalized minimum determinants than the comparable perfect STBCs which hitherto had the best-known normalized minimum determinants.", "paper_title": "Improved Perfect Space-Time Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500010"}
