It is shown that the proposed analysis is able to predict correctly the oscillator's power spectrum also very closely to the fundamental harmonic. The correctness of the analysis is verified through comparisons with commercially available tools.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Phase Diffusion Process in Oscillators Due to White and Colored-Noise Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000295099800014"}
