Because filaments offer a very compact description of fluid flow, real time applications like games or virtual reality are also possible. We present a complete model that includes moving obstacles with vortex shedding, all represented as filaments. Due to variational reconnection the long-time behavior of our method is excellent: Energy and momentum stay constant within reasonable bounds and computational complexity does not increase over time.", "paper_title": "Filament-based smoke with vortex shedding and variational reconnection", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600084"}
