We propose a numerical srategy based on the derivation of a simple, accurate and explicit approximate Riemann solver. The source terms associated with the external forces and the drag force are included in the definition of the Riemann problem, and thus receive an upwind treatment. The objective is to try to preserve, at the numerical level, the asymptotic property of the solutions of the model to behave like the solutions of a drift-flux model with an algebraic closure law when the source terms are stiff. Numerical simulations and comparisons with other strategies are proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
