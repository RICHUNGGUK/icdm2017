In our previous study, the convergence properties of the filter in the non-steady state were clarified; however, its behavior in the steady state was not discussed. Therefore, we develop a distinct analysis technique based on a Markov chain in order to investigate the steady-state properties of the filter. By using the proposed technique, the relationship between step size and coefficient estimation error is revealed.", "paper_title": "Steady-state properties of a CORDIC-based adaptive ARMA lattice filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600042"}
