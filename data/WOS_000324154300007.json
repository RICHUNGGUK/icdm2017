This recently introduced molecular structure descriptor found interesting applications in the study of the heats of formation of alkanes. Let C(pi) and T(pi) denote the sets of connected graphs and trees with degree sequence pi, respectively. Gan et al. [MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 68 (2012)] and Xing et al. [Filomat 26 (2012)] proved that, the so-called greedy tree is a tree with minimal ABC index in T(pi). In this paper we introduce the breadth-first searching graphs (BPS-graphs for short), and prove that, for any degree sequence pi there exists a BFS-graph with minimal ABC index in C(pi). This result is applicable to obtain the minimal value or lower bounds of ABC index of connected graphs.", "paper_title": "On The Minimal ABC Index of Connected Graphs with Given Degree Sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154300007"}
