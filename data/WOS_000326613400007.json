Many run-time data analysis tools can give the most up-to-date knowledge of the system to administrators. However, when troubleshooting a problem in depth, the offline data analysis functionality is necessarily required to get the complete knowledge for system diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a composite tree index structure for the Run-Time Correlation Engine framework to achieve efficient event indexing and searching tasks. The framework has been previously proposed as an automatic tool for easing many run-time data analysis tasks. By integrating the data indexing solution to the framework, we are able to further enhance the tool to perform offline data analysis tasks to provide a more sophisticated monitoring service in the Cloud computing environment.
