Yet this revolution is far from being complete, since, as of today the majority of telephone calls are still originated by circuit-oriented networks. In this paper we present our experience in the real-time monitoring of VoIP calls from a commercial operational network. We discuss and present a methodology and a large dataset of measurements, collected from the FastWeb backbone, which is one of the first worldwide Telecom operators to offer VoIP and high-speed data access to the end-user. Traffic characterization focuses on several layers, concentrating on both end-user and ISP perspectives. In particular, we highlight that, among loss, delay and jitter, only the first index may affect VoIP call quality. Overall, results show that the technology is mature enough to make the final step, allowing the integration of data and real-time services over the Internet.
