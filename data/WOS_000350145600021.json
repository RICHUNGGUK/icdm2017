Our approach specializes in reducing global illumination noise in the presence of depth-of-field effects at very low sampling rates and interactive frame rates. We employ edge-aware filtering in the sample space to locally improve outgoing radiance of each sample. The improved samples are then distributed in the image plane using a fast, linear manifold-based approach supporting very large circles of confusion. We evaluate our filter by applying it to several images containing noise caused by Monte Carlo-simulated global illumination, area light sources and depth of field. We show that our filter can efficiently denoise such images at interactive frame rates on current GPUs and with as few as 4-16 samples per pixel. Our method operates only on the colour and geometric sample information output of the initial rendering process. It does not make any assumptions on the underlying rendering technique and sampling strategy and can therefore be implemented completely as a post-process filter.", "paper_title": "Sample-Based Manifold Filtering for Interactive Global Illumination and Depth of Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145600021"}
