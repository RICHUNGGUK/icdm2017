This article investigates one such problem in which there are k different tasks to be accomplished and each division's performance on each task may be different and represented by a scalar value. In this article we formally introduce this real life decision problem, named as Maximum-Weighted Tree Matching Problem, and propose a genetic algorithm solution to it, and give some experimental results.
