These types of structures are engineered for high performance and are used particularly in industries where low weight and high strength are desired. However, designing these structures can be difficult because they can contain thousands of individual elements. To design mesoscale lattice structures, current synthesis methods generally require some form of rigorous, multi-variable optimisation that can slow or halt the design process. In this article, we present an alternative method for the design of mesoscale lattice structures: the size matching and scaling method. This method eliminates the need for time-consuming optimisation by using a combination of a solid-body finite element analysis and a library of pre-defined lattice configurations to generate a structure's lattice topology. In addition, we explore several methods for determining the best lattice diameter values for the lattice topology. Various 2D and 3D examples will be used to test and validate the method.", "paper_title": "The size matching and scaling method: a synthesis method for the design of mesoscale cellular structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000326352600003"}
