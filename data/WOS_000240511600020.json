The processor consists of a mixed four-quadrant multiplier and a current conveyor that performs the nonlinearity. Schematics, circuit parameters, and a high-level model are shown. The results achieved when applying this processor model to conditioning several sensor types are discussed.", "paper_title": "Analysis and simulation of a mixed-mode neuron architecture for sensor conditioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240511600020"}
