Current foreground detectors learn models from annotated images since the goal is to generate a robust foreground model able to detect changes in all possible scenarios. Unfortunately, manual labelling is very expensive. Most advanced supervised learning techniques based on generic object detection datasets currently exhibit very poor performance when applied to surveillance datasets because of the unconstrained nature of such environments in terms of types and appearances of objects. In this paper, we take advantage of change detection for training multiple foreground detectors in an unsupervised manner. We use statistical learning techniques which exploit the use of latent parameters for selecting the best foreground model parameters for a given scenario. In essence, the main novelty of our proposed approach is to combine the where (motion segmentation) and what (learning procedure) in change detection in an unsupervised way for improving the specificity and generalization power of foreground detectors at the same time. We propose a framework based on latent support vector machines that, given a noisy initialization based on motion cues, learns the correct position, aspect ratio, and appearance of all moving objects in a particular scene. Specificity is achieved by learning the particular change detections of a given scenario, and generalization is guaranteed since our method can be applied to any possible scene and foreground object, as demonstrated in the experimental results outperforming the state-of-the-art.
