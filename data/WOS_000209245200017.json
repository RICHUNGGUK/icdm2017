Digital tuning varactors are used to maintain a low VCO tuning sensitivity (K-VCO) and maximum frequency overlap. The VCO achieves a frequency tuning range (FTR) of 17% at 12 GHz, a phase noise of -106.62 dBc/Hz at 1MHz o r set and consumes 7mW from 1.8V supply.", "paper_title": "A LOW POWER PUSH-PUSH VCO USING MULTI-COUPLED LC TANKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200017"}
