It is based on the use of multivariate spacings as those studied in Janson (Ann. Probab. 15:274-280, 1987). As a novel aspect, this test can be adapted to the case that the support S is unknown, provided that it fulfils the shape condition of lambda-convexity. The consistency properties of this test are analyzed and its performance is checked through a small simulation study. The numerical problems involved in the practical calculation of the maximal spacing (which is required to obtain the test statistic) are also discussed in some detail.", "paper_title": "A multivariate uniformity test for the case of unknown support", "paper_id": "WOS:000297543400018"}
