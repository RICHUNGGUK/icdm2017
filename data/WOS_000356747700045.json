The considered switching regularity is more general that extends the frequently studied dwell-time (DT) and average dwell-time (ADT) switching. The random packet dropouts, which are governed by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence, are considered to exist together for the estimator design of underlying switching neural networks. The desired mode-dependent estimators are designed such that the resulting estimation error system is exponentially mean-square stable and achieves a prescribed H-infinity level of disturbance attenuation. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the developed results are demonstrated through a class of synthetic oscillatory networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
