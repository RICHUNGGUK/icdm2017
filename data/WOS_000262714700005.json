Sports professionals, however, are more interested in tactic analysis to help improve their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract tactic information from the attack events in broadcast soccer video and present the events in a tactic mode to the coaches and sports professionals. We extract the attack events with far-view shots using the analysis and alignment of web-casting text and broadcast video. For a detected event, two tactic representations, aggregate trajectory and play region sequence, are constructed based on multi-object trajectories and field locations in the event shots. Based on the multi-object trajectories tracked in the shot, a weighted graph is constructed via the analysis of temporal-spatial interaction among the players and the ball. Using the Viterbi algorithm, the aggregate trajectory is computed based on the weighted graph. The play region sequence is obtained using the identification of the active field locations in the event based on line detection and competition network. The interactive relationship of aggregate trajectory with the information of play region and the hypothesis testing for trajectory temporal-spatial distribution are employed to discover the tactic patterns in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework. Extensive experiments on FIFA World Cup 2006 show that the proposed approach is highly effective.", "paper_title": "Event Tactic Analysis Based on Broadcast Sports Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000262714700005"}
