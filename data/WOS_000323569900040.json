We show how data bandwidth redundancy and the need to change performance is exploited to achieve power efficient, field programmable gate array realizations with improved sampling rates. A unified methodology is given for the implementation of a key function, the fast Fourier transform, for a Radar-based digital receiver. Locality of data, temporal and spatial resource usage are examined from first principles, leading to an algorithmic approach that demonstrates substantial industrial benefits in terms of power, performance and resource usage. A power saving of 18% is achieved over a Cooley Tukey design with a 100% speed improvement; the work is extended to other cyclical fast algorithms.", "paper_title": "Power Efficient, FPGA Implementations of Transform Algorithms for Radar-Based Digital Receiver Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900040"}
