However, degradation signals are often compounded and contaminated by measurement errors, making data analysis a difficult task. Motivated by the wear problem of magnetic heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs), this paper investigates Wiener processes with measurement errors. We explore the traditional Wiener process with positive drifts compounded with i.i.d. Gaussian noises, and improve its estimation efficiency compared with the existing inference procedure. Furthermore, to capture the possible heterogeneity in a population, we develop a mixed effects model with measurement errors. Statistical inferences of this model are discussed. The mixed effects model subsumes several existing Wiener processes as its limiting cases, and thus it is useful for suggesting an appropriate Wiener process model for a specific dataset. The developed methodologies are then applied to the wear problem of magnetic heads of HDDs, and a light intensity degradation problem of light-emitting diodes.", "paper_title": "Degradation Data Analysis Using Wiener Processes With Measurement Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000327953900003"}
