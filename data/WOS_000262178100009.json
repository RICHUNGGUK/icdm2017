However, the prioritization results in the conventional QFD may be misleading since it does not consider the uncertainty of input information. This paper develops two robustness indices and proposes the notion of robust prioritization that ensures the EC prioritization to be robust against the uncertainty. The robustness indices consider robustness from two perspectives, namely, the absolute ranking of ECs and the priority relationship among ECs. Based oil the two indices, robust prioritization seeks to identify a set of ECs or a priority relationship among ECs in such a way that the result of robust prioritization is stable despite the uncertainty. Finally, the proposed robustness indices and robust prioritization are demonstrated in a case study conducted on the ADSL-based high-speed internet service. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
