An efficient suboptimum algorithm is proposed for selecting a set of users in order to maximize the sum-rate throughput of the system, in a Rayleigh-fading environment. For the asymptotic case when N tends to infinity, the necessary and sufficient conditions in order to achieve the maximum sum-rate throughput, such that the difference between the achievable sum-rate and the maximum value approaches zero, is derived. The complexity of our algorithm is investigated in terms of the required amount of feedback from the-users to the BS, as well as the number of searches required for selecting the users. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of achieving a large portion of the sum-rate capacity, with a very low complexity.", "paper_title": "On the user selection for MIMO broadcast channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200010"}
