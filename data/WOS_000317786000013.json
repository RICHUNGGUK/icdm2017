The approach is based on the algebraic representation of BNs in terms of the semi-tensor product of matrices. Instead of designing the logical dynamic equations of a response BN directly, we first construct its algebraic representation and then convert the algebraic representation back to the logical form. The results are applied to a three-neuron network in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Synchronization Design of Boolean Networks via the Semi-Tensor Product Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000317786000013"}
