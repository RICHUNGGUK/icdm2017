Unlike the linear ICA that only treats one-dimensional data, the proposed GND-ICA treats 'N-dimensional data as a tensor without any preprocess of data vectorization. We furthermore introduce two types of GND-ICA solutions and analyze their efficiency and effectiveness. As an application, the GND-ICA can be used for multiple feature fusion and representation for color image classification. Many, teatimes extracted from a given image are constructed as a tensor. The feature tensor can be effective represented by GND-ICA. Compared with the conventional linear subspace learning methods, GND-ICA is capable of obtaining more distinctive representation for color image classification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
