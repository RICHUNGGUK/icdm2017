The proposed method is compatible with a mass-spring model and makes use of the regular warp-weft structure of the cloth. The visualization parameters for the loops and threads are easily mapped to the animated mass-spring model. The simulation idea underlying both knitted and woven fabrics is similar as we represent both structures in 3D. As the proposed method is simple and practical, we can achieve near real-time rendering performance with good visual quality. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
