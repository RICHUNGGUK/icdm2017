We address the problem of defining what is the control and what is the effect. We then propose a mapping strategy derived from mapping techniques used in sound synthesis. The explicit mapping strategy we developed has two levels and two layers for each level: the first level is the adaptive control with a feature combination layer and a control signal conditioning layer; the second level is the gestural control layer. We give musical examples that illustrate the interest of this strategy.", "paper_title": "Mapping strategies for gestural and adaptive control of digital audio effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000238193200007"}
