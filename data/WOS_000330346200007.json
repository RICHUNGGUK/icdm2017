The purpose of this project was to use goal setting and SmartRoom patient education videos to examine whether the videos more effectively engaged patients and their families in their discharge plan and encouraged them to take a more active role in their care while hospitalized. This study used a descriptive design to analyze the effect of goal setting and patient education videos on patient satisfaction at discharge, hospital average length of stay, and 30-day readmission rate in the orthopedic spine surgical care setting. Comparisons were made among three patient groups. No statistically significant difference was found for average length of stay and 30-day readmission across these three groups. However, patient satisfaction with discharge, as measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems, revealed an increase in five items regarding discharge with statistically significant differences on two of the five items.", "paper_title": "The Influence of Goal Setting and SmartRoom Patient Education Videos on Readmission Rate, Length of Stay, and Patient Satisfaction in the Orthopedic Spine Population", "paper_id": "WOS:000330346200007"}
