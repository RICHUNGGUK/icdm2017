However, the abundance of reviews and their uneven quality make distinguishing between useful and useless reviews difficult for potential customers, thereby diminishing the benefits of online review systems. To address this problem, we develop a semi-supervised system called Online Review Quality Mining (ORQM). Embedded with independent component analysis and semi-supervised ensemble learning, ORQM exploits two opportunities: the improvement of classification performance through the use of a few labeled instances and numerous unlabeled instances, and the effectiveness of the social characteristics of e-commerce communities as identifiers of influential reviewers who write high-quality reviews. Three complementary experiments on datasets from Amazon.com show that ORQM exhibits remarkably higher performance in classifying reviews of different quality levels than do other well-accepted state-of-the-art text mining methods. The high performance of ORQM is also consistent and stable even under limited availability of labeled instances, thereby outperforming other baseline methods. The experiments also reveal that (1) the social features of reviewers are important in deriving better classification results; (2) classification results are affected by product type given the different purchase habits of consumers; and (3) reviews are contingent on the inherent nature of products, such as whether they are search goods or experience goods, and digital products or physical products, through which purchase decisions are influenced.
