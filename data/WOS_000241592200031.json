For example, Ubiquitous Robotic Companion (URC) system should be equipped with powerful resources or be given an aid from the external servers to find its location for itself. Sensor network that consists of inexpensive low-power sensors can provide an efficient solution to find the exact location of such a mobile target at a low price. In such applications, if all sensor nodes have to always wake up to find location of the mobile robot, we have to pay a lot of waste of resources such as battery power and channel utilization. In this paper, we propose a cheap and energy efficient location tracking method of a mobile robot by minimizing the number of sensor nodes participating in the task of target tracking.", "paper_title": "An energy efficient method for tracking mobile ubiquitous robots using wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200031"}
