Choosing a higher threshold voltage (V-th) and/or gate-oxide thickness (T-ox) for cache transistors improves leakage, but impacts cell delay. We show that due to uncorrelated random within die delay variation, only some (not all) of cells actually violate the cache delay after the above change. We propose to add a spare cache way to replace delay-violating cache-lines separately in each cache-set. By SPICE and gate-level simulations in a commercial 90 nm process, we show that choosing higher V-th, T-ox and adding one spare way to a 4-way 16 KB cache reduces leakage power by 42%, which depending on the share of leakage in total cache power, gives up to 22.59% and 41.37% reduction of total energy respectively in L I instruction- and L2 unified-cache with a negligible delay penalty, but without sacrificing cache capacity or timing-yield.", "paper_title": "Way-Scaling to Reduce Power of Cache with Delay Variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800022"}
