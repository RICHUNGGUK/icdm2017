The aim of this study was to capture and analyze the nonlinear characteristics of asthmatic wheezes, reflected in the quadrature phase coupling of their harmonics, as they evolve over time within the breathing cycle. To achieve this, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was combined with third-order statistics/spectra. Wheezes from patients with diagnosed asthma were drawn from a lung sound database and analyzed in the time-bi-frequency domain. The analysis results justified the efficient performance of this combinatory approach to reveal and quantify the evolution of the nonlinearities of wheezes with time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
