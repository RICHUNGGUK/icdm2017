The new hyperchaotic system has two very large positive Lyapunov exponents in a quite wide parameter range through observing the Lyapunov exponents spectra, which indicates that it has very complex nonlinear dynamics. Some simulations of the phase portraits of hyperchaotic attractors are made to show the complicated system orbits. The Poincare section analysis shows that the new system bifurcates and folds simultaneously in several various directions. The frequency spectra are also plotted to show that the system has an extremely broad bandwidth when it is hyperchaotic, which implies that the system has high complexity and randomness, and may have great potential applications in chaos-needed fields such as secure communication and encryption.", "paper_title": "THE MODELING AND SIMULATION OF A CLASS OF HYPERCHAOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900026"}
