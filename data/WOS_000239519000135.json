The developed module would hence offer increased functionality to current prostheses. This novel device required multidisciplinary design in mechanical, electrical, and software areas. The robust integration of these key technical areas ensured a reliable module that allowed converting voluntary muscle contractions from remaining muscles into written characters. The writing module spanned over a specific writing area using a mechanical finger to yield a realistic and feasible design. The electrical implementation involved capturing and processing real time myoelectric signals (EMG). The software section utilized an assembler based algorithm to control the overall device using the processed signals. After processing a serially inputted code, the implemented writing module accurately selected and generated the requested characters with reliable and acceptable printing quality.", "paper_title": "An integrated design for a myoelectrically-based writing module for a controlled prosthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000135"}
