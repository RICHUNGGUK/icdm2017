The model studied has characteristics of discrete events and continuous events coexistence, multistage, multiproduct, uncertainty and large scale. Firstly, the model is transformed into its equivalent fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming model by using the method of Quesada & Grossmann ([5]). Then the fuzzy equivalent model is changed into its crisp MILP model relies on the theory presented by Liu & Iwamura ([12]) for the first time in this area. Finally, the crisp MILP model is solved in LINGO 8.0 based on time discretization. A case study which has 265 continuous variables, 68 binary variables and 318 constraints is effectively solved with the proposed solution approach.", "paper_title": "Chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters for refinery crude oil scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000125"}
