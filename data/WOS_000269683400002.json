As a by-product, we give a new proof of the theorem describing the index of a Sturmian word in terms of the continued fraction expansion of its slope. This theorem was independently proved in [A. Carpi, A. de Luca, Special factors, periodicity, and an application to Sturmian words, Acta Inform. 36 (2000) 983-1006] and [D. Damanik, D. Lenz, The index of Sturmian sequences, European J.
