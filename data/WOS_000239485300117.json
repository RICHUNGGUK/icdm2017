An experimental study on mobile phones is conducted. The concept of consumer oriented design is used to extract the experimental samples as a design database for the numerical analysis. The result of the experiment demonstrates the advantages of using NN models for the product form design. NN models can help product designers understand consumers' perception and translate consumers' feeling of a product into design elements.", "paper_title": "Neural network models for transforming consumer perception into product form design", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300117"}
