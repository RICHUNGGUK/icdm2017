Meanwhile, the use of ID is essential to defend against collusion attack on ABE. Benefiting from privacy homomorphism, by which we distribute the part of the interpolation for the shares abstracted by the hidden attributes into each AA, the performance of the proposed scheme is higher than those of existing ABE schemes.", "paper_title": "Improving User's Privacy for Multi-Authority ABE Using Privacy Homomorphism", "paper_id": "WOS:000320218000008"}
