Following his ideas, we generalize the construction of partial spreads bent functions to partial spreads -bent functions of arbitrary level. Furthermore, we show how these partial spreads -bent functions give rise to a new construction of (classical) bent functions. Further, we construct a bent function on 8 variables which is inequivalent to all Maiorana-McFarland as well as PS (ap) type bents. It is also shown that all bent functions on 6 variables, up to equivalence, can be obtained by our construction.", "paper_title": "A new construction of bent functions based on Z-bent functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200017"}
