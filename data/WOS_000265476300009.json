Our method is applicable to different types of tumors. First, the brain is segmented using a new approach, robust to the presence of tumors. Then a first tumor detection is performed, based on selecting asymmetric areas with respect to the approximate brain symmetry plane and fuzzy classification. Its result constitutes the initialization of a segmentation method based on a combination of a deformable model and spatial relations, leading to a precise segmentation of the tumors. Imprecision and variability are taken into account at all levels, using appropriate fuzzy models. The results obtained on different types of tumors have been evaluated by comparison with manual segmentations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
