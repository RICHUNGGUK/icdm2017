As two examples, a fourth-order bandpass filter (BPF) operating at 1 GHz with a size of 0.078 lambda(g) x 0.062 lambda(g) and a miniaturized diplexer operating at 0.9/1.57 GHz with a size of 0.054 lambda(0) x 0.086 lambda(0) are designed based on the proposed SSIR. The fabricated BPF exhibits a high selectivity and a wide -30 dB rejection upper stopband from 1.13 f(0) to 6.52 f(0), while the fabricated diplexer has up to -60 dB output isolation.
