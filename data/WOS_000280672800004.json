We arrange this approach into a formal rewriting system R and provide a new version of Massey's argument. Moreover, we study the computational properties of two subsystems of R: R(or) for dealing with words denoting orientable surfaces and R(nor) for dealing with words denoting non-orientable surfaces. We show how such properties induce an alternative proof for the surface classification in which the basic homeomorphism between the connected sum of three projective planes and the connected sum of a torus with a projective plane is not required.", "paper_title": "Rewriting systems for the surface classification theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000280672800004"}
