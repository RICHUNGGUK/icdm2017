The ICNN model can characterize complicated dynamics behavior. It possesses the sensitivity to the initial load value and to the walking of the whole chaotic track. The input dimension of ICNN is decided using PSRT, and the training samples are formed by means of the stepping dynamic space track on the basis of the DONP. So it can improve associative memory and generalization ability of ICNN model. The testing results show that proposed model and algorithm can enhance effectively the precision of STLF and its stability.", "paper_title": "A new modeling approach of STLF with integrated dynamics mechanism and based on the fusion of dynamic optimal neighbor phase points and ICNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000123"}
