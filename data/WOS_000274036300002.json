However, due mainly to concerns of external validity, questions have been raised about the value of these types of studies. The authors of this paper draw on their experiences of conducting a large number of empirical studies in university courses in three countries (Italy, Norway, and the United States) to address this important issue. This paper first identifies the requirements that research and pedagogy place on a valid empirical study with students. This information is then used as the basis for a checklist that provides guidance for researchers and educators when planning and conducting studies in university courses. The goal of this checklist is to help ensure that these studies have as much research and pedagogical value as possible. Finally, an example application of the checklist is provided to illustrate its use.", "paper_title": "A checklist for integrating student empirical studies with research and teaching goals", "paper_id": "WOS:000274036300002"}
