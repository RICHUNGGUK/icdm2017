The typical methods realize the color correction mainly in the spatial domain of RGB color space. In this paper, a linear color correction method in JPEG/MPEG-2 compressed domain is proposed. The correction is realized in the DCT domain of YUV color space without full-frame decompression. Experimental results show that the visual quality of the corrected images/videos in the compressed domain is identical to the quality of the images/videos corrected in the uncompressed domain.", "paper_title": "A linear color correction method for compressed images and videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000241296100013"}
