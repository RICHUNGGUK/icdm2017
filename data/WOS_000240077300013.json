A sequence -x(1),..., -x(n) is called an inversion of x(1),..., x(n). In this paper, we investigate the size of a negation-limited circuit, which is a Boolean circuit with a limited number of NOT gates, that sorts or inverts k-tonic input sequences. We show that if k=O(1) and t=O (log log n), a k-tonic sequence of length n can be sorted by a circuit with t NOT gates whose size is O((nlogn)/2(ct)) where c > 0 is some constant. This generalizes a similar upper bound for merging by Amano, Maruoka and Tarui [4], which corresponds to the case k=2. We also show that a k-tonic sequence of length n can be inverted by a circuit with O(k log n) NOT gates whose size is O(kn) and depth is O(k log 2 n). This reduces the size of the negation-limited inverter of size O(n log n) by Beals, Nishino and Tanaka [6] when k = o(log(2)n). If k = O(1), our inverter has size O(n) and depth O(log2n) and contains O(log n) NOT gates. For this case, the size and the number of NOT gates are optimal up to a constant factor.", "paper_title": "On the negation-limited circuit complexity of sorting and inverting k-tonic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300013"}
