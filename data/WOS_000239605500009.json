This model uses the concept of artificially generated negative data to form closed decision boundaries using a multilayer perceptron. The neural network output is novelty filtered by thresholding the output of multiple networks (one per known class) to which the sample is input and clustered for determining which clusters represent novel classes. After labeling these novel clusters, new networks are trained on this data. We perform experiments with video-based image sequence data containing a number of novel classes. The performance of the novelty filter is evaluated using two performance metrics and we compare our proposed model on the basis of these with five baseline novelty detectors. We also discuss the results of retraining each model after novelty detection. On the basis of Chi-square performance metric, we prove at 5 percent significance level that our optimized novelty detector performs at the same level as an ideal novelty detector that does not make any mistakes.", "paper_title": "A neural network-based novelty detector for image sequence analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239605500009"}
