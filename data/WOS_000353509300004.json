M1 and contact layers, which are usually deployed within standard cells, are the most critical and complex parts for modern digital designs. Traditional design flow that ignores TPL in early stages may limit the potential to resolve all the TPL conflicts. In this paper, we propose a coherent framework, including standard cell compliance and detailed placement, to enable TPL friendly design. Considering TPL constraints during early design stages, such as standard cell compliance, improves the layout decomposability. With the precoloring solutions of standard cells, we present a TPL aware detailed placement where the layout decomposition and placement can be resolved simultaneously. In addition, we propose a linear dynamic programming to solve TPL aware detailed placement with maximum displacement, which can achieve good trade-off in terms of runtime and performance. Experimental results show that our framework can achieve zero conflict, meanwhile can effectively optimize the stitch number and placement wire-length.", "paper_title": "Methodology for Standard Cell Compliance and Detailed Placement for Triple Patterning Lithography", "paper_id": "WOS:000353509300004"}
