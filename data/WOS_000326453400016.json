The ADC resolution is enhanced by using a noise-shaping technique which does not need any integrator and only uses a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. To provide a first-order noise-shaping, the quantization error is firstly extracted by using the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) dummy capacitor and it is then employed in the error feedback scheme. The proposed structure employs a low-gain and low-swing operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) to realize the FIR filter which operates only at the sampling phase. To minimize the power consumption of the ADC analog part, the OTA is powered off during the conversion phase. The proposed ADC is designed and simulated in a 90 nm CMOS technology using Spectre with a 0.5 V single power supply. The simulated ADC uses a fully-differential 8-bit charge redistribution DAC with an oversampling ratio of 8 and achieves 10.7-bit accuracy. The simulated average power consumption is 4.53 mu W and the achieved maximum SNDR and SFDR are 66.1 and 73.1 dB, respectively, resulting in a figure of merit of 27.6 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "A noise-shaping SAR ADC for energy limited applications in 90 nm CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400016"}
