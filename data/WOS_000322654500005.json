In this work, we present a Bayesian algorithm based on the principle of progressive correction for the latter choice of a discrete multicomponent model. We demonstrate in application to simulated data and two experimental datasets that our Bayesian approach provides robust and accurate estimates of both the T-2 model parameters and nonideal flip angles. The second contribution of the paper is to present a Cramer-Rao analysis of T-2 component width estimators. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious parametric and continuous model based on a mixture of inverse-gamma distributions. This analysis supports the notion that T-2 spread is difficult, if not infeasible, to estimate from relaxometry data acquired with a typical clinical paradigm. These results justify the use of the discrete distribution model.", "paper_title": "Modelling and Estimation of Multicomponent T-2 Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000322654500005"}
