In particular, we derive a single-letter expression for the largest, universally achievable fraction xi of the optimum error exponent pertaining to the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. Moreover, a simpler single-letter expression for a lower bound to is presented. To demonstrate the tightness of this lower bound, we use it to show that xi= 1, for the binary symmetric channel (BSC), when the random coding distribution is uniform over: i) all codes (of a given rate), and ii) all linear codes, in agreement with well-known results. We also show that xi = 1 for the uniform ensemble of systematic linear codes, and for that of time-varying convolutional codes in the bit-error-rate sense. For the latter case, we also derive the corresponding universal decoder explicitly and show how it can be efficiently implemented using a slightly modified version of the Viterbi algorithm which employs two trellises.", "paper_title": "Exact Characterization of the Minimax Loss in Error Exponents of Universal Decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200002"}
