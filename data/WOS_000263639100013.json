This approach is developed via Lyapunov stability and inverse optimality, which circumvents the task of solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of a nonlinear H(infinity) control design for a class of dynamic neural network systems, which are usually used in the modeling and control of nonlinear affine systems with unknown nonlinearities. The proposed H(infinity) control design achieves global inverse optimality with respect to some meaningful cost functional, global disturbance attenuation, and global asymptotic stability provided that no disturbance occurs. Finally, four numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Global Robust Stabilizing Control for a Dynamic Neural Network System", "paper_id": "WOS:000263639100013"}
