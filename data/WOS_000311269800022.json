Design/methodology/approach - The design of high speed permanent magnet motor (HSPM) with core made of SMC has been proposed. The governing information about SMC has been presented. The possible advantages and disadvantages of applying magnetic powder materials in the design of electrical machines have been studied. To solve the partial differential equations describing magnetic vector distribution in considered HSPM, the edge element method (EEM) has been applied. The formulas of permanent magnet and winding descriptions, and electromagnetic torque calculations have been presented and studied. To verify accuracy of methodology and functionality of the elaborated software, a prototype of the considered motor has been built and the experimental setup for testing torque and electromotive force has been elaborated. The comparison between measured and simulated motor characteristics have been presented and discussed. Findings - Comparison between measured and simulated motor characteristics proves the model accuracy. The obtained results show that the designed HSPM motor has sinusoidal electromotive force waveforms, low cogging torque value and the sinusoidal torque versus rotor angle characteristics. Moreover, it has been indicated that the application of SMC materials can reduce power losses in the high speed motors. Originality/value - The paper describes the development of the numerical method and software for analysis of HSPM with core made of powder materials.", "paper_title": "Analysis of high speed permanent magnet motor with powder core material", "paper_id": "WOS:000311269800022"}
