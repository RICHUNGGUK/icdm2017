The main result of the paper settles an important open question: There exist no non-trivial examples with t = 7 (or larger). The proof is based on the classification of the finite 3-homogeneous permutation groups, itself relying on the finite simple group classification.", "paper_title": "On the existence of block-transitive combinatorial designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275862300002"}
