A multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) model with soft time-windows for multiple environmental vehicle types is presented, and a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is designed. Based on the experiments, the effectiveness of the algorithm is examined. With Pareto analysis, the relationship among the three objectives (distribution cost, customer satisfaction and environmental pollution) is examined. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the influence of different type vehicle on the environmental performance. The results shows that the vehicle speed has strong correlation with the operation cost and environmental pollution, while the load capacity affects the operation cost, customer satisfaction and environmental pollution.
