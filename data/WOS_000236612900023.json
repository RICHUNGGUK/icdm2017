The LCB-DWH is an effort towards a complete system for storage (using the BASE system), analysis and publication of microarray data. Important features of the system include: access to established methods within R/Bioconductor for data analysis, built-in connection to the Gene Ontology database and a scripting facility for automatic recording and re-play of all the steps of the analysis. The service is up and running on a high performance server. At present there are more than 150 registered users.", "paper_title": "The LCB Data Warehouse", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612900023"}
