This approach allows the nonlinear effects arising from the soil-pile interaction to be properly accounted for. In particular, the occurrence of plastic strains in the soil, concrete cracking and steel yielding in the pile as well as the occurrence of slip and gap at the soil-pile interface are reliably simulated using appropriate constitutive models. Another advantage of the present method is that it requires few material parameters as input data. In addition, these parameters can be readily obtained from conventional geotechnical and structural tests. The proposed approach is used to analyse the results from some loading tests documented in the literature concerning a large-diameter pile and a large-section rectangular pile (barrette) embedded in sandy soils. The theoretical results from these analyses are found to be in fairly good agreement with the experimental measurements available from the loading tests. Remarks of practical interest on the response of the structures considered to horizontal loading are also made. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
