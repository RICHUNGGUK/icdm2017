Lately, security SLAs have also received much attention to guarantee security in a user perspective and provide optimal and efficient security service in the security paradigm shifting by cloud computing, such as security as a service. The quantitative measurement of security metrics is a considerably difficult problem and might be considered one of the multi-dimensional aspects of security threats. To address these issues, we provide a novel cooperative security-SLA evaluation model for the personal cloud service environment including a multi-dimensional approach to analyze security threats depending on services type as well as a cooperative model to reach a general consensus of priorities, that is, indicators depending on services type and security metrics based on cloud brokers.
