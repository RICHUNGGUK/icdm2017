Because the levels and relative proportion of hER alpha and hER beta differ significantly in different target cells, selective hER ligands could target specific tissues or pathways regulated by one receptor subtype without affecting the other. To understand the structural and chemical basis by which small molecule modulators are able to discriminate between the two subtypes, we have applied three-dimensional target-based approaches employing a series of potent hER-ligands. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) studies were applied to a data set of 81 hER modulators, for which binding affinity values were collected for both hER alpha and hER beta. Significant statistical coefficients were obtained (hER alpha, q(2) = 0.76; hER beta, q(2) = 0.70), indicating the internal consistency of the models. The generated models were validated using external test sets, and the predicted values were in good agreement with the experimental results. Five hER crystal structures were used in GRID/PCA investigations to generate molecular interaction fields (MIF) maps. hER alpha and hER beta were separated using one factor. The resulting 3D information was integrated with the aim of revealing the most relevant structural features involved in hER subtype selectivity. The final QSAR and GRID/PCA models and the information gathered from 3D contour maps should be useful for the design or novel hER modulators with improved selectivity.", "paper_title": "Structure-Based Approach for the Study of Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinity and Subtype Selectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000261103700014"}
