The proposed key recovery mechanism offers a \"backdoor\" for an authorized agency to monitor suspected communications while protecting legal users from unauthorized disclosure of their data privacy. All the features form a unitary security scheme with monitoring service. The performance analysis shows that our scheme has a low-computational complexity and it can be practically deployed on contemporary mobile devices.
