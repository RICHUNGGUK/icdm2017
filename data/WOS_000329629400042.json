Consensus errors of individual agents are considered as the anticipation in time, based on which a distributed iterative learning protocol is proposed for the undirected networks with fixed topology to make the followers track the leader in finite time. The dynamic of the leader is assumed to be time-varying and the state information is available to only a portion of the followers. The sufficient condition for solving the consensus problem of the multi-agent system is obtained. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Iterative Consensus for a Class of Second-order Multi-agent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400042"}
