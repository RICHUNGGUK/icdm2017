The method determines the viewshed by analyzing the geometric relationship between the target points and viewpoint. It differentiates the visibility of the target points by the elevation information. Eventually the visual results related to the given viewpoint are rendered on three-dimensional landscapes. The visibility of some target points is computed by comparing their elevations with the viewpoint's height, thus is able to enhance the efficiency of the visibility analysis. This method can not only be applied in the visibility analysis of forest scenes, but also used in the analysis of the urban environment. Experiments show that the proposed method results in high efficiency and precision.", "paper_title": "An improved line-of-sight method for visibility analysis in 3D complex landscapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900003"}
