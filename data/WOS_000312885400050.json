The system creates chemical signatures which are matched to a library of known chemicals, allowing the positive identification of hazardous substances. The performance of the system is tested against a publicly available mass-spectrometry dataset, against which it has previously been demonstrated as an effective anomaly detection algorithm. An autonomous chemical-detection device is then discussed, in which the algorithm is running on hardware embedded in a Pioneer robot carrying a portable chemical agent monitor.", "paper_title": "Chemical Detection Using the Receptor Density Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000312885400050"}
