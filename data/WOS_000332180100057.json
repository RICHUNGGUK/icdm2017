The results showed that, the anomeric stereochemistry or the axial/equatorial orientation of C1-O1 (alpha/beta) is an important factor controlling the area and d-spacing of glycolipid bilayer systems in the thermotropic phase. The head group tilt angle and the chain ordering properties are affected by the anomeric effect. In addition, the LC phase of beta-C8Gal, is tilting less compared to those in the fluid L?. The stereochemistry of the C4- epimeric (axial/equatorial) and anomeric (alpha/beta) centers simultaneously influence the inter-molecular hydrogen bond. Thus, the trend in the values of the hydrogen bond for these glycosides is beta-C8Gal>alpha-C8Glc>beta-C8Glc>alpha-C8Gal. The four bilayer systems showed anomalous diffusion behavior with an observed trend for the diffusion coefficients; and this trend is beta-C8Gal>beta-C8Glc>alpha C8Gal>alpha-C8Glc. The \"bent\" configuration of the ?-anomer results in an increase of the hydrophobic area, chain vibration and chain disorganization. Since thermal energy is dispensed more entropically for the chain region, the overall molecular diffusion decreases.", "paper_title": "Atomistic simulation studies of the alpha/beta glucoside and galactoside in anhydrous bilayers: effect of the anomeric and epimeric configurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332180100057"}
