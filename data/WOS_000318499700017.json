A self-biased inverter is used as a preamplifier stage to provide a 50 %-duty-cycle square wave to drive the class-E PA. The design (PA with the preamplifier), which is fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, achieves 40.2 % drain efficiency while output power is 14.7 dBm at 433 MHz under 1.2-V supply, as demonstrated by the experimental results.", "paper_title": "A class-E power amplifier for wireless biomedical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700017"}
