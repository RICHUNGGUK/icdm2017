It is shown that the use of the aforementioned Lyapunov function leads to less-pessimistic solutions. The usefulness of the new control law is shown through several examples.", "paper_title": "Control Law Proposition for the Stabilization of Discrete Takagi-Sugeno Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000266677000019"}
