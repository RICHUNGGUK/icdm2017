The L1VPN hose model is an elegant and flexible way to specify the customers' bandwidth requirements, by defining the total incoming and outgoing demand for each endpoint. Furthermore, multi-domain physical infrastructures are common in L1VPNs, since these are usually deployed on a global scale. Thus, high-performance Routing for Multi-domain VPN Provisioning (RMVP) for the hose model is an important problem to efficiently support a global virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we formulate the RMVP problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Also, we propose a Top-Down Routing (TDR) strategy to compute the optimal routing for the hose model L1VPN in a multi-domain backbone network. Results indicate that TDR approaches the minimum routing cost when compared to the ideal case of single-domain routing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
