A plane mechanism with five heavy links (body, two shins and two thighs) and attached weightless feet and weightless crutch is used as the mathematical model. By the crutch, we mean the crutch itself with the arm holding it. The gait in which the crutches execute synchronous motion is considered; for this reason, both crutches are considered as a single crutch. The links of the mechanism and the crutch are assumed to be absolutely solid bodies. Using a motion capture system, the trajectories of a healthy individual and the crutches are registered. Using these trajectories, variations of the angles in the individual's joints as functions of time and their first and second derivatives are obtained. Using force platforms, the support reactions applied to the individual's feet and the coordinates where these forces are applied are found. By solving the inverse dynamics problem, the torques developed at the joints and creating power torques are found. They can be used for choosing actuators for the joints of medical exoskeletons. The interjoint angles obtained experimentally can be used as tracked programmed trajectories for the organization of the motion of a medical exoskeleton put on a paraplegic. The overdetermined systems of equations arising in the inverse dynamics problem are solved using the least squares method.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modeling of crutch walking", "paper_id": "WOS:000352821700013"}
