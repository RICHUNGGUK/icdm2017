Results: Inside the epidermis, the differentiation state of individual keratinocytes is correlated with their respective distance from the connective tissue. We here present a novel method to profile this correlation for multiple epithelial protein biomarkers in the form of quantitative spatial profiles. Profiles were computed by applying image processing algorithms to histological sections stained with tri-color indirect immunofluorescence. From the quantitative spatial profiles, reflecting the spatiotemporal changes of protein expression during cellular differentiation, graphs of protein networks were reconstructed. Conclusion: Spatiotemporal networks can be used as a means for comparing and interpreting quantitative spatial protein expression profiles obtained from different tissue samples. In combination with automated microscopes, our new method supports the large-scale systems biological analysis of stratified epithelial tissues.", "paper_title": "Reconstructing protein networks of epithelial differentiation from histological sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000251334800013"}
