Parasitic mismatch induced by layout will affect circuit performance significantly for analog designs. Consideration of symmetry and common centroid constraints during placement can help to reduce these errors. Besides these two specific types of placement constraints, other constraints, such as alignment, abutment, preplace, and maximum separation, are also essential in circuit placement. In this paper, we will present a placement methodology that can handle all these constraints at the same time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that can handle symmetry constraint, common centroid constraint, and other general placement constraints, simultaneously. Experimental results do confirm the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in solving this mixed constraint-driven placement problem.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Handling of Symmetry, Common Centroid, and General Placement Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000285517100008"}
