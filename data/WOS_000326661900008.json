The available localization schemes using passive RFID systems do not consider the scanning delay which may cause location estimation error, especially when the robot moves at a high speed. In this paper, a new Non-Blocking scanning (reading) scheme is proposed to avoid collisions so that the scanning delay, and consequently the localization error, can be reduced. This scheme avoids collisions among tag replies by assigning tag IDs based on the FCA coloring scheme. Theoretical and simulation studies indicate that the new Non-Blocking scheme combined with the new tag arrangement pattern can achieve a good RFID localization performance in terms of both estimation error and scanning delay with reduction of tag/reader required complexities.
