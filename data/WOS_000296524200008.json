We propose an approach for the definition of a function P-S, for any set of scientific articles S, which reflects global properties of the citation network associated to S. Such a function, that we propose as a measure of the impact of scientific papers, is constructed as solution of an iterated system of Perron-eigenvalue problems. We discuss differences with previously defined measures, in particular of the PageRank type. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
