This scheme is an adaptation of the one developed by Sasoglu et al. for the multiple access channel (MAC) to the MDC setting. The analysis of the proposed scheme contains two new ingredients: 1) a certain MDC-MAC duality and 2) an auxiliary random process that involves both the mutual information and the Bhattacharyya parameter. The decorrelation effect of the polar transform is also investigated.", "paper_title": "Polar Codes for Multiple Descriptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400010"}
