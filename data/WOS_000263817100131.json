First, we present a new method for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers. The proposed method considers the defuzzified values, the heights and the spreads for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers. Based on the proposed method for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers, we propose a fuzzy risk analysis algorithm to deal with fuzzy risk analysis problems. The proposed method provides a useful way for handling the fuzzy risk analysis problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
