There are various criteria of simplicity for universal Turing machines. Probably the most popular one is to count the number of states/symbols. This criterion is more complex than it may appear at a first glance. In this note we propose three new criteria of simplicity for universal prefix-free Turing machines. These criteria refer to the possibility of proving various natural properties of such a machine (its universality, for example) in a formal theory, Peano arithmetic or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. In all cases some, but not all, machines are simple. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
