An optimal transistor sizing is established for the proposed 9T SRAM cell by considering stability, energy consumption, and write-ability. As a complementary hardware solution at array-level, a novel write bitline balancing technique is proposed to reduce the leakage current. By optimizing its size and employing the proposed write circuit technique, 33% power dissipation saving is achieved in memory array operation compared with the conventional 6T SRAM based design. A new metric that comprehensively captures all of these figures of merit (and denoted to as SPR) is also proposed; under this metric, the proposed 9T SRAM cell is shown to be superior to all other cell configurations found in the technical literatures. The impact of the process variations on the cell design is investigated in detail. HSPICE simulation shows that the 91 SRAM cell demonstrates an excellent tolerance to process variations comparing with the conventional SRAM cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
