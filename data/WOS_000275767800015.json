Our engine is also indirectly designed to solve common problems in existing neurogenetic implementations. The proposed DANGLE consists of a gene regulatory engine (GRE) and a high performance distributed adaptive neural network (DANN) Our experiments show that DANGLE performs better than EFuNN and is a powerful tool for lattice analysis of cubic structure identification.", "paper_title": "A DISTRIBUTED AUTONOMOUS NEURO-GEN LEARNING ENGINE AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE LATTICE ANALYSIS OF CUBIC STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800015"}
