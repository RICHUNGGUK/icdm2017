A transducer model is introduced to compare tree languages (schemas) with different alphabets and attributes. Using the statistical embedding of Fischer et al. (Proceedings of 21st IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 421-430, 2006), we show that Source-Consistency and Approximate Query Answering are testable on words and trees, i.e. can be approximately decided within epsilon by only looking at a constant fraction of the input.", "paper_title": "Approximate schemas, source-consistency and query answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000258961400003"}
