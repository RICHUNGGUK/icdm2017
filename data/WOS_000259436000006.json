Specific rules that explicitly refer to exceptions of more general default rules can then be handled in a non-monotonic setting. However, there is no assessment of the certainty with which the conclusion of a default rule holds when it applies. We propose a formalism in which uncertain default rules can be expressed, but still preserving the distinction between the defeasibility and uncertainty semantics by means of a two steps processing. Possibility theory is used for representing both uncertainty and defeasibility. The approach is illustrated in persistence modeling problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
