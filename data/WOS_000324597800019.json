The emphasis here is on evaluating performance using real clinical computed tomography (CT) data with comparisons made to an objective ground truth acquired using micro-CT. In this paper, we show that the application of conventional active contour methods to small objects leads to non-optimal results because of the inherent properties of the energy terms and their interactions with one another. We show that the blind use of a gradient magnitude based energy performs poorly at these object scales and that the point spread function (PSF) is a critical factor that needs to be accounted for. We propose a new model that augments the external energy with prior knowledge by incorporating the PSF and the assumption of reasonably constant underlying CT numbers.", "paper_title": "Augmented Active Surface Model for the Recovery of Small Structures in CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800019"}
