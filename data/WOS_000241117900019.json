On the other hand a notion of compatible topologies on graphs has emerged from digital topology (see [A. Bretto, Comparability graphs and digital topology, Comput. Vision Graphic Image Process.

In this article we study GI front the topological point of view. Firstly, we explore the poset of compatible topologies on graphs and in particular on bipartite graphs. Then, from a graph we construct a particular compatible Alexandroff topological space said homeomorphic-equivalent to the graph. Conversely, from any Alexandroff topology we construct an isomorphic-equivalent graph on which the topology is compatible. Finally, using these constructions, we show that GI is polynomial-time equivalent to the topological homeomorphism problem (TopHomeo). Hence GI and TopHomeo are in the same class of complexity.
