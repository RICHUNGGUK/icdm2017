This paper presents a novel concept: a BCI-simulator, which has been developed for the Hex-O-Spell interface, using the sensory motor rhythms (SMR) paradigm. With the simulator, it is possible to evaluate how the model parameters such as error classifications, delay between classifications and success rate affect the communication rate. Another advantage of the simulator is that it allows us to study for more classes than most online BCI systems which are limited to only two classes. Results show that the BCI simulator is able to give a deeper understanding of the feedback systems. We also find that a 3-class system is more efficient than a 2-class system if it obtains a success rate of at least 55% of the 2-class system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
