We show that TFMs are able to achieve decoding performance similar to that of the previous re-randomization methods in the literature (i.e., edge memories), but they exhibit much lower hardware complexity. We then present circuit topologies for analog implementation of TFMs.", "paper_title": "Tracking Forecast Memories for Stochastic Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000289166100010"}
