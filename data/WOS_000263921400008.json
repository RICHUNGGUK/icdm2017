Most research has been used North Americans as subjects. For this reason, we interviewed European educators from diverse cultures; in particularly, we analysed the cultural differences and their moderating effects on acceptance-based relationships between European universities: European Nordic culture in contrast to European-Mediterranean culture. The empirical results provided strong support for the hypotheses. Cultural differences have a significant impact on attitudes and behaviours towards using Web-based applications. The Nordic culture is driven more by instrumental factors and intrinsic enjoyment-based factors. On the other hand, the PSG-Mediterranean culture (Portugal, Spain and Greece) seems to regard the Web more as a means to a social end. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
