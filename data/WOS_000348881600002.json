It has a plastic shelf for carrying the micro-robots, and four actuating units for movement. Each unit is composed of a water-jet propeller and two servomotors, each of which can rotate 90 in the horizontal and vertical directions. The robot is capable of motion on land, as well as underwater. The robot is capable of three walking gaits; therefore, we describe experiments on various terrains to evaluate the walking motion performance, including stability and velocity. Additionally, plenty of underwater experiments are conducted to evaluate the underwater performance, containing horizontal and vertical motions, and to verify the fixture and deployment mechanism for the micro-robot.
