Despite the simplicity of the models involved, the characterization of this entropy is a long standing open problem. By presenting the probability of a sequence under the model as a product of random matrices, one can see that the entropy rate sought is equal to a top Lyapunov exponent of the product. This offers an explanation for the elusiveness of explicit expressions for the HMP entropy rate, as Lyapunov exponents are notoriously difficult to compute. Consequently, we focus on asymptotic estimates, and apply the same product of random matrices to derive an explicit expression for a Taylor approximation of the entropy rate with respect to the parameter of the binary symmetric channel. The accuracy of the approximation is validated against empirical simulation results. We also extend our results to higher-order Markov processes and to Renyi entropies of any order.
