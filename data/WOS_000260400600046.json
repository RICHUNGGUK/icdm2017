Our method describes arithmetic circuits directly with high-level mathematical objects based on weighted number systems and arithmetic formulae. Such circuit description call be effectively verified by polynomial reduction techniques using Grobner Bases. In this paper, we describe how the symbolic computer algebra can be used to describe and verify arithmetic circuits. The advantageous effects of the proposed approach are demonstrated through experimental verification of some arithmetic circuits such as multiply-accumulator and FIR filter. The result shows that the proposed approach has a definite possibility of verifying practical arithmetic circuits.", "paper_title": "Arithmetic Circuit Verification Based on Symbolic Computer Algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600046"}
