Many other variants of a proportional removal operation have been considered in the literature and a characterization of removal operations that preserve regularity is known. We consider the nondeterministic state complexity of the operation 1/2 (L) and, more generally, of polynomial removals as defined by Domaratzki (J. Automata, Languages and Combinatorics 7(4), 2002). We give an O (n(2)) upper bound for the nondeterministic state complexity of polynomial removals and a matching lower bound in cases where the polynomial is a sum of a monomial and a constant, or when the polynomial has rational roots.", "paper_title": "NONDETERMINISTIC STATE COMPLEXITY OF PROPORTIONAL REMOVALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000348030000003"}
