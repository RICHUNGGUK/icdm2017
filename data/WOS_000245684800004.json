We use the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to construct the singularly perturbed fuzzy (SPF) systems. The corresponding fuzzy slow and fast subsystems of the original SPF system are also obtained. At first, a set of common positive-define matrices and the controller gains are determined by the Lyapunov stability theorem and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Then, a sufficient condition is derived for the robust stabilization of NSP systems. The composite fuzzy control will stabilize the original NSP systems for all epsilon is an element of (0, epsilon*) and the allowable perturbation bound epsilon* can be determined via some algebra inequalities. A practice example is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Composite fuzzy control of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800004"}
