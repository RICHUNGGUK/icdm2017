For the MULTICUT ON TREES problem, we present a parameterized algorithm that runs in time O*(rho(k)), where rho = root root 2 + 1 < 1.554 is the positive root of the polynomial x(4) - 2x(2) - 1. This improves the current-best algorithm of Chen et al. that runs in time O*(1.619(k)). For the GENERALIZED MULTIWAY CUT ON TREES problem, we show that this problem is solvable in polynomial time if the number of terminal sets is fixed; this answers an open question posed in a recent paper by Liu and Zhang. By reducing the GENERALIZED MULTIWAY CUT ON TREES problem to the MULTICUT ON TREES problem, our results give a parameterized algorithm that solves the GENERALIZED MULTIWAY CUT ON TREES problem in time O*(rho(k)).
