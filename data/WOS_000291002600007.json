Two computational models are deduced in this paper: one is the perspective transformation model, through which an image is transformed perspectively from downward-looking state to forward-looking state; the other is the indirect location model, through which the position of a building is computed in an FLIR image. In addition, in order to illustrate the application scope of our method, the error analysis is presented. The proposed approach is validated by extensive experiments, with images taken in different weather conditions, seasons and at different times. Superior recognition results were obtained on three FLIR image sequences we collected.", "paper_title": "BUILDING RECOGNITION BASED ON INDIRECT LOCATION OF PLANAR LANDMARK IN FLIR IMAGE SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000291002600007"}
