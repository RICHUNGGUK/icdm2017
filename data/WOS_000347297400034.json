This paper aims to analyse the effect of collaboration (co-authorship) on the scientific output of Italian economists. We use social network analysis to investigate the structure of co-authorship, and econometric analysis to explain the productivity of individual Italian economists, in terms of 'attributional' variables (such as age, gender, academic position, tenure, scientific sub-discipline, geographical location), 'relational' variables (such as propensity to cooperate and the stability of cooperation patterns) and 'positional' variables (such as betweenness and closeness centrality indexes and clustering coefficients).", "paper_title": "The strength of strong ties: How co-authorship affect productivity of academic economists?", "paper_id": "WOS:000347297400034"}
