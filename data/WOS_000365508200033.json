The inverter is implemented using a single boost switch, an H-bridge inverter, and a CL output filter. The inverter output current is simply controlled using the boost switch and open-loop or feedforward control. The dark I-V configuration is used to simulate two series PV modules. Comprehensive test results are obtained to validate the computer simulation results. Furthermore, the proposed inverter's ability to deliver a sinusoidal current to the grid while meeting the appropriate standards, i.e. total harmonic distortion and power factor requirements, is also examined for various modulation index values and irradiances.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of a low-cost current-source 1-ph grid-connected PV inverter", "paper_id": "WOS:000365508200033"}
