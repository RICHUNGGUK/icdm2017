Because the naive Bayes classifier prefers to dealing with discrete values, an novel discretization approach is proposed to improve naive Bayes classifier and enhance decision accuracy in this paper. Based on the statistical information of the naive Bayes classifier, a distributional index is defined in the new discretization approach. The distributional index can be applied to find a good solution for discretization of continuous attributes so that the naive Bayes classifier can reach high decision accuracy for instance information systems with continuous attributes. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the naive Bayes classifier with the new discretizer can reach higher accuracy than the C5.0 tree.", "paper_title": "Improvement of decision accuracy using discretization of continuous attributes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000081"}
