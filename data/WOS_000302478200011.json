We take full advantage of the existing duality (cites-is cited by) in a citation network. Although algebraic aspects are emphasized, a first step towards their interpretation is attempted. Examples of their calculation and of future applications are provided.", "paper_title": "Structural indicators in citation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302478200011"}
