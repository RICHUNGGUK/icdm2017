Prototype-based rules are an interesting alternative providing in many cases simpler, more accurate and more comprehensible description of the data. Algorithm for generation of threshold prototype-based rules are described and a comparison with neurofuzzy systems on a number of datasets provided. Results show that systems for data understanding generating prototypes deserve at least the same attention as that enjoyed by the neurofuzzy systems.", "paper_title": "Prototype-based threshold rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000113"}
