This project explores the possibilities of using interactive toys and social interaction in encouraging children to become more physically active. To arrive at the final concept, research was conducted into the factors that encourage and discourage physically active play in children. Based on that knowledge, four key elements were used to develop the product: fantasy, social interaction, surmounting physical and cultural barriers and inspirational factors. The project resulted in a cuddly toy that stimulates young children aged 4-8 to care for it through their own physical actions. First limited tests indicated that children appreciated and understood the toys' key elements, and suggest that it could be possible to use interactive toys and social interaction to change behaviour with regard to physical activity.", "paper_title": "Get up and move: an interactive cuddly toy that stimulates physical activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000280072100003"}
