This modified diminished-1 adder can perform n-bit modulo 2(n) + 1 addition in less area and time than solutions that are based on the use of binary adders and/or weighted modulo 2(n) + 1 adders. Therefore, it can be applied effectively to all weighted modulo 2(n) + 1 arithmetic components that finally derive two n-bit addends. A small number of weighted arithmetic components have in the past adopted such a scheme without presenting this general theory. By applying this idea, we propose novel multi-operand modulo 2(n) + 1 adders (MOMAs) and residue generators (RGs). Experimental results indicate that the resulting arithmetic components offer significant savings in delay, implementation area and average power consumption compared to the currently most efficient solutions.", "paper_title": "ON IMPLEMENTING EFFICIENT MODULO 2(n)+1 ARITHMETIC COMPONENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279796900001"}
