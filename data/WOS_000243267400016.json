An energy-to-peak control performance is used and actuator saturation is taken into consideration. By combining the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and the random search results of genetic algorithm (GA), a desirable static output feedback controller can be computed. Two building structures under seismic loads are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the structural vibration. Simulation results also show that the energy-to-peak performance based controller can well realize the peak response suppression requirement and the static output feedback controller can achieve the same level of control performance as that of a full-state feedback controller.
