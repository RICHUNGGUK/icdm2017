An authenticated key agreement protocol, which is against the attack of quantum computer, is proposed. The proposed protocol can provide the security properties known session key security, forward security, resistance to key-compromise impersonation attack and to unknown key-share attack, key control. We also prove its security in a widely accepted model.", "paper_title": "An Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol Using Isogenies Between Elliptic Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000289028900007"}
