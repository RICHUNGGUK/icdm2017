Like the Local Binary Patterns (LBP), the proposed method considers at each pixel a neighboring function defined on a circle of radius R. We define local frequency components as the magnitude of the coefficients of the 1D Fourier transform of the neighboring function. By applying different bandpass filters on the 2D Fourier transform of the local frequency components, we define our Local Frequency Descriptors (LFD). The LFD features are added dynamically from low frequencies to high. The features defined in this paper are invariant to rotation. As well, they are robust to noise. The experimental results on the Outex, CUReT, and KTH-TIPS datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art texture analysis methods. The results also show that the proposed method is very robust to noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
