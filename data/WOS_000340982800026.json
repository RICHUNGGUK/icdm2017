Necessary and sufficient conditions on the synchronization for master-slave Boolean networks with impulsive effects are derived by converting the logical systems into algebraic expression with the method of semi-tensor product of matrices. Some convenient conditions are proposed to judge whether a Boolean network with impulsive effects can be synchronized. Finally, one illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
