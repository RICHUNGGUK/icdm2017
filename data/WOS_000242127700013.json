It is based on efficient computation of the Bezout resultant and Lagrange interpolation. One of the main features of our approach is that it considerably reduces the size of intermediate expressions and results in significant speed-up in the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Implicitization of rational curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000242127700013"}
