While existing standards (eg High Level Architecture) provide a technical architecture to enable distributed simulation, they do not provide any standard pattern for interfacing distributed discrete-event simulation models. In this paper, generic interface specifications have been proposed to enable interoperability among distributed discrete-event simulation models. The interface specification models have been broadly classified into four types: Entity transfer, Data exchange, Resource sharing, and Event notification. The specifications define the minimum set of messages required to realize a situation. The specifications are described in detail using Unified Modelling Language sequence diagrams. A prototype distributed simulation, developed using a commercial-off-the-shelf simulation package, is used to demonstrate the proposed specifications. Finally, to test the validity of the proposed specifications, statistical results obtained from the constructed distributed simulation are compared against those from a single (non-distributed) simulation.", "paper_title": "Generic interface specifications for integrating distributed discrete-event simulation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735400005"}
