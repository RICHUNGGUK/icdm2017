Walls, roofs and floors generate reflections and refractions that conduce to constructive and destructive interferences due to the multipath effect. In this paper, we perform an analytical study based on the signal strength generated by an access point (AP) inside a building. The evolution of the signal strength allows us to move away the sensors from the AP without reducing the signal level and link quality. We study the IEEE 802.11 technology. These results are compared with the theoretical distribution channels to know what should be followed to avoid interferences. Finally, taking as a reference the measures provided, we develop a method for estimating indoor signal strength that will help us determine the best position for wireless sensors. Our method will allow saving 15% of sensors. The reduction in the number of sensors provides us economic and energy savings, allowing us to prolong the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n short-scale indoor wireless sensor placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000333272800006"}
