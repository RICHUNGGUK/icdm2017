In this paper, a simple combination approach for obtaining minimal disparity OWA operator weights is proposed. The proposed approach generates the OWA operator weights by minimizing the combination disparity between any two adjacent weights and its expectation. This involves the formulation and solution of a linear programming model and a quadratic programming model for a given degree of orness. A numerical example demonstrated simpleness and effectiveness of the methods proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "A combination approach for obtaining the minimize disparity OWA operator weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000300099200002"}
