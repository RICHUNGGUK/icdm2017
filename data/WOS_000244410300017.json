In order to provide differential quality of services (QoS), we need to efficiently schedule a set of incoming packets so that every packet can be transferred to its destined output port before its deadline. If no such a schedule exists, we wish to find one that allows a maximum number of packets to meet their deadlines. Recently, this problem has been proved to be NP-complete if three or more distinct deadlines (classes) are present in the set. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Flow-based Iterative Packet Scheduling (FIPS) for this scheduling problem. A key component in FIPS is a non-trivial algorithm that solves the problem for the case where two classes are present in the packet set. By repeatedly applying the algorithm for two classes, we solve the general case of an arbitrary number of classes more efficiently. Applying FIPS to a frame-based model effectively achieves differential QoS provision in IQ switches. Using simulations, we have compared FIPS performance with five well-known existing heuristic algorithms including Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF), Minimum-Laxity-First (MLF) and their variants. The simulation results demonstrate that our new algorithm solves the deadline guaranteed packet scheduling problem with a much higher success rate and a much lower packet drop ratio than all other algorithms.", "paper_title": "An efficient packet scheduling algorithm with deadline guarantees for input-queued switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000244410300017"}
