An authentication code with arbitration is t-fold perfect if the numbers of decoding rules and encoding rules meet the information-theoretic lower bounds. Pei (Message authentication codes (in Chinese). USCT, Hefei, 2009) pointed out that there has not yet been able to construct t-fold perfect authentication codes with arbitration for . In this paper, we define a new design, perfect strong strict restricted partially balanced t-design, and prove that the existence of perfect strong strict restricted partially balanced t-designs implies the existence of t-fold perfect authentication codes with arbitration. Further, we obtain some new infinite classes of t-fold perfect authentication codes with arbitration.", "paper_title": "A construction for t-fold perfect authentication codes with arbitration", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700005"}
