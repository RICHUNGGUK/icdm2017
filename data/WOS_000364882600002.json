It is inspired by Jacobs' recent identification of a categorical structure that is common in various predicate transformers, but adds generality in the following aspects: (1) different notions of modality (such as \"may\" vs. \"must\") are captured by Eilenberg-Moore algebras; (2) nested alternating branching like in games and in probabilistic systems with nondeterministic environments is modularly modeled by a monad on the Eilenberg-Moore category of another.
