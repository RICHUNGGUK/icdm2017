It covers various approaches that utilized different properties of images, like intensity distribution, spatial frequency content and several others. A few case studies including isotropic and heterogeneous, congruent and non-congruent images are used to illustrate how the described methods work and to compare some of them. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
