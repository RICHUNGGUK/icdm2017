IoT data is substantial in quantity, noisy, heterogeneous, inconsistent, and arrives at the system in a streaming fashion. Due to the unique characteristics of IoT data, the manipulation of IoT data for practical applications has encountered many fundamental challenging problems, such as data modeling and processing. This paper proposes the infrastructure for an IoT prototype system that aims to develop foundation models for IoT data. We illustrate major modules in the IoT prototype, as well as their functionalities, and provide our vision of the key techniques used for tacking the critical problems in each module.", "paper_title": "Development of foundation models for Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800008"}
