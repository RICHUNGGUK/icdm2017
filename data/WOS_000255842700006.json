Facial expression recognition has recently become a promising research area. Its applications include human-computer interfaces, human emotion analysis, and medical care and cure. In this paper, we investigate various feature representation and expression classification schemes to recognize seven different facial expressions, such as happy, neutral, angry, disgust, sad, fear and surprise, in the JAFFE database. Experimental results show that the method of combining 2D-LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) outperforms others. The recognition rate of this method is 95.71% by using leave-one-out strategy and 94.13% by using cross-validation strategy. It takes only 0.0357 second to process one image of size 256 x 256.", "paper_title": "Performance comparisons of facial expression recognition in JAFFE database", "paper_id": "WOS:000255842700006"}
