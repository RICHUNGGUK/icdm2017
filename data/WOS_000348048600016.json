It is based on the theory that human perception of a pattern depends not only on the change of stimulus intensity, but also on the original stimulus intensity. Invariant to scale and rotation is the intrinsic properties of WLSD. As a global shape descriptor, WLSD has far lower computation complexity while is as discriminative as state-of-art shape descriptors. Experimental results demonstrate the strong capability of the proposed method in handling shape retrieval.", "paper_title": "WLSD: A Perceptual Stimulus Model Based Shape Descriptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000348048600016"}
