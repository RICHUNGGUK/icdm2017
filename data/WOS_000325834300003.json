A criterion for having a sufficient grid solution to capture the thin lubricating film surrounding non-wetting bubbles or droplets, and the precise moment of breakup or coalescence is provided. We analyze and propose optimal computational settings to obtain a sharp fluid interface and small parasitic currents. To show the usability of our computational rules, numerical simulations are presented for three benchmark cases, viz, the steady motion of bubbles in a straight two-dimensional channel, the formation of bubbles in two- and three-dimensional T-junctions, and the breakup of droplets in three-dimensional T-junctions. An error analysis on the accuracy of the computations is presented to probe the efficacy of the VOF method. The results are in good agreement with published experimental data and experimentally-validated analytical solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
