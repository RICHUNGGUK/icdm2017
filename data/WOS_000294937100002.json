With the aid of a generalized dyadic representation system in the unit interval, we study a negation N which is a duality function for pairs of operators satisfying certain boundary conditions. New properties of N are investigated, including its singularity and fractal dimensions for several related sets. As an application we obtain an explicit expression for k-negations.
