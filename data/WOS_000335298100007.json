However, users' content and contacts in real-world social networks cannot be detected easily. Herein, we construct a website interaction network to reflect the online social network, based on mapping relationships among websites, webpages, and attributes of a social event. This network reflects the social association relationships between websites of an event, which can be mapped to the users' relationships in the real-world social network. In this article, we study the structural features of a website interaction network and, then, mapping of these features to the real-world social network. Further, we discuss implications for human behaviors, human relationships, and structure of human society. Experimental results show that the website interaction networks concerning popular social events have power-law scaling in degree distribution and exhibit small-world properties.", "paper_title": "WEBSITE INTERACTION NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000335298100007"}
