Due to the error-tolerance property, FIBE scheme is very useful in real-world applications. However, most FIBE schemes are provable secure only in a weaker security model. In order to eliminate this problem, Ren et al. recently proposed a new FIBE scheme and proved that it is fully chosen-ciphertext secure in the standard model. Unfortunately, in this paper, we will show that their FIBE scheme is even not chosen-plaintext secure.", "paper_title": "SECURITY ANALYSIS OF A FUZZY IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000334692700003"}
