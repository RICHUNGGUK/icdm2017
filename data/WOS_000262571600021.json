A supplementary term is added to the compressible Navier-Stokes system, seeking to simulate the effect of the Brinkman-penalization technique used in incompressible flow simulations including obstacles. We present a computational study comparing numerical results obtained with this method to theoretical results and to simulations with Fluent software. Our work indicates that this technique can be very promising in applications to complex flows. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
