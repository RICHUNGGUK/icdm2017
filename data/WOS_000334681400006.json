In this method, the transfer function synthesis problem is converted into a Hurwitz polynomial generation problem, where the real roots correspond to C-sections and the complex roots correspond to D-sections. Several design examples are provided to illustrate the proposed synthesis method. A prototype is implemented in strip-line configuration and fabricated in LTCC technology, and the measured response is in good agreement with the prescribed and full-wave responses.
