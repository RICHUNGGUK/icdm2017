In some quantum communication tasks using entangled pairs, the error distributions between two parts of the pairs are unbalanced, and one party holds the whole entangled pairs at the final stage, and he or she is able to perform joint measurements on the pairs. In this situation the proposed one-party QECCs can improve error correction by allowing a higher-tolerated error rate. We have established the general correspondence between linear classical codes and the one-party QECCs, and we have given the general definition for these types of quantum-error-correcting codes. It has been shown that the one-party QECCs can correct errors as long as the error threshold is not larger than 0.5. They work even for fidelity less than 0.5 as long as it is larger than 0.25. We give several concrete examples of the one-party QECCs. We provide the applications of the one-party QECCs in quantum dense coding, so that it can function in noisy channels. As a result, a large number of quantum secure direct communication protocols based on dense coding are also able to be protected by this new type of one-party QECCs.", "paper_title": "ONE-PARTY QUANTUM-ERROR-CORRECTING CODES FOR UNBALANCED ERRORS: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATION TO QUANTUM DENSE CODING AND QUANTUM SECURE DIRECT COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281889900005"}
