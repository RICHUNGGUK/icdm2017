First, a novel augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method is proposed to develop delay-dependent synchronization criteria for the networks, which makes use of more relaxed conditions by employing the new type of augmented matrices with Kronecker product operation. The proposed method can handle a multitude of Kronecker product operations in the LKF and alleviates the requirements of the positive definiteness of some conditional matrices which are usually considered in the existing methods for complex networks. This leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the synchronization criteria, i.e., less conservative synchronization results can be obtained. Meanwhile, the case of fast time-varying delay can also be handled by the proposed method. Furthermore, based on the derived criteria, a robust synchronization criterion is obtained for the system with uncertainties both in coefficient and coupling matrix terms. Since an expression based on linear matrix inequality is used, the proposed criteria can be easily checked in practice. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Synchronization for Coupled Neural Networks With Interval Delay: A Novel Augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functional Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000312844800006"}
