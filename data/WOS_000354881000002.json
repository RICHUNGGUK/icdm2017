An event-triggered communication scheme, under which the threshold depends on the latest successfully transmitted sampled-data, is introduced to reduce network resource utilization. Taking the event-triggered communication scheme and the asynchronous operation between the fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller, the resulting system is modeled as an asynchronous threshold-error-dependent system with an interval time-varying delay. A new delay-dependent criterion for L-2-gain tracking performance of the asynchronous system is derived by applying the deviation bounds of asynchronous normalized membership functions. Based on this performance criterion, some criteria on the existence of the fuzzy tracking controller are established. A co-design algorithm is presented to obtain the control gains and the event-triggering parameters simultaneously. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
