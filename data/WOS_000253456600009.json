In this article, we join managerial advice for implementation strategies with insights from a theory that determines the flexibility requirements of an enterprise system in relation with characteristics of the business process that the system is intended to support. We align our theoretical considerations with practical evidence from the case of an electronic procurement system that was implemented at a Fortune 100 firm. Based on our findings, we present a roadmap that can guide flexibility and implementation strategies based on both project and process characteristics.", "paper_title": "Enterprise system flexibility and implementation strategies: Aligning theory with evidence from a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000253456600009"}
