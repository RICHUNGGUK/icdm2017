As an essential part of each step, restricted problems are solved on every subdomain and a certain coarse grid solution is found. In this paper we present a new strategy of preconditioning of the coarse problem. This is based on the algebraic multilevel preconditioning technique. We present numerical estimates of constants defining the condition numbers of the preconditioned coarse problems for several two- and three-dimensional elliptic equations. (c) 2011 IMACS.
