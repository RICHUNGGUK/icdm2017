Structural optimization is considered to be one of the most important means to improve the crashworthiness of tailor welded structures. However, majority of the existing optimization studies to data have not considered uncertainties for simplication. Its associated risk is that a deterministic optimization might deteriorate its optimality and/or violate design constraints when being present in uncertain environment. This study aimed to explore how to maximize the crashworthiness of the hybrid tailor welded structures involving uncertainties. For this purpose, a novel robust optimization algorithm based on successive Taguchi approach for design in discrete space is firstly presented. In the optimization process, the peak force is taken as an objective, while specific energy absorption (SEA) as a constraint. The optimal results show that not only the performance of peak force and specific energy absorption is improved, but also the robustness of these two indicators is also significantly enhanced. The proposed algorithm can also be used to solve other more complicated engineering problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
