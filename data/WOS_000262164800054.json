The anonymity was formalized in previous works [1], [13], and this can be considered under chosen plaintext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, yielding two notions of security, ID-II-CPA and ID-II-CCA, where II denotes \"indistinguishability of identities.\" However, how to obtain an ID-II-CCA secure anonymous IBE in the random oracle model is still a challenging problem. We firstly propose a new notion of plaintext awareness in the two identities setting, called PATI. Secondly, we prove that the IBE scheme is ID-II-CCA secure if it is PATI secure. Finally, we propose the first generic conversion for anonymous ME from ID-II-CPA to ID-II-CCA in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Anonymous Identity Based Encryption with Plaintext Awareness in the Two Identities Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800054"}
