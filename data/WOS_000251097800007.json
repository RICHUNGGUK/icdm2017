Five patients' IMRT treatment plans have been analyzed, employing five different planning image data-sets: (a) uncorrected (UC); (b) homogeneous uncorrected (HUC); (c) sinogram completion corrected (SCC); (d) minimum-value-corrected (MVC); and (e) streak-artifact-reduction including minimum-value-correction (SAR-MVC), which has been taken as the reference data-set. The effects on NTCP and TCP were evaluated using the Lyman-NTCP model and the Logistic-TCP model, respectively. When compared to the predicted NTCP obtained using the reference data-set, the treatment plan based on the original CT data-set (UC) yielded an increase in NTCP of 3.2 and 2.0% for the spared parotid gland and the spinal cord, respectively. While for the treatment plans based on the MVC CT data-set the NTCP increased by a 1.1% and a 0.1% for the spared parotid glands and the spinal cord, respectively. In addition, the MVC correction method showed a reduction in TCP for target volumes (MVC: Delta DTCP = -0.6% vs. UC: Delta TCP = -1.9%) with respect to that of the reference CT data-set. Our results indicate that the presence of dental-metal-artifacts in H&N planning CT data-sets has an impact on the estimates of TCP and NTCP. In particular dental-metal-artifacts lead to an increase in NTCP for the spared parotid glands and a slight decrease in TCP for target volumes.", "paper_title": "On the radiobiological impact of metal artifacts in head-and-neck IMRT in terms of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000251097800007"}
