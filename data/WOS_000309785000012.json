For each pixel, the RRT assigns a value which is the distance to the nearest edge pixel. The medial pixels are those which have the maximum radius values in their neighborhood. We demonstrate the application of these concepts in the problem of character reconstruction to improve the character recognition rate in video images. With ring radius transform and medial pixels, our approach exploits the symmetry information between the inner and outer contours of a broken character to reconstruct the gaps. Experimental results and comparison with two existing methods show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of measures such as relative error and character recognition rate.
