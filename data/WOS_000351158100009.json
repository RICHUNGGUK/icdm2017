An optical orthogonal code (OOC) which spreads in these dimensions is called a three-dimensional (3-D) OOC. In this paper, we study 3-D OOC with at most one optical pulse per wavelength/time plane, which have the favorable property that the Hamming auto-correlation is identically equal to 0. An upper bound on the number of codewords for general Hamming cross-correlation requirement is given. A 3-D OCC with at most one pulse per wavelength/time plane and Hamming cross-correlation no more than 1 is shown to be equivalent to a generalized Bhaskar Rao group divisible design (GBRGDD), signed over a cyclic group. Through this equivalence, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of GBRGDD of weighted 3, signed over a cyclic group, are derived.", "paper_title": "Optimal three-dimensional optical orthogonal codes of weight three", "paper_id": "WOS:000351158100009"}
