We show that an ideal I belongs to Mf(J) if and only if it is generated by a special set of polynomials, the J-marked basis of I, that in some sense generalizes the notion of reduced Grobner basis and its constructive capabilities. Indeed, although not every J-marked basis is a Grobner basis with respect to some term order, a sort of reduced form modulo I is an element of Mf(J) can be computed for every homogeneous polynomial, so that a J-marked basis can be characterized by a Buchberger-like criterion. Using J-marked bases, we prove that the family Mf(J) can be endowed, in a very natural way, with a structure of an affine scheme that turns out to be homogeneous with respect to a non-standard grading and flat in the origin (the point corresponding to J), thanks to properties of J-marked bases analogous to those of Grobner bases about syzygies.
