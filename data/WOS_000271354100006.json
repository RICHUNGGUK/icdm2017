The results of transient solutions show that both the recirculation zone near the wall in upstream of the injectors and the vortex breakdown in downstream of the injectors increase in size during whole period. A nearly axisymmetric conical breakdown is formed and its internal structure consists of two asymmetric spiral-like vortices rotating in opposite directions. The stagnation point shifts slowly toward the pipe outlet over time. The maxima of the three velocity components, which are located near the wall, decrease gradually with streamwise direction. It can also be inferred that Mach number approaches 1.0 near the injector outlets. The velocities increase with the increasing injector pressure. However, its increasing trend is not significant. With the increase of the injection position, vortex breakdown moves in downstream direction and the pitch along the streamwise direction increases.
