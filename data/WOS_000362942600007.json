In response to the challenge, this paper demonstrates a full-system TWDM-PON through physical layer simulation that provides 56 Gb/s downstream and 40 Gb/s upstream bandwidths. We propose a simple and cost-effective scheme to improve the capacity of the downstream signal by utilizing highly spectrally efficient 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with 20 GHz radio-over-fiber signal distribution using a single sideband signal that is generated by an optical dual-arm modulator. In addition, we study the effect of nonlinearity on a directly modulated laser (DML) as the upstream laser of an optical network unit. The outcomes obtained revealed good transmission quality in both directions, where bit error ratios of 10(-6) and 10(-5) are obtained for the downstream and upstream transmissions, respectively. This leads to the ability to support up to 128 users over 40 km of single-mode fiber.", "paper_title": "Capacity Improvement of TWDM-PONs Exploiting the 16-QAM Technique for Downstream Side With a Nonlinearity Effect Study for Upstream DML", "paper_id": "WOS:000362942600007"}
