Template selection is a reliable method to reduce the number of templates used in a biometric system to account for variations observed in a person's biometric data. An efficient method based on clustering with automatic selection of the number of clusters is proposed in this work for finding subgroups of similar templates which are used for prototype selection. Experimental results confirm the advantage of the new method and the importance of adopting a procedure to perform template selection. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
