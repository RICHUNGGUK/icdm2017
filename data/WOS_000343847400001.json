This problem is formulated as a parameter-free shape optimization problem, in which a squared displacements error norm on the prescribed region is employed as an objective functional. The shape sensitivity, called shape gradient function, is theoretically derived using the adjoint variable method and the formula of the material derivative, and then applied to a gradient method with Laplacian smoother for shells to determine the smooth optimal shape. Several calculated examples are presented to verify the validity and practical utility of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
