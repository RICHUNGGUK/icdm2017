He claimed that quantum mechanics was incomplete and devised an experiment to prove it. Two experiments have directly and indirectly tested Popper's hypothesis, and they provide some evidence that Popper's prediction may have been correct. The equations governing these two experiments and Popper's thought experiment will be derived from basic quantum principles. The experimental constants will be inputted and it will show that the two experiments reinforce each other and agree completely with quantum theory.", "paper_title": "POPPER'S THOUGHT EXPERIMENT REINVESTIGATED", "paper_id": "WOS:000304611800008"}
