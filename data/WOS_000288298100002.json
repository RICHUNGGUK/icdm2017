These works have led to the identification of similarities in the structures of such networks arising in very different fields, and to the development of a body of knowledge, tools and methods for their study. While many interesting questions remain open on the subject of static networks, challenging issues arise from the study of dynamic networks. In particular, the measurement, analysis and modeling of social interactions are first class concerns. In this article, we address the challenges of capturing physical proximity and social interaction by means of a wireless network. In particular, as a concrete case study, we exhibit the deployment of a wireless sensor network applied to the measurement of health care workers' exposure to tuberculosis-infected patients in a service unit of the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital in Paris, France. This network has continuously monitored the presence of all HCWs in all rooms of the service during a three month period. We both describe the measurement system that was deployed and some early analysis on the measured data. We highlight the bias introduced by the measurement system reliability and provide a reconstruction method which not only leads to a significantly more coherent and realistic dataset but also evidences phenomena a priori hidden in the raw data. By this analysis, we suggest that a processing step is required prior to any adequate exploitation of data gathered thanks to a non-fully reliable measurement architecture. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
