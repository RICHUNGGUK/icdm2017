The simultaneous solution procedure uses a mixed-hybrid velocity-based formulation of both fluid and structure discretized by a stabilized time-discontinuous space-time finite element method. The continuity at the interface is ensured by a localized mixed-hybrid interface method avoiding Lagrange multipliers and penalty approaches. The XFEM is utilized for enrichment of the approximation space of the fluid variables in order to represent non-smooth (discontinuous) solution features resulting from immersing a thin structure in a fluid.
