Service-oriented communication (SOC) is a new trend in the industry to enable communication through a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and thereby package communications as services. In this paper, we firstly introduce the design and implementation for business process execution language (BPEL) based multimedia conferencing communication services orchestration, and mainly focus on the issue of guaranteeing the correctness of such applications, we presents a Petri net-based approach to analyzing the BPEL based multimedian conferencing communication services orchestration correctness and also a set of translation rules is proposed to transform BPEL processes into Petri nets. Especially, we define the correctness of multimedia conferencing services orchestration and address the verification method based on Petri nets. The algorithms and corresponding reliable issues have been proposed, such as the coverability tree for detecting flow safeness, the incidence matrix & state equation for finding reachable issues, and a transitive matrix for detecting a deadlock problem. With the Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) are introduced to transform a orchestrated services into a Petri net model, and providing an automated support for the formal analysis of their behavior. Finally, we give the conclusions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
