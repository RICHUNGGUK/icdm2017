The aspect ratio of the flow channel is allowed to vary within a wide range to examine its influence on the flow which bifurcates from a symmetric state to an asymmetric state. The results reveal that the critical Reynolds number of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation increases while the aspect ratio is reduced. The flow behaviour near the side walls is illustrated by using limiting streamlines. The origin of the Singular points identifiable on the side wall can be traced back to the recirculating flows and the relevant reattachment/separation points in the core of the channel. It is seen that the determination of the exact critical Reynolds number is not trivial because it depends on how to define asymmetric flow. Computations have also been conducted to show that a slight asymmetry in the channel geometry causes a smooth transition from symmetric to non-symmetric states.
