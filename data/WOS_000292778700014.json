Gene-environment (GxE) interaction is considered pivotal in determining trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders. Regression-based methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response and the genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction is the commonly used approach in detecting GxE interaction. The linearity assumption, however, could be easily violated due to non-linear genetic penetrance which induces non-linear GxE interaction. Results: In this work, we propose to relax the linear GxE assumption and allow for non-linear GxE interaction under a varying coefficient model framework. We propose to estimate the varying coefficients with regression spline technique. The model allows one to assess the non-linear penetrance of a genetic variant under different environmental stimuli, therefore help us to gain novel insights into the etiology of a complex disease. Several statistical tests are proposed for a complete dissection of GxE interaction. A wild bootstrap method is adopted to assess the statistical significance. Both simulation and real data analysis demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed method. Our method provides a powerful and testable framework for assessing non-linear GxE interaction.", "paper_title": "Varying coefficient model for gene-environment interaction: a non-linear look", "paper_id": "WOS:000292778700014"}
