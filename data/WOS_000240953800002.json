Thirty descriptors, including quantum chemical parameters, steric effect descriptors and half wave potential (E-1/2), were used for describing twelve substituted phenols, including mono- and multi-substituent phenols. A leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation procedure resulted in the selection of three descriptors, the total of electron and nuclear energies of the two-center terms for the carbon-chlorine or carbon-nitrogen bond (TE2), the net atomic charges on the chlorine or nitrogen (q(x)), and the largest negative atomic charge on an atom (q(-)). The model based on SVM yielded a Q(2) value of 0.892, indicating a high predictive ability. Compared with models developed with partial least squares (PLS) and multiple linear regression (MLR), where Q(2) were 0.804 and 0.799 respectively, SVM showed higher performances.", "paper_title": "Quantitative structure-property relationship studies on electrochemical degradation of substituted phenols using a support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000240953800002"}
