The proposed comparator enhances the input signal range to the rail-to-rail mode, and hence, improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ADC in low supply voltages. The effect of the latch offset voltage is reduced by providing a higher voltage gain in the regenerative latch. To reduce the ADC power consumption further, the binary-weighted capacitive array with an attenuation capacitor (BWA) is employed as the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in this design. The ADC is designed and simulated in a 90 nm CMOS process with a single 0.5 V power supply. Spectre simulation results show that the average power consumption of the proposed ADC is about 400 nW and the peak signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) is 56 dB. By considering 10% increase in total ADC power consumption due to the parasitics and a loss of 0.22 LSB in ENOB due to the DAC capacitors mismatch, the achieved figure of merit (FoM) is 11.4 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "A 10-BIT 0.5 V 100 kS/s SAR ADC WITH A NEW RAIL-TO-RAIL COMPARATOR FOR ENERGY LIMITED APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332115500011"}
