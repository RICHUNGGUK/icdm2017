As a consequence, significant congestion can occur in the data center network. To the best of our knowledge, most existing approaches either focus on local congestion-aware mechanisms, which have only a poor ability to handle asymmetry or use explicit congestion notification packets, which are difficult to implement directly in switch hardware. These methods are insufficient to solve the congestion problem. In this paper, we focus on a congestion-free routing strategy, resorting to the global view of the data center network in a software-defined networking controller. Specifically, a timeslot allocation was first conducted for the coming packets, and then the corresponding routing paths were computed for each packet. In view of the efficiency, the timeslot allocation algorithm follows a heuristic pattern, and the path selection is modeled as a bin-packing problem. Simulation results showed that the congestion-free routing strategy proposed here performs well in throughput, queuing, and end-to-end round-trip time.
