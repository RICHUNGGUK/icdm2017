The anesthesiology nurses are one of the most shared resources in the hospital and we attempt to find a fair/balanced schedule for them, taking into account a set of constraints and the nurses' stated preferences, concerning the different shifts. We propose a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the ANSP. Finally, we compare our technique with previous results obtained using integer programming.", "paper_title": "Anesthesiology Nurse Scheduling using Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572700009"}
