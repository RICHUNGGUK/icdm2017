In this paper we show that a natural adaptation of the primal-dual Steiner forest algorithm of Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi [SIAM J. Comput., 24 ( 1995), pp. 445-456] yields a 2-budget balanced and cross-monotonic cost sharing method for this game. We also present a negative result, arguing that no cross-monotonic cost sharing method can achieve a budget balance factor of less than 2 for the Steiner tree game. This shows that our result is tight. Our algorithm gives rise to a new linear programming relaxation for the Steiner forest problem which we term the lifted-cut relaxation. We show that this new relaxation is stronger than the standard undirected cut relaxation for the Steiner forest problem.", "paper_title": "A group-strategyproof cost sharing mechanism for the steiner forest game", "paper_id": "WOS:000254459500002"}
