The multi-level fusion combines model level and decision level fusion via dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). A novel methodology known as support vector regression (SVR) is utilized to estimate the fusion weights directly from audio features; Sigma-Pi network sampling method is also incorporated to reduce feature dimensions. Experiments on the homegrown Chinese database and CMU English database both demonstrate that the method improves the accuracies of audio-visual bimodal speaker identification under dynamically varying acoustic noise conditions.", "paper_title": "Weight estimation for audio-visual multi-level fusion in bimodal speaker identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300144"}
