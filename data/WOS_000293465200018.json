This approach is used for solving the state interactions modeling problem caused by the model approximations in VLSI interconnect for RLC tree network systems. The bond graph (BG) energy model with a simulink energybased block diagram (SEBD) algorithm is developed. The dynamic behaviors of an example of VLSI interconnect with a 20 (th) -order RLC tree are presented. Methods of sequent structuring and the delineation of dynamic interactions can be provided for users applying the BG/SEBD algorithms in the development of structural models. It is shown that the new BG/SEBD structural modeling approach requires neither mathematical higher-order reduction nor physically based model reduction. Therefore, useful information can be extracted from the BG/SEBD representation of physical RLC tree network systems. Both time-domain and frequency-domain simulation results are applied to analyze the dynamic response of energy-storing elements using BG/SEBD algorithm combined with Matlab/Simulink software. Finally, a causal analysis of the system zeros plot from the shortest causal path method is proposed, to predict the dynamic response of energy-storing elements and the system performance for design and verification purposes. The dynamic response outputs from different node points were revealed, and the obtained physical information is significant which suggests feasible directions for design (re-design) improvement toward better overall system performance.", "paper_title": "A novel structural modeling and analysis of VLSI interconnect with an RLC tree network system using a BG/SEBD approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000293465200018"}
