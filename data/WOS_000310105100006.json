Production costs show the most robust influence on governance. Skills required to execute the activities, interdependence between the activities, and firm-level characteristics - uncertainty and knowledge intensity - are the main explanatory variables of the decision. Transaction-level uncertainty is the only transaction cost variable found to influence the decision. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
