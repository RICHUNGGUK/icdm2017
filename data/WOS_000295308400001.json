The Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) routing protocol provides Quality of Service (QoS) driven routing and performs self-improvement in a distributed manner, by learning from the experience of special packets, which gather on-line QoS measurements and discover new routes. Although CPN is generally very resilient to network changes, it may suffer worse performance during node failures caused by network threats, such as network worms. Here we evaluate the performance of CPN in such crises and compare it with the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, an industry standard and widely used in Internet Protocol networks. We also improve it by introducing a failure detection element that reduces packet loss and delay during failures. Our experiments were performed in a real networking testbed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
