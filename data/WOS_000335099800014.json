Optimal input timings and strengths are identified by using phase plane arguments for discrete input kicks with a given total magnitude. Furthermore, analytical results are conducted to estimate the firing time of given number of spikes resulting from a given input train. We obtain the fastest strategy as the total input size increases. In particular, when the parameter -b is large and total input size G is not so large, there are two candidate strategies to fastest achieve given number of spikes, which depend on the considered parameters. The fastest strategy for some cases of G >> -b to fire m spikes should partition m spikes into m-n + 1 spikes for the highest band, with largest g, and one spike for each subsequent n - 1 band. When G is sufficiently large, big kick is the fastest strategy. In addition, we establish an optimal value for the dependent variable, 19, where each input should be delivered in a non-threshold-based strategy to fastest achieve given output of subsequent spikes. Moreover, we find that reset and kick strategy is the fastest when G is small and G>> -b. The obtained results can lead to a better understanding of how the period of nonlinear oscillators are affected by different input timings and strengths. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
