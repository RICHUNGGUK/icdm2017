Quality-dependent time slots refer to pre-defined time windows where certain activities can be executed under ideal circumstances (optimal level of quality). Outside these time windows, there is a loss of quality due to detrimental effects. The purpose is to select a quality-dependent time slot for each activity, resulting in a minimal loss of quality. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we show that an R&D project from the bio-technology sector can be transformed to a resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). Secondly, we propose an exact search procedure for scheduling this project with the aforementioned quality restrictions. Finally, we test the performance of our procedure on a randomly generated problem set.", "paper_title": "Scheduling an R&D project with quality-dependent time slots", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300066"}
