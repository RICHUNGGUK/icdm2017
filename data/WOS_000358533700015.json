In particular, most observers report perceiving temporally-varying noise. Two reasons are physiologically plausible; quantum noise (due to the low absolute number of photons) and spontaneous photochemical reactions. Previously, static noise with a normal distribution and no account for absolute values was combined with blue hue shift and blur to simulate scotopic appearance on a photopic display for movies and interactive applications (e.g., games). We present a computational model to reproduce the specific distribution and dynamics of scotopic noise for specific absolute values. It automatically introduces a perceptually-calibrated amount of noise for a specific luminance level and supports animated imagery. Our simulation runs in milliseconds at HD resolution using graphics hardware and favorably compares to simpler alternatives in a perceptual experiment.", "paper_title": "Modeling Luminance Perception at Absolute Threshold", "paper_id": "WOS:000358533700015"}
