He was only sixty-one years old. His death was a tremendous to his family, friends colleagues, co-workers, co-authors, co-editors, members of conference program committees, students, the theoretical Computer Science Community and especially to his beloved wife, Lizhen. Through his teachings, international committee work, seminars and some 150 refereed publications, he left us a huge legacy of many interesting and important research contributions in the areas of the theory and implementation of automata and formal languages, fuzzy logic, object oriented modeling methodologies, parallel processing for parallel programming languages, important software projects for automata theory research, the creation of the international Conference on Implementation and Application of Automata (CIAA) and a gallery of vivid memories of the wonderful times shared. He is remembered for his enormous energy, competence, diligence, anticipatory thoughtfulness, over-the-top generosity, measured politeness, noble sportsmanship and committed friendship. This paper, an extension of a talk with a similar title at DLT 2012, is an account how we are commemorating Sheng.", "paper_title": "GOODBY TO THE KINDHEARTED DRAGON PROF.
