In the Study, all Action Research approach is used. with theoretical considerations leading to specific actions being implemented, which ill turn yield results that are used to reflect upon the original theoretical assumptions. Results of the study emphasize the need for proper problem-structuring prior to the formulation of actions, the challenges of moving from planning to action; the importance of User involvement in the development of tools; and how a good match of people, problem-structuring, proactiveness and participatory tools development is required for effective decision support provision. The study also highlights the challenges of embedding decision support within existing work systems ill organizations. The Action Research approach is shown to be useful in bridging the gap between theory and practice, aiding the development of decision Support tools of immediate and practical benefit to organizations.
