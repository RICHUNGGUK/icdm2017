The controller is implemented on a simple PLC platform with an extra mathematical coprocessor, but is intended for the advanced control of complex processes. The model of the controlled plant is obtained by means of experimental modelling. A special batch-wise algorithm that is based on the Takagi-Sugeno model and uses \"fuzzy instrumental variables\" technique is described in the paper. Many robustness problems of the classical adaptive approaches can be circumvented to some extent by the proposed batch-wise approach combined with a supervisory mechanism. The paper also includes some experimental results on the hydraulic pilot plant and some simulation case studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
