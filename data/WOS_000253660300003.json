It was shown that the correlation coefficients varied from 0.65 to 0.90 for log P (seven methods), from 0.01 to 0.73 for aqueous solubility (four methods), and from 0.19 to 0.73 for drug-likeness (three methods). While for log P estimates, reasonable average pairwise correlation was found, for aqueous solubility and drug-likeness it was rather poor. Therefore, using computational tools freely available via the Internet, medicinal chemists should evaluate their accuracy versus experimental data for particular series of compounds. In contrast to prediction of above mentioned properties, which can be done with several Internet tools, wide profiling of biological activity can be obtained only with PASS Inet (http://www.ibmc.msk.ru/PASS). PASS Inet was tested by a dozen medicinal chemists for compounds from different chemical series with various kinds of biological activity, and in the majority of cases the results of prediction coincided with the experiments. New anxiolytics, antiarrhythmics, antileishmanials, and other biologically active agents have been identified on this basis. The advantages and limitations of computer-aided predictions for medicinal chemistry via the Internet are discussed.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided prediction for medicinal chemistry via the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000253660300003"}
