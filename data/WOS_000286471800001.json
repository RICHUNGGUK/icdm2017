Particular consideration is given, however, to both beat noise (BN) and multiple access interference (MAI) effects. BER performance of the TS OCDMA scheme is much superior to that of the WT scheme in the MAI limited case, while the WT scheme has better tolerance to beat noise. Improvement of BER performance and throughput can be obtained by utilization of optimum threshold detection. The two OCDMA schemes have comparable bit-error probability, and the WT scheme achieves a higher throughput for a heavy load when the optimum threshold is employed.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of asynchronous time-spreading phase coding and wavelength-time OCDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286471800001"}
