In this paper, the midpoint of the time delay's variation interval is introduced, and the variation interval is divided into two subintervals. Then, by constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and checking its variation in the two subintervals, respectively, some novel delay-dependent stability criteria for the addressed neural networks are derived. Numerical examples are provided to show that the achieved conditions are less conservative than some existing ones in the literature. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
