Linear sufficient conditions for shape preserving criteria on convexity, inflection, collinearity and coplanarity are derived to ensure the approximant mimics the shape of the data. The cubic B-spline is used to generate the C(2) shape preserving approximation curve as this type of spline enables the shape preserving constraints to be formulated in a simple way.
