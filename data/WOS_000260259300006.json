In this paper, we present FT-Pro, an adaptive fault management approach that combines proactive migration with reactive checkpointing. It aims to enable parallel applications to avoid anticipated failures via preventive migration and, in the case of unforeseeable failures, to minimize their impact through selective checkpointing. An adaptation manager is designed to make runtime decisions in response to failure prediction. Extensive experiments, by means of stochastic modeling and case studies with real applications, indicate that FT-Pro outperforms periodic checkpointing, in terms of reducing application completion times and improving resource utilization, by up to 43 percent.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fault Management of Parallel Applications for High-Performance Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000260259300006"}
