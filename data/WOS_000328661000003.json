We describe a method for finding the set of all prime annihilators of submodules which are preserved by the given Frobenius map and on which the Frobenius map is not nilpotent. This extends the algorithm by Karl Schwede and the first author, which solved this problem for submodules of the injective hull of the residue field. The Maths dual of this problem asks for the radical annihilators of quotients of free modules by submodules preserved by a given Frobenius near-splitting, and the same method solves this dual problem in the F-finite case.
