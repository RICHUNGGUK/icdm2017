We present an efficient construction of N x N distributors for all N in the form of parallel distributed-control networks, where the maximum size of a building block is the largest prime factor of N. The construction achieves the lowest known complexity for distributors of all sizes within the practical range. Meanwhile, we also offer an algorithm for the adaptation of a larger distributor into a smaller distributor. The adaptation is useful when the size N contains large prime factors. Rigorous algebraic formulation throughout the paper keeps the algorithmic construction transparent and affords many variations for the flexibility in implementation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
