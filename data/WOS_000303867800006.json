Job scheduling is a very important mechanism and a better scheduling scheme can greatly improve the efficiency of Grid computing. A lot of algorithms have been proposed to address the job scheduling problem. Unfortunately, most of them largely ignore the security risks involved in executing jobs in such an unreliable environment as Grid. This is known as security problem and it is a main hurdle to make the job scheduling secure, reliable and fault-tolerant. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm with multi-criteria approach, in terms of job completion time and security risks. Although Genetic Algorithms are suitable for large search space problems such as job scheduling, they are too slow to be executed online. Hence, we changed the implementation of a traditional genetic algorithm, proposing the Accelerated Genetic Algorithm. We also present the Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead which concerns the extra overhead caused by the application of Accelerated Genetic Algorithm. Accelerated Genetic Algorithm and Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead are compared with three well-known heuristic algorithms. Simulation results indicate a substantial performance advantage of both Accelerated Genetic Algorithm and Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead.", "paper_title": "Multi-Criteria Job Scheduling in Grid Using an Accelerated Genetic Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000303867800006"}
