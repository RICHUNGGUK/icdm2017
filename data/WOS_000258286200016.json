The HTS filter has a 0.51% fractional bandwidth at 1955 MHz, simulated in Sonnet, and is fabricated using double-sided Tl(2)Ba(2)CaCu(2)O(8) films on 0.5 mm thick LaAlO(3) substrate. Measured responses show that the minimum insertion loss of the filter is 0.16 dB, and the out-of-band rejection is better than 75 dB. The slope is 27 dB MHz(-1) at the low band edge and 22 dB MHz(-1) at the upper band edge. The HTS filter subsystem has a gain of 19.3 dB and a noise figure (NF) of 0.8 dB. Furthermore, the phase distortion of HTS filters is considered, and an efficient design approach for self-equalized HTS filters is proposed.", "paper_title": "HTS filter subsystem for future mobile communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200016"}
