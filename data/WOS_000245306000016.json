Richardson and Urbanke have proposed efficient encoding algorithms for LDPC codes. These algorithms permute the parity-check matrix of the code iteratively, such that it becomes approximately lower triangular. We propose a new approach for efficient encoding of LDPC codes in which we modify the code ensemble to force an approximate lower triangular structure, thus eliminating the need to apply the algorithms of Richardson and Urbanke in this ensemble. We prove that the new ensemble has the same asymptotic threshold as the corresponding standard ensemble. The new ensemble can be used for linear time encoding of an arbitrary code profile. Computer simulations confirm that the performances of the standard and new ensembles are also very similar when using finite length codes.", "paper_title": "Approximately lower triangular ensembles of LDPC codes with linear encoding complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000016"}
