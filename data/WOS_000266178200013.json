A clique is a maximal complete set. Denote bye(G) the clique family of G. The clique graph of G, denoted by C(G), is the intersection graph of C(G). Say that G is a clique graph if there exists a graph H such that G = K(H). The clique graph recognition problem asks whether a given graph is a clique graph. A sufficient condition was given by Hamelink in 1968, and a characterization was proposed by Roberts and Spencer in 1971. However, the time complexity of the problem of recognizing clique graphs is a long-standing open question. We prove that the clique graph recognition problem is NP-complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
