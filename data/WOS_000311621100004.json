However, although many QA systems for open domain exist, its adaptation for restricted domains (such as those of healthcare, agriculture, transportation, or science) is a far from trivial task. The principal problem is that domain experts ask more precise questions (and expect more precise answers), including specific terminology, and this is costly to integrate into a QA system. To overcome this drawback, this paper presents an innovative approach based on model-driven software development. It uses restricted-domain resources to automatically and effortlessly adapt open-domain QA systems in order to make them useful in restricted-domain scenarios. Finally, a set of experiments has been carried out to show the approach's applicability.", "paper_title": "Model-driven Development for Adapting Question Answering Systems to Restricted Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000311621100004"}
