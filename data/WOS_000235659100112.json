The focus of this paper is our work on grid-enabling the ParaView, a widely used parallel visualization software package. Upon the analysis of the ParaView Source code, the architecture as well as the implementation of ParaView-based client side cooperation of object visualization has been presented. Furthermore, the deployment of the collaborative ParaView as a visualization service in the Grid has been addressed.", "paper_title": "ParaView-based collaborative visualization for the grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100112"}
