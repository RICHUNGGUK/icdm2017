Controlling and hence limiting such factors has always been an important but elusive research goal, since the packet degree distribution, which is the main factor driving the complexity, is altered in a non-deterministic way by the random recombinations at the network nodes. In this paper we tackle this problem with a new approach and propose Band Codes (BC), a novel class of network codes specifically designed to preserve the packet degree distribution during packet encoding, recombination and decoding. BC are random codes over GF(2) that exhibit low decoding complexity, feature limited and controlled degree distribution by construction, and hence allow to effectively apply NC even in energy-constrained scenarios. In particular, in this paper we motivate and describe our new design and provide a thorough analysis of its performance. We provide numerical simulations of the BC performance in order to validate the analysis and assess the overhead of BC with respect to a conventional random NC scheme. Moreover, experiment in a real-world application, namely peer-to-peer mobile media streaming using a random-push protocol, show that BC reduce the decoding complexity by a factor of two with negligible increase of the encoding overhead, paving the way for the application of NC to power-constrained devices.", "paper_title": "Band Codes for Energy-Efficient Network Coding With Application to P2P Mobile Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000330245800019"}
