The proposed algorithm combines high-order sliding mode and feedback control. The sliding mode is used to estimate the synchronization error between the master and the slave as well as its time derivatives, while feedback control is used to drive the slave track the master. The stability of the proposed design is proved theoretically, and its performance is verified by some numerical simulations. Compared with some existing synchronization algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows faster convergence and stronger robustness to system uncertainties.", "paper_title": "Robust synchronization of chaotic systems using slidingmode and feedback control", "paper_id": "WOS:000332953000005"}
