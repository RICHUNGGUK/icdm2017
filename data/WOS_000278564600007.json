(2006) [9] and Bouvel and Rossin (2009)[8]. In this model, genomes composed of n genes are modeled by permutations of the set of integers {1, 2, ... , n}, that can evolve through duplication-loss steps. It was previously shown that the class of permutations obtained in this model after a given number p of steps is a class of pattern-avoiding permutations of finite basis. The excluded patterns were described as the minimal permutations with d = 2(p) descents, minimal being intended in the sense of the pattern-involvement relation on permutations. Here, we give a local and simpler characterization of the set B(d) of minimal permutations with d descents. We also provide a more detailed analysis - characterization, bijection and enumeration - of two particular subsets of B(d), namely the patterns in B(d) of size d + 2 and 2d. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
