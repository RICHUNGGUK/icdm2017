The existing GUI modeling methods, however, do not focus on hierarchical GUI and business component modeling based on the MDD and MVC patterns. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematic component-mapping mechanisms integrating GUI and business/DB component modeling, which consequently makes it difficult to establish a GUI component modeling process integrated with business tasks and ultimately deteriorates the reusability of GUI-business application models. This paper proposes a layered metamodel and an integrated modeling process that can hierarchically build a GUI-business component model based on MDD and MVC. Towards this end, the GUI metamodel and the component metamodel hierarchically established based on the PIM/PSM (MDD) and MVC styles are first defined. Then a GUI-business component modeling process is constructed based on these metamodels, in three modeling phases. Finally, the result of a case study in which the proposed method is applied to an ISMS system is discussed. With the use of the modeling elements and modeling process of the well-defined metamodels based on MDD and MVC, it is hoped that it can be shown that a systematic and layered GUI-business component model can be established, and that the reusability of the constructed GUI-business model can be maximized.", "paper_title": "AN INTEGRATED GUI-BUSINESS COMPONENT MODELING METHOD FOR THE MDD- AND MVC-BASED HIERARCHICAL DESIGNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293094300008"}
