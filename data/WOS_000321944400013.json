Sometimes graphics show information models miss, sometimes graphics help to make model results more understandable, and sometimes models show whether information from graphics has statistical support or not. It is the interplay of the two approaches that is valuable. Graphics could be used a lot more in R examples and we explore this idea with some datasets available in R packages.", "paper_title": "Let Graphics Tell the Story - Datasets in R", "paper_id": "WOS:000321944400013"}
