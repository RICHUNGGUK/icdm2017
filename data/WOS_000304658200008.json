The compulsory spectrum sensing is a critical component to facilitate systems co-existence. In this paper, we propose a new Time-Division Energy Efficient (TDEE) sensing scheme in which the sensing period is divided into an optimal number of timeslots and each Secondary User (SU) is assigned to detect a different channel in one time-slot. An important advantage of TDEE is that the SUs do not need to exchange the control messages for the acknowledgement of a successful cooperation, leading to substantial energy saving without compromising sensing accuracy. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are investigated with respect to the intrinsic trade-off between spectrum efficiency and energy-efficiency. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed TDEE is able to achieve much lower energy consumption and higher throughput, compared to the existing mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Spectrum Discovery for Cognitive Radio Green Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200008"}
