The database is derived from 520 quarterly financial reports of all listed construction companies in Taiwan that have now or in the past five years made foreign investment in China's construction industry. The input variables are set to all 25 financial ratios assessable in public, reducing to 11 ratios after feature deduction using t-test. The model yields a high successful classification rate of 90.6% and generates 14 and 18 rules for Taiwan construction companies performing or not performing foreign investment in China, respectively. The valuable rules give user a closer look at what is the appropriate corporate financial status, what knowledge can be shared from the interpretations of the rules, and the impact by investment on corporate finance.
