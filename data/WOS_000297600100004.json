Design/methodology/approach - The data were obtained from an online survey of 274 SN web site users. Structural equation modelling analysis was used to validate the proposed model. Findings - The results indicate that social influence affects intention directly through the compliance process. Social influence, when exerted through the identification and internalization processes, affects intention indirectly via the two interpersonal motives (sociability and status) and perceived enjoyment. The two interpersonal motives affect intention indirectly via perceived enjoyment. Research limitations/implications - This study advances theory by examining how the social influence processes affect one's behavioural intention via the interpersonal and hedonic motives. Practical implications These findings help online SNs to devise strategies to attract and retain users. Originality/value - This study provides evidence that social influence processes are also operative in one's adoption of information technology in non-work settings. It also shows that people have two interpersonal motives in mind when they develop an online relationship with others.", "paper_title": "Online social network acceptance: a social perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000297600100004"}
