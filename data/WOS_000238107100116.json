It defines distributed data structures based on an abstract object called a vector map. It uses co-array syntax, embedded in methods associated with distributed objects, for communication between those objects based on information in the vector map. It applies a finite difference operator to the shallow water equations to illustrate how to use the library to calculate solutions for partial differential equations.", "paper_title": "A parallel numerical library for Co-array Fortran", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100116"}
