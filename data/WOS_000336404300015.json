A physical example of the emerging genre of \"architectural robotics,\" AWE features a programmable, reconfigurable \"wall,\" three horizontal, mobile work-surfaces, and embedded information technologies. AWE is the result of an iterative design process involving surveys, task analyses, virtual and physical prototyping, and usability testing accomplished by a transdisciplinary team of engineers, architects, sociologists, and human factors psychologists. Usability testing has demonstrated AWE's potential to enhance working life: AWE adapts to variations in complex activities involving users working in one physical place with physical and digital tools and artifacts.", "paper_title": "AWE: an animated work environment for working with physical and digital tools and artifacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000336404300015"}
