We used the above method for some nonlinear examples to show how implementation and efficiency of the method. Numerical results show that the homotopy analysis method is a very effective and simple technique for such systems. Examples for linear systems are so easy that has been ignored.", "paper_title": "Homotopy analysis method for systems of integro-differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600003"}
