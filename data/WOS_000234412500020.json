Thanks to the binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) nature of the channel, the pairwise error probability (PEP) is equal to the tail probability of a sum of random variables with a particular distribution. This probability is in turn computed with a saddlepoint approximation. Its precision is numerically validated for coded transmission over standard Gaussian noise and fully interleaved fading channels for both convolutional and turbo-like codes.", "paper_title": "Error probability analysis of bit-interleaved coded modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234412500020"}
