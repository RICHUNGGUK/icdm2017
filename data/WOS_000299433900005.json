In this study, we extend existing finite element models of stress-mediated growth and remodelling of arteries to incorporate a medical image-based geometry of a healthy aorta and, then, simulate abdominal aortic aneurysm. Degradation of elastin initiates a local dilatation of the aorta while stress-mediated turnover of collagen and smooth muscle compensates the loss of elastin. Stress distributions and expansion rates during the aneurysm growth are studied for multiple spatial distribution functions of elastin degradation and kinetic parameters. Temporal variations of the degradation function are also investigated with either direct time-dependent degradation or stretch-induced degradation as possible biochemical and biomechanical mechanisms for elastin degradation. The results show that this computational model has the capability to capture the complexities of aneurysm progression due to variations of geometry, extent of damage and stress-mediated turnover as a step towards patient-specific modelling.", "paper_title": "A finite element model of stress-mediated vascular adaptation: application to abdominal aortic aneurysms", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433900005"}
