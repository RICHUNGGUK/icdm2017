However, there are certain key issues that are preventing the field from addressing larger domains and from achieving wide-scale impact. Formulating these as grand challenges arguably focuses attention on these key issues and may bring a critical mass of effort to bear that could result in a major leap forward. This article is one of several concurrent activities aimed at reinvigorating the debate on grand challenges in M&S. These grand challenges include Big Simulation, human behavior, composability, cloud-based M&S, reproducibility in M&S research and the democratization of M&S. Two themes emerge: the need for large-scale cloud-based cyberinfrastructures for M&S and the democratized access to M&S and its outputs.", "paper_title": "Grand challenges for modeling and simulation: simulation everywherefrom cyberinfrastructure to clouds to citizens", "paper_id": "WOS:000358121600004"}
