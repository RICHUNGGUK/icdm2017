Since each potential partner has a different technology the one whose technology better complements ours is the one that will bring the greatest synergy to the technology of the joint venture. Models for the cases that the joint venture is planning to open one or several facilities are presented. A priori and ex-post measures of synergy between the partners are proposed. Also, a simple way of sharing the costs of the horizontal cooperation based on cooperative game theory is presented. The proposed approach is quite flexible and can be extended to include multiple-partner joint ventures as well as a multi-period planning horizon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
