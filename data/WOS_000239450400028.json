The OSGi framework supports a remote installation of a bundle, which is a unit that installs and deploys services and service matching method based on service syntax. However, in order for the service in ubiquitous computing environment, a specific form of bundle such a mobile service manager is needed, one which is able to move through a heterogeneous network. And more precise service matching mechanism is needed, one which is able to search services using semantic description. This paper proposes a method that can manage bundles for supporting dynamic service's mobility between frameworks, in order to ensure the mobility of services in a multiple the OSGi framework environment and a method that can search service using extended OWL-S. This service management system we are proposing implements a bundle form which can perform in an OSGi framework as well as manage the mobile services and semantic service matching mechanism. As a result, service management in a ubiquitous computing environment will be supported more efficiently.", "paper_title": "Design of service management system in OSGi based ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400028"}
