The user is asked to specify a set of regions belonging to a single image. Then this request set of regions is compared to the sets of the regions of the images in the database. We propose a comparison measure that not only evaluates the similarity of regions one to the other, but that also takes into account the spatial configuration of the regions. The spatial structure of the regions is represented by means of fuzzy spatial relations, like horizontal and vertical disposal and connexity.
