An intrusion detection mechanism based on self-tolerance, clone selection, and immune surveillance, is established. The method, which uses antibody concentration to quantitatively describe the degree of intrusion danger, is demonstrated. And quantitative calculations of response cost and benefit are achieved. Then, the response decision-making mechanism of maximum response benefit is developed, and a dynamic intrusion response system which is self-adaptation is set up. The experiment results show that the proposed model is a good solution to intrusion response in the network.", "paper_title": "Immune-based dynamic intrusion response model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300013"}
