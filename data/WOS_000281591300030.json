The proposed Type-II fuzzy image processing method has four distinct modules: Pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Approximate Reasoning. We develop a fuzzy rule base by aggregating the existing filtering methods for Pre-processing step. For Segmentation step, we extend the Possibilistic C-Mean (PCM) method by using the Type-II fuzzy concepts, Mahalanobis distance, and Kwon validity index. Feature Extraction is done by Thresholding method. Finally, we develop a Type-II Approximate Reasoning method to recognize the tumor grade in brain MRI. The proposed Type-II expert system has been tested and validated to show its accuracy in the real world. The results show that the proposed system is superior in recognizing the brain tumor and its grade than Type-I fuzzy expert systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
