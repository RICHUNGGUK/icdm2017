To our knowledge, this problem has only been addressed in two papers before, and with two objectives and heuristic methods. We propose a new heuristic, based on the two-phase Pareto local search, with the aim of generating a good approximation of the Pareto efficient solutions. In the first phase of this method, the supported efficient solutions or a good approximation of these solutions is generated. Then, a neighborhood embedded in the Pareto local search is applied to generate non-supported efficient solutions. In order to get high quality results, two elaborate local search techniques are considered: a large neighborhood search and a variable neighborhood search. We intensively study the parameters of these two techniques. We compare our results with state-of-the-art results and we show that with our method, better results are obtained for different indicators.", "paper_title": "Variable and large neighborhood search to solve the multiobjective set covering problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000339821900003"}
