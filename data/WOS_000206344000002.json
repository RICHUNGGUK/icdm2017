However, with only busy tone signals, senders cannot determine the receiving status of their intended receivers. Invitations from intended senders may fail owing to the non-receivable status of their intended receivers rather than owing to collisions. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Busy tone and Carrier sense-based MAC protocol (HBCMA). Simulation results show that HBCMA achieves better performance than a purely busy tone-based protocol.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Busy tone and Carrier sense-based MAC protocol in multi-hop ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000206344000002"}
