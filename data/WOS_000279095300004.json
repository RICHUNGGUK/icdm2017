To develop efficient soil erosion control best management practices, the soil erosion status in the target areas first needs to be understood spatially and temporally. The SATEEC system has been widely used for soil erosion studies because of its ease-of-use and limited input data requirement. However. SATEEC cannot be used for spatiotemporal analysis of soil erosion studies. Thus, the time-variant R, C, and GA-SDR modules were developed and integrated with the SATEEC system. The enhanced SATEEC 2.0 system estimated sediment yield values were compared with measured data for the Imha watershed. The re value and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient were 0.72 and 0.72, respectively for calibration and 0.91 and 0.88, respectively for validation with the time-variant R, C and GA-SDR modules. The statistics indicate the enhanced SATEEC 2.0 system with these modules can be used for spatial and temporal analysis of soil erosion and sediment yield with higher accuracy and a limited input dataset, which is the primary philosophy of the SATEEC ArcView GIS system. Since the daily USLE C database was obtained from SWAT runs using the climate data and agricultural management data in Korea, the daily USLE C database should be adjusted depending on the climate condition and agricultural management when the SATEEC is applied to other watersheds having different climate and agricultural management systems.
