The structure and architecture will require high efficiency and scalability in network operation and management. In this paper, we address main requirements and challenges of future cellular networks and introduce network function virtualisation (NFV) with software defined networking (SDN) to realize the self-organizing (SO) scheme. NFV integrates the hardware appliances together in industry standard servers. And SDN performs as core controller of the network. The proposed SO scheme is based on soft fractional frequency reuse (SFFR) framework. The scheme takes different traffic demands into consideration and allocates the power adaptively. Finally the system is proved to be more scalable, energy-saving, and intelligent.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Scheme Based on NFV and SDN Architecture for Future Heterogeneous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360003900007"}
