In this paper a new approach to topic tracking of Chinese news Web pages is presented. We have developed several relatively simple NIP methods for extracting temporal information from, news texts and key Web contexts from HTML, with the goal of improving performance of TDT tasks. Temporal information is used to increase the similarity between the news and topics which happened at the same time because of the fact that the same type of events happened on the same time. Because key Web contexts are used to get weighted model of TDT system, we have made these information elements play a more important role in the similarity match between the news and the topics. The technique is implemented in a framework of dependency structure language model (DSLM). The experiments show remarkable improvements to the existing approaches.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING TOPIC TRACKING FOR CHINESE NEWS WEB PAGES WITH TEMPORAL INFORMATION AND KEY WEB CONTEXTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900034"}
