Therefore geological section automatic recognition is a core process for risk identification automation, however, legends in the geological section map automatic recognition by computer is a foundation work. This paper proposes the categories of legends, the challenges and probabilities of legends recognition, and presents the methodology and detailed algorithms of legend of \"clay\" and \"silty clay\" recognition as example. At last an automatic legends recognition application example on the project of Pangxiejia Station of Wuhan Metro Line 2 is presented and geological stratum information recognition algorithms of the station exterior is proposed.", "paper_title": "Two Typical Legends Automatic Recognition in Geological Section Map of Metro Project", "paper_id": "WOS:000360311800019"}
