Firstly, the spectrogram of the emotional speech is calculated. Secondly, imitating the selective attention mechanism, the color, direction and brightness map of the spectrogram is computed. Each map is normalized and down-sampled to form the low resolution feature matrix. Then, each feature matrix is converted to the row vector and the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce features redundancy to make the subsequent classification algorithm more practical. Finally, the speech emotion is classified with the support vector machine. Compared with the tradition features, the improved recognition rate reaches 15%.", "paper_title": "A Salient Feature Extraction Algorithm for Speech Emotion Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422200014"}
