In practice, most companies rely on experienced engineers to visually find the specific WBM patterns. However, as wafer size is enlarged and integrated circuit (IC) feature size is continuously shrinking, WBM patterns become complicated due to the differences of die size, wafer rotation, the density of failed dies and thus human judgments become inconsistent and unreliable. To fill the gaps, this study aims to develop a knowledge-based intelligent system for WBMs defect diagnosis for yield enhancement in wafer fabrication. The proposed system consisted of three parts: graphical user interface, the WBM clustering solution, and the knowledge database. In particular, the developed WBM clustering approach integrates spatial statistics test, cellular neural network (CNN), adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network, and moment invariant (MI) to cluster different patterns effectively. In addition, an interactive converse interface is developed to present the possible root causes in the order of similarity matching and record the diagnosis know-how from the domain experts into the knowledge database. To validate the proposed WBM clustering solution, twelve different WBM patterns collected in real settings are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in terms of purity, diversity, specificity, and efficiency. The results have shown the validity and practical viability of the proposed system. Indeed, the developed solution has been implemented in a leading semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan. The proposed WBM intelligent system can recognize specific failure patterns efficiently and also record the assignable root causes verified by the domain experts to enhance troubleshooting effectively.
