In terms of assessing similarity between two nodes, current distance approaches suffer from its nature that only parent-child relationships among nodes are captured in the hierarchy. This paper presents an idea of treating a hierarchy as a set rather than as a tree in the traditional view. The established set theory is applied to provide the foundation where the relations between nodes can be mathematically specified and results in a more powerful and logical assessment of similarity between nodes.", "paper_title": "A set theoretic view of the ISA hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800016"}
