To find lower bounds, we compare fractal percolation with site percolation. Fundamentally new is the construction of a computable increasing sequence that converges to p(c)(M). We prove that pc(2)>0.881 and pc(3)>0.784. For the upper bounds, we introduce an iterative random process on a finite alphabet A, which is easier to analyze than the original process. We show that pc(2)0.993,pc(3)0.940 and pc(4)0.972.
