Many Current machine learning paradigms used for this purpose, however, result in opaque models that are difficult, if not impossible to analyse, which is an impediment in safety-critical applications or application scenarios where humans and robots occupy the same workspace. In experiments with a Magellan Pro mobile robot we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain transparent models of sensor-motor Couplings that are amenable to subsequent analysis, and flow such analysis can be used to refine and tune the models post hoc.
