Being a resource-intensive application, how to maximize resource utilization is a key issue of designing such an application. Due to the special cloud-based VOD system architecture consisting of cloud storage cluster and media server cluster, existing techniques such as traditional caching strategies are inappropriate to be adopted by a cloud-based VOD system directly in practice. Therefore, in this study, we have proposed a systemic caching scheme, which seamlessly integrates a caching algorithm and a cache deployment algorithm together to maximize the resources utilization of cloud-based VOD system. Firstly, we have proposed a cloud-based caching algorithm. The algorithm models the cloud-based VOD system as a multi-constraint optimization problem, so as to balance the resource utilization between cloud storage cluster and media server cluster. Secondly, we have proposed a cache deployment algorithm. The algorithm further manages the bandwidth and cache space resource utilization inside the media server cluster in a more fine-grained manner, and achieves load balancing performance. Our evaluation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the resource utilization of the cloud-based VOD system under resource-constrained situation, and cuts down the reject ratio of user requests.", "paper_title": "CBC: Caching for cloud-based VOD systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200025"}
