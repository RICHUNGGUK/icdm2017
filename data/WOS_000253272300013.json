To achieve more sufficient representation of various visual properties of the images, both the global visual features and the local visual features are extracted for image content representation. To tackle the problem of huge intraconcept visual diversity, multiple types of kernels are integrated to characterize the diverse visual similarity relationships between the images more precisely, and a multiple kernel learning algorithm is developed for SVM image classifier training. To address the problem of huge interconcept visua similarity, a novel multitask learning algorithm is developed to learn the correlated classifiers for the sibling image concepts under the same parent concept and enhance their discrimination and adaptation power significantly. To tackle the problem of huge intraconcept visual diversity for the image concepts at the higher levels of the concept ontology, a novel hierarchical boosting algorithm is developed to learn their ensemble classifiers hierarchically. In order to assist users on selecting more effective hypotheses for image classifier training, we have developed a novel hyperbolic framework for large-scale image visualization and interactive hypotheses assessment. Our experiments on large-scale image collections have also obtained very positive results.", "paper_title": "Integrating concept ontology and multitask learning to achieve more effective classifier training for multilevel image annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272300013"}
