This paper proposes domain-based autoconfiguration framework (DACF), a novel approach for the efficient address autoconfiguration of MANETs. To construct a hierarchy of addresses, this framework defines a loose domain structure where nodes in the same domain may roam to different locations after they are configured. This framework uses the passive Duplicate Address Detection(PDAD) but the proposed domain structure is able to reduce the initial conflict probability and accelerate the conflict resolution significantly. To evaluate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed framework, we also present an exemplified full-functioned implementation of the proposed framework. Through the detailed analysis and simulation, we believe the proposed scheme provides a promising autoconfiguration framework for large-scale MANETs.
