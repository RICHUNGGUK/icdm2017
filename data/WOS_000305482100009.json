The search domain for the DMDGP is a binary tree that can be effciently explored by employing a Branch & Prune (BP) algorithm. We showed in recent works that this binary tree may contain several symmetries, which are directly related to the total number of solutions of DMDGP instances. In this paper, we study the possibility of exploiting these symmetries for speeding up the solution of DMDGPs, and propose an extension of the BP algorithm that we named symmetry-driven BP (symBP). Computational experiments on artificial and protein instances are presented.", "paper_title": "EXPLOITING SYMMETRY PROPERTIES OF THE DISCRETIZABLE MOLECULAR DISTANCE GEOMETRY PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000305482100009"}
