Our approach combines the structure event detection method with the highlight ranking algorithm. Firstly, unsupervised shot clustering and supervised audio classification are performed to obtain the visual and audio mid-level patterns respectively. Then, a temporal voting scheme for structure event detection is proposed by utilizing the correspondence between audio and video content. Finally, by using the affective features extracted from the detected events, a linear highlight model is adopted to rank the detected events in terms of their exciting degrees. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
