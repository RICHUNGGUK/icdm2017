Its simplified format, neural oscillator, is wildly adopted in engineering application. This paper explores the CPG from an integral view that combines biology and engineering together. Biological CPG and simplified CPG are both studied. Computer simulation reveals the mechanism of CPG. Some properties, such as effect of tonic input and sensory feedback, stable oscillation, robustness, entrainment etc., are further studied. The promising results provide foundation for the potential engineering application in future.", "paper_title": "Computer simulation study on central pattern generator: From biology to engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000243806000002"}
