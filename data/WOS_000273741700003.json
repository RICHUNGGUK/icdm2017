These rearrangements lead to the scrambling of the elements of one genome with respect to another descended from a common ancestor. Multidisciplinary work undertakes to mathematically model these processes and to develop statistical analyses and mathematical algorithms to understand the scrambling in the chromosomes of two or more related genomes. A major focus is the reconstruction of the gene order of the ancestral genomes.", "paper_title": "Issues in the Reconstruction of Gene Order Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000273741700003"}
