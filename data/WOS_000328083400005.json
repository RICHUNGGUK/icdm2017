The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors that influence the effectiveness of SMS advertising by using a hierarchy of effects approach. We employ a simulated experiment with 736 respondents to examine how consumers react to SMS advertisements and identify factors that influence their attitude toward the ad, their attitude toward the brand, and their purchase intention. Perceived ad credibility, attitude toward mobile advertising, message appeal, argument quality, incentive, product involvement, and interactivity were found to be antecedents of the attitude toward the ad. Moreover, there is a clear link between attitude and behavioral intention. The study is among the first to provide an experimental-based assessment and a unified model linking consumer attitudes toward mobile text ads with brand attitudes and purchase intentions.", "paper_title": "Consumer Responses to SMS Advertising: Antecedents and Consequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000328083400005"}
