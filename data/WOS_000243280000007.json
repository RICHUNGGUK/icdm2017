A high-resolution scheme is constructed by developing an exponential-fitting method with the slope limiter in a class of conservative schemes to simulate the flow of electrons with quantum confinement effects in MOSFETs. This method is reinterpreted as a flux-limiter method that hybridizes a low-order flux and a high-order flux into a single numerical flux. The discretization method provides good approximations to the density profile in the smooth regions and boundary layers of the electron flow and allows high-resolution simulations of quantum confinement transport in ultrasmall MOSFETs.", "paper_title": "A high-resolution method for quantum confinement transport Simulations in MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243280000007"}
