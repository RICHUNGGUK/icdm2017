The model consists of water flow governing equations, sediment transport governing equations, transport-transformation equation of chemicals and convection-diffusion equations of sorption-desorption kinetics of particulate chemical concentrations on suspended load, bed load and bed sediment. The chemical transport-transformation equation is basically a mass balance equation. It demonstrates how sediment transport affects transport-transformation of chemicals in fluvial rivers. The convection-diffusion equations of sorption-desorption kinetics of chemicals, being an extension of batch reactor experimental results, take both physical transport, i.e. convection and diffusion, and chemical reactions, i.e. sorption-desorption into account. The effects of sediment transport on chemical transport-transformation were clarified through three simple examples. Specifically, the transport-transformation of chemicals in a steady, uniform and equilibrium sediment-laden flow was calculated by applying this model, and results were shown to be rational. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicated that the transport-transformation of chemicals in sediment-laden flows with a clay-enriched riverbed possesses not only the generality of common tracer pollutants, but also characteristics of transport-transformation induced by sediment motion. Future work will be conducted to present the validation/application of the model with available data.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional numerical modeling of chemical transport-transformation in fluvial rivers: formulation of equations and physical interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264660400002"}
