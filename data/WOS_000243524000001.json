This interaction enables the astrocyte to modulate the information flow from presynaptic to postsynaptic cells in a manner dependent on previous activity at this and other nearby synapses. Our model suggests a novel, testable hypothesis for the spike timing statistics measured for rapidly firing cells in culture experiments.", "paper_title": "The astrocyte as a gatekeeper of synaptic information transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000243524000001"}
