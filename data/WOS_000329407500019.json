Recently, observing about sensors demonstrates that for better accuracy, faster response time and enlarged sensitivity, it needs to be improved. Nowadays, carbon-based equipments as an exclusive substance are remarkable in the sensing technology. High conductivity as unique properties caused that graphene can be used in biological applications. Gas sensor based on graphene can be supposed to have great sensitivity for gas molecules detection. In this study, graphene-based carbon dioxide sensor analytically is modeled. In addition, new methods of gas sensor model based on the gradient of GNR conductance are provided. Also, a field effect transistor-based structure as a modeling platform is suggested. Ultimately, optimum model is evaluated by comparison study between analytical model and experimental performance.", "paper_title": "The effect of concentration on gas sensor model based on graphene nanoribbon", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500019"}
