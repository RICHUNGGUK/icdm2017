The Snoop protocol, a link layer solution introduced several years ago to improve the performance of TCP in this scenario, has been shown to neglect its benefits to the most widely used TCP version, TCP SACK. In this paper, we introduce the TCP SACK-Aware Snoop protocol to address this problem. Our results indicate that the TCP SACK-Aware Snoop protocol improves the performance of TCP SACK by around 30% compared with the original Snoop protocol and by about 8% in an environment where no TCP enhancing mechanism is in place. In addition, we introduce further modifications to the proposed protocol to make its advantages available to any TCP sender. We also show that the mechanism does not introduce unfairness among TCP sources and somewhat protects TCP against UDP traffic. Our results show important throughput improvements to all TCP versions and demonstrate that the TCP SACK-Aware Snoop protocol shields TCP from last hop wireless losses providing throughtput values very close to the maximum possible.
