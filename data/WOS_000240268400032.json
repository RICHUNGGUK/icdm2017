It is important to understand how human players try to teach virtual agents in order to design agents that learn effectively from this instruction. We present results of a user study where people teach a virtual agent a novel task within a reinforcement-based learning framework. Analysis yields lessons of how human players approach the task of teaching a virtual agent: 1) they want to direct the agent's attention; 2) they communicate both instrumental and motivational intentions; 3) they tailor their instruction to their understanding of the agent; and 4) they use negative communication as both feedback and as a suggestion for the next action. Based on these findings we modify the agent's learning algorithm and show improvements to the learning interaction in follow-up studies. This work informs the design of real-time learning agents that better match human teaching behavior to learn more effectively and be more enjoyable to teach.", "paper_title": "Teachable characters: User studies, design principles, and learning performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400032"}
