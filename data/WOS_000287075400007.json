Such a class of cooperative games was introduced by Mares in 1999. Different from Mares' approach, the F-core generalizes the interval core introduced by Alparslan, Branzei and Tijs in 2008 for games where the worth of any coalition is a compact interval of the real line. Moreover, we introduce a balanced-like condition and prove that this condition is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee the F-core to be non-empty. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
