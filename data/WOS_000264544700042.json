Despite recent developments for nearly inextensible materials, the efficient simulation of general biphasic textiles and their anisotropic behavior remains challenging. Many approaches use soft materials and enforce limits on edge elongations, leading to discretization-dependent behavior. Moreover, they offer no explicit control over shearing and stretching unless specifically aligned meshes are used. Based on a continuum deformation measure, our method allows accurate control over all strain components using individual thresholds. We impose deformation limits element-wise and cast the problem as a 6x6 system of linear equations. CSL can be combined with any cloth simulator and, as a velocity filter, integrates seamlessly into standard collision handling.", "paper_title": "Continuum-based Strain Limiting", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700042"}
