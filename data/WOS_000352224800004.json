Partitioning and scheduling SDF graphs onto homogeneous architectures is a well-known NP-hard problem. The heterogeneity of the execution architecture makes our problem exponentially challenging to solve. We model the problem as a weighted sum and solve it using novel state space exploration inspired from the theory of parallel automata. The resultant heuristic algorithm results in good scheduling when implemented in an existing stream framework.", "paper_title": "Heuristics on Reachability Trees for Bicriteria Scheduling of Stream Graphs on Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000352224800004"}
