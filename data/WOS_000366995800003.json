Therefore, load analysis must be conducted before confirming the plans. However, conducting the analysis using the traditional mathematical model is difficult. This study suggests using the discrete event simulation (DES) method for load analysis in advance. The simulation model of actual shipyard block logistics is established by the DES software. Data on the structure of the product, process, resource, and schedule are clearly defined to match the DES model. Partial results through the simulation are discussed in terms of real production activities. The outputs prove that the proposed simulation model can help planners arrive at reasonable and rational decisions related to shipbuilding plans. This simulation method can contribute in strengthening the competitiveness of shipyards.", "paper_title": "Ship Block Logistics Simulation Based on Discrete Event Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366995800003"}
