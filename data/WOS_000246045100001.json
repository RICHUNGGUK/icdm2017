Specifically, the paper focuses on Delta Sigma analog-to-digital converters (ADC). The method creates compiled-code simulators based on symbolic analysis. Code is optimized using loop invariant elimination and constant folding, well-known compiler optimization methods. Circuits are described as structural macromodels. Nonlinear parameters are expressed using piecewise linear (PWL) models. The paper presents a technique for automatically creating PWL models through model extraction from trained neural networks. As compared to existing behavioral simulation methods for Delta Sigma ADC, this technique is more systematic and accurate. In our experiments, compiled-code simulation was significantly faster than numerical simulation. Hence, the methodology is very useful in analog and mixed-signal system synthesis, which is known to require a large number of simulation steps. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
