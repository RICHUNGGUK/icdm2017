Charikar et al.'s algorithm is well-known for this problem. It achieves an approximation guarantee of l(l - 1)k(1/l) in O(n(l)k(2l)) time for any fixed level l > 1, where 1 is the level of the tree produced by the algorithm, n is the number of vertices, vertical bar V vertical bar, and k is the number of terminals, vertical bar X vertical bar. However, it requires a great amount of computing power, and there are some problems in the proof of the approximation guarantee of the algorithm. This paper provides a faster approximation algorithm improving Charikar et al.'s DSP algorithm with a better time complexity, O(n(l)K(l) + n(2)k + nm), where m is the number of edges, and an amended root 8k - delta In k factor for the 2-level Steiner tree, where delta = root 6 - 2 = 0.4494.", "paper_title": "FasterDSP: A faster approximation algorithm for directed Steiner tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242243500007"}
