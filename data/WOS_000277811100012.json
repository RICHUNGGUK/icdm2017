To alleviate the inter-ISP traffic load and to minimize the access latency, proxy caching has been widely suggested for P2P applications. In this paper, we carry out an extensive measurement study on the properties of P2P live streaming data requests. Our measurement demonstrates that the P2P living streaming traffic exhibits strong localities that could be explored by caching. This is particularly noticeable for the temporal locality, which is often much weaker in the conventional P2P file sharing applications. Our results further suggest that the request time of the same data piece from different peers exhibits a generalized extreme value distribution. We then propose a novel sliding window (SLW)-based caching algorithm, which predicts and caches popular data pieces according to the measured distribution. Our experimental results suggest that the P2P live streaming can greatly benefit from the proxy caching. And, with much lower overhead, our SLW algorithm works closer to an off-line optimal algorithm that holds the complete knowledge of future requests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
