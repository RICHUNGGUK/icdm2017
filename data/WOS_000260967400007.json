In this approach, a new and simple method, which we termed Failure Analysis of Structures (FAST), is used to estimate the stress-intensity factor for cracks at a notch. The methodology and software used to automate damage-tolerance calculations are developed using computer-aided design and FAST codes. The worst crack locations are found by modeling many cracks along fractured critical edges of the structure by using FAST. This software is then used to evaluate damage-tolerance objective functions for optimisation algorithms. A particular stress-based biological growth method is employed to study the problem of optimisation with fatigue life as the design objective. This work confirms that a stress-optimised structure does not necessarily give the longest fatigue life by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A CAD-based on biological method for designing optimal fatigue life", "paper_id": "WOS:000260967400007"}
