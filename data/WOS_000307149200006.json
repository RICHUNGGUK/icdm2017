We show that the diameter of a fullerene graph G of order n is at least root 24n-15-3/6 and at most n/5 + 1. Moreover, if G is not a (5, 0)-nanotube its diameter is at most n/6+5/2. As a consequence, we improve the upper bound on the saturation number of fullerene graphs. We also report an improved lower bound on the independence number and an upper bound on the smallest eigenvalue of fullerene graphs, confirming some conjectures for large fullerene graphs.", "paper_title": "On the Diameter and Related Invariants of Fullerene Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000307149200006"}
