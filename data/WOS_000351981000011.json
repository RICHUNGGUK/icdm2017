The new element uses a u-p formulation to consider the interaction of the pore fluid and solid skeleton. An hourglass stabilization scheme facilitates single-point integration for the solid phase terms, and non-residual pressure field stabilization is used to facilitate equal-order interpolation for the two phases and improve element behavior in the incompressible-impermeable limit. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the new element formulation and demonstrate its response in a geotechnical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
