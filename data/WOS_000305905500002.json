In addition to different types of objects, adopting up-to-date parameters and complex reaction processes, we newly introduce ion-induced and natural defects into our model. This improved model programmed in IRadMat2 could describe very well the depth distributions and the amounts of hydrogen retained in tungsten under different radiation conditions. The calculated results agree with the experimental ones much better than the previous model, especially for the depth-distribution of D retained in W, which imply that this model is applicable to the evolution of defects especially for low energy high flux ions irradiated on plasma-facing materials.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED CLUSTER DYNAMICS MODEL FOR HYDROGEN RETENTION IN TUNGSTEN", "paper_id": "WOS:000305905500002"}
