A continuous bridge with box girders is considered as a case study. The dynamic responses of the bridge and the running safety indices of the train on the bridge under three types of collision loads are analyzed. Large responses of the bridge induced by collision strongly threaten the running safety of trains. An assessment procedure is proposed for the running safety of high-speed trains on bridges subjected to collision loads, and related threshold curves for train speed versus collision intensity are defined.
