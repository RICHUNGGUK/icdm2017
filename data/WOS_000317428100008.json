Dourish used Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception as the theoretical basis for his discussion of the bodily nature of embodied interaction. This article extends Dourish's work to introduce the human-computer interaction community to ideas related to Merleau-Ponty's concept of the lived body. It also provides a detailed analysis of two related topics: (1) embodied perception: the active and embodied nature of perception, including the body's ability to extent its sensory apparatus through digital technology; and (2) kinaesthetic creativity: the body's ability to relate in a direct and creative fashion with the \"feel\" dimension of interactive products during the design process.", "paper_title": "Interaction Design for and with the Lived Body: Some Implications of Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology", "paper_id": "WOS:000317428100008"}
