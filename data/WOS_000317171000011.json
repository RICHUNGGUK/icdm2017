Two variants of AMLS hybrid Subspace Iteration Method (AMLS-SIMa and AMLS-SIMb) are proposed. AMLS-SIMa is a derivative of the basic subspace iteration by utilizing the AMLS approximations as initial vectors. AMLS-SIMb further takes advantage of the AMLS transformed block diagonal stiffness matrix to avoid factorization of the original stiffness matrix. Numerical experiments show that: (a) the error of AMLS approximate eigenpairs can be significantly reduced with just a few iteration steps; (b)AMLS-SIMb is more efficient than AMLS-SIMa with less execution time.
