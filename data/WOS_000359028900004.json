The crucial point of all focus fusion methods is the decision about the in-focus areas. To this end, we present a general framework for focus fusion that introduces a modern regularisation strategy on these per-pixel decisions. We assume that neighbouring pixels in the fused image belong to similar depth layers. Following this assumption, we smooth the depth map with a sophisticated anisotropic diffusion process combined with a robust data fidelity term. The experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our new model yields a better quality than several existing focus fusion methods. Moreover, our methodology is general and can be applied to improve many fusion approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
