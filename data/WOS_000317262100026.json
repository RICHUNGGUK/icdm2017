This method is superior to the standard scheme in the sense that Azarenok presents in Azarenok (2006) [2]. It produces grids with good quality measured in terms of [2] and Ushakova (2001) [3]. To illustrate this new grid generation method, we include an application to a blast wave problem simulation in simply-connected domains studied by LeVeque et al. (2008) [9], where the resulting grids are smoother/better than [9]. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
