Our idea is to extend the language with \"witnesses,\" which is based on an arguably more pragmatic motivation than past approaches. We give a semantic condition for correctness and prove it is sufficient. We also give a somewhat surprising static checking algorithm that makes use of a network flow property equivalent to the semantic condition via reduction to a satisfaction problem for a system of linear inequalities.", "paper_title": "Witnessing side effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000256425100004"}
