We consider the stability of this subroutine when exposed to a discrete error model that acts to perturb the computational trajectory of a quantum computer. Through detailed state vector simulations of an appropriate quantum circuit, we show that the error locations within the circuit itself heavily influences the probability of success of the QPF subroutine. The results also indicate that the naive estimate of required component precision is too conservative.", "paper_title": "Robustness of Shor's algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000243571800005"}
