The channelizer operates at the highest sampling rate in the digital front end of receiver and hence power efficient low complex architecture is required for cost-effective implementation of channelizer. Reconfigurability is another key requirement in the channelizer to support different communication standards. In this paper, we propose a low complexity reconfigurable filter bank (FB) channelizer based on coefficient decimation, interpolation and frequency masking techniques. The proposed FB architecture is capable of extracting channels of distinct (non-uniform) bandwidths from the wideband input signal. Design example shows that the proposed FB offers multiplier complexity reduction of 83% over Per-Channel (PC) approach and 60% over Modulated Perfect Reconstruction FB. The proposed FB when designed as a uniform FB (subbands of equal bandwidths), offers a complexity reduction of 20% over Discrete Fourier Transform FB (DFTFB) and 57% over Goertzel Filter Bank. Furthermore, the proposed FB has an added advantage of dynamic reconfigurability over these FBs. The proposed FB is implemented on Xilinx Virtex 2v3000ff1152-4 FPGA with 16 bit precision. The PC approach and DFTFB are also implemented on the same FPGA with 14 bit precision. The implementation results shows an average slice reduction of 29.14% and power reduction of 46.84% over PC approach, 14.39% and 2.67% over DFTFB.", "paper_title": "A Low Complexity Reconfigurable Non-uniform Filter Bank for Channelization in Multi-standard Wireless Communication Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000303383800008"}
