The most suitable adsorption site is found to be atop the center of a six-membered ring of the exterior surface of C-24 molecule. Interaction energies of these cations decreased in the order: Li+ > Na+ > K+, with values of -31.82, -22.36, and -15.68 kcal mol(-1), respectively. It was shown that the interaction energies are increased and decreased by impurity doping of B and N atoms in adjacent wall of adsorption site, depending on electron donating or receptivity of the doping atoms.", "paper_title": "Cation-pi interaction of alkali metal ions with C-24 fullerene: a DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900009"}
