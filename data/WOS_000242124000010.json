First, a characterization of optimal randomized learners is provided and, based on it, optimal teaching teaching times for certain classes are established. Second, the problem of determining the optimal teaching time is shown to be NP-hard. Third, an algorithm for approximating the optimal teaching time is given. Finally, two heuristics for teaching are studied, i.e., cyclic teachers and greedy teachers.", "paper_title": "Teaching memoryless randomized learners without feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124000010"}
