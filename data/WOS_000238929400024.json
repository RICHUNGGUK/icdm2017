In our framework, a mesh is encoded by some differential quantities based on edge length and dihedral angle; and the deformation is formulated as a least square problem for preserving the edge length and dihedral angle via the differential quantities. In order to obtain anisotropic material effects, we further propose an edge-weighting scheme based on a user-specified vector field. To avoid specifying the local transformations, we set tip an iterative scheme for solving the deformation. At last, several examples are presented to show that our approach can interactively generate visually pleasing deformations.
