An optimization problem is formulated, which aims to maximize the average achievable throughput of cooperating cognitive users while keeping the error rate at a lower level. This is a multi-variable nonconvex optimization problem. Instead of solving it directly, we propose an iterative algorithm which jointly optimizes the threshold and sensing time together to decrease the effect of the error and to increase the achievable throughput. We first prove that the local error rate of the cognitive user is a convex function of energy threshold and determine a closed-form for the optimal threshold which minimizes the error rate. Then we show that the AND rule is the optimal fusion rule to maximize the achievable throughput. Furthermore we determine the least number of cooperating cognitive users that can guarantee a minimum target error rate. This initial nonconvex problem is converted into a single variable convex optimization problem which can be successfully solved by common methods e.g. Newton's method. Simulation results illustrate the fast convergence and effectiveness of the joint iterative algorithm. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
