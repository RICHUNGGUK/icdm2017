In this paper we exploit both the structural similarities and sparse prior of image patches and propose a new dictionary learning and similarity regularization based image noise reduction method. By formulating the image noise reduction as a multiple variables optimization problem, we alternately optimize the variables to obtain the denoised image. Some experiments are taken on comparing the performance of our proposed method with its counterparts on some benchmark natural images, and the superiorities of our proposed method to its counterparts can be observed in both the visual results and some numerical guidelines.
