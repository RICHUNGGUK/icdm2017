In this paper, MFCA is introduced to study the environmental impacts of production lot-size determination by structuring simulation models of a multi-variety and small-batch production system in an actual forging factory. It is demonstrated that the proposed procedure of application of simulation with MFCA can also perform a dynamic analysis and a static analysis.", "paper_title": "Analysis of manufacturing systems using simulations in terms of material flow cost accounting", "paper_id": "WOS:000340262700006"}
