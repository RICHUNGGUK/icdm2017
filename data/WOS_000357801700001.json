It is shown that, given an initial formaldehyde concentration of similar to 0.2 ppm, the reactor removes 15 similar to 80% of the formaldehyde at a height of 107 cm and 20 similar to 73% at a height of 180 cm after 5.5 hours. Moreover, it is shown that, in decomposing the formaldehyde, the reaction process does not generate O-3. Finally, it is shown that the reduction in the formaldehyde concentration is particularly significant near the outlet of the plasma reactor and between the reactor and the door.", "paper_title": "Experimental Evaluation of Indoor Formaldehyde Decomposition Performance of Atmospheric Plasma Reactor Utilizing Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000357801700001"}
