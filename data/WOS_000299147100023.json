The ITP defines the structure for communication between telesurgery robots and controllers and has been adopted and tested by fourteen research groups in telesurgical robotics. The Secure ITP uses open source software tools and follows guidelines in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to create asecurity enhancement prototype for demonstration purposes and tofacilitate the development of new security technologies which addressthe stringent requirements of telesurgery.
