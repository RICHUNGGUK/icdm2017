ECT has several advantages over other reconstruction algorithms and has found many applications in the industrial fields. However, there are some difficulties with image reconstruction in ECT: The relationship between the permittivity distribution and measured capacitance is nonlinear. And inverse problem is ill-posed so that the inverse solution is sensitive to measurement error. To cope with these difficulties iterative image reconstruction algorithms have been developed. In general, the iterative reconstruction algorithms in ECT have comparatively good-quality in reconstructed images but result in intensive computational burden. This paper presents the iterative image reconstruction algorithm for ECT that can enhance the speed of image reconstruction without degradation in the quality of reconstructed image. The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is new weighting matrices, which are obtained by the interpolation of the grouped electrical field centre lines (EFCLs). Extensive simulation results have demonstrated that proposed algorithm provides improved reconstruction performance in terms of computational time and image quality.", "paper_title": "Novel iterative image reconstruction algorithm for electrical capacitance tomography: Directional algebraic reconstruction technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500010"}
