The minimum cardinality of such a code is denoted by E(n, R). Upper bounds on this function are here obtained by constructing codes using tabu search; lower bounds, on the other hand, are mainly obtained by integer programming and exhaustive search. Best known bounds on E(n, R) for n <= 13 and R <= 6 are tabulated.", "paper_title": "Unidirectional covering codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000234412500029"}
