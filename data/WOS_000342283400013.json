We also define the C (1) and C (2) discontinuity measures for surface meshes using changing rates of one-sided curvatures or changing rates of curvatures across mesh edges. The curvatures are computed discretely as of local interpolating surfaces that lie within a tolerance to the mesh. Together with proper estimation of local shape parameters, the obtained discontinuity measures own properties like sensitivity to salient joint lines and being scale invariant. A simple algorithm is finally developed for detection of C (1) or C (2) discontinuity joint lines on triangular meshes with even highly non-uniform triangulations. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A computational approach to joint line detection on triangular meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000342283400013"}
