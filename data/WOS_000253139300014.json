For a fair distribution of the CHs, the current CH chooses the next CH according to the two metrics - the number of general nodes (GNs) in a cluster and the number of CHs within the GN's transmission range. By fairly distributing the CHs, the number of GNs in the clusters can be balanced, which leads to fair energy consumption of the CHs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the network lifetime. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
