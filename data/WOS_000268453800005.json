The tracking problem analyzed is the joint estimation of the global and local transformation of the outline of a given target, represented following the active shape model approach. The main contributions of the paper are the novel adaptations of the considered techniques on this generic problem, and the quantitative assessment of their performance in extensive experimental work done.
