Once the graph model is chosen to be a stochastic graph, every feature of the graph such as path, clique, spanning tree and dominating set, to mention a few, should be treated as a stochastic feature. For example, choosing stochastic graph as the graph model of an online social network and defining community structure in terms of clique, and the associations among the individuals within the community as random variables, the concept of stochastic clique may be used to study community structure properties. In this paper maximum clique in stochastic graph is first defined and then several learning automata-based algorithms are proposed for solving maximum clique problem in stochastic graph where the probability distribution functions of the weights associated with the edges of the graph are unknown. It is shown that by a proper choice of the parameters of the proposed algorithms, one can make the probability of finding maximum clique in stochastic graph as close to unity as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the number of samples needed to be taken from the edges of the stochastic graph as compared to the number of samples needed by standard sampling method at a given confidence level.", "paper_title": "Finding Maximum Clique in Stochastic Graphs Using Distributed Learning Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000349848300001"}
