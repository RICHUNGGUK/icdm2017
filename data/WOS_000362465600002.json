This work applies a novel grey fuzzy control process to joint radio resource management (JRRM). In this architecture, the JRRM techniques are divided between grey fuzzy control (GFC) and grey fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (GFMADM). These enhancements lead to a new JRRM architecture which seeks to minimize the multi-user interference, decrease blocking, lower dropping probabilities and improve load balancing. The policy uses the signal strength, path loss, and load algorithms for admission control (AC), horizontal handoff (HHO) and vertical handover (VHO) in a heterogeneous wireless scenario which includes GSM/EDGE radio access network (GERAN), high-speed packet access (HSPA) and long term evolution (LTE) RATs. Our simulation results show that the proposed GFC/GFMADM algorithm can decreases multi-user interference which results in the increasing system radio capacity, decreasing blocking and dropping probabilities and enhancing load balancing.", "paper_title": "Improved Joint Radio Resource Management Usage Grey Fuzzy Control in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362465600002"}
