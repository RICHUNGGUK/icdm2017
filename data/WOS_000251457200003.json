It has not only utilized critical areas of the computer system to survive reboots, but also grown resilient against current anti-spyware tools; they are capable of self-healing themselves against deletion. Because existing anti-spyware tools are stateless in the sense that they do not remember or monitor the spyware programs that were deleted, they fail to remove self-healing spyware from the system completely. This paper proposes a stateful approach that is based on characterizing spyware invasion as a trust information flow problem, and implements STARS (Stateful Threat-Aware Removal System), which is a tool that at run time monitors critical system behaviors, and ensures that removed spyware programs do not reinstall themselves' to enforce information flow policy in the system. If a reinstallation (self-healing) is detected, STARS infers the source of such activities, and discovers additional '' suspicious '' programs. Experimental results show that STARS is effective in removing self-healing spyware programs that resist removal by existing anti-spyware tools.", "paper_title": "Self-healing spyware: Detection, and remediation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251457200003"}
