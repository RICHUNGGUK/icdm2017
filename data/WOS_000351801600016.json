Based on the fractional-order Lyapunov stability theorem, some sufficient conditions are derived to realize the hybrid synchronization of two coupled fractional-order networks. Under suitable condition, two coupled networks can reach the hybrid synchronization, i.e., the outer synchronization between the drive and response networks, and the inner synchronization in each networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and feasility of the proposed synchronization protocol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
