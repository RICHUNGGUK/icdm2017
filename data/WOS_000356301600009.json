This paper considers the impact of noise on such gains due to feedback. In particular, this paper considers the two-user linear deterministic interference channel with noisy feedback, as a stepping stone to characterize the approximate capacity region for the two-user Gaussian interference channel with noisy feedback. First, the capacity region for the symmetric linear deterministic interference channel with noisy feedback is obtained. It is shown that noisy feedback enlarges the capacity region if and only if the number of feedback bits l is greater than a certain threshold l*. It is found that, excluding the regime (1/2) <= alpha <= 2, where a is the normalized interference level, in which even full feedback does not increase symmetric capacity, this threshold l* is equal to the per-user symmetric capacity without feedback. One of the key ideas is a novel converse outer bounding technique for the weighted sum rates 2R(1) + R-2 and R-1 + 2R(2). These results and the techniques developed for the linear deterministic model are then applied to characterize inner bounds and outer bounds for the symmetric Gaussian interference channel with noisy feedback. The outer bounds are shown to be at most 4.7 b/s/Hz away from the achievable rate region. As a corollary, the generalized-degrees-of-freedom region, which approximates the capacity region of the symmetric Gaussian interference channel at high SNR, is found.", "paper_title": "Approximate Capacity Region for the Symmetric Gaussian Interference Channel With Noisy Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600009"}
