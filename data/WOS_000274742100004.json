Thus, when an agent has to emulate human behaviour, not only should this agent think and reason but also should have emotions and personality. In this article a fuzzy agent with dynamic personality is modelled based on a five-factor personality model and implemented in a Java environment. Then it is extended with a fuzzy emotion component. This emotion component uses calculated personality factors and some related parameters and then determines the degree of anger. The proposed personality and emotion model provides a proper framework for human-like agent decision-making tasks.", "paper_title": "Anger evaluation for fuzzy agents with dynamic personality", "paper_id": "WOS:000274742100004"}
