To seek the optimal parameter of RWv-SVC, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The results of application in fault diagnosis of car assembly line show the hybrid diagnosis model based on RWv-SVC and PSO is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is better than v-SVC and Wv-SVC.
