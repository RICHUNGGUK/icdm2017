The most prominent characteristic of flash memory is that prewritten data can only be dynamically updated via the time consuming erase operation. Furthermore, every block in flash memory has a limited program/erase cycle. In order to manage these issues, the flash memory controller can be integrated with a software module called the flash translation layer (FTL). This paper surveys the state-of-art FTL algorithms. The FTL algorithms can be classified by the complexity of the algorithms: basic and advance. Furthermore, they can be classified by their corresponding tasks: performance enhancement and durability enhancement. The FTL algorithms corresponding to each classification are further broken down into various schemes depending on the methods they adopt. This paper also provides the information of hardware features of flash memory for FTL programmers.", "paper_title": "FTL algorithms for NAND-type flash memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000297366500001"}
