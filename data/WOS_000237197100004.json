Compared to simulation, the construction and utilization of a wireless mesh testbed poses many new challenges. We discuss the challenges with distributed testbed management, nonintrusive and distributed monitoring, and node status visualization. These are vital components in a sustainable wireless mesh testbed, but at the same time nontrivial to design and realize. As a case Study, we present the UCSB MeshNet architecture, including its management, monitoring, and visualization systems. We share our lessons learned from this effort and believe that they will be valuable to other researchers who develop experimental wireless mesh networks.", "paper_title": "Experiences from the design, deployment, and usage of the UCSB MeshNet testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000237197100004"}
