Unlike conventional precast concrete (PC), the CPC components of GF are connected using shaped steels, which results in a different working method and erection time. In addition, the components are produced within the crane working radius where only a limited quantity is supplied, which impacts the erection time. In turn, the erection time generates a dynamic problem that influences the total amount of production and time. According to case studies on the application of GF, erection time is more critical than production. Thus, information on the erection process of CPC components and the working time of each task should be analyzed to solve the dynamic scheduling issue between production and erection. The objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic erection simulation (DES) model of column-beam structures using CPC components produced within the working radius of cranes. The DES model can easily and quickly establish an erection schedule for GF in response to changes in the on-site production and erection conditions.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Erection Simulation Model of Column-Beam Structures Using Composite Precast Concrete Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000360311800015"}
