In this paper a real-world parallel machines scheduling problem from the pharmaceutical environment has been tackled. Though in the last decades literature extensively approached such an issue, a set of constraints and compulsory dispositions strongly increase the complexity of the level of the problem in hand; thus, in order to fulfill the firm's objectives in terms of production rate increase and rapidity of solution, a dedicated hybrid genetic algorithm equipped with a two-stage encoding and a proper local search has been developed. A twofold validation procedure has been adopted for the proposed optimization technique. First, it was compared with a set of meta-heuristic algorithms on the basis of a teal-world data set. Once the outperformance of the proposed genetic optimization was demonstrated, a further comparison with a set of empirical schedules, manually performed by the production supervisor, had been carried out.
