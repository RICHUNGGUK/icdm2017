Therefore, most researchers have concentrated on the optimization technique to compute the optimal DG value. In this paper, the comparative learning in global particle swarm optimization (CLGPSO) method is introduced. The implementation of individual cognitive and social acceleration coefficient values for each particle and a new fourth term in the velocity formula make the process of convergence faster. This new algorithm is tested on 6 standard mathematical test functions and a 33-bus distribution system. The performance of the CLGPSO is compared with the inertia weight particle swarm optimization (PSO) and evolutionary PSO methods. Since the CLGPSO requires fewer iterations, less computing time, and a lower standard deviation value, it can be concluded that the CLGPSO is the superior algorithm in solving small-dimension mathematical and simple power system problems.", "paper_title": "Comparative learning global particle swarm optimization for optimal distributed generations' output", "paper_id": "WOS:000343076200017"}
