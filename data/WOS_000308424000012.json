The techniques provide a novel basis for initializing and updating time series feature extraction parameters used in the automated decision support of vibration events due to operational transients. The data-driven nature of the algorithms allows for machine-specific characteristics of individual turbines to be learned and reasoned about. The paper provides a case study illustrating the routine alarm paradigm, and the applicability of systems using self-tuning techniques. The approaches discussed throughout are presented to provide useful diagnosis tools for the reliability and maintenance analysis of steam turbine generators.", "paper_title": "Self-Tuning Routine Alarm Analysis of Vibration Signals in Steam Turbine Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000308424000012"}
