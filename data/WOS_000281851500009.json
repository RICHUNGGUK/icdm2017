The proposed protocol can be used for determining stress and strain distributions and contact kinetics in different knee elements at different body postures during various physical activities. Several examples are provided to highlight the capabilities and potential applications of the proposed protocol. This includes preliminary results on the role of body weight on the stresses and strains induced in the knee articular cartilages and meniscus during single-leg stance and calculations of the induced stresses and ligament forces during the gait cycle.", "paper_title": "Protocol for constructing subject-specific biomechanical models of knee joint", "paper_id": "WOS:000281851500009"}
