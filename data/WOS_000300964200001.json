A graph G that has no subgraph isomorphic to a graph H is called H-free. The VERTEX COLORING problem is the problem to determine the chromatic number of a graph. Its computational complexity for triangle-free H-free graphs has been classified for every fixed graph H on at most 6 vertices except for the case H = 2P(3). This remaining case is posed as an open problem by Dabrowski, Lozin, Raman and Ries. We solve their open problem by showing polynomial-time solvability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
