Different from traditional measurements, we propose a novel vision method based on image motion blur to estimate angular velocity and angular displacement in this paper. First, we transform 2D rotation to ID translational motion by sectoring rotation blurred image. Then we use mathematical models in spatial and frequency domain to analyze translation blurred images. According to mathematical models in frequency domain, there is a series of dark parallel lines on the spectrum of the translation blurred image. These dark lines are exactly related to the velocity of translation and exposure time. Furthermore, based on the geometric relationship between rotation and translation, these dark lines are also related to angular velocity. Both simulation results and real experimental results, based on the proposed method in this paper, are provided. These results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of proposed method.", "paper_title": "Estimation of rotation parameters from blurred image", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100057"}
