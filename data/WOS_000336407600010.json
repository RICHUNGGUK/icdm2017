The outcome is determined by whether the resulting word lies in a prescribed set (a win for player A) or not (a win for player B). We focus on symbolic dynamical games, where the target set is a subshift. We investigate the relation between the target subshift and the set of turn orders for which A has a winning strategy.", "paper_title": "Playing with Subshifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000336407600010"}
