The multi-standard receiver architecture presents considerable different VGA requirements (in terms of bandwidth, DC-gain, noise level, and common mode input voltage) for the three telecom standards. The VGA is positioned just after the mixer, and, then, it operates on low- amplitude input signals. This results in stronger noise requirements than linearity ones. Thus a digitally controlled open-loop structure has been used. The prototype VGA is realized in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology and it features gain levels from -10 to 36 dB. For 0 dB DC-gain it exhibits a 25 dBm IIP3 and an input-referred noise voltage lower than 5 nV/aeHz. This gives a 85 dB-DR for the WLAN case. The VGA draws 6.4 mA from a single 2.5 V supply.", "paper_title": "A 6.4 mW, 4.9 nV/aeHz, 24 dBm IIP3 VGA for a multi-standard (WLAN, UMTS, and Bluetooth) receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000268994600001"}
