One of the more popular ones is the so-called regression calibration method. This method has been investigated mostly in situations with only one explanatory variable with error and with normally distributed variables and errors. In this paper, we present the results from a simulation study with a high number of explanatory variables and with varying distri-butions on both the variables and the errors. The results suggest that the method works well in situations with normally distributed or moderately skewed explanatory variables. Situations with highly skewed explanatory variables are problematic, while skewed distributions on the errors do not seem to add much extra trouble.", "paper_title": "Correction for measurement error in multiple logistic regression: A simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000235735400001"}
