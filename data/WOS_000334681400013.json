It utilizes fragmented slots as its radiation elements and explores employing this highly flexible structure for achieving high gain. Each fragmented slot is gridded into 8 x 8 rectangular pixels, whose dimensions as well as conducting or nonconducting properties are optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in parallel on a PC cluster. A prototype antenna with 4 x 4 slots was designed, fabricated and measured. Both the simulation and measurement results show that this antenna possesses a high gain of 20.5 dBi at its working frequency of 5.8 GHz, and thus the corresponding aperture efficiency is up to 95%, which is much higher than that of the planar arrays with rectangular slots or split-ring resonator (SRR) slots.
