A fast numerical algorithm called C/GMRES is employed to implement nonlinear receding horizon control of quadruple-tank system, in which the continuation method is combined with a fast algorithm for linear equations instead of the Riccati differential equation. Analysis and simulation results show that the computation time is significantly reduced and nonlinear receding horizon control can be implemented successfully in real time.", "paper_title": "NONLINEAR RECEDING HORIZON CONTROL OF QUADRUPLE-TANK SYSTEM AND REAL-TIME IMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118400005"}
