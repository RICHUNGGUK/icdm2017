Namely, if in an infinite family of convex sets in we know that out of every there are which are intersecting, we determine if having some compact sets implies a bound on the number of points needed to intersect the whole family. We also study variations of this problem.", "paper_title": "About an ErdAs-Grunbaum Conjecture Concerning Piercing of Non-bounded Convex Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400014"}
