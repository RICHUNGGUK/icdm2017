EAM systems are used to delineate scar regions responsible for the arrhythmia by creating voltage or activation time maps. Previous studies have identified the benefits of creating MR-guided voltage maps; however, in some cases voltage maps may not identify regions of slow propagation that can cause the reentrant tachycardia. In this study, we obtained local activation time maps and analyzed propagation properties by performing MR-guided mapping of the porcine left ventricle while pacing from the right ventricle. Anatomical and myocardial late gadolinium enhancement images were used for catheter navigation and identification of scar regions. Our MR-guided mapping procedure showed qualitative correspondence to conventional clinical EAM systems in healthy pigs and demonstrated altered propagation in endocardial infarct models.", "paper_title": "The Feasibility of Endocardial Propagation Mapping Using Magnetic Resonance Guidance in a Swine Model, and Comparison With Standard Electroanatomic Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000302547400011"}
