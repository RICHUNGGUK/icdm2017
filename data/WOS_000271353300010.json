This system consists of an atom trapped in a double-well potential and a cavity that couples to the atom. The population of the atom in the left/right well and the dynamics of entanglement are calculated and discussed. We find that the tunneling behaves as a damping-oscillating function of time, and the entanglement between the internal and external degree of freedom of the atom exhibits entanglement sudden death (ESD).", "paper_title": "ATOMIC TUNNELING AND ENTANGLEMENT SUDDEN DEATH IN A DISSIPATIVE ATOM-CAVITY SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000271353300010"}
