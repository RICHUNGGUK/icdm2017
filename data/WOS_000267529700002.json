A routing in G is a set of fixed paths for all ordered pairs of vertices in G. The forwarding index of G is the minimum of the largest number of paths specified by a routing passing through any vertex of G taken over all routings in G. This article investigates the forwarding index of a wrapped butterfly graph, determines the exact value for the directed case, and gives an upper bound for undirected case.
