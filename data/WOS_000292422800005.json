This would bring down the performance of transaction processing systems. The transaction compensation is a feasible solution through allowing sub-transactions to independently commit, however, it is not able to speed up the transaction processing. This paper proposes a novel pipeline-based transaction processing (PLbTP) model for Serial Long Transactions (SLTs), which parallelises the transaction processing to reduce the transaction execution duration. Furthermore, we design a time-stamp-based deadlock prevention mechanism for the control of multiple concurrent transactions. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve performance of SLTs without the aid of compensating transactions.", "paper_title": "A pipeline-based approach for long transaction processing in web service environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000292422800005"}
