This allows the most flexible R&D agenda while at the same time providing a commercialization path. This process is described as a natural extension of current focus areas and funding agents for R&D, D&E and P&S, but adds stake holders from the next stage in the process in the upstream processes. This model allows the flexibility to encourage development and competition of ideas in the research, development and productization phases. We anticipate that multiple iterations through this process from R&D through P&S are required to achieve appropriate software for Exascale systems.", "paper_title": "A COLLABORATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION MODEL FOR EXASCALE SOFTWARE RESEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000270983500019"}
