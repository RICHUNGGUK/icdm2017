In order to efficiently run this kind of applications in embedded systems, the dynamic memory subsystem needs to be optimized. A key role in this optimization is played by the dynamic data structures that reside in every real-life application. This paper presents a novel and automated way to optimize dynamic data structures. The search space is pruned using genetic algorithms that converge to the best multilayered data structure implementation for the targeted applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
