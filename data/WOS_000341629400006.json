An emerging concept for robust and accurate network localization is to exploit cooperation and heterogeneous design for harnessing multimodal fusion of sensing measurements to extract location information. This article gives a brief introduction to vision- and radio-based positioning technologies, and then presents illustrative machine-learning methodology to successfully integrate vision information and radio time-of-arrival measurements for cooperative localization of ultra-wide-band visual radios in harsh indoor environments.", "paper_title": "LOCATION-AWARE VISUAL RADIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629400006"}
