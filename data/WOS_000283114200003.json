We characterize the graphs for which this problem has a solution. As corollaries we characterize graphs which admit an election algorithm for two seminal models: Angluin's model and asynchronous systems where processes communicate with synchronous message passing (i.e., there is a synchronization between the process sending the message and the one receiving it).", "paper_title": "On the power of synchronization between two adjacent processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283114200003"}
