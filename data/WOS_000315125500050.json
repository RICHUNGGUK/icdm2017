For a set of MSSM parameters as input, the code gives predictions for: 1. Electric dipole moments of the leptons and the neutron. 2. Anomalous magnetic moments (i.e. g - 2) of the leptons. 3. Radiative lepton decays (mu -> e gamma and tau -> mu gamma, e gamma). 4. Rare Kaon decays (K-L(0) -> pi(0)(nu) over bar nu and K+ -> pi(+)(nu) over barv). 5. Leptonic B decays (B-s,B-d -> l(+)l(-), B -> D tau nu) 6. Radiative B decays (B -> (X) over bar (s)gamma). 7. Delta F = 2 processes ((K) over bar (0)-K-0, (D) over bar -D, (B) over bar (d)-B-d and (B) over bar (s)-B-s mixing). Comparing to SUSY_FLAVOR v1, where the matching conditions were calculated strictly at one-loop level, SUSY_FLAVOR v2 performs the resummation of all chirally enhanced corrections, i.e. takes into account the enhanced effects from tan beta and/or large trilinear soft mixing terms to all orders in perturbation theory. Also, in SUSY_FLAVOR v2 new routines calculation of B -> (D)tau nu, g - 2, radiative lepton decays and Br(l -> l'gamma) were added. All calculations are done using exact diagonalization of the sfermion mass matrices. The program can be obtained from http://www.fuw.edu.pl/susy_flavor.

Computer: Any. Operating system: Any, tested on Linux. Classification: 11.6. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEGV_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 2180 Nature of problem: Predicting CP-violating observables, meson mixing parameters and branching ratios for set of rare processes in the general R-parity conserving MSSM. Solution method: We use standard quantum theoretical methods to calculate Wilson coefficients in MSSM and at one loop including QCD corrections at higher orders when this is necessary and possible. The input parameters can be read from an external file in SLHA format. Reasons for new version: A major rewrite of the internal code structure to accommodate higher order corrections; new observables added. Summary of revisions: 1. SUSY_FLAVOR v2.0 is able to perform resummation of chirally enhanced corrections to all orders of perturbation expansion (v1.0 included 1-loop terms only). 2. Routines calculating new observables are added: g-2 lepton magnetic moment anomaly, mu to e gamma and tau to e gamma, mu gamma decays, B to D tau nu decays, B to mu e, tau e, tau mu decays. 3. Parameter initialization in the sfermion sector is simplified and follows, by default, the SLHA2 conventions. Restrictions: The results apply only to the case of MSSM with R-parity conservation.
