However it is difficult to assign an appropriate title to each object that reflects its content. Since there are various aspects of analyzing discourse segments, it is inevitable that researchers will face the diversity when describing the \"meanings\" of discourse segments. In this paper, we propose the assignments of discourse segment titles from the representation of their \"meanings.\" In this assigning procedure, we focus on the speaker's evaluation for the event or the speech object. To verify the effectiveness of our idea, we examined identification of the segment boundaries from the titles that were described in our procedure. We confirmed that the result of the identification was more accurate than that of intuitive identification.", "paper_title": "A model of discourse segmentation and segment title assignment for lecture speech indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800015"}
