Then, an optimal power allocation algorithm is proposed based on the full channel state information (CSI) among PUs, CUs, and base station (BS). In order to reduce the feedback overhead, another power allocation algorithm is devised based only on the partial CSI, that is, the CSI of BS-PU and the CSI of BS-CUs. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the optimal power allocation algorithm, the power allocation algorithm with only the partial CSI can achieve a similar performance with a smaller channel feedback overhead.", "paper_title": "Power Allocation in Nonselfish Symbiotic Cognitive Relaying with Partial Channel State Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000330457500001"}
