To seamlessly cover the target area and keep the received signal power strength at an acceptable level, we send the signal from multiple diffused optical emitters and achieve possible transmit diversity. With the proposed diversity scheme, the effective coverage range of the proposed system can be significantly enlarged with a guaranteed BER performance. Simulation results show a 13.4 m(2) area can be effectively covered by two optical emitters with optical emitter spacing of 3 m and average transmit optical power of 28 dBm.", "paper_title": "A subcarrier modulation based optical wireless communication system employing transmission diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000011"}
