We consider both Dirichlet and Neumann problems. We derive well-conditioned Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, which are discretized using high-order, hybrid Gauss-trapezoid rules. Our fast multipole-based iterative solution procedure requires only O(N) operations, where N is the number of nodes in the discretization of the boundary. We demonstrate the performance of our methods on several numerical examples, and we show that they have both the ability to handle highly complex geometry and the potential to solve large-scale problems.
