In order to achieve the desirable gain and linearity of the receiver chain at a reduced supply voltage, the current-reused bias technique and the multiple-gated transistors are employed. As for the transmitter frontend, a low-voltage double-balanced mixer is utilized to maximize the conversion gain. In addition, a differential-to-single-ended circuit is also included to increase the saturated output power. Using a standard 0.18-mu m CMOS process, the proposed circuits are realized for 5-GHz RF applications with a supply voltage of 0.6 V. The fabricated receiver frontend demonstrates a conversion gain of 14.5 dB and an IIP(3) of -16 dBm with a power consumption of 2.1 mW, while the conversion gain and the output 1-dB compression of the transmitter frontend are 12.9 dB and -4.1 dBm, respectively, provided a dc power of 6 mW.", "paper_title": "Experimental 5-GHz RF Frontends for Ultra-Low-Voltage and Ultra-Low-Power Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000288681400018"}
