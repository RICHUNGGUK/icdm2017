In such a scenario, relay beamforming has been proved to be an effective way to improve system performance by employing spatial diversity gains. Early works have mostly focused on various centralized relay beamforming schemes based on global channel state information (CSI). Since global CSI is often unavailable due to geometric locations, power limitation, or other constraints of the relay nodes in M2M networks, our work aims to develop distributed algorithms that each relay node individually learns its own beamforming weights with local CSI. We propose two suboptimal relay beamforming schemes that only require local CSI to minimize mean square error (MSE) for all the users with nonorthogonal channels. For multiuser systems with orthogonal channels, we divide the optimization problem into multiple single user problems which then can be solved by each relay independently. Numerical simulations for the proposed algorithms are presented showing the performance of the proposed schemes is close to that of the optimal scheme with global CSI in terms of bit error rate (BER) criterion.", "paper_title": "Distributed Beamforming for Relay Assisted Multiuser Machine-to-Machine Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308171600001"}
