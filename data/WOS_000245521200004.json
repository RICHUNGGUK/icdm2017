We present an adaptive surface reconstruction method providing a hierarchy of quadrilateral meshes adapting surface topology when a mesh is refined. This way, a user can choose a model with proper resolution and topology from the hierarchy without having to run the algorithm multiple times with different parameters. The multiresolution mesh representation can be used subsequently for view-dependent rendering and wavelet compression.", "paper_title": "Reverse engineering with subdivision surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200004"}
