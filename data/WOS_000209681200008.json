The resource allocation problem is formulated as a maximization of effective capacity based bits-per-joule capacity under statistical QoS provisioning, which is complicated due to specific constraints of SC-FDMA. We solve the problem using Canonical duality theory. Numerical results show that the proposed energy efficient design significantly enhances the energy efficiency while satisfying the QoS requirements of different users.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Design of SC-FDMA Based Uplink under QoS Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200008"}
