However, it does not reflect the semantic measure among the items. The semantic measure of an itemset is characterized with utility values that are typically associated with transaction items, where a user will be interested to an itemset only if it satisfies a given utility constraint. In this paper, we first define the problem of finding association rules using utility-confidence framework, which is a generalization of the amount-confidence measure. Using this semantic concept of rules, we then propose a compressed representation for association rules having minimal antecedent and maximal consequent. This representation is generated with the help of high utility closed itemsets (HUCI) and their generators. We propose the algorithms to generate the utility based non-redundant association rules and methods for reconstructing all association rules. Furthermore, we describe the algorithms which generate high utility itemsets (HUI) and high utility closed itemsets with their generators. These proposed algorithms are implemented using both synthetic and real datasets. The results demonstrate better efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed HUCI-Miner algorithm compared to other well-known existing algorithms. In addition, the experimental results show better quality in the compressed representation of the entire rule set under the considered framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
