This is the result of economies of scale and the possibility for organizations to purchase just as much computing and storage resources as needed whenever needed. However, a clear specification of cost savings requires a detailed specification of the costs incurred. Although there are some efforts to define cost models for clouds, the need for a comprehensive cost model, which covers all cost factors and types of clouds, is undeniable. In this paper, we cover this gap by suggesting a cost model for the most general form of a cloud, namely federated hybrid clouds. This type of cloud is composed of a private cloud and a number of interoperable public clouds. The proposed cost model is applied within a cost minimization algorithm for making service placement decisions in clouds. We demonstrate the workings of our cost model and service placement algorithm within a specific cloud scenario. Our results show that the service placement algorithm with the cost model minimizes the spending for computational services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
