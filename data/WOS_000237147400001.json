By sensing and adapting to its environment, such A device is able to fill voids in the wireless spectrum and can dramatically increase spectral efficiency. In this paper, the cognitive radio channel is defined as a two-sender, two-receiver interference channel in which sender 2 obtains the encoded message sender I plans to transmit. We consider two cases: in the genie-aided cognitive radio channel, sender 2 is noncausally presented the data to be transmitted by sender 1 while in the causal cognitive radio channel, the data is obtained causally. The cognitive radio at sender 2 may then choose to transmit simultaneously over the same channel, as opposed to waiting for an idle channel as is traditional for a cognitive radio. Our main result is the development of an achievable region which combines Gel'fand-Pinkser coding with an achievable region construction for the interference channel. In the additive Gaussian noise case, this resembles dirty-paper coding, a technique used in the computation of the capacity of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. Numerical evaluation of the region in the Gaussian noise case is performed, and compared to an inner bound, the interference channel, and an outer bound, a modified Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Results are also extended to the case in which the message is causally obtained.", "paper_title": "Achievable rates in cognitive radio channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400001"}
