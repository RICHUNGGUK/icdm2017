The two users transmit to the destination via a multiple access channel, and user 2 also receives noisy channel outputs. Such channel outputs potentially help user 2 to learn user 1's confidential information (although they are not exploited by user 2 for channel transmission). Hence, user 1 views user 2 as an eavesdropper and wishes to keep its confidential message as secret as possible from user 2. A parallel CMAC-CM with independent subchannels is first studied. The secrecy capacity region of the parallel CMAC-CM is established, which yields the secrecy capacity regions of the parallel CMAC-CM with degraded subchannels and the parallel Gaussian CMAC-CM. These results are then applied to study the fading CMAC-CM, in which both the user-to-user channel and the user-to-destination channel are corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients in addition to additive white Gaussian noise. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at both the users and the destination. With the CSI, users can dynamically change their transmission powers with the channel realization to achieve the optimal performance. The closed-form power allocation function that achieves every boundary point of the secrecy capacity region is derived.", "paper_title": "Fading Cognitive Multiple-Access Channels With Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500010"}
