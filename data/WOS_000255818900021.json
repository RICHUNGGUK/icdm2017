However, so far their segmentation has only been performed by simple thresholding which is insufficient due to noise and weak contrast. In this paper, we propose a new customized region growing approach to segment each remodeling zone taking into account some biological prior. A constrained region growing strategy based on distance map and watershed is developed to control the shape of the detected regions. The statistical analysis of the results on synthetic noisy images and the application to experimental micro-CT data show the efficiency of the method. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
