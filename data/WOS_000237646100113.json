In order to fill the gap, authors clarified the dynamic nature of cadastral data and presented the analysis of functional requirements, and then developed a spatio-temporal model and relevant functionalities, which can deal with real world cadastral data. The proposed model and functions were implemented using prolog, XPCE, and C++. The value of this study is to uncover the need for the integration of all historical cadastral data and the feasibility of the system development for the future.", "paper_title": "Temporal land information system (TLIS) for dynamically changing cadastral data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100113"}
