Velocity patterns are compared between computer simulations and measurements. The workflow includes several steps: MRI measurement to obtain both geometry and velocity, an automatic levelset segmentation followed by meshing of the geometrical model and CFD setup to perform the simulations follwed by the actual simulations. The computational results agree well with the measured data.", "paper_title": "Feasibility of patient specific aortic blood flow CFD simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300032"}
