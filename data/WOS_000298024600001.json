In deal splitting with packages (DSP), the sellers offer packages containing combinations of the goods; in deal splitting with price tables (DST), the buyer can generate such combinations using price tables. Our problems, which often occur in online reverse auctions, generalize covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints (CIP), where we must fill up an R-dimensional bin by selecting (with a bounded number of repetitions) from a set of R-dimensional items, such that the overall cost is minimized. Thus, both DSP and DST are NP-hard, already for a single good, and hard to approximate for arbitrary number of goods. In this paper we focus on finding efficient approximations for DSP and DST instances where the number of goods is some fixed constant. In particular, we develop polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for several subclasses of instances of practical interest. Our results include a PTAS for CIP in fixed dimension, and a more efficient (combinatorial) scheme for CIP(infinity), where the multiplicity constraints are omitted. Our approximation scheme for CIP(infinity) is based on a non-trivial application of the fast scheme for the fractional covering problem, proposed by Fleischer [L Fleischer, A fast approximation scheme for fractional covering problems with variable upper bounds, in: Proc. of the 15th ACIV-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithm, 2004, pp. 994-1003].
