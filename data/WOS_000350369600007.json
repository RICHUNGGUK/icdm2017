However, inadequate tool support has compromised attempts to transfer Agile methodology's successes from \"business systems\" to embedded system development. We outline the advantages of adding an Agile test support (ATS) co-processor to provide low overhead hardware-assisted test insertion capabilities into testing frameworks for test-first (Agile) and test-last hardware-software design philosophies. We propose the development of an ATS FPGA co-processor using an extension to the eXtreme Programming Inspired (XPI) embedded lifecycle. The performance of a prototype ATS co-processor is compared to the existing instruction watch (low overhead) and data watch (high overhead) debug hardware present on Analog Devices ADSP-BF5XX Blackfin processors.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Hardware Assisted Test Insertion Capabilities on Embedded Processors using an FPGA-based Agile Test Support Co-processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000350369600007"}
