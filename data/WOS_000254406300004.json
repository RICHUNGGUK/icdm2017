This paper presents a new family of histograms, the Hierarchical Model Fitting (HMF) histograms, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Rather than having each bucket of a histogram described by the same type of model, the HMF histograms employ a local optimal model for each bucket. The improved effectiveness of the locally chosen models offsets more than the overhead of keeping track of the representation of each individual bucket. Through a set of experiments, we show that the HMF histograms are capable of providing more accurate approximations than previously proposed techniques for many real and synthetic data sets across a variety of query workloads.", "paper_title": "Histograms based on the minimum description length principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000254406300004"}
