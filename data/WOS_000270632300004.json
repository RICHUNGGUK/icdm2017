Our main contributions are reconstruction of the spine curve of a pipe surface from surface samples, and approximation of the spine curve by G(1) continuous circular arcs and line segments. Our algorithm accurately outputs the parametric data required for bending machines to create the reconstructed tube. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
