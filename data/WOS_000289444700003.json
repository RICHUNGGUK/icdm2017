However, the ever-increasing energy consumption of computing systems has started to limit further performance growth due to overwhelming electricity bills and carbon dioxide footprints. Therefore, the goal of the computer system design has been shifted to power and energy efficiency. To identify open challenges in the area and facilitate future advancements, it is essential to synthesize and classify the research on power- and energy-efficient design conducted to date. In this study, we discuss causes and problems of high power/energy consumption, and present a taxonomy of energy-efficient design of computing systems covering the hardware, operating system, virtualization, and data center levels. We survey various key works in the area and map them onto our taxonomy to guide future design and development efforts. This chapter concludes with a discussion on advancements identified in energy-efficient computing and our vision for future research directions.", "paper_title": "A Taxonomy and Survey of Energy-Efficient Data Centers and Cloud Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000289444700003"}
