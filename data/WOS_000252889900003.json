Some additional parameters are taken in this system, which have an advantage in performing point multiplication while keeping the security of ECC over finite fields. We give a method to select generators of the cryptographic groups, and give a way to represent the elements of the quotient groups with finitely bounded storage by establishing a bijection between these elements and their approximate coordinates. The addition formula under this representation is also presented.", "paper_title": "Cryptography on elliptic curves over p-adic number fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000252889900003"}
