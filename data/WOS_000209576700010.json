The method tries to minimize the jitter of the system performance, subject to a given power consumption constraint. The adaptation is performed through simultaneous dynamic processor speed selection (to control power of the system processor) and dynamic fan mode selection (to control power of its cooling fan). First, we provide an analytical method for calculation of the system power consumption and performance under some processor and fan speed setups. All the inter-effects among the processor dynamic power, leakage power, temperature, and the system stochastic properties are taken into account in the calculations to reach more accurate analysis. Then, to adapt the system power consumption with respect to the variations of the ambient temperature, we have used a model predictive control (MPC) approach beside some optimizations based on the analysis to appropriately change the processor and fan speed setups. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed adaptive method with an emphasis on the preference of the considered backlog -dependent mode selection comparing to some traditional static mode selection methods.
