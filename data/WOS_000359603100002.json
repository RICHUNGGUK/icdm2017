Furthermore, this study aimed to investigate users' perceived situation awareness due to the system. This study conducted one experiment and introduced three newly developed interaction mechanisms: two-way rubber band, drag-and-response, and centre collection area. Two-way rubber band enables users not only to send but also to request digital objects. Drag-and-response allows users to accept or to reject digital objects sent by others; therefore, it eliminates conflicting situations and interference. Centre collection area stores, organises, and manages shared digital resources on a surface of a tabletop display, so that users have an overall picture of available resources. This paper discusses results of an experiment, research findings, and implications along with conclusions and several suggestions for future development and research.", "paper_title": "Study of using a multi-touch tabletop technology to facilitate collaboration, interaction, and awareness in co-located environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000359603100002"}
