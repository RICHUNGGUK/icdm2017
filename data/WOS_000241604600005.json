Simple structure allowing multiple frequency control has been adopted so that the VCO maintains its center frequency and tuning range throughout -40 degrees C to 120 degrees C by the way of a Proportional To Absolute Temperature (PTAT) biasing scheme. Simulations and measurements show the sensitivity of the VCO center frequency has been reduced from 1300 ppm/degrees C to 73 ppm/degrees C, while a phase noise of -96 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz offset with a power consumption of 18 mW have been achieved.", "paper_title": "2.45-GHz-CMOS temperature compensated multi-controlled oscillator for IEEE 802.15 wireless PAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000241604600005"}
