First, the condition for stability of switched systems whose subsystems are stable are presented with dynamical dwell time approach, which is shown to be less conservative in switching law design than dwell time approach. Then the proposed approach is extended to the switched systems with both stable and unstable subsystems. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of switched systems under dynamical dwell time control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000264375500003"}
