Its nodes can be any type of resource. Its edges can be any semantic relation. Potential semantic links can be derived out according to reasoning rules on semantic relations. This paper proposes the schema theory for the SLN, including the concepts, rule-constraint normal forms, and relevant algorithms. The theory provides the basis for normalized management of semantic link network. A case study demonstrates the proposed theory.
