A parity edge-coloring (respectively, strong parity edge-coloring) is an edge-coloring in which there is no nontrivial parity path (respectively, open parity walk). The parity edge-chromatic number p(G) (respectively, strong parity edge-chromatic number ) is the least number of colors in a parity edge-coloring (respectively, strong parity edge-coloring) of G. Notice that for any graph G. In this paper, we determine and p(G) for some complete bipartite graphs and some products of graphs.
