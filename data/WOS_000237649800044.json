Multiple authentications and key establishments are required as these resources may reside in different security domains. Therefore we are in quest of a solution that combines multiple logins and key exchanges into one single process. Motivated by this need, we propose a scheme for single sign-on and key establishment (SSOKE) for ubiquitous smart environments. We examine the computational model and design considerations for smart environments, and address them in our scheme construction. Security and privacy considerations of our proposal are also provided.", "paper_title": "Single sign-on and key establishment for ubiquitous smart environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800044"}
