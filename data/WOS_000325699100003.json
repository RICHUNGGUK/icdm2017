The principles of the network time protocol (NTP) and precision time protocol (PTP) were analyzed. The framework for time synchronization of the shore station, undersea junction box layer, and submarine science instrument layer was designed. NTP and PTP network signals were decoded by a PTP master clock on a shore station that receives signals from the Global Positioning System and the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System as reference time sources. These signals were remotely transmitted by a subsea optical-electrical composite cable through an Ethernet passive optical network. Accurate time was determined by time synchronization devices in each layer. Synchronization monitoring experiments performed within a laboratory environment indicated that the proposed system is valid and has the potential to realize microsecond accuracy to satisfy the time synchronization requirements of a high-precision seafloor observatory network.", "paper_title": "IEEE 1588 based time synchronization system for a seafloor observatory network", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699100003"}
