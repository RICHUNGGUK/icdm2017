We propose a soft-decision interpolation technique that estimates missing pixels in groups rather than one at a time. The new technique learns and adapts to varying scene structures using a 2-D piecewise autoregressive model. The model parameters are estimated in a moving window in the input low-resolution image. The pixel structure dictated by the learnt model is enforced by the soft-decision estimation process onto a block of pixels, including both observed and estimated. The result is equivalent to that of a high-order adaptive nonseparable 2-D interpolation filter. This new image interpolation approach preserves spatial coherence of interpolated images better than the existing methods, and it produces the best results so far over a wide range of scenes in both PSNR measure and subjective visual quality. Edges and textures are well preserved, and common interpolation artifacts (blurring, ringing, jaggies, zippering, etc.) are greatly reduced.", "paper_title": "Image interpolation by adaptive 2-D autoregressive modeling and soft-decision estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256055500005"}
