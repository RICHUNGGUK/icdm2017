By this approach, BER degradation of AM MIMO due to DC offset is removed considerably. This technique provides a good trade-off between BER and average spectral efficiency (ASE) and increases the robustness of the system relative to DC offset.", "paper_title": "DC compensated adaptive modulation in MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273587200014"}
