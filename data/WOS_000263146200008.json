Our work builds on a variant of the minimal path approach. First, an initial point on the desired contour is chosen by the user. Next, new keypoints are detected automatically using a front propagation approach. We assume that the desired object has a closed boundary. This a-priori knowledge on the topology is used to devise a relevant criterion for stopping the keypoint detection and front propagation. The final domain visited by the front will yield a band surrounding the object of interest. Linking pairs of neighboring keypoints with minimal paths allows us to extract a closed contour from a 2D image. This approach can also be used for finding an open curve giving extra information as stopping criteria. Detection of a variety of objects on real images is demonstrated. Using a similar idea, we can extract networks of minimal paths from a 3D image called Geodesic Meshing. The proposed method is applied to 3D data with promising results.", "paper_title": "Fast Object Segmentation by Growing Minimal Paths from a Single Point on 2D or 3D Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000263146200008"}
