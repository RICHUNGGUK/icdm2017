Given a query object q and a target database object p, we explicitly find the shortest path between them in the distance manifold of the database objects. Then a new distance measure between q and p is learned based on the database objects on the shortest path to replace the original distance measure. The promising results on both MEPG-7 shape dataset and a protein dataset demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the ranking of the object retrieval. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
