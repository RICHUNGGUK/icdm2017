By using the method of differential subordinations, we derive certain conditions involving q and zq' under which the functions q satisfy the following two-sided inequality: alpha(2)pi/2 < argq(z) alpha(1)pi/2 (z is an element of U) for some alpha(1) and alpha(2) (0 < alpha(1), alpha(2) <= 1). Several interesting consequences of the main results are also given. All these results presented here are sharp. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
