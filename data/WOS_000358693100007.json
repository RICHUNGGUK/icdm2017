The objective of this algorithm is to reduce interference and balance network load among links. The LBR algorithm is composed of link allocation algorithm and load-balancing route-selection algorithm. First, the network model is presented. Based on this model, a link allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate all links to channels which aims to minimise interference degree of networks. After links are allocated to channels, a route-selection algorithm is proposed to select a path from source to destination to balance network load. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm balances network load and improves the network throughput significantly.", "paper_title": "A load-balancing routing algorithm for multi-channel wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358693100007"}
