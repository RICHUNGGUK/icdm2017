The C-pk index has been the most popular one used to evaluate the quality of supplier's products. Using fuzzy data collected from q >= 2 possible suppliers' products, fuzzy estimates of q suppliers' capability indices C-pki (i = 1, 2,..., q) are obtained according to the form of resolution identity that is a well-known theorem in fuzzy sets theory. Certain optimization problems are formulated and solved to obtain alpha-level sets for the purpose of constructing the membership functions of fuzzy estimates of C-pki. These membership functions are sorted by using a fuzzy ranking method to choose the preferable suppliers. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to present the possible application by incorporating fuzzy data into the quality-based supplier selection and evaluation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
