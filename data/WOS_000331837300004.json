INDEMICS can support policy analysts and epidemiologists interested in planning and control of pandemics. INDEMICS goes beyond traditional epidemic simulations by providing a simple and powerful way to represent and analyze policy-based as well as individual-based adaptive interventions. Users can also stop the simulation at any point, assess the state of the simulated system, and add additional interventions. INDEMICS is available to end-users via a web-based interface. Detailed performance analysis shows that INDEMICS greatly enhances the capability and productivity of simulating complex intervention strategies with a marginal decrease in performance. We also demonstrate how INDEMICS was applied in some real case studies where complex interventions were implemented.", "paper_title": "INDEMICS: An Interactive High-Performance Computing Framework for Data-Intensive Epidemic Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000331837300004"}
