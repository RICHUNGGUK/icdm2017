However, the emotion models and architectures for virtual agents are not yet advanced enough to be imbued with coexisting emotions. In this paper, an improved emotion model integrated with decision making algorithms is proposed to deal with two topics: the generation of coexisting emotions, and the resolution to ambivalence, in which two emotions conflict. A scenario of ambivalence is provided to illustrate the process of agent's decision-making.", "paper_title": "Feeling ambivalent: A model of mixed emotions for virtual agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400027"}
