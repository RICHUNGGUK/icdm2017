In this article, we propose an unified hybrid censoring scheme (HCS) which includes many cases considered earlier as special cases. We then derive the exact distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator as well as exact confidence intervals for the mean of the exponential distribution under this general unified HCS. Finally, we present some examples to illustrate all the methods of inference developed here.", "paper_title": "Exact likelihood inference based on an unified hybrid censored sample from the exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000257291200007"}
