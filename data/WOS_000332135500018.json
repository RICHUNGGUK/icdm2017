This makes it difficult to perform 3D shape optimizations. The purpose of this paper is to present a new meshing method with light computational cost for 3D shape optimizations. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a new meshing method on the basis of nonconforming voxel finite element method. The 3D mesh generation is performed with light computational cost keeping the computational accuracy. Findings - It is shown that the computational cost for 3D mesh generation can be reduced without deteriorating numerical accuracy in the FE analysis. It is reported the performance of the present method. Originality/value - The validity of the nonconforming voxel elements is tested to apply it to the optimization of 3D optimizations.", "paper_title": "Accuracy evaluation of three-dimensional FE analysis based on nonconforming voxel element", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500018"}
