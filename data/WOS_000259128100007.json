This work designs and evaluates a stream-based mail proxy constructed from several open-source packages. This proxy processes mail ill segments, and interleaves MIME parsing, decoding, decompressing and virus scanning. It is seven times faster than the storage-based one on forwarding, three times faster oil virus scanning, and twice as faster on decompressing plus virus scanning. This proxy call keep nearly constant memory usage and work Without disks, while the storage-based one requires memory and disk space proportional to the number of clients and the mail size.
