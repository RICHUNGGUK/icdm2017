The duration of any operations are assumed to be controllable variables based on the amount of capacity allocated to them, whereas in classical NWJS it is assumed that the machine capacity and hence processing times are fixed and known in advance. The suggested problem which is entitled no-wait job shop crashing (NWJSC) problem is decomposed into the crashing, sequencing and timetabling subproblems. To tackle the addressed NWJSC problem, an improved hybrid timetabling procedure is suggested by employing the concept of both non-delay and enhanced algorithms which provides better solution than each one separately. Furthermore, an effective two-phase genetic algorithm approach is devised integrating with hybrid timetabling to deal with the crashing and sequencing components. The results obtained from experimental evaluations support the outstanding performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
