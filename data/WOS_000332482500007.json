In this work, we propose novel scan architectures for 3-D IC pre-bond and post-bond testing by considering the interconnection overhead of through-silicon-vias (TSVs). Since hotspots in 3-D ICs often cause performance and reliability issues, we also develop different test ordering schemes for prebond and postbond testing to avoid applying test vectors that could worsen the temperature distribution. Experimental results show that the peak temperature can be lowered by 20% with the 3-D scan tree architecture. When combined with the test ordering scheme, the 3-D scan tree can further reduce peak temperature by over 30%.", "paper_title": "A Thermal-Driven Test Application Scheme for Pre-Bond and Post-Bond Scan Testing of Three-Dimensional ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332482500007"}
