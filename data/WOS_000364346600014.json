The demand for removing the pollutant, especially for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), as well as reducing the cost of wastewater treatment plant is an important research theme recently. Thus, in this paper, the benchmark proposed default control strategy and 10 additional control strategies are applied on the combined biological P and N removal Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1-P). In addition, according to the results of applying PI controllers, as usual, we also chose the group with the better performance, as well as the default control strategy, to replace the PI controllers with fuzzy controllers. In this way, it can be seen that in all cases the quality of effluent of the controlled process could be improved in some degree; and the fuzzy controllers get a better phosphorus removal.", "paper_title": "PI and Fuzzy Control for P-removal in Wastewater Treatment Plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000364346600014"}
