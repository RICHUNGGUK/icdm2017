Component sizing is a hard problem to solve, both from a computational and modeling aspect. This is because of competing objectives, requirements from multiple disciplines, and the need to find a good solution quickly for the architecture being considered. In current approaches, designers rely on heuristics and iterate over the multiple objectives and requirements until a satisfactory solution is found. To improve on this state of practice, we introduce advances in the following two areas: (a) solving the problem efficiently so that all of the imposed requirements are satisfied simultaneously and the solution obtained is mathematically optimal and (b) modeling a component sizing problem in a manner that is convenient to designers. An acausal, algebraic, equation-based, declarative modeling approach using mathematical programming (GAMS) is taken to solve these problems more efficiently. The object management group systems modeling language (OMG SysML (TM)) is used to model component sizing problems in order to facilitate problem formulation, model reuse and automatic generation of low-level code that can be solved using GAMS and its solvers. This framework is demonstrated by applying it to an example of a hydraulic log splitter. Based on this initial example, we discuss two advantages of this framework-total time taken in solving multiple scenarios for a given configuration and the graphical representation of a problem in SysML.
