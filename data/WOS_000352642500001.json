The estimation of its parameters entails unconstrained maximization of a concave and non-differentiable function over the real space. In this note, we describe a maximization algorithm based on the gradient of the log-likelihood that generates a finite sequence of parameter values along which the likelihood increases. The algorithm can be applied to the estimation of mixed-effects quantile regression, Laplace regression with censored data, and other models based on Laplace likelihood. In a simulation study and in a number of real-data applications, the proposed algorithm has shown notable computational speed.", "paper_title": "A gradient search maximization algorithm for the asymmetric Laplace likelihood", "paper_id": "WOS:000352642500001"}
