Then we study the relationships between nodal filters and some other types of filters, likeness prime filter and special filter in BL-algebras. Also, we study inverse image of a nodal filter under aBL-homomorphism. Finally, we obtain a characterization of the nodal filters in terms of congruences.", "paper_title": "Nodal filters in BL-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000349834500017"}
