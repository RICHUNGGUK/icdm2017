We call it the Best Approximation Weighted Residuals (BAWR) method since it gives the best approximation in the norm induced by the inner-product used to build the weighted-residuals approximation. The method computes the optimal weighting functions by solving suitable adjoint problems. Moreover, through a localization technique it becomes computationally efficient without loosing accuracy. The analysis is confirmed by numerical results. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
