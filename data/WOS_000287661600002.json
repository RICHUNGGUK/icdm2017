Realizing its significance this article proposes a self correcting multi-agent architecture for the supply chain for the distributed manufacturing environment. The main aim of the proposed architecture is to generate an effective manufacturing plan while exploring the algorithm portfolio concept to minimize the manufacturing and supply chain costs. This architecture focuses on automatic selection of best techniques and suppliers while making the tradeoff between the cost, availability, reliability, distance and quality of the products supplied. When the new order arrives, the proposed architecture explores the delicacy of the skill exploitation algorithm to simultaneously incorporate the new and old orders. This will help manufacturing firms to execute their manufacturing processes efficiently.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Agent Self Correcting Architecture for Distributed Manufacturing Supply Chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000287661600002"}
