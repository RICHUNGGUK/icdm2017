Such collection and analysis of data is essential for the active monitoring of production during the construction phase of a project and for the automatic 3D layout of built assets during their service lives. This review outlines recent research efforts in this field and technological developments that aim to facilitate the analysis of 3D data acquired from as-built civil infrastructure and applications of such data, not only to the construction process per se but also to facility management - in particular, to production monitoring and automated layout. This review also considers prospects for improvement and addresses challenges that can be expected in future research and development. It is hoped that the suggestions and recommendations made in this review will serve as a basis for future work and as motivation for ongoing research and development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
