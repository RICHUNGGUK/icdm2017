This paper describes CoPSF, a multiagent system middle-ware that simplifies the development of coordinated problem solving applications while ensuring standard compliance through a set of system services and agents. CoPSF hosts and serves multiple concurrent teams of problem solving contributing both to the limitation of communication overheads and to the reduction of redundant work across teams and organizations. The framework employs (i) an interleaved task decomposition and allocation approach, (ii) a mechanism for coordination of agents' work, and (iii) a mechanism that enables synergy between parallel teams.", "paper_title": "A multiagent framework for coordinated parallel problem solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000281788900004"}
