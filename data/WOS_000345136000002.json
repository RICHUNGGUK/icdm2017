We find that the strongest ties tend to link institutions across continents in research collaboration. However, the effect of geographic factors is still notable in light of the fact that most of the institutions in the largest subgroup are located in Europe. Examination of the network position, measured by degree centrality, indicates that homophily is more common than heterophily in the network. A relatively high number of relational ties are observed among institutions that have similar levels of network centrality. Mutual relations are prevalent among central institutions, while strong mutual solidarity exists between institutions on the periphery of the network. This study shows a general unstable international collaborative relationship among astronomical institutions. While more and more institutions have linked up in research collaboration, many of them keep relatively weak ties. Institutions tend not remain in the same subgroup, but link to different partners over time.", "paper_title": "Cohesive subgroups in the international collaboration network in astronomy and astrophysics", "paper_id": "WOS:000345136000002"}
