By analyzing this similarity measure, we find it somewhat inconvenient in some cases, and thus we develop a new similarity measure between intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then we apply the developed similarity measure for consensus analysis in group decision making based on intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations, and finally further extend it to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set theory.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic and interval-valued intutionistic fuzzy preference relations and their measures of similarity for the evaluation of agreement within a group", "paper_id": "WOS:000265818300001"}
