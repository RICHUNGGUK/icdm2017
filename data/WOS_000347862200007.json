The hypercube is one of the most popular interconnection networks. In this paper we consider the balanced hypercube, which is a variant of the hypercube. Huang and Wu showed that the balanced hypercube has better properties than hypercube with the same number of links and processors. Let F-e be the set of faulty edges in an n-dimensional balanced hypercube BHn, where n >= 2. In this paper, we consider BHn with vertical bar Fe vertical bar <= 2n - 3 faulty edges and prove that every fault-free edge lies on a fault-free cycle of every even length from 6 to 2(2n) in BHn-F-e. Furthermore, we prove that the lower limit of the length 6 is sharp by giving a counter example. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
