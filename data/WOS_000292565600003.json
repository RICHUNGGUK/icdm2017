Analyzing the video packets received by the client application, the estimator is capable of selecting the most suitable encoding bitrate for the available bandwidth in the end-to-end path. The estimator has been integrated in a real client/server architecture and evaluated with different network traffic situations. The results of the performed evaluation have revealed the stability and adaptation speed as the best qualities of our proposal.", "paper_title": "A non-intrusive estimation for high-quality Internet TV services", "paper_id": "WOS:000292565600003"}
