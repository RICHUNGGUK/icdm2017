By high contrast, we mean that the electrical or thermal conductivity ratios are high. Our approach involves a modification of the standard integral representation using, in electrostatic terms, the polarization charge as an unknown. It is related to the perturbation approach proposed by Tausch and White [J. Tausch, J. White, Capacitance extraction of 3-D conductor systems in dielectric media with high-permittivity ratios, IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech., 47 (1999) 18-26], but based on a simple form of projection rather than on the solution of auxiliary integral equations. Numerical implementation is straightforward in the multiple dielectric case. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
