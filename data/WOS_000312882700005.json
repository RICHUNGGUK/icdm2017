We study these variations with respect to domain reductions. The effectivity theory induced by these variations is not stable, and this paper investigates some of the rich structure found. We follow Mostowski (On computable sequences. Fund. Math., 44, 37-51) and use computable sequences to exhibit this structure.", "paper_title": "Interval Domains and Computable Sequences: A Case Study of Domain Reductions", "paper_id": "WOS:000312882700005"}
