However, most approaches focus on feature extraction from 2D images while ignoring the spatial information of the 3D model. In order to improve the effectiveness of view-based methods on 3D model retrieval, this paper proposes a novel method for characteristic view extraction and similarity measurement. First, the graph clustering method is used for view grouping and the random-walk algorithm is applied to adaptively update the weight of each view. The spatial information of the 3D object is utilized to construct a view-graph model, thus enabling each characteristic view to represent the discriminative visual feature in terms of specific spatial context. Next, by considering the view set as a graph model, the similarity measurement of two models can be converted into a graph matching problem. This problem is solved by mathematically formulating it as a Rayleigh quotient maximization with affinity constraints for similarity measurement Extensive comparison experiments were conducted on the popular ETH, NW, PSB, and MV-RED 3D model datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
