In the proposed scheme a neural controller is constructed based on the single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) for approximating the unknown nonlinearities of dynamic systems. A sliding mode controller is also incorporated to compensate for the modelling errors of SLFN. The parameters of the SLFN are modified using the recently proposed neural algorithm named extreme learning machine (ELM), where the parameters of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly. However different from the original ELM algorithm, the output weights are updated based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach to guarantee the stability of the overall control system, even in the presence of modelling errors which are offset using the sliding mode controller. Finally the proposed adaptive neural controller is applied to control the inverted pendulum system with two different reference trajectories. The simulation results demonstrate that good tracking performance is achieved by the proposed control scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
