It is also able to measure/collect behavior data of the cricket on-line. The behavior selection of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) is influenced by the experience or the context in living environment. In our current research, we are trying to investigate neuronal mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior switching of the cricket based on individual interactions. However in conventional biological experiments, the conditions are not maneuverable intentionally. Therefore, we are developing an integrated system for conducting active interaction experiments and gathering behavior data related to the effect of interactions. The prototype consists of a micro mobile robot as a physical interaction agent, a camera and a microphone and a computer. The computer is for commanding the robot by the operator's input. It also works for recording the data of a video sequence, on-line motion tracking and the audio during the experiment. Interaction experiments with the cricket utilizing the prototype system were done. From the results, we could confirm it works well especially for maneuvering experimental conditions and on-line experimental data gathering. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
