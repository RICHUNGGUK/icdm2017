The existing highly robust watermark algorithms are applying \"detectable watermarks\" for which a detection mechanism checks if the watermark exists or not (a Boolean decision) based on a watermarking key. The problem is that the detection of a watermark in a digital image library containing thousands of images means that the watermark detection algorithm is necessary to apply all the keys to the digital images. This application is non-efficient for very large image databases. On the other hand \"readable\" watermarks may prove weaker but easier to detect as only the detection mechanism is required. The proposed watermarking algorithm combine's the advantages of both \"detectable\" and \"readable\" watermarks. The result is a fast and robust multimedia application which has the ability to cast readable multibit watermarks into digital images. The watermarking application is capable of hiding 2(14) different keys into digital images and casting multiple zero-bit watermarks onto the same coefficient area while maintaining a sufficient level of robustness.", "paper_title": "A multimedia application for watermarking digital images based on a content based image retrieval technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000275800200011"}
