Under-voltage load shedding (UVLS) is one of the most important tools for avoiding voltage instability. In this paper, the UVLS problem is formulated based on the concept of the static voltage stability margin and its sensitivity at the maximum loading point or the collapse point. The voltage stability criterion is modeled directly into the load-shedding scheme. In any UVLS scheme finding the global point is very important for having cost effective economy. The proposed PSO-B-SA methodology is implemented in the under-voltage load shedding scheme for IEEE 14 and 118 bus test systems. In addition to having better solution, the global property of the proposed approach plays an important role in on-line applications. Simulation results show the efficacy and advantage of the proposed scheme. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
