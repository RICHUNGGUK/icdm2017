Traditional learning-based feature selection methods separate embedding learning and feature ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework, termed as the joint embedding learning and sparse regression (JELSR), in which the embedding learning and sparse regression are jointly performed. Specifically, the proposed JELSR joins embedding learning with sparse regression to perform feature selection. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we also provide a method using the weight via local linear approximation and adding the l(2,1)-norm regularization, and design an effective algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Furthermore, we also conduct some insightful discussion on the proposed feature selection approach, including the convergence analysis, computational complexity, and parameter determination. In all, the proposed framework not only provides a new perspective to view traditional methods but also evokes some other deep researches for feature selection. Compared with traditional unsupervised feature selection methods, our approach could integrate the merits of embedding learning and sparse regression. Promising experimental results on different kinds of data sets, including image, voice data and biological data, have validated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Joint Embedding Learning and Sparse Regression: A Framework for Unsupervised Feature Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000337960000006"}
