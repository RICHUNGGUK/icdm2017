The first component consists of a novel semi-supervised possibilistic clustering and feature weighting algorithm based on robust modeling of the generalized Dirichlet (GD) finite mixture. This algorithm is used to group image regions into prototypical region clusters that summarize the training data and can be used as the basis of annotating new test images. The constraints consist of pairs of image regions that should not be included in the same cluster. These constraints are deduced from the irrelevance of all concepts annotating the training images to help in guiding the clustering process. The second component of our system consists of a probabilistic model that relies on the possibilistic membership degrees, generated by the clustering algorithm, to annotate unlabeled images. The proposed system was implemented and tested on a data set that include thousands of images using four-fold cross validation.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANNOTATION BASED ON SEMI-SUPERVISED CLUSTERING AND MEMBERSHIP-BASED CROSS MEDIA RELEVANCE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000314402900007"}
