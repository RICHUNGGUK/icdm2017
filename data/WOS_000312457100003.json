The network is constructed by random addition of nodes on the plan. The probability for a previous node to be connected to the new one is inversely proportional to their spatial distance to the power alpha. The spreading rate between two nodes is inversely proportional to their spatial distance. The effective spreading time increases with the increasing of alpha. The proportional coefficient is found to have a alpha-dependent threshold with a maximum situated in the interval 1: 5 < alpha < 2.", "paper_title": "IMPACTS OF SPATIAL STRUCTURE ON EPIDEMIC SPREADING", "paper_id": "WOS:000312457100003"}
