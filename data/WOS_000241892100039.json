MAICSA combines the characteristic of Multi-Agent with the search strategy of Immune Clonal Selection Algorithm. To compare with the conventional Genetic Algorithm (GA), MAICSA overcomes the most serious drawbacks, such as slow convergence rate and \"prematurity\". The experimental results show that MAICSA has faster astringency and higher precision than traditional GA, MAGA (Multi-Agent multicast routing based on Genetic Algorithm) and MAIA (Multi-Agent multicast routing based on Immune Algorithm).", "paper_title": "Multi-agent immune clonal selection algorithm based multicast routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100039"}
