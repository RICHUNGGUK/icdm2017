A free-weighting matrices method based on linear control design approach is presented to design the robust H-infinity damping controller to improve the dynamical performance of power systems. Firstly, the linearized reduced-order plant model is established, which efficiently considers the signal's time delay and disturbance. Then, the design of multi-FACTS robust H-infinity damping controller is formulated as the standard control problem on delay-dependent state-feedback robust control based on the robust control theory. Finally, the simulation tests are carried out on the 2-area 4-machine power systems. Satisfactory test results verify the correctness of the proposed damping controller.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity Damping Control of Multi-FACTS Devices for Stability Enhancement of Power Systems with Signal's Time Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200010"}
