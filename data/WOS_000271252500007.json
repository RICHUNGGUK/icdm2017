The resulting least-squares procedure can be split into two independent symmetric positive definite sub-schemes and does not need to solve a coupled system of equations. Theory analysis shows that the method yields the approximate solutions with optimal accuracy in L(2)(Omega) norm, for the primal unknown and in H(div; Omega) norm for the unknown flux, respectively. Numerical examples in one dimension, which are consistent with the theoretical results, are provided to demonstrate the characteristic behavior of this approach. (C) 2009 IMACS.
