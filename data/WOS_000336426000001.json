This paper presents the first sub-quadratic recognition algorithm for the class of circle graphs. Our algorithm is O(n+m) times the inverse Ackermann function, alpha(n+m), whose value is smaller than 4 for any practical graph. The algorithm is based on a new incremental Lexicographic Breadth-First Search characterization of circle graphs, and a new efficient data-structure for circle graphs, both developed in the paper. The algorithm is an extension of a Split Decomposition algorithm with the same running time developed by the authors in a companion paper.", "paper_title": "Practical and Efficient Circle Graph Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000336426000001"}
