Under this pressure, the scope of credit prediction needs to be broadened to the customer management after delinquency occurs. In doing so, this study clusters the credit card debtors in a retail company into homogeneous segments by using a self-organizing map. This study then develops credit prediction models to recognize the repayment patterns of each segment by using a Cox proportional hazard analysis. The credit prediction models are evaluated and the managerial implications of the study are provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
