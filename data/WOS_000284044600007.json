In this paper, we approach one aspect of the study of tiling computability: the quest for a universal tile set. Using a complex construction, based on Robinson's classical construction and its different modifications, we build a tile set y (pronounced ayin) that almost always simulates any tile set. By way of Banach-Mazur games on tilings topological spaces, we prove that the set of y-tilings that do not satisfy the universality condition is meagre in the set of y-tilings.", "paper_title": "Tilings: simulation and universality", "paper_id": "WOS:000284044600007"}
