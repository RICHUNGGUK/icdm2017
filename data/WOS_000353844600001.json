TGL has a notion of model that generalizes both first-order models and Henkin models of the lambda-calculus. The abstract notions of term syntax and model are shown to be sufficient for obtaining the completeness theorem of a Gentzen system generalizing that of first-order logic. Various systems featuring bindings and contextual reasoning, ranging from pure type systems to the pi-calculus, are captured as theories inside TGL. For two particular, but rather typical instances-untyped lambda-calculus and System F-the general-purpose TGL models are shown to be equivalent with standard ad hoc models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
