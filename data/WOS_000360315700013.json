In-network caching has been viewed as an attractive feature of ICN because it can reduce network traffic, alleviate server bottleneck, and reduce the user access latencies. Because of this, the network community has proposed many in-network caching mechanisms that aim at optimizing various performance metrics such as cache hit ratio and cache hit distance. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the recently proposed in-network caching mechanisms for ICN. For each caching mechanism, we describe it in detail, present examples to illustrate how it works, and analyze its possible benefits and drawbacks. We also compare some typical in-network caching mechanisms through extensive simulations and discuss the remaining research challenges.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Caching Mechanisms in Information-Centric Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000360315700013"}
