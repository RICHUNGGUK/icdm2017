Routing protocols in Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching, using distributed SRLG information, can calculate paths avoiding certain SRLGs. For single SRLG failure an end-to-end SRLG-disjoint path pair can be calculated, but to ensure connection in the event of multiple SRLG failures a set with more than two end-to-end SRLG-disjoint paths should be used. Two heuristic, the Conflicting SRLG-Exclusion Min Sum (CoSE-MS) and the Iterative Modified Suurballes's Heuristic (IMSH), for calculating node and SRLG-disjoint path pairs, which use the Modified Suurballes's Heuristic, are reviewed and new versions (CoSE-MScd and IMSHd) are proposed, which may improve the number of obtained optimal solutions. Moreover two new heuristics are proposed: kCoSE-MScd and kIMSHd, to calculate a set of node and SRLG-disjoint paths, seeking to minimize its total cost. To the best of our knowledge these heuristics are a first proposal for seeking a set of node and SRLG-disjoint paths of minimal additive cost. The performance of the proposed heuristics is evaluated using a real network structure, where SRLGs were randomly defined. The number of solutions found, the percentage of optimal solutions and the relative error of the sub-optimal solutions are presented. Also the CPU time for solving the problem in a path computation element is reported.", "paper_title": "Two Heuristics for Calculating a Shared Risk Link Group Disjoint Set of Paths of Min-Sum Cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000360549300011"}
