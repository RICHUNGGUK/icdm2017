The method consists in detecting and diagnosing NoC interconnect faults using BIST structures and activating alternative paths for the faulty links. Alternative paths use the inherent redundancy of the torus topology, thus leading to minimal performance, area, and power overhead. We assume an extended interconnect fault model comprising stuck-at and pairwise shorts within a single link or between any two links in the network. Experimental results for a 3 x 3 NoC show that the proposed approach can correctly diagnose 93% of all possible interconnect faults and can mitigate 42% of those faults (representing 94.4% of the solvable faults) with a worst case performance penalty of 8% and 1% of area overhead. We also demonstrate the scalability of the method by presenting its application to larger NoCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
