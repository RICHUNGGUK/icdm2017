We consider a complex adaptive system as a model for the development of design representations, and present a semi-constructive algebraic formalism for design representations, termed sorts, as a candidate for supporting this approach. We analyze sorts with respect to the requirements of a complex adaptive system and compare it to other representational formalisms that consider a constructive approach to representations. We demonstrate the advantages of sorts in various examples, illustrate its use to support the specification of design queries and the recognition of emergent information, and consider sorts in relationship to integrated product models.
