In our research we investigate pronunciation errors frequently made by foreigners learning Dutch as a second language. In the present paper we focus on the velar fricative /x/ and the velar plosive /k/. We compare four types of classifiers that can be used to detect erroneous pronunciations of these phones: two acoustic-phonetic classifiers (one of which employs Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)), a classifier based on cepstral coefficients in combination with LDA, and one based on confidence measures (the so-called Goodness Of Pronunciation score). The best results were obtained for the two LDA classifiers which produced accuracy levels of about 85-93%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
