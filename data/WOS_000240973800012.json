The two first parts of the survey address system design problems for winter road maintenance. The third part concentrates mainly on vehicle routing problems for spreading operations. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of optimization models and solution methodologies for the routing of vehicles for plowing and snow disposal operations. We also review models for the fleet sizing and fleet replacement problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A survey of models and algorithms for winter road maintenance.
