Using the sliding mode control technique, an adaptive control law is established which guarantees projective synchronization even when the dead-zone nonlinearity is present. Computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization scheme. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
