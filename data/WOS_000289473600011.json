After applying the LDI sampling-based membership classification, the most challenging part, a trimmed adaptive contouring algorithm, is developed to reconstruct the mesh surface from the LDI samples near the intersected regions and stitch it to the boundary of the retained surfaces. Our method of approximate Boolean operations holds the advantage of numerical robustness as the approach uses volumetric representation. However, unlike other methods based on volumetric representation, we do not damage the facets in nonintersected regions, thus preserving geometric details much better and speeding up the computation as well. We show that the proposed method can successfully compute the Boolean operations of freeform solids with a massive number of polygons in a few seconds.", "paper_title": "Approximate Boolean Operations on Large Polyhedral Solids with Partial Mesh Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000289473600011"}
