However, most eye trackers have a limited tracking range, e.g., +/- 35A degrees in the horizontal direction. This paper proposed a method to combine head pose tracking and eye gaze tracking together to achieve a large range of tracking in virtual driving simulation environments. Multiple parallel multilayer perceptrons were used to reconstruct the relationship between head images and head poses. Head images were represented with the coefficients extracted from Principal Component Analysis. Eye gaze tracking provides precise results on the front view, while head pose tracking is more suitable for tracking areas of interest than for tracking points of interest on the side view.", "paper_title": "An integrated head pose and eye gaze tracking approach to non-intrusive visual attention measurement for wide FOV simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000300657600004"}
