This strategy considers three factors: Coverage rate, node energy consumption and node residual energy. The advantage of this method is to prolong the maintenance period and reduce the computational complexity. We first construct the networks health indicator to determine the locations of redeployed nodes. Therefore, the maintenance problem is formulated into cost optimization problem, and the linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization is employed to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed particle swarm optimization based maintenance strategy (PSOMS) outperforms the random and uniform redeploy strategy with longer repair period.", "paper_title": "A Pso-Based Maintenance Strategy in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000346832900005"}
