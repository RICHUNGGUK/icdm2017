The algorithm is model-free and operates on the latent space of the motion, by first aggregating all the sensor data into a single vector, and then modeling them on a low-dimensional manifold to perform segmentation. The proposed approach is contrasted to a basic, model-based algorithm, which operates directly on the joint angles computed by the Orient sensor devices. The latent space algorithm is shown to be capable of retrieving qualitative features of the motion even in the face of noisy or incomplete sensor readings.", "paper_title": "Latent Space Segmentation for Mobile Gait Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000321217900004"}
