The model of DIEMNF is first established as a modified neural field model. Second, it has been proved that if the interconnection of neural field is symmetric, then every trajectory of the system converges to an equilibrium. The boundedness condition for integrodifferential equations modeling neural field with delay is obtained. Moreover, when the interconnection is asymmetric, we give a sufficient condition that can guarantee that the equilibrium of the DIEMNF is unique and is also a global attractor.", "paper_title": "Boundedness and stability for integrodifferential equations modeling neural field with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000243524000010"}
