This Viterbi principle is used in combination with semantic data to improve the accuracy, that is, the environment of the object that is being tracked and a motion model. The starting point is a fingerprinting technique for which an advanced network planner is used to automatically construct the radio map, avoiding a time consuming measurement campaign. The developed algorithm was verified with simulations and with experiments in a building-wide testbed for sensor experiments, where a median accuracy below 2 m was obtained. Compared to a reference algorithm without Viterbi or semantic data, the results indicated a significant improvement: the mean accuracy and standard deviation improved by, respectively, 26.1% and 65.3%. Thereafter a sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the influence of node density, grid size, memory usage, and semantic data on the performance.", "paper_title": "Advanced Real-Time Indoor Tracking Based on the Viterbi Algorithm and Semantic Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000363579300001"}
