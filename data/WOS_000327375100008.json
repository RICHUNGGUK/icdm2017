This paper describes a system implementation that provides emotion awareness, both explicitly, by self-reporting of emotions through a usable web tool, and implicitly, via sentiment analysis. Prominent theories, models and techniques of emotion, emotion learning, emotion detection and affective feedback are reviewed. We also present findings from our experiment with university students, validating the explicit mechanism in real education settings. Finally, we set open issues for future experimentation, contributing to the research agenda.", "paper_title": "A Dual-Modal System that Evaluates User's Emotions in Virtual Learning Environments and Responds Affectively", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100008"}
