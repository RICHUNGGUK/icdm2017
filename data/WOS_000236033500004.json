We propose a direct surface reconstruction approach which starts from a continuous geometric functional that is minimized up to a discretization by a global graph-cut algorithm operating on a 3D embedded graph. The method is related to the stereo disparity computation based on graph-cut formulation, but fundamentally different in two aspects. First, existing stereo disparity methods are only interested in obtaining layers of constant disparity, while we focus on high resolution surface geometry. Second, most of the existing graph-cut algorithms only reach approximate solutions, while we guarantee a global minimum. The whole procedure is consistently incorporated into a voxel representation that handles both occlusions and discontinuities. We demonstrate our algorithm on real sequences, yielding remarkably detailed Surface geometry up to 1/10th of a pixel.", "paper_title": "A surface reconstruction method using global graph cut optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000236033500004"}
