Changes to a single system can therefore have an unexpected impact on other, dependent systems. In our Caro approach we try to cope with this problem by observing each system participating in the infrastructure and analyzing the impact of any change that occurs. The analysis process is driven by declaratively defined rules and works with a generic and extensible graph model to represent the relevant metadata that is subject to changes. This makes Caro applicable to heterogeneous scenarios and customizable to special needs.", "paper_title": "Change management in large-scale enterprise information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200009"}
