The proposed control concept may lead to easier distributed control implementation of parallel DC-DC converters and distributed power systems. For equipment with significant power requirement, the traditional single power supply may not be adequate. Many power supplies with parallel regulation control can be used to solve this problem. This paper proposes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to control paralleled DC-DC buck converters and current sharing is achieved. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to derive optimal or near optimal PID controller gains. Both simulations and experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis through an experimental prototype of paralleled DC-DC buck converters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
