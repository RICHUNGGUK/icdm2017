The monocyclic 1,2-dihydro-1,2-phosphasiletes are shown to be the thermodynamically preferred product, in contrast to the isomerization of the hydrocarbons, which favors the 1,3-butadiene structure. Furthermore, an unprecedented direct isomerization pathway to the 1,2-dihydro-1,2- phosphasiletes was identified. This pathway is competitive with the isomerization via the open-chain butadienes and becomes favorable when electron-donating substituents are present on silicon.", "paper_title": "Valence isomerization of 2-phospha-4-silabicyclo[1.1.0]butane: a high-level ab initio study", "paper_id": "WOS:000239248300002"}
