With a high cumulative cross-validated regression coefficient value (Q(cum)(2)) of 0.927 and low standard deviation (SD) of 0.065, the model obtained by the training set shows a good predictive ability, and it is validated to be robust by predicting the test set. Among 20 quantum chemical descriptors, the dielectric energy (DE), the molecular weight (M(w)), and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy (E(HOMO)) are the key descriptors governing the logk(d) values in the model. Increase in the DE or decrease in the M(w) values leads to the increase in logk(d), indicating the van der Waals interactions and steric hindrance effect on the depuration process. Decrease in the E(HOMO) values results in increasing the logk(d) values, implying important roles the molecular orbital energies may play in the biological depuration of PAHs in mussels.", "paper_title": "QSARs on the Depuration Rate Constants of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Elliptio complanata", "paper_id": "WOS:000266290200005"}
