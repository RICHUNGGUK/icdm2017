So far, the performance of the combined Shewhart-EWMA (CSEWMA) has been investigated under the assumption that the process parameters are known. However, parameters are often estimated from reference Phase I samples. Since chart performances may be even largely affected by estimation errors, we study the behaviour of the CSEWMA with estimated parameters in both in- and out-of-control situations. Comparisons with standard Shewhart and EWMA charts are presented. Recommendations are given for Phase I sample size requirements necessary to achieve desired in-control performance.", "paper_title": "Combined Shewhart-EWMA control charts with estimated parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000278439300006"}
