The governing equations are based on the Reissner-Naghdi type shell theory, which include the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. Explicit discrete forms of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions are presented. It is shown that using only few grid points, accurate results are obtained which demonstrate the efficiency and convenience of the DQ method (DQM) for the problem under consideration. The effects of different types of boundary conditions, opening angle, thickness-to-length and orthotropy ratios on the frequencies of antisymmetric cross-ply laminated arches are studied.
