However, these scores use only the pairwise constraints and ignore the available information brought by the unlabeled data. Moreover, these constraint scores strongly depend on the given must-link and cannot-link subsets built by the user. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a new semi-supervised constraint score that uses both pairwise constraints and local properties of the unlabeled data. Experiments using Kendall's coefficient and accuracy rates, show that this new score is less sensitive to the given constraints than the previous scores while providing similar performances.
