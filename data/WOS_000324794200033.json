In the literature, several mathematical models have been used to describe the dynamics of viral infections. In addition, several control strategies have been reported in the literature to deal with optimal antiviral therapy problem of infectious diseases. In this paper, three controller structures with optimized parameters using covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy algorithm are proposed for optimal control of basic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection dynamical system. The first structure is an optimized neural-type sigmoid-based closed-loop controller, which is a nonlinear feedback controller. The second structure is an optimized open-loop time-based fuzzy controller in which the control input is approximated using the mixture of Gaussian membership functions. Finally, an optimized closed-loop fuzzy controller is used as the third control structure. After designing the controllers, some parameters of the HBV infection model are considered to be unknown and the robustness of the controllers is studied. Experimental results show that the optimized neural-type sigmoid-based closed-loop controller has the best performance in terms of healthy hepatocytes and free HBVs concentration among the investigated controllers and the optimized closed-loop fuzzy controller is the best in terms of minimum mean control input signal that is the drug usage. Concerning the robustness, the optimized neural-type sigmoid-based closed-loop controller has the best performance.", "paper_title": "Application of covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy to optimal control of hepatitis B infection", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200033"}
