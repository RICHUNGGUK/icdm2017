This paper analyzes the original Roofline model and proposes a novel approach to provide a more insightful performance modeling of modern architectures by introducing cache-awareness, thus significantly improving the guidelines for application optimization. The proposed model was experimentally verified for different architectures by taking advantage of built-in hardware counters with a curve fitness above 90%.", "paper_title": "Cache-aware Roofline model: Upgrading the loft", "paper_id": "WOS:000344987900006"}
