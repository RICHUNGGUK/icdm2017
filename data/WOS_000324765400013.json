In this work, we develop a source localization algorithm on solids with applications to human-computer interface. We employ surface-mounted piezoelectric shock sensors that, in turn, allow us to convert existing flat surfaces to a low-cost touch interface. The algorithm estimates the time-differences-of-arrival between the signals via onset detection in the time-frequency domain. The proposed algorithm is suitable for vibration signals generated by a metal stylus and a finger. The validity of the algorithm is then verified on an aluminium and a glass plate surface.", "paper_title": "Localization of Taps on Solid Surfaces for Human-Computer Touch Interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000324765400013"}
