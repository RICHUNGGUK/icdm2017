Additive controller gain perturbations axe considered. Both subsystems and interconnections include time-delays. A low-order control design system is first constructed. Then, stabilizing controllers with norm bounded gain uncertainties axe designed for the control design system using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability approaches. The main result shows that when such a non-fragile low-order controllers axe implemented into each local controller of the decentralized controller for the global system, the global closed-loop systems axe globally asymptotically stable.", "paper_title": "NON-FRAGILE CONTROLLERS FOR A CLASS OF TIME-DELAY NONLINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264627500003"}
