However, there is not presently a strict definition for the measurement or reporting of this parameter. This article defines resolution as the smallest distance between two non-overlapping position commands. Methods are presented for simulating and predicting resolution in both the time and frequency domains. In order to simplify resolution measurement, a new technique is proposed which allows the resolution to be estimated from a measurement of the closed-loop actuator voltage. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the proposed techniques. The paper concludes by comparing the resolution benefits of new control schemes over standard output feedback techniques.
