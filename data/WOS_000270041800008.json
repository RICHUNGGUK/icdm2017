The TLRs are coupled by current-biased Josephson junctions, which act as tunable couplers between each two nearest TLRs, and a superconducting qubit is fabricated in the center of each TLR. We show that some important quantum information processing, such as quantum state transfer and preparation of remote entanglement, can be achieved in this system, and we also propose a scheme for generating the W-class states.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING IN AN ARRAY OF SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSMISSION LINE RESONATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270041800008"}
