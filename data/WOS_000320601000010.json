Furthermore, in order to protect the users from being tracked when they login to the remote server, researchers have proposed some dynamic ID based remote user authentication schemes for multi-server environments. Recently, Lee et al. have pointed out the security weaknesses of Hsiang and Shih's dynamic ID based multi-server authentication scheme, and proposed an improved dynamic ID based authentication scheme for multi-server environments. They claimed that their scheme provided user anonymity, mutual authentication, session key agreement and can resist several kinds of attacks. In this paper, however, we find that Lee et al.'s scheme is still vulnerable to forgery attack and server spoofing attack. Besides, their scheme cannot provide proper authentication if the mutual authentication message is partly modified by the attacker. In order to remove these security weaknesses, we propose a novel smart card and dynamic ID based authentication scheme for multi-server environments. In order to protect the user from being tracked, the proposed scheme enables the user's identity to change dynamically when the user logs into the server. The proposed scheme is suitable for use in multi-server environments such as financial security authentication since it can ensure security while maintaining efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
