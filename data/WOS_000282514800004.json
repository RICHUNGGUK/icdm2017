The problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization model, subject to quality of service (QoS) requirements, and solved by the Lagrangean relaxation approach. In addition, Lagrangean multipliers are used to conduct sensitivity analysis. The model's objective is to minimize the weighted call blocking rate in terms of the distribution diversity. The model's performance is evaluated by the proposed HFCS, which is an adaptive scheme (AS). We compare the performance of AS with that of a non-adaptive (NA) scheme, which is a common power control method. Experiment results show that combining sectorization with the bandwidth segmentation scheme provides effective adaptive load balancing (ALB). The performance improvement achieved by the proposed adaptive scheme over the common power control scheme is as high as 68%. Moreover, under the scheme, the performance improves as the traffic load increases. Load balancing improves even further when AS is combined with the sectorization.", "paper_title": "Modeling of Adaptive Load Balancing with Hybrid F/CDMA and Sectorization Schemes in Mobile Communication Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282514800004"}
