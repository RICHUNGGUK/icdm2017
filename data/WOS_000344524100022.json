We derive analogs of Johnson bounds and give constructions showing these bounds to be asymptotically tight up to a constant factor under certain conditions. We also examine the rates of multiply constant-weight codes and demonstrate that these rates are the same as those of constant-weight codes of corresponding parameters.", "paper_title": "Multiply Constant-Weight Codes and the Reliability of Loop Physically Unclonable Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100022"}
