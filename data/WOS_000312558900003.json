Its aim is to address the shortcomings of existing approaches to system verification and the tracking of anomalies in safety-critical wireless systems. We use Architecture Analysis and Description Language (AADL) to describe an analysis-oriented architecture model with highly modular components. We also develop the cooperative tool chains required to analyze the performance of a wireless system by simulation. We show how this framework can support a detailed and largely automated analysis of a complicated, networked wireless system using examples from wireless healthcare and video broadcasting.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Analysis of Wireless System Architectures for Real-Time Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000312558900003"}
