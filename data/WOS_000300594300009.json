These developments mainly include the determination of desired direction of pedestrians in the walkways, the action of pedestrians encountering walls around corner, and the generation of pedestrians in the walkways at the initial time of each simulation. Using the developed model, the effects, which the walkway corner and pedestrian preference to inside routes have on the pedestrian queue, trajectory and flow-density relation, are investigated by numerical simulations. Simulation results indicate that, under certain conditions, increasing the turning degree of corner has negative impact on the pedestrian queues; the effects of the pedestrian preference to inside routes on the pedestrian queues and flows are not still positive; the flow-density relation of pedestrian flow through walkways with corners, compared with that of pedestrian flow through bottleneck, is more complex, and in different region partition in the walkways, different relation of flow to initial density can be shown.
