It increases link reliability, provides higher capacity, reduces transmit power, and extends transmission range for the same level of performance and modulation rate. In this paper, we study the achievable gain of cooperative communications from a wireless cross-layer point of view in multi hop networks. We propose two routing algorithms applicable for wireless ad hoc networks. First, we propose an edge node based on a greedy cooperative routing (ENBGCR) algorithm, where we modify the geographic routing algorithm to incorporate the cooperative transmission and extend the coverage range of the nodes. The main objective of ENBGCR algorithm is to minimize the number of hops that messages transverse to reach their destination. Then the energy-efficient cooperative routing algorithm is proposed to minimize the end-to-end total transmission power subject to end-to-end target data rate. Simulation results for both algorithms show that the proposed strategies have great improvement in terms of delay and power saving respectively for the same quality of service requirement as compared to traditional algorithms.", "paper_title": "Multi-hop routing with cooperative transmission: a cross-layer approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000342229400002"}
