In this paper, we use both text information from closed captions and visual information from video frames to generate links to enable users to easily explore not only the original video content but also augmented information from the Web. This solution especially shows its superiority when the video content cannot be fully represented by closed captions. A prototype system was implemented and some experiments were carried out to prove its effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Mining text and visual links to browse TV programs in a web-like way", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000023"}
