However, there is little explicit information about how and in which musical contexts this manipulation occurs. In this paper we describe a machine learning approach to modeling the knowledge applied by a musician when performing a score in order to produce an expressive performance. In particular, we apply inductive logic programming techniques in order to automatically learn models for both understanding and generating expressive violin performances.", "paper_title": "Modeling violin performances using inductive logic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000281877900005"}
