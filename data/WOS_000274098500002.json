Two planning experiments testing the map-based application called WebMapMedia are featured. The literature review of the paper describes attempts to utilize geographic information systems (GIS) in participation, pointing out severe weaknesses of these systems in acquiring and processing qualitative local knowledge. The results of the experiments show that the Web-based technology supports regular but short-term \"lunch break participation\" that occurs in the week during the office hours. The other results reveal a symbiotic relationship between conventional and Web-based means of participation and the potential of the Web-based technology to broaden participation. It is also found that if the technology can be adapted to the stages of the planning process, it may facilitate knowledge creation in the process. The Google Maps mashup based on Web 2.0 approach exhibits certain advantages over GIS-based solutions. Based on the results, it is argued that a prerequisite for the full utilization of the Web-based technology in participation is the evolution of the planning process and the attitudes of the planners.", "paper_title": "WebMapMedia: a map-based Web application for facilitating participation in spatial planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000274098500002"}
