The unified neural networks, which can be used in both continues-time space and discrete-time space, takes advantage with a high sampling frequency. In the framework of the newly proposed neural networks, the delay-dependent stability criteria is derived in terms of linear matrix inequality by constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function in the delta domain. A numerical simulation is given to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
