Experiments on grayscale and color images demonstrate that these novel filters outperform classical morphological operations with a fixed, space-invariant structuring element for noise reduction applications. Tests on synthetic 3D images are then performed to show the high noise-reduction capacity of amoeba-based filters. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
