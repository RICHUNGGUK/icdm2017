The WA technique reduces the problem of writing a \"one\" through an nMOS pass device, thereby making a single-ended bit line more attractive. Both active power and leakage power can be significantly reduced. Leakage charge can be pooled to help precharge bit lines. Cell area and performance are competitive with traditional SRAM cell area and performance.", "paper_title": "A new single-ended SRAM cell with write-assist", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684600005"}
