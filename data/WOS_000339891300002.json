The main idea is to match skeleton graphs by comparing the geodesic paths between skeleton endpoints. Our approach is motivated by the fact that the path feature is stable in the presence of articulation of components. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in terms of robustness to symmetry, discrimination against different graph structures, and high efficiency in the retrieval of nonrigid 3D shapes.", "paper_title": "Symmetry discovery and retrieval of nonrigid 3D shapes using geodesic skeleton paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300002"}
