However, its use is limited to the rate versus substrate-concentration analysis, as the integrated Webb equation cannot be expressed in an explicit closed-form reformulation of the time-dependent solution. In this article, I construct explicit approximations to the solution of the Webb rate equation as a recursive series using the Adomian decomposition method. This decomposition method is an elegant technique to handle nonlinear differential equations effectively, and thus it has recently been widely used to solve this class of equations in the sciences and engineering. I demonstrate here that the algebraic nature of these approximations to the solution of the Webb equation makes progress-curve analysis through the integrated rate equation an attractive and useful alternative for the cholinesterases that can be simply performed using any optional standard nonlinear regression software.", "paper_title": "Solution of the Webb Equation for Kinetics of Cholinesterase Substrate-Inhibition/Activation Using the Adomian Decomposition Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000328719100002"}
