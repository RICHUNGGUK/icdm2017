The quantity tau(d) was introduced by Dash, Fukasawa, and Gunluk, who showed that tau(2) = 2, tau(3) = 4, and tau(d) = Omega(2 (d) ), and asked whether tau(d) is finite for all d. Using the Steinitz lemma, in a quantitative version due to Grinberg and Sevastyanov, we prove an upper bound of tau(d) a parts per thousand currency sign d (d+o(d)), and based on a construction of Alon and V, whose main idea goes back to HAyenstad, we obtain a lower bound of tau(d) a parts per thousand yen d (d/2-o(d)). These results contribute to understanding the master equality polyhedron with multiple rows defined by Dash et al. which is a \"universal\" polyhedron encoding valid cutting planes for integer programs (this line of research was started by Gomory in the late 1960s). In particular, the upper bound on tau(d) implies a pseudo-polynomial running time for an algorithm of Dash et al. for integer programming with a fixed number of constraints. The algorithm consists in solving a linear program, and it provides an alternative to a 1981 dynamic programming algorithm of Papadimitriou.", "paper_title": "Vectors in a box", "paper_id": "WOS:000308647100012"}
