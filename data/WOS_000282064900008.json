It is done by incorporating locality preserving constraints inside the cost function of NMF, then a new decomposition of a face with locality preserving can be obtained. As a result, the proposed LPNMF method shares some properties with the Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) such that it can effectively discover the manifold structure embedded in a high-dimensional face space. Experimental results show that LPNMF provides a better representation and achieves higher recognition rates in face recognition.", "paper_title": "LOCALITY PRESERVING NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION WITH APPLICATION TO FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000282064900008"}
