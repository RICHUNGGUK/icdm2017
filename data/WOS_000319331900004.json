We regard an image surface as a three-dimensional terrain and pour water on it. The water finds the valleys and fills them. Our algorithm controls the rainfall process, pouring the water, in such a way that the water fills up to half of the valley's depth. After stopping the rainfall, each wet region represents one character or a noisy component. To segment each character, we labeled the wet regions and regarded them as blobs; since some of the blobs are noisy components, we use a multilayer Perceptron to label each blob as either text or non-text. Since our algorithm classifies the blobs instead of pixels, it preserves stroke connectivity. After several experiments, the proposed binarization algorithm demonstrated superior performance against six well-known algorithms on three sets of degraded document images. The main superiority of our algorithm is on document images with uneven illumination.", "paper_title": "An adaptive water flow model for binarization of degraded document images", "paper_id": "WOS:000319331900004"}
