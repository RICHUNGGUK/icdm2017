A key property of the EHOC scheme is that it has excellent stability and higher accuracy so that the high gradients near the boundary layer areas can be effectively resolved without refining the mesh. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the currently proposed scheme. Computation results of the MHD flow in the 2D square-channel problems with different wall conductivities are presented for Hartmann numbers ranging from 10 to 10(6). The numerical solutions obtained with the newly developed EHOC scheme are also compared with analytic solutions and numerical results by other available methods in the literature.
