As the name suggests, VS-PSTG adopts Particle Swarm Optimization to ensure optimal test size reduction. To determine its efficiency in terms of the size of the generated test suite, VS-PSTG was subjected to well-known benchmark configurations. Comparative results indicate that VS-PSTG gives competitive results as compared to existing strategies. An empirical case study was conducted on a non-trivial software system to show the applicability of the strategy and to determine the effectiveness of the generated test suites to detect faults.
