For the former, by using adaptive control method, a sufficient condition is obtained to guarantee the output synchronization of the complex dynamical network. In addition, a pinning adaptive output synchronization criterion is also derived for such network model. Then we extend these results to the case when the output matrix is semi-positive definite. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
