Compared to classification code systems, a personalized KOS made up of topics can represent the technology information in a more agile, detailed manner. This paper presents an approach to automatically construct a KOS of patent documents based on term clumping, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, K-Means clustering and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Term clumping is adopted to generate a better bag-of-words for topic modeling and LDA model is applied to generate raw topics. Then by iteratively using K-Means clustering and PCA on the document set and topics matrix, we generated new upper topics and computed the relationships between topics to construct a KOS. Finally, documents are mapped to the KOS. The nodes of the KOS are topics which are represented by terms and their weights and the leaves are patent documents. We evaluated the approach with a set of Large Aperture Optical Elements (LAOE) patent documents as an empirical study and constructed the LAOE KOS. The method used discovered the deep semantic relationships between the topics and helped better describe the technology themes of LAOE. Based on the KOS, two types of applications were implemented: the automatic classification of patents documents and the categorical refinements above search results.", "paper_title": "Empirical study of constructing a knowledge organization system of patent documents using topic modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000340569800012"}
