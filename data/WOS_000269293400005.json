This technology enables tracking of people and objects, supporting the conception of pervasive networks if identities are linked in real-time to their locations. We propose L-VIRT, a 3-D localization method for RFID tags based only on connectivity information. Virtual landmarks are combined with defined topological constraints to localize tags. A relaxation of the constraints is introduced to attenuate the effect of reading errors and, thus, to increase the precision of the localization. Simulation results show a fine-grained accuracy in free space or moderately obstructive environments, and a satisfactory accuracy in very cluttered environments. Moreover, the use of additional mobile readers enables rapid and large localization error reduction in sparse deployments of static readers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
