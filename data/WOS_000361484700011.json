Then, some desirable properties of these proposed operators are discussed, including monotonicity, idempotency, commutativity and boundedness. Furthermore, based on the proposed operators, some novel methods are developed to solve MAGDM problems with intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information under different cases. Finally, an illustrative example of emergency response capability evaluation is provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "A new method for multiple attribute group decision-making with intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000361484700011"}
