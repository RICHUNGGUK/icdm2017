Normal CA1 place field activity is supported by this input after CA3 has been lesioned. However, inhibitory responses are observed in CA1 after the stimulation of the cortical input in slice preparations. An integrate-and-fire neuron model of the cortical-CA1 network is presented which accounts for both phenomena by using N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors to mediate a significant proportion of the excitatory response. The model demonstrates that a rate coding scheme is consistent with both phenomena, a remaining challenge to temporal coding schemes in the pathway. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
