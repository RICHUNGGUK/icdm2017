In these problems a salesperson has to make deliveries to customers who are willing to help in the process. Customer cooperativeness may be manifested in several modes: they may assist by approaching the salesperson, by reselling the goods they purchased to other customers, or by doing both. Several objectives are of interest: minimizing the total distance traveled by all of the participants, minimizing the maximal distance traveled by a participant and minimizing the total time until all of the deliveries are made. All of the combinations of cooperation modes and objective functions are considered, both in weighted undirected graphs and in Euclidean space. We show that most of the problems have a constant approximation algorithm, many of the others admit a PTAS, and a few are solvable in polynomial time. On the intractability side we provide NP-hardness proofs and inapproximability factors, some of which are tight. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
