In this letter, we take a first step to investigate efficient Media Access Control (MAC) strategies for the UFH-based collaborative broadcast, and derive closed-form expressions of the channel access probabilities for time-slotted systems to minimize the broadcast delay and to significantly reduce the energy cost. Numerical and simulation results are provided to verify our analysis and reveal some insights.", "paper_title": "MAC Design of Uncoordinated FH-Based Collaborative Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100030"}
