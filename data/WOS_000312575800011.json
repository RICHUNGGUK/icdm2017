It is well recognized that in biometric systems feature extraction and representation are key considerations. Among various feature extraction and representation schemes, coding-based methods are most attractive because they have the merits of high accuracy, robustness, compactness and high matching speed, and thus they have been adopted in many different kinds of biometric systems, such as iris, palmprint, and finger-knuckle-print based ones. However, how to devise a good coding scheme is still an open issue. Recent studies in image processing and applied mathematics have shown that local image features can be well extracted with Riesz transforms in a unified framework. Thus, in this paper we propose to utilize Riesz transforms to encode the local patterns of biometric images. Specifically, two Riesz transforms based coding schemes, namely RCode1 and RCode2, are proposed. They both use 3-bits to represent each code and employ the normalized Hamming distance for matching. RCode1 and RCode2 are thoroughly evaluated and compared with the other 3-bit coding methods on a palmprint database and a finger-knuckle-print database. Experiments show that the proposed methods, especially RCode2, could achieve quite similar verification accuracies with the state-of-the-art method (CompCode) while they need much less time at the feature extraction stage, which renders them better candidates for time critical applications.
