We first discuss single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) for LTE and identify potential techniques for further improving the performance of LTE, such as enhanced channel state information feedback and adaptive switching between SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO. Then, we address inter-cell interference mitigation techniques for downlink and uplink, respectively. Finally, potential research challenges and topics in the area are discussed.", "paper_title": "Multi-Cell Coordinated Scheduling and MIMO in LTE", "paper_id": "WOS:000339727700010"}
