However, due to the heterogeneity of resources and the variation of sharing policies from different providers, current P2P-based resource discovery systems may suffer the load imbalance problem in large-scale distributed systems. In this paper, a self-adaptive resource index and discovery system, NAMED SARIDS, is proposed to achieve load balancing in distributed computing environments, by adopting a two-tier architecture based on structured P2P overlay. Experimental results show that SARIDS is scalable yet efficient for load balancing even in non-uniform peer range environments.", "paper_title": "A self-adaptive resource index and discovery system in distributed computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000307168500003"}
