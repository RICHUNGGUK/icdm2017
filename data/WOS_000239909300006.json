Several kinds of reducts preserving some of lower approximations, upper approximations, boundary regions and the unpredictable region are discussed. Relations among those kinds of reducts are investigated. As a basis for reduct computation, Boolean function representations of the preservation of lower approximations, upper approximations, boundary regions and the unpredictable region are discussed. Throughout this paper, the great difference between the analysis using variable precision rough sets and the classical rough set analysis is emphasized.", "paper_title": "Attribute reduction in variable precision rough set model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239909300006"}
