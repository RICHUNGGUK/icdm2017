First, in many organizations, R&D budget represents huge investment. Project selection decisions could be thought with the strategic objectives and plans of the firm. Second, R&D projects' organizational returns are multidimensional in nature and risky in terms of projected outcome. Real options approach helps to calculate this risky side of the selection process. This paper considers that multidimensional side of the R&D project selection process. Another consideration is the vagueness in the evaluation process. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, which takes monetary (fuzzy real option value) and nonmonetary (capability, success probability, trends, etc.) criteria into account, is used to make this selection among alternative R&D projects. A real case study is given to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.
