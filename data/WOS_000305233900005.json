The study of references shared by the articles allows us to obtain a global point of view on the structure of this highly interdisciplinary field. We show that its overall coherence does not arise from a universal theory, but instead from computational techniques and fruitful adaptations of the idea of self-organization to specific systems. We also find that communication between different disciplines goes through specific \"trading zones,\" i.e., subcommunities that create an interface around specific tools (a DNA microchip) or concepts (a network).", "paper_title": "Complex Systems Science: Dreams of Universality, Interdisciplinarity Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000305233900005"}
