The nonlinear delayed HNNs are first established as a modified T-S fuzzy model in which the consequent parts are composed of a set of Markovian jumping HNNs with interval delays. Time delays here are assumed to be time-varying and belong to the given intervals. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach, stability conditions are proposed in terms of the upper and lower bounds of the delays. Finally, numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust Stability for Uncertain Delayed Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Networks With Markovian Jumping Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562700010"}
