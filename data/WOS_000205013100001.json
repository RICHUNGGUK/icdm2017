Given a family of binary, radiation-field sensors and a geometric reference structure, we refer to the set of sensor states induced by a source at point p as the signature of p. We study the segmentation of an object space into signature cells and prove near optimal bounds on the number of distinct signatures induced by a point source, as a function of sensor and reference structure complexity. We also show that almost any family of signatures can be implemented under this model.", "paper_title": "Segmenting Object Space by Geometric Reference Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000205013100001"}
