Our main focus is on query modification: a query transformation approach which works by revising the preference relation in the query. We provide a detailed analysis of the cases where the order-theoretic properties of the preference relation are preserved by the revision. We consider a number of different revision operators: union, prioritized and Pareto composition. We also formulate algebraic laws that enable incremental evaluation of preference queries,", "paper_title": "Iterative modification and incremental evaluation of preference queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000235837300005"}
