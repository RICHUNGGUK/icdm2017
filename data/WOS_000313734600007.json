We provide empirical examples of MET research in the context of a comparative study of two exhibitions at two museums in Germany. The article underlines the potentials of MET in combination with other methods and in comparison with conventional forms of observation and interviewing. On the basis of our case material we provide recommendations for social scientists who consider integrating mobile eye-tracking in their field research.", "paper_title": "Potentials and Limitations of Mobile Eye Tracking in Visitor Studies: Evidence From Field Research at Two Museum Exhibitions in Germany", "paper_id": "WOS:000313734600007"}
