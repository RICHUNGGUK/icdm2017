Two point velocity correlations in these jets revealed the extent and orientation of the large scale structures in the major and minor planes. The spatial filtering of the instantaneous velocity field using Gaussian convolution kernel shows that while a single large vortex ring circumscribing the jet seems to be present at the exit of nozzle, the orifice jet exhibited a number of smaller vortex ring pairs close to jet exit. The smaller length scale observed in the case of the orifice jet is representative of the smaller azimuthal vortex rings that generate axial vortex field as they are convected. This results in the axis-switching in the case of orifice jet and may have a mechanism different from the self induction process as observed in the case of contoured nozzle jet flow.", "paper_title": "PIV studies of large scale structures in the near field of small aspect ratio elliptic jets", "paper_id": "WOS:000234554800010"}
