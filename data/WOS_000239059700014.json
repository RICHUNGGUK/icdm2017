Such a service might be used in a portal environment to allow interactive services lookup and creation of permanent composed services in the design stage, and for efficiently resolving missing parameters during the runtime of a process. The portal integration relies on augmented service description files based on WSGUI concepts [1], and provides a usable infrastructure for BPEL4People [4] concepts.", "paper_title": "WSInterConnect: Dynamic composition of web services through web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000239059700014"}
