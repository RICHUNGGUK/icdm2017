The procedure uses the mean square normalized error of constrained and unconstrained least-square filters to produce the initial and the subsequent sizes that converge to the smallest feasible one in a few iterations, where the constrained least-square filters are defined as the least-square filters satisfying the magnitude error constraint. The procedure finally returns a smallest size filter that satisfies the magnitude error constraint and has least total squared magnitude error. Design examples of diamond-shaped, rectangular, and elliptic filters are provided, and comparisons with an exhaustive search are given.", "paper_title": "Design of smallest size two-dimensional linear-phase FIR filters with magnitude error constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000250920700009"}
