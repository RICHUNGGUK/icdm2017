Different from previous online direct sales channel, the e-channel is operated by the third party - virtual trading community (referred to hereafter as 'VTC'). And the pricing strategies are analyzed by the game model. In order to explore the role of the VTC, the VTC mode is compared with the traditional online direct sales channel operated independently by the merchants themselves (referred to hereafter as 'TOD'). The result shows that there is a significant difference in the equilibrium prices between the two operation modes and the cost for channel operation has an important influence on. the price. After that, according to the more intense competition characteristic of the VTC, service promoting strategy is introduced and the impacts of service's cost on equilibrium prices and demands are discussed under different service promoting strategies (i.e., promoting service only in physical retail channel or both physical retail channel and VTC channel). It is found that in a given interval of the service coefficient, the service promoting only in physical retail channel effectively alleviates competition threat from manufacturer's VTC channel and benefits the retailer, and the service promoting in, both channels has an indirect benefit for the retailer by increasing the physical retail channel demand. In the end, the results are demonstrated by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A GAME MODEL OF MULTI-CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION BASED ON THE VIRTUAL TRADING COMMUNITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200017"}
