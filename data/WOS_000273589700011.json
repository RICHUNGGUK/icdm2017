This also improves the largest known gap for planar graphs from 3 2 to 2, yielding the first lower bound that does not follow from elementary calculations. Our approach uses the coarse differentiation method of Eskin, Fisher, and Whyte in order to lower bound the distortion for embedding a particular family of shortest-path metrics into L(1).", "paper_title": "Coarse Differentiation and Multi-flows in Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273589700011"}
