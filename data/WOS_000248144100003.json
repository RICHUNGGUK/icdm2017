The discharge gas of the PDP was a 88% Ne-12% Xe gas mixture at a pressure of 400 Torr. For the surface treatment, a single crystalline MgO powder was mixed in methanol, sprayed on the phosphor surface, and annealed at 400 degrees C. This treatment suppressed glow discharge, which was observed very often in the weak discharges for reset of PDP if the phosphor works as a cathode, and provided a favorable condition for the PDP reset operation. When an experimental PDP fabricated using the surface treatment was driven by the twin reset waveform, the measured time delay for 99.9% cumulative probability of address discharge was 830 ns, which meets the timing requirement for addressing a Full HD (1920 x 1080 resolution) PDP with the 10 sub-field single scan method.
