The PPS comprises multiple packet switches operating independently and in parallel. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of parallel center-stage switches with memory buffers running slower than the external line rate. Each lower speed packet switch operates at a fraction of the external line rate R. For example, each packet switch can operate at internal line rate R/K, where K is the number of center-stage switches. This work presents a proposed novel Markov chain model successfully exhibits these performance characteristics for throughput, cell delay and cell drop rate. This novel Markov chain model extends from our previous paper [Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Performance analysis of the sliding-window parallel packet switch, in: IEEE 40th International Conference on Communications 2005, ICC 2005, May 16-20, 2005; Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Evaluation and analysis of the sliding-window parallel packet switch, in: IEEE 19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, vol. 2, 2005, pp. 355-358]. Simulation comparison demonstrates that the chains are accurate for practical network loads. With the proposed model, major finding are that: (1) it is theoretically possible for the throughput and cell drop rates of a PPS to emulate those of a FCFS-OQ packet switch when each lower speed packet switch operates at a rate of approximately R/K, and, (2) this work also demonstrates that it is theoretically possible for the cell delay of a PPS to emulate that of FCFS-OQ packet switch when each lower speed packet switch operates at a rate of approximately (3R/cell delay of FCFS-OQ switch). Additionally, this work develops and investigates a novel PIAO PPS which distributes cells or variable-length packets to center-stage switches and uses multiplexers with push-in arbitrary-out (PIAO) queues.
