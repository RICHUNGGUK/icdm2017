In spite of the several advantages of density-based outlier detections, its computational complexity remains one of the major barriers to its application. The purpose of the present study is to reduce the computation time of LOF (Local Outlier Factor), a density-based outlier detection algorithm. The proposed method incorporates kd-tree indexing and an approximated k-nearest neighbors search algorithm (ANN). Theoretical analysis on the approximation of nearest neighbor search was conducted. A set of experiments was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the method can effectively detect local outliers in a reduced computation time.
