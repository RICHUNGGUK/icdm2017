The analysis of the performance of the display-louvers system takes into account the location, orientation, and daily and seasonal variations. The observation of the system is divided depending on the distance of observation. The far distance vision performance use the background luminance. The medium distance performance needs the use of the Contrast Sensitivity Function of the eye. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
