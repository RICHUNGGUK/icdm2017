The goal in this paper is for the forecaster to output sequential predictions which are, after T time rounds, almost as good as the ones output by the best linear predictor in a given l(1)-ball in R-d. We consider both the cases where the dimension d is small and large relative to the time horizon T. We first present regret bounds with optimal dependencies on d. T, and on the sizes U, X and Y of the l(1)-ball, the input data and the observations. The minimax regret is shown to exhibit a regime transition around the point d = root TUX/(2Y). Furthermore, we present efficient algorithms that are adaptive, i.e., that do not require the knowledge of U, X, Y, and T, but still achieve nearly optimal regret bounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
