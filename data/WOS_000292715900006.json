Design/methodology/approach - The applied methodology is a combination of design of experiments and finite element analysis to minimise the cogging torque of the estimated machine. Different qualities of the permanent magnet material are investigated by a stochastic analysis. Findings - A robust design of the machine is achieved, which is verified by a stochastic analysis. Furthermore, this analysis shows the strong influence of the magnet quality on the cogging torque. Practical implications - This paper provides a method for a machine design which is robust against non-ideal manufacturing and an approach to prove the use of a bad quality for a possible reduction of the fabrication costs. Originality/value - This paper gives a close insight on how to investigate non-ideal manufacturing and in particular its influence on the cogging torque.", "paper_title": "Influence and evaluation of non-ideal manufacturing process on the cogging torque of a permanent magnet excited synchronous machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900006"}
