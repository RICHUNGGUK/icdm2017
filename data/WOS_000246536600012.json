We describe a means to manage responsive environments whereby each component is dynamically assigned a software agent. Software agents are autonomous and reactive/proactive programs that communicate via message-passing. Arbitrary functionalities can be encoded in such agents, reflecting the capabilities of the components they represent, as well as extending them. Ours is a flexible and scalable approach allowing the gradual population of environments with physical devices and their agents.", "paper_title": "Managing responsive environments with software agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000246536600012"}
