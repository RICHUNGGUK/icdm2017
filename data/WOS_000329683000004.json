The proposed scheme also offers a reliable association with parent nodes and dynamically assigns network addresses. For the large scale multi-sensor processing, the proposed system accomplished the intelligent database, which generates alert messages to the handheld terminal by means of the fire and air-based sensor data. Thus farmers can easily check out the current conditions of crops and farms at anytime and anywhere. Moreover, we also developed a robot platform with network based mobility function for mobile surveillance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
