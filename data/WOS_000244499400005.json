Mobile devices and dynamic services affect a dynamically changing environment, which can result in very difficult interaction. In addition, how to provide services efficiently and appropriately. is always an important issue for a smart home. To solve the problems caused by traditional architectures, to deal with the dynamic environment, and to provide appropriate services, we propose a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for smart-home environments, based on Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) and mobile-agent (MA) technology. This architecture is a peer-to-peer (P2P) model based on multiple OSGi platforms, in which service-oriented mechanisms are used for system components to interact with one another, and MA technology is applied to augment the interaction mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented smart-home architecture based on OSGi and mobile-agent technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000244499400005"}
