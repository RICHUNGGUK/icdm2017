Here, particular emphasis is devoted to the construction of an optimal numerical method for the evaluation of certain target functionals of practical interest, such as the lift and drag coefficients of a body immersed in a viscous fluid. With this in mind, the key ingredients in the construction of the method include: (i) an adjoint consistent imposition of the boundary conditions; (ii) an adjoint consistent reformulation of the underlying target functional of practical interest; (iii) design of appropriate interior penalty stabilization terms. Numerical experiments presented within this article clearly indicate the optimality of the proposed method when the error is measured in terms of both the L-2-norm, as well as for certain target functionals.
