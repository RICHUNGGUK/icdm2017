PDCA and methodology of statistical research were applied. Relying on the original research, ICT innovations were analysed in the period between 2000 and 2012, along with all areas of human endeavour. Regression equations were presented by explicit mathematical relations and their applicability in time was analysed. Furthermore, this paper presents unique indices obtained by multicriteria analyses, for a closer determination of ICT innovations and the creation of models of knowledge excellence. The objectives of further development are also given. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
