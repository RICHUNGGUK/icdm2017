Applications of bonsai trees include an efficient, stateless 'hash-and-sign' signature scheme in the standard model (i.e., no random oracles), and the first hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme (also in the standard model) that does not rely on bilinear pairings. Interestingly, the abstract properties of bonsai trees seem to have no known realization in conventional number-theoretic cryptography.", "paper_title": "Bonsai Trees, or How to Delegate a Lattice Basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308958000002"}
