Typically probabilistic models such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are known as commonly employed for such purpose. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this work, the authors propose a robust strategy combining the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with Cost Sensitive Support Vector Machines (CS-SVM) with an adaptive tuning of cost parameter in order to handle imbalanced data problem. Findings - The results have demonstrated the usefulness of the approach through comparison with state of art of approaches including HMM, CRF, the traditional C-Support vector machines (C-SVM) and the Cost-Sensitive-SVM (CS-SVM) for classifying the activities using binary and ubiquitous sensors. Originality/value - Performance metrics in the experiment/simulation include Accuracy, Precision/Recall and F measure.", "paper_title": "A new classification strategy for human activity recognition using cost sensitive support vector machines for imbalanced data", "paper_id": "WOS:000343399700004"}
