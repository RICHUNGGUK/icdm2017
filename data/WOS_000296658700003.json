However, there is a trade-off between the approximation performance of RBF network and the number of hidden neurons. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic REF (DRBF) network with a constructive learning. This DRBF network not only can create the new hidden neurons, but also can prune the insignificant hidden neurons. Then, an adaptive dynamic RBF fuzzy neural control (ADRFNC) system, including a neural controller and a saturation compensator, is developed. The neural controller uses a DRBF network to on-line mimic an ideal controller and the saturation compensator is designed to dispel the approximation error introduced by the neural controller. Finally, the proposed ADRFNC system is applied to a chaotic circuit and a DC motor control system. Simulation and experimental results show the proposed ADRFNC system can achieve a favorable tracking performance when the controller's parameters have been learned and the network structure has been constructed by the proposed learning algorithm.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Dynamic RBF Fuzzy Neural Controller Design with a Constructive Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000296658700003"}
