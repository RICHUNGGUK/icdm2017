However, in reality most parts that need to be machined require more than one operation. In addition, machining technology has been developed to the point that a single computer numerical control (CNC) machine is capable of performing multiple operations, even simultaneously, employing multiple spindles and cutting tools. When several operations are performed on a CNC turning machine, various tools are required for the cutting operations. Determining the life of these cutting tools under different machining conditions is an arduous task for the operators. They usually replace the tools based on their experience or according to the specific cutting tool handbook. Frequent tool replacements may result in wasted tools and tool utilization, while infrequent tool replacements may result in poorly machined parts. In this study we propose a mathematical model in which several different turning operations (turning, drilling, and parting) with proper constraints are performed. The issue of tool replacement is taken into account in the proposed cutting model. In addition, an evolutionary strategy (ES)-based optimization approach is developed to optimize the cutting conditions of the multiple turning-related operations while taking into account the minimizing unit cost criteria under the economical tool replacement strategy.
