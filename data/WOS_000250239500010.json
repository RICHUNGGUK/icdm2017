The inherent characteristics of sensor networks do not permit simply applying traditional time synchronization algorithms. Therefore, many new time synchronization algorithms have been proposed, and a few of them provide security measures against various degrees of attacks. In this article we review the most commonly used time synchronization algorithms and evaluate these algorithms based on factors such as their countermeasures against various attacks and the types of techniques used.", "paper_title": "Secure time synchronization protocols for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250239500010"}
