A significant demand for embedded high-performance WiMAX solutions is forcing designers to seek single-chip multicore systems that offer competitive advantages in terms of all performance metrics, such as speed, power, and area. Through the provision of a degree of flexibility similar to that of a DSP and performance and power consumption advantages approaching that of an application-specific integrated circuit, emerging dynamically reconfigurable (DR) processors are proving to be strong candidates for processing cores in future high-performance multicore-processor systems. This paper presents several new single-chip multicore architectures for the WiMAX application based on recently emerging coarse-grained DR processor cores. A simulation platform is proposed in order to explore and implement various multicore solutions combining different memory architectures and task-partitioning schemes. This paper describes the different architectures, the simulation environment, and several task-partitioning methods and demonstrates that up to 7.3 and 12 times speedup can be achieved by employing eight and ten DR processor cores for both the WiMAX transmitter and receiver sections, respectively. A comparison with other WiMAX multicore solutions is given in order to demonstrate that our best solution delivers a high throughput at relatively low area cost.", "paper_title": "Multicore Architectures With Dynamically Reconfigurable Array Processors for Wireless Broadband Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000271952300005"}
