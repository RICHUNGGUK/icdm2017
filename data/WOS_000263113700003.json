Analytical expressions are derived for the frequency pulling, critical transimpedance, maximum negative resistance, and start-up time constant of the Transresistance oscillator circuit which are useful for the design of micromechanical oscillators. These results are then used to study the frequency stability of Transresistance oscillator circuit and compare its operating conditions with that of the Pierce oscillator circuit which is widely used in micromechanical oscillators. The results conclusively show that the Transresistance oscillator has less start-up problems and better frequency stability than the Pierce oscillator. These results are then verified with a well-established circuit theory that compares the phase-frequency plots of the Pierce and Transresistance oscillator.", "paper_title": "Micromechanical oscillator circuits: theory and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000263113700003"}
