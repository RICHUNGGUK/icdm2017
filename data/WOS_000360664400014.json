Lab-on-Phone includes a generic sensing module which shares data with a Smartphone via near field communication. The sensor measurements are processed and displayed by an Android application running in the same Smartphone, a web server stores the measured information sent by multiple Smartphones, considering privacy and security. Lab-on-Phone also uses a set of web applications which allow accessing data from many different places and in any platform with Internet access.", "paper_title": "Lab-on-Phone: a participatory sensing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400014"}
