It is based on the Cayley graph of F-2(n) together with a set of generators regarded as the columns of the parity-check matrix of a classical code. We give a general lower bound on the minimum distance of the Quantum code in O(dn(2)) where d is the minimum distance of the classical code. This bound is logarithmic in the blocklength 2(n) of the quantum code. When the classical code is the [n, 1, n] repetition code, we are able to compute the exact parameters of the associated Quantum code which are [[2(n), 2((n+1)/2)), 2((n-1)/2)]].", "paper_title": "A Construction of Quantum LDPC Codes From Cayley Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800060"}
