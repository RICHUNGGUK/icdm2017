In this paper, we present a novel visual object tracking algorithm based on the observation dependent hidden Markov model (OD-HMM) framework. The observation dependency is computed by structure complexity coefficients (SCC) which is defined to predict the target appearance change. Unlike conventional methods addressing the appearance change problem by investigating different online appearance models, we handle this problem by addressing the fundamental reason of motion-related appearance change during visual tracking. Based on the analysis of motion-related appearance change, we investigate the relationship between the structure of the object surface and the appearance stability. The appearance of complex structural regions is easier to change compared with that of smooth structural regions with object moving. Based on this, we define SCC to predict the appearance stability of moving objects. Different from the standard HMM-based tracking algorithms where observations between different frames are assumed to be independent, we consider the observation dependency between consecutive frames with the information provided by SCC. Moreover, we present a novel outlier removing method in appearance model updating which helps to avoid error accumulation. Experimental results on challenging video sequences demonstrate that the proposed visual tracking algorithm with OD-HMM and SCC achieves better performance than existing related tracking algorithms.", "paper_title": "Visual Object Tracking by Structure Complexity Coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000001"}
