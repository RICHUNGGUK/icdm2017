We consider a wide class of cost functions, namely f(l) = l(alpha) for all alpha >= 0, where l is the length of the reversed subsequence. We present tight or nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case cost of sorting by reversals. Then we develop algorithms to approximate the optimal cost to sort a given input. Furthermore, we give polynomial-time algorithms to determine the optimal reversal sequence for a restricted but interesting class of sequences and cost functions. Our results have direct application in computational biology to the field of comparative genomics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
