The aim of this paper was to develop a DSS for optimize route planning in terms of minimized risk for soil compaction for agricultural vehicles carrying time-depended loads. The developed system uses as input field and operational characteristics, including a potential risk indicator map based on specific measure of distributed soil physical-chemical properties. It provides the optimal field-work tracks traversal sequence which can be executed using state-of-the-art auto-steering and navigation-aiding systems available on modern agricultural vehicles. The system has been demonstrated and tested for heavy application units used for organic fertilizer. The risk factor was reduced up to 61% by using the corresponding optimal plans instead of the non-optimal conventional ones that an operator would follow. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
