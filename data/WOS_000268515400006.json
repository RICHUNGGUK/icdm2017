In particular, we identify XPath fragments which are ideally coupled with the newly introduced P(k)-partition which has its definition grounded in the well-known A(k) structural index and its associated partition. We then utilize these couplings to investigate fundamental questions about the use of structural indexes in XPath query evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
