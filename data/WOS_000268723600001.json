More specific we have tested different types of metal plates near a loop antenna in terms of resonance frequency. The performance of an RFID system strongly depends on the configuration of the antenna. The study shows that the resonance frequency will shift up in a metallic environment, resulting in a failing performance. A solution is presented to avoid the influence of a changing environment around a loop antenna. As an example a loop antenna is designed to prove the increase of stability.", "paper_title": "Influence of Different Types of Metal Plates on a High Frequency RFID Loop Antenna: Study and Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000268723600001"}
