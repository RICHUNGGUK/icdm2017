When an NCS operates over the communication network, one of the major challenges is the network-induced delay in data transfer among the controllers, actuators, and sensors. This delay degrades system performance and causes system unstablility. This paper proposes a GPC (generalized predictive control) with the Kalman state estimator to compensate for the network-induced delay and packet loss. The GPC is implemented in WiNCS (Wireless NCS) based on IEEE 802.11 standard. An analytical NCS model and NS2 (network simulator version 2) are developed to simulate and evaluate the performance under the effect of various delays and packet loss rates. The result shows that the proposed GPC is adaptive and robust to the uncertainties in a time-delay system. The WiNCS is evaluated with latency and throughput measurements in various environments. The experiment setup conforming to the IEEE 802.11 standard achieves an average latency of 1.3ms and a data throughput of 3.000 kB/s up to a distance of 70 m. The results demonstrate the feasibility of real-time closed-loop control with the proposed concept.", "paper_title": "Generalized Predictive Control in a Wireless Networked Control System", "paper_id": "WOS:000329712000001"}
