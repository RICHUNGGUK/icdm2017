The key essence of these emerging, LTE cellular systems lie in deployment of multiple femtocells for improved coverage and higher data rates. However, the arbitrary deployment of a wide number of femtocells makes the configuration, management and planning of LTE systems quite complex and challenging. In order to support dynamic and efficient network configuration, every cell needs to be assigned a particular Physical Cell ID (PCID). In this paper we show that the dynamic, optimal PCID allocation problem in LTE systems is NP-complete. Subsequently we provide a near-optimal solution using Self-Organizing Networks which models the problem using new merge operations and explores the search space using a suitable randomized algorithmic approach. We also discuss two feasible options for dynamic auto-configuration of the system and analyze the algorithm to prove its convergence. Simulation results point out that our proposed near-optimal solution dynamically achieves similar to 85-90 % of global optimal auto-configuration in computationally feasible time.", "paper_title": "Auto-configuration of Physical Cell ID in LTE femtocellular systems using Self Organizing Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339379900021"}
