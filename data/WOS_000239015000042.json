Karyotype is often used for predicting genetic disorders or possible abnormalities that may occur in the future generations. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the error rate. The fusion of machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best results previously published in the literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
