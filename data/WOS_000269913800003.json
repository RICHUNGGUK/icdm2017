The proposed algorithm utilizes gradient based features which are extracted along the object boundaries. We use two-dimensional steerable G-Filters (IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 19(6):545-563, 1997) to obtain gradient information at different orientations and scales, and then aggregate the gradients into a shape signature. The signature derived from the rotated object is circularly shifted version of the signature derived from the original object. This property is called the circular-shifting rule (Affine-invariant gradient based shape descriptor. Lecture notes in computer science. International workshop on multimedia contents Representation, Classification and Security, pp 514-521, 2006). The shape descriptor is defined as the Fourier transform of the signature. We also provide a distance measure for the proposed descriptor by taking the circular-shifting rule into account. The performance of the proposed descriptor is evaluated over two databases; one containing digits taken from vehicle license plates and the other containing MPEG-7 Core Experiment and Kimia shape data set. The experiments show that the devised method outperforms other well-known Fourier-based shape descriptors such as centroid distance and boundary curvature.", "paper_title": "Gradient-based shape descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000269913800003"}
