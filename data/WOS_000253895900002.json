We solve the problem of estimating the number of perfect matchings with exactly k Red edges for dense graphs. We study a Markov chain on the space of all matchings of a graph that favors matchings with k Red edges. We show that it is rapidly mixing using non-traditional canonical paths that can backtrack. We show that this chain can be used to sample matchings in the 2-dimensional toroidal lattice of any fixed size l with k Red edges, where the horizontal edges are Red and the vertical edges are Blue.", "paper_title": "Random bichromatic matchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000253895900002"}
