As a result, to share an n-bit secret key in an (m + 1)-party SQSS, the number of quanta required to transmit is n x 2(m), which increases exponentially with the number of agents (i.e. m). This study proposes a new idea on the construction of the secret key for the existing SQSS such that only 2nm qubits are required to produce an n-bit secret key in the (m + 1)-party SQSS.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT KEY CONSTRUCTION ON SEMI-QUANTUM SECRET SHARING PROTOCOLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313300008"}
