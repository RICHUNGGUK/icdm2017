In an earlier paper, we proposed a multiphase segmentation process to identify elongated features in point-sampled surface models without the explicit construction of a mesh or other surface representation. The preliminary results demonstrated the strength and potential of the segmentation process, but the resulting segmentations were still of low quality, and the segmentation process could be slow. In this paper, we describe several algorithmic improvements to overcome the shortcomings of the segmentation process. To demonstrate the improved quality of the segmentation and the superior time efficiency of the new segmentation process, we present segmentation results obtained for various point-sampled surface models. We also discuss an application of our segmentation process to extract ridge-separated features in point-sampled surfaces of CAD models.", "paper_title": "Segmenting point-sampled surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000284112400001"}
