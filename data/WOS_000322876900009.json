As the number of design points or factors becomes large, the total number of LHDs grows exponentially. The large number of feasible designs makes the search for optimal LHDs a difficult discrete optimization problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a new population-based algorithm named LaPSO that is adapted from the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and customized for LHD. Moreover, we accelerate LaPSO via a graphic processing unit (GPU). According to extensive comparisons, the proposed LaPSO is more stable than existing approaches and is capable of improving known results.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Latin hypercube designs by particle swarm", "paper_id": "WOS:000322876900009"}
