As input, we require a set of example poses that are representative of the types of deformations the character undergoes and we produce a multi-resolution hierarchy for the simplified character where all simplified vertices also have associated skin weights. We create this hierarchy by minimizing an error metric for a simplified set of vertices and their skin weights, and we show that this quartic error metric can be effectively minimized using alternating quadratic minimization for the vertices and weights separately. To enable efficient GPU accelerated deformations of the simplified character, we also provide a method that guarantees the maximum number of bone weights per simplified vertex is less than a user specified threshold at all levels of the hierarchy.", "paper_title": "Simplification of Articulated Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700020"}
