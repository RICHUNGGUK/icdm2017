This paper aims to address the multi-objective next release problem using search based methods such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for empirical studies. In order to achieve the above goal, a requirement-dependency-based multi-objective next release model (MONRP/RD) is formulated firstly. The two objectives we are interested in are customers' satisfaction and requirement cost. A popular multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEA). NSGA-II, is applied to provide the feasible solutions that balance between the two objectives aimed. The scalability of the formulated MONRP/RD and the influence of the requirement dependencies are investigated through simulations as well. This paper proposes an improved version of the multi-objective invasive weed optimization and compares it with various state-of-the-art multi-objective approaches on both synthetic and real-world data sets to find the most suitable algorithm for the problem.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE NEXT RELEASE PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000309328000008"}
