Exploiting the properties common to the continuous Archimedean t-norm and the arithmetic mean, this study proposes a generalization of them as the \"u-norm\", enabling FREs that are based on the max-continuous u-norm composition also to be transformed into the covering problem. This study also proposes a procedure for transforming the covering problem into max-product FREs. Consequently, max-continuous u-norm FREs can be solved by extending any procedure for solving either the covering problem or max-product FREs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
