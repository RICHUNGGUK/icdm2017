In this article, we propose the use of pi functions which are spline functions of degree two, as membership functions of the input variables. At first, we show by a constructive theory that multi-input-single-output (MISO) Sugeno Fuzzy Logic Systems with pi input variables membership functions are universal approximators to every continuously differentiable function defined on a compact subset of R-n. Moreover they are of first order approximation accuracy. Then, we show that with appropriately chosen parameters of the pi functions, fuzzy logic systems with pi input variables membership functions are universal approximators not only for the function itself but also for its first order derivative.
