However, the existing methods have the drawbacks that they cannot guarantee the convexity of the fuzzy interpolated result and may generate the same fuzzy interpolated results with respect to different observations. Moreover, they also cannot deal with fuzzy rule interpolation with bell-shaped interval type-2 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we present a new method for fuzzy rule interpolation for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems based on the ratio of fuzziness of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods. First, it calculates the weights of the closest fuzzy rules with respect to the observation to obtain an intermediate consequence fuzzy set. Then, it uses the ratio of fuzziness of interval type-2 fuzzy sets to infer the fuzzy interpolated result based on the intermediate consequence fuzzy set. We also use some examples to compare the fuzzy interpolated results of the proposed method with the results by the existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy rule interpolation method gets more reasonable results than the existing methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
