We propose a technique for patient-specific 3D prostate model reconstruction from a sparse collection of non-parallel 2D TRUS biopsy images. Our method conforms to the restrictions of current TRUS biopsy equipment and could be efficiently incorporated into current clinical biopsy procedures for needle guidance without the need for expensive hardware additions. In this paper, the model reconstruction technique is evaluated using simulated biopsy images from 3D TRUS prostate images of 10 biopsy patients. All reconstructed models are compared to their corresponding 3D manually segmented prostate models for evaluation of prostate volume accuracy and surface errors (both regional and global). The number of 2D TRUS biopsy images used for prostate modeling was varied to determine the optimal number of images necessary for accurate prostate surface estimation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
