There is a pressing need for effective content-based 3D model retrieval methods. In this paper, a novel 3D model retrieval approach is proposed by using the Fuzzy Weighted Symmetrical Depth Images (FW-SDI). Firstly, three symmetrical planes of the 3D model are obtained based upon principal plane analysis and sequential quadratic programming, which are the distinctive characteristics of 3D model and perpendicular to each other. Secondly, three novel depth Images (NDI) and three depth differential images (DDI) are extracted by projecting the 3D surface to the proposed symmetrical planes. The Fourier descriptors of the novel depth Images and depth differential images are calculated. Finally, a fuzzy weighted procedure is conducted for combining the Fourier descriptors of NDI and DDI. Experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve better retrieval performance than others. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
