It is hard to imagine that there could be any relationship between two so remote attacks which have nothing in common. However, there is one: Very surprisingly, both properties can be combined and lead the fastest attack on GOST ever found, which is nearly feasible to execute in practice.", "paper_title": "On Multiple Symmetric Fixed Points in GOST", "paper_id": "WOS:000364959700003"}
