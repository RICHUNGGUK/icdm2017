Spike-based protocols are used to communicate activity between processors. The spike activity in the arrays depends on the input statistics as well as internal parameters such as time constants and gains. In this paper, we investigate strategies for automatically adapting these parameters to maintain a constant firing rate in response to changes in the input statistics. We find that under the constraint of maintaining a fixed firing rate, a strategy based upon updating the gain alone performs as well as an optimal strategy where both the gain and the time constant are allowed to vary. We discuss how to choose the time constant and propose an adaptive gain control mechanism whose operation is robust to changes in the input statistics. Our experimental results on a mobile robotic platform validate the analysis and efficacy of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Adaptive gain control for spike-based map communication in a neuromorphic vision system", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670500008"}
