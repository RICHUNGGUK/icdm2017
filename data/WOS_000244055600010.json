In this paper, we introduce a modified susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model to study geographical effects on the spread of diseases by assuming that the probability of a healthy individual infected by an infectious one is inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. It is found that geography plays a more important role than hubs in disease spreading: the more geographically constrained the network is, the more highly the epidemic prevails.", "paper_title": "Geographical effects on epidemic spreading in scale-free networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055600010"}
