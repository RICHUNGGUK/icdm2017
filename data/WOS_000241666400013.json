Two synthesis objectives are considered: the maximization of the domain of attraction of the closed-loop system under some time-domain performance constraints; and the guarantee that the trajectories of the system are bounded in the presence of L-2-bounded disturbances, while ensuring an overbound for the L-2 gain from the disturbance to the regulated output. The nonlinear effects introduced by the saturations in the closed-loop system are taken into account by using a generalized sector condition, which allows to propose theoretical conditions to solve the synthesis problems directly in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). From these conditions, convex optimization problems are proposed in order to compute the controller aiming at the maximization of the basin attraction of the closed-loop system, as well as aiming at ensuring a level of L-2 disturbance tolerance and rejection. Numerical examples are provided, to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Output feedback for discrete-time systems with amplitude and rate constrained actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000241666400013"}
