In one of these variants, a careful reorganization and accumulation of Givens rotations enables the use of efficient level 3 BLAS. Experimental results on four different architectures, representative of current high performance processors, compare the performances of the new variants with those of the implementation of Moler and Stewart's algorithm in subroutine DGGHRD from LAPACK, Dackland and Kagstrom's two-stage algorithm for the HT form, and a modified version of the latter which requires considerably less flops.", "paper_title": "BLOCKED ALGORITHMS FOR THE REDUCTION TO HESSENBERG-TRIANGULAR FORM REVISITED", "paper_id": "WOS:000259935400009"}
