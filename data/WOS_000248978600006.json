We demonstrate that the graph of a Khalimsky-continuous mapping X -> Z is a surface, which separates X x Z. We study infima and suprema of families of such continuous mappings, a study that naturally leads to the introduction of an extended Khalimsky line. Moreover, we show that the adjacency boundary of a connected subset, U, of the Khalimsky plane is connected precisely when the complement of U is connected.", "paper_title": "Digital surfaces and boundaries in Khalimsky spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000248978600006"}
