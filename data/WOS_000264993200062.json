The behavior of human participants was roughly classified into two qualitatively different types. On the other hand, surprisingly, the variety of human behavior could be explained simply by a single parameter of the degree of randomness (i.e., the temperature parameter) in the action-selection rules of the RL agents. This result implies that the various behaviors of human action-selection may be determined by a simple mechanism in the brain. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
