However, it is not valid in realistic sensor networks, which leads to high retransmissions of data frames. In order to address this problem, a reliable spatial window aggregation query processing algorithm called RESA is proposed in this paper. RESA only requires each node to maintain locations and residual energy of its neighbors and link qualities between them. According to the information, it divides the query area into several sub-regions, followed by collection of sensor readings in each sub-region. RESA traverses all the sub-regions within the query area to ensure the correctness of query result. Based on RESA's energy consumption formula derived, two highly efficient methods for sub-regional division are proposed to reduce packet loss rate during data communication and balance the load of nodes, hence saving energy consumption and extending lifetime. Experimental results show that in most cases RESA outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of energy consumption, quality of query results and lifetime. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
