The developed framework facilitates the required type of data fusion at any given point in the construction progress, reliably and efficiently. Data are acquired from high-frequency automated technologies such as three-dimensional (3D) imaging and ultrawideband (UWB) positioning, in addition to foreman reports, schedule information, and other information sources. The results of validation through a detailed field implementation project show that the developed framework for fusing volumetric, positioning, and project control data can successfully address the challenges associated with fusing multisensory data by tracking activities rather than objects, a feature that offers superior capability, efficiency, and accuracy over the length of the project. Other contributions of this research include the development of fusion processes that are performed at higher levels of data fusion instead of traditional low-level fusion algorithms, thus supporting decision-making processes and a number of automated construction management applications, such as construction progress tracking, earned-value estimation, and schedule updating.
