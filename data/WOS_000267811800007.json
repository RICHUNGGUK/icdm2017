To achieve entropy consistency, a second and third-order differential terms are added to the entropy-conservative flux. This new flux function is tested on several one dimensional problems and compared with the original Roe flux. The new flux function exactly preserves the stationary contact discontinuity and does not capture the unphysical rarefaction shock. For steady shock problems, the new flux predicts a slightly more diffused profile whereas for unsteady cases. the captured shock is very similar to those produced by the Roe- flux. The shock stability is also studied in one dimension. Unlike the original Roe flux, the new flux is completely stable which will provide as a candidate to combat multidimensional shock instability, particularly the carbuncle phenomenon.
