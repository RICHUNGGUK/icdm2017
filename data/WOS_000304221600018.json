We prove that the considered problem is at least NP-hard. Moreover, a pseudopolynomial time dynamic programming algorithm that optimally solves the problem with a step learning function (curve) is constructed. Furthermore, fast approximation algorithms for the general version of the problem, where job processing times are described by arbitrary functions dependent on the sum of the normal job processing times, are provided. Their efficiency is verified numerically and for Weighted Shortest Processing Times algorithm a worst case analysis is also performed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
