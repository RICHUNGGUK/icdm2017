We give strong evidence that stopping time analysis is no more powerful than standard path coupling. In particular, we prove a stronger theorem for path coupling with stopping times, using a metric which allows us to analyse a one-step path coupling. This approach provides insight for the design of better metrics for specific problems. We give illustrative applications to hypergraph independent sets and SAT instances, hypergraph colourings and colourings of bipartite graphs, obtaining improved results for all these problems.", "paper_title": "Stopping times, metrics and approximate counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500011"}
