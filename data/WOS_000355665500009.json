We first consider the case that A is fixed. In this case, we obtain the following dichotomy: If A/rad A is noncommutative, then computing the determinant over Ais hard. \"Hard\" here means #P-hard over fields of characteristic 0 and Mod(p)P-hard over fields of characteristic p > 0. If A/rad A is commutative and the underlying field is perfect, then we can compute the determinant over A in polynomial time. We also consider the case when A is part of the input. Here the hardness is closely related to the nilpotency index of the commutator ideal of A.
