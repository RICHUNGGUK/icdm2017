An upper bound on M-1(T) and a lower bound on 2M(2)(T) + 1/2M(1)(T) of trees is obtained, in terms of the number of vertices (n) and maximum degree (Delta). Moreover, we compare the Zagreb indices and the Zagreb coindices of trees.", "paper_title": "Comparing Zagreb Indices and Coindices of Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000307149200012"}
