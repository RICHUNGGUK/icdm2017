Our algorithm guarantees that each group to be connected and maintains the coverage ratio with high possibility. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that it has better performance than previous randomized scheduling scheme, and can prolong the lifetime of the sensor network effectively.", "paper_title": "Cluster based node scheduling method for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200003"}
