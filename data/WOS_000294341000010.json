The software is divided into three sections: (1) multimedia files, pictures, and videos, produced in order to teach the working of the mechanism, (2) theoretical information related to mechanical clutches, and (3) interactive problems that allow to design a mechanical clutch and test changes in operational conditions when varying the value of critical design parameters. This software has become a very useful tool for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students in compliment to theoretical classes or alone, as a self-study tool. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
