It uses the tangent space in the neighborhood of a data point to represent the local geometry, and then aligns those local tangent spaces in the low-dimensional space which is linearly mapped from the raw high-dimensional space. Since images of faces often belong to a manifold of intrinsically low dimension, we develop LLTSA algorithm for effective face manifold learning and recognition. Comprehensive comparisons and extensive experiments show that LLTSA achieves much higher recognition rates than a few competing methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
