The orthogonal function neural network is Legendred orthogonal neural network. First of all, the orthogonal function neural network is trained to learn the uncertain information. The parameters of Legendred orthogonal neural network are adjusted to accomplish the synchronization of two chaotic systems with the perturbation by Lyapunov steady theorem. At last, the result of numerical example is shown to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of chaotic system with the perturbation via orthogonal function neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000050"}
