The order gamma(k)(c) (G) of such a smallest set we relate to gamma(c)(G), the order of a smallest connected dominating set. For a tree T we give bounds on gamma(k)(c) (T) in terms of minimum valency and diameter. For trees the inequality gamma(k)(c) (T) <= n - k - 1 is known to hold, we determine the class of trees, for which equality holds.", "paper_title": "Generalized connected domination in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235901300002"}
