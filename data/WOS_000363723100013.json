Proactively provisioning cloud workload is essential in order to keep the cloud utilization and service-level agreement at an acceptable level. Problems such as new virtual machine start-up latency, energy minimization and efficient resource provisioning, requires to predict resource demands for a few minutes ahead. Since the Cloud workloads have a very dynamic nature, CPU/memory usage varies considerably in the cloud. Also, existing prediction methods have considerable prediction error and erroneous results. So we propose a novel tuned support vector regression (TSVR) scheme that carefully selects three SVR parameters by a hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method. A chaotic sequence is devised into the algorithm to improve prediction accuracy and simultaneously avoid premature converging. To demonstrate the prediction accuracy of our TSVR model, we conduct a simulation study using Google cloud traces. The simulation results show that the proposed TSVR model achieves better prediction performance than conventional models in terms of standard metrics.", "paper_title": "A hybrid heuristic-based tuned support vector regression model for cloud load prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000363723100013"}
