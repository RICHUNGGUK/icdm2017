For this reason, updating or adding programs in sensor nodes must be performed via a communication channel at run-time. Many code update protocols have been developed for sensor networks, ranging from function-level update to full-image replacement. However, they provide only a fixed level of code update protocols. These protocols require manual selection of an appropriate protocol because they do not consider a cost analysis of the update protocols. In addition, they do not consider real-time response while updating codes. In this paper, we present an adaptive multilevel code update protocol (AMCUP) for real-time sensor operating systems. AMCUP enables energy-efficient code update via support for multilevel protocols (i.e., full-image, module-level, function-level, and instruction-level). It adaptively selects a protocol which meets deadline of applications and consumes less energy based on a cost analysis of several protocols. Our simulation and experimental results show that AMCUP can reduce energy consumption and execution time compared with existing single-level code update protocols while meeting deadline of the running applications.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Multilevel Code Update Protocol for Real-Time Sensor Operating Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262989100006"}
