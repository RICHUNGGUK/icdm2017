Our Study is based on a practical Simulation model that lets us quantify the maximum number of voice calls that can be handed over from UNITS to WLAN, Subject to maintaining the same level of UMTS QoS and respecting some WLAN policies. In addition, several other voice call performance metrics are derived. Our results indicate that an IEEE 802.11e access point can Support it limited number of voice calls handed over from UNITS, which depends primarily on the applied WLAN bandwidth sharing policy (i.e., how the bandwidth is shared between WLAN voice and data users) and the QoS requirements. The performance of the WLAN scheduling algorithm is also of paramount importance and in our Study we consider the so-called ARROW scheduler. Although the simulation results are derived for a specific bandwidth sharing policy, they call readily be scaled and provide practical Upper bounds for the number of UMTS voice calls that call be seamlessly admitted to a WLAN access point.
