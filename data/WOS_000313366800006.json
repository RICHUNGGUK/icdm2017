The method presented here is a generalized clustering-based method where the patterns can live on a hyper-plane of very low dimensionality in each cluster. The provided generalizationallows a remarkable increase in variability of the model and a significant reduction in the number of necessary clusters for pattern modeling which leads to more computational efficiency compared with clustering-based methods. The Bayesian model employed here is a nonlinear model which is composed of a mixture of linear models. Therefore, the model is stronger than linear models for data modeling and computationally more effective than nonlinear models. Furthermore, the model allows us to extract features from incomplete patterns and to compare patterns in feature space instead of spatial domain. Due to the lower dimensionality of feature space, comparison in feature space results in more computational efficiency as well. Despite most of the previously employed methods, the feature extraction filters employed here are customized for each training image (TI). This causes the features to be more informative and useful. Using a fully Bayesian model, the method does not require extensive parameter setting and tunes its parameters itself in a principled manner. Extensive experiments on different TIs (either continuous or categorical) show that the proposed method is capable of better reproduction of complex geostatistical patterns compared with other clustering-based methods using a very limited number of clusters.", "paper_title": "Stochastic simulation of patterns using Bayesian pattern modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000313366800006"}
