The flow equations are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations including Coriolis forces and density variation through the Boussinesq approximation. The turbulence effects are incorporated in the system by considering the Smagorinsky model. As a numerical solver we propose a finite element semi-Lagrangian method. The solution procedure consists of combining a non-oscillatory semi-Lagrangian scheme for time discretization with the finite element method for space discretization. Numerical results illustrate a buoyancy-driven circulations along the Strait of Gibraltar and the sea-surface temperature is flushed out and move to northeast coast. The Ocean discharge and the temperature difference are shown to control the plume structure. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V..
