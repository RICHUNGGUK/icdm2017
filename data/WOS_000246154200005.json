In our macroeconomic model the growth rate of the labour force is not known, but its lower and upper bounds are given a priori. This means that the system is uncertain, which makes the determination of an optimal solution (in a Nash, Stackelberg, etc. sense) impossible. Therefore, only a guaranteeing cost control is determined for Player 1. It is shown that the balancing by a guaranteeing cost control is possible even in the most unfavourable situation, when the governmental debt is higher and the volume of fixed capital stock is lower than the equilibrium value.", "paper_title": "Budget balancing in a two-dimensional macroeconomic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000246154200005"}
