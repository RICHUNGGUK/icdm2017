The model gives us an appropriate methodology to deal with the systematic components of device variation in an LSI chip. The key idea of the model is the fitting of a polynomial to an array of Gaussian random numbers. The curved surface is expressed by a new extension from the Legendre polynomials to form two-dimensional formulas. The formulas were proven to be suitable to express the spatial correlation with reasonable computational complexity. In this paper, we show that this approach is useful in analyzing characteristics of device variation of actual chips by using experimental data.", "paper_title": "A novel expression of spatial correlation by a random curved surface model and its application to LSI design", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700019"}
