In this study, a restricted simulated annealing (RSA) algorithm which incorporates a restricted search strategy is presented to minimize the makespan. The proposed RSA algorithm can effective reduce the search effort required to find the best neighborhood solution by eliminating ineffective job moves. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RSA algorithm is compared with the basic simulated annealing and existing meta-heuristics on a benchmark problem dataset used in earlier studies. Computational results indicate that the proposed RSA algorithm compares well with the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic for small-sized problems, and significantly outperforms basic simulated annealing algorithm and existing algorithms for large-sized problems.", "paper_title": "Makespan minimization for scheduling unrelated parallel machines with setup times", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200025"}
