The same accuracies and optimized structural geometries were obtained whether optimization of the [ML2(NO3)](2+) complexes was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/RECP or the MP2/6-31G(d)/RECP level of theory. Calculations carried out at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/RECP level of theory indicated that solvation does not favor the formation of these complexes. Moreover, the Delta G(g) and Delta G(solv) values for the reactions leading to the formation of [LnL(2)(NO3)](2+) complexes were seen to decrease with increasing atomic number of the lanthanide (from Eu to Tb to Tm). In addition, when a strongly hydrophobic benzo[e][1,2,4] triazine group was created in each ligand, ligand selectivity for actinides/lanthanides in acidic media improved. Even greater ligand selectivity for actinides/lanthanides in acidic media was obtained when a 5, 6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine group was created in each ligand instead of a benzo[e][1,2,4] triazine group. Vibrational analysis and NMR spectroscopic analysis were also performed on all of the studied ligands and the metal complexes that included them. Further in-depth investigations should be undertaken in this field.", "paper_title": "Complexation behavior of Eu(III), Tb(III), Tm(III), and Am(III) with three 1,10-phenanthroline-type ligands: insights from density functional theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458400013"}
