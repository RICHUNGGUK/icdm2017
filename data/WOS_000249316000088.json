In practice, this scheme is commonly used for official surveys, in which quantile estimation is often required when the investigation deals with variables such as income or expenditure. A class of estimators for quantiles is proposed and some important properties, such as asymptotic unbiasedness and asymptotic variance, are established. The optimal estimator, in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic variance, is also presented. The proposed class contains several known types of estimators, such as ratio and regression estimators, which are of practical application and are therefore derived. Assuming several populations, the proposed estimators are compared with the direct estimator via an empirical study. Results show that a gain in efficiency can be obtained. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
