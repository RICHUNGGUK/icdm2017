A truncated-Newton method is also introduced, and several preconditioning strategies are proposed. Numerical experiments illustrating these enhancements are provided on a wide class of test problems. In particular, the truncated-Newton variant is able to achieve high accuracy in modest amounts of time on maximum-cut-type SDPs.", "paper_title": "Computational enhancements in low-rank semidefinite programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000234634200010"}
