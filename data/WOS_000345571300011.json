Accuracy in SER heavily depends on finding good affect-related, discriminative features. In this paper, we propose to learn affect-salient features for SER using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The training of CNN involves two stages. In the first stage, unlabeled samples are used to learn local invariant features (LIF) using a variant of sparse auto-encoder (SAE) with reconstruction penalization. In the second step, LIF is used as the input to a feature extractor, salient discriminative feature analysis (SDFA), to learn affect-salient, discriminative features using a novel objective function that encourages feature saliency, orthogonality, and discrimination for SER. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach leads to stable and robust recognition performance in complex scenes (e. g., with speaker and language variation, and environment distortion) and outperforms several well-established SER features.", "paper_title": "Learning Salient Features for Speech Emotion Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345571300011"}
