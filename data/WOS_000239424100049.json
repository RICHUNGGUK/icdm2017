Using countable choice we prove the reverse implication for countable and strongly discrete modules. The Hilbert basis theorem for this specific class of Noetherian modules, and polynomials in a single variable, follows with Tennenbaum's celebrated version for modules with a Noetherian basis function. In particular, the usual hypothesis that the modules under consideration are coherent need not be made. We further identify situations in which countable choice is dispensable.", "paper_title": "Do Noetherian modules have Noetherian basis functions?", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100049"}
