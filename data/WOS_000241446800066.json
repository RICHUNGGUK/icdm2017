We cannot expect each user to know the trustworthiness of each source. We tackle this problem by employing a semantic reputation mechanism which enables P2P Semantic Web to utilize reputation mechanism based on semantic similarity among peers. Our experiments show that the system with this mechanism outperforms the system without it. We hope that this method will help move the Semantic Web closer to fulfilling its promise.", "paper_title": "A semantic reputation mechanism in P2P Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800066"}
