The IM3 cancellation is achieved by post-distorting signal inversely after it is pre- distorted in the input trans-conductance stage during amplification process. The operating frequency range of the LNA is 800 MHz-5 GHz. The proposed technique increases input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) and input 1 dB Compression point (P-1dB) to 12-25 dB m and -1.18 dBm, respectively. Post layout simulation results show a noise figure (NF) of 4.1-4.5 dB, gain of 13.7-13.9 dB and S11 lower than -13 dB while consumes 8 mA from 1.2 V supply. The LNA is designed in a 65 nm standard CMOS technology. The layout schematic shows that the LNA occupies 0.15 x 0.11 mm(2) of silicon area.", "paper_title": "Wideband Inductor-Less Linear LNA Using Post Distortion Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300008"}
