So the demand for automation of package routing is increasing. In this paper, we give the necessary and sufficient condition that all nets can be connected by monotonic routes when a net consists of a finger and a ball and fingers are on the two parallel boundaries of the Ball Grid Array package, and propose a monotonic routing method based on this condition. Moreover, we give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition when fingers are on the two orthogonal boundaries, and propose a monotonic routing method based on the necessary condition.", "paper_title": "Routing of monotonic parallel and orthogonal netlists for single-layer ball grid array packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600022"}
