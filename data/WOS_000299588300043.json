In this paper, by means of the usual Fourier transform, we give a simpler form of the upper bound for 2-adic complexity than related result before. For p(n)-periodic sequences, we discuss the relation between sequences and their Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, based on the relation, we get the lower bound for the number of p(n)-periodic sequences with given 2-adic complexity.", "paper_title": "On the 2-Adic Complexity of Periodic Binary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300043"}
