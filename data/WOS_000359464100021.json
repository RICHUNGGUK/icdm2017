For an application to secure data storage, the share size of SS is an important factor. For an application to a building block for MPC, the extendibility to MPC is needed. Computationally secure SSs and a ramp scheme have a small share size but there have been few studies concerning their MPC. In contrast, there have been many studies about MPC on Shamir's and replicated SSs while their share size is large. We consider an application scenario of SS such as applying SSs to secure data storage service with MPC. In this application, users store their data in servers through SS, and sometimes the servers perform MPC as an optional feature. In this case, the extendibility to MPC is needed and good code-efficiency is preferable. We propose a new computational SS, and show how to convert shares of our SS and a ramp SS to those of multiparty-friendly SS such as Shamir's and replicated SS. This enables one to secretly-share data compactly and extend secretly-shared data to MPC if needed.", "paper_title": "Secret Sharing with Share-Conversion: Achieving Small Share-Size and Extendibility to Multiparty Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100021"}
