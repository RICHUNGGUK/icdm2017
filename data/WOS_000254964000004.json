Based on screw theory, Lie group notations, reciprocal product of twist and wrench, and Jourdain principle, the robot's motion equations including the whole body manipulation are formulated with left invariant representation. A legible and canonical dynamic model representing the relation between the inputs and the generalized dynamic load wrenches is presented. Considering the tradeoff between the symbolic concision, the modularization in code realization and the computation load, the dynamic model is decomposed into succinct block factorizations, and the basic computation unites are boiled down to the adjoint map corresponding to each joint. The traditional Lie bracket operation is extended to a generalized form. Computation efficiency, for the coefficient matrixes of the system motion equation, is discussed based on its special representation form. The generalization of the modeling method with Lie group and algebra tool is also summarized.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis of the dynamics of an omni-directional mobile manipulators system", "paper_id": "WOS:000254964000004"}
