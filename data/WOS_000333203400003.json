However, visual tracking still remains one of the biggest challenges in the area of computer vision, although it has been extensively discussed during in the previous years. In this paper we propose a robust tracking approach based on object flow, which is a motion model for estimating both the displacement and the direction of an object of interest. In addition, an observation model that utilizes a generative prior is adopted to tackle the pitfalls that derive from the appearance changes of the object under study. The efficiency of our technique is demonstrated using sequences captured in a complex industrial environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is sound, yielding improved performance in comparison with other tracking approaches.", "paper_title": "Efficient tracking using a robust motion estimation technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000333203400003"}
