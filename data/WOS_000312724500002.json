We investigate the minimal requirements for such a system to be complete (i.e. closed under redex expansion), and show that the non-logical nature of both intersection and union types disturbs the soundness (i.e. closed uder reduction) properties. This implies that this notion of intersection-union type assignment needs to be restricted to satisfy soundness as well, making it unsuitable to define a semantics. We will look at two (confluent) notions of reduction, called Call-by-Name and Call-by-Value, and prove soundness results for those.", "paper_title": "Completeness and Soundness Results for chi with Intersection and Union Types", "paper_id": "WOS:000312724500002"}
