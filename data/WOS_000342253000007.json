We analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price. We consider both the case of monopolist vendors and cases where a vendor competes with other vendors. When vendors have uncertainty about buyers' valuations specified by a known distribution, we show that a vendor is always better off posting a fixed price, provided that buyer types (valuations) are i.i.d. and that other vendors also use fixed prices. We also show that these assumptions cannot be relaxed: if buyer types are not i.i.d., or other vendors post discount schedules, then posting a schedule may yield a higher profit for the vendor. We provide similar results under a distribution-free uncertainty model, where vendors minimize their maximum regret over all type realizations.
