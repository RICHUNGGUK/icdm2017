The method employs a two-step strategy to predict translation initiation sites (TISs) by first clustering metagenomic fragments into phylogenetic groups and then predicting TISs independently for each group in an unsupervised manner. As evaluated on experimentally verified TISs, MetaTISA greatly improves the accuracies of TIS prediction of current gene-finders.", "paper_title": "MetaTISA: Metagenomic Translation Initiation Site Annotator for improving gene start prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000267665900023"}
