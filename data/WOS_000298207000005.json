One of the methods, based on regular systems, is capable of computing the exact parametric loci of intersection and self-intersection. The other, based on Grobner bases, can compute the minimal varieties passing through the exact parametric loci. The relation between the results computed by the two methods is established and algorithms for computing parametric loci of intersection and self-intersection are described. Experimental results and comparisons with some existing methods show that our algorithms have a good performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
