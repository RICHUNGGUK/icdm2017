Due to process variation and silicon aging, on-chip thermal sensors require periodic calibration before use in DTM. However, the calibration cost for thermal sensors can be prohibitively high as the number of on-chip sensors increases. In this paper, a model which is suitable for online calculation is employed to estimate the temperatures of multiple sensor locations on the silicon die. The estimated sensor and actual sensor thermal profile show a very high similarity with correlation coefficient similar to 0.9 for most tested benchmarks. Our calibration approach combines potentially inaccurate temperature values obtained from two sources: temperature readings from thermal sensors and temperature estimations using system performance counters. A data fusion strategy based on Bayesian inference, which combines information from these two sources, is demonstrated along with a temperature estimation approach using performance counters. The average absolute error of the corrected sensor temperature readings is < 1.5 degrees C and the standard deviation of error is less than < 0.5 degrees C for tested benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Dynamic On-Chip Thermal Sensor Calibration Using Performance Counters", "paper_id": "WOS:000338136100005"}
