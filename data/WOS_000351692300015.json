Viewer's visual evoked potentials (VEP), eye movements and pupil oscillations were measured while six sizes of Landolt circles were presented for 1s each. The significant features of the metrics were extracted to illustrate the perception process and the resulting sizes of visual stimuli. The stimulus sizes affect P1 and N1 delay times of VEP, means of eye movement lengths and pupil diameters and oscillations during the second 500 milliseconds of observation. The feasibility of prediction of stimulus sizes viewed was confirmed using the features of eye behaviour and support vector machines. Both indices of eye movements and pupil diameters were determined to be significant features for making predictions. The influences of the combination of features and viewer's individual factors were also confirmed. This result suggests that features of oculo-motor indices reflect the size of objects being viewed and that these viewing sizes can be predicted using the features.", "paper_title": "Features of Oculo-motors and their chronological changes in response to varying sizes of visual stimuli", "paper_id": "WOS:000351692300015"}
