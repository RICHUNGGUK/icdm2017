First we show that the hydrodynamic radius actually depends on three quantities: the fractal dimension, the so-called prefactor and the inside connectivity. Second, from the simulated velocity field inside the aggregate, we observe that Darcy's law describes the flow better than Brinkman equation. Finally we measure the permeability-porosity relation and observed that it departs from the prediction of Happel's model.", "paper_title": "Hydrodynamic properties and permeability of fractal objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000036"}
