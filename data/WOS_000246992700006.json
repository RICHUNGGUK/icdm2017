This interest is expected to grow further with the proliferation of wireless sensor network applications. This paper provides an overview of the measurement techniques in sensor network localization and the one-hop localization algorithms based on these measurements. A detailed investigation on multi-hop connectivity-based and distance-based localization algorithms are presented. A list of open research problems in the area of distance-based sensor network localization is provided with discussion on possible approaches to them. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
