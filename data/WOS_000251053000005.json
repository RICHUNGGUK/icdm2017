The widely acknowledged importance of the Web Services' concept lies in the fact that they provide a platform independent answer to the software component development question. Equally important are the mechanisms that allow for Web Service discovery, especially as the latter has turn to an arduous task. This paper critically presents the latest methods, architectures, models and concerns that have arisen in the Web Service Discovery area.", "paper_title": "Contemporary web service discovery mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000251053000005"}
