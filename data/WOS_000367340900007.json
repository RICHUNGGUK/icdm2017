We are particularly interested in the verification of physical systems including Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) designs. ACL2 offers strong induction abilities for reasoning about sequences and SMT complements deduction methods like ACL2 with fast nonlinear arithmetic solving procedures. While SAT solvers have been integrated into ACL2 in previous work, SMT methods raise new issues because of their support for a broader range of domains including real numbers and uninterpreted functions. This paper presents S m t l i n k, our clause processor for integrating SMT solvers into ACL2. We describe key design and implementation issues and describe our experience with its use.", "paper_title": "Extending ACL2 with SMT Solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000367340900007"}
