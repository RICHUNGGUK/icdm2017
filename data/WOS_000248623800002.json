We describe a fast statistical thermodynamic method for estimation the binding entropy to address the challenges. The method is based on the integration of the configurational integral over clusters obtained from multiple docked positions. We apply the method in conjunction with 11 popular scoring functions (AutoDock, ChemScore, DrugScore, D-Score, F-Score, G-Score, LigScore, LUDI, PLP, PMF, X-Score) to evaluate the binding entropy of 100 protein-ligand complexes. The averaged values of binding entropy contribution vary from 6.2 to 9.1 kcal/mol, showing good agreement with literature. We calculate positional sizes and the angular volume of the native ligand wells. The averaged geometric mean of positional sizes in principal directions varies from 0.8 to 1.4 angstrom. The calculated range of angular volumes is 3.3-11.8 rad(2). Then we demonstrate that the averaged six-dimensional volume of the native well is larger than the volume of the most populated non-native well in energy landscapes described by all of 11 scoring functions.", "paper_title": "Calculations of protein-ligand binding entropy of relative and overall molecular motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000248623800002"}
