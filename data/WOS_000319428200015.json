Unfortunately, PB models have not reached a wider non-specialized audience for the lack of freely available software implementations. Here we present an extensible C++ implementation of four variants of the PB model, which allows the user to calculate melting temperatures from tested model parameters. Even for a non-specialist, it should be straightforward to change these parameters to reflect different experimental environments or different types of oligonucleotides. For users with some proficiency in C++ programming, it should be feasible to extend the code to other PB models owing to the generic programming implementation adopted for TfReg. Pre-calculated parameters are included that allow the immediate calculation of melting temperatures and thermal equivalence indexes for DNA and RNA.", "paper_title": "TfReg: calculating DNA and RNA melting temperatures and opening profiles with mesoscopic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428200015"}
