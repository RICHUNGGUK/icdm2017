The proposed SRP-based Slack Distribution Technique has been considered with EDF and Rate-Based scheduling schemes that are most commonly used with embedded systems. A fault-tolerant mechanism has also been incorporated into the proposed technique in order to utilize the available dynamic slack to maintain checkpoints and provide for rollbacks on faults. Results show that, in comparison to contemporary techniques, the proposed SRP Slack Distribution Technique achieves about 29 percent more performance/overhead improvement benefits when validated with random and real-world benchmarks.", "paper_title": "A dynamic slack management technique for real-time distributed embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251686300007"}
