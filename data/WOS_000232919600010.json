We determine (cr) over bar (K(11)) = 102 and (cr) over bar (K(12)) = 153. Despite the remarkable hunt for crossing numbers of the complete graph K(n) - initiated by R. Guy in the 1960s - these quantities have been unknown for n > 10 to date. Our solution mainly relies on a tailor-made method for enumerating all inequivalent sets of points ( order types) of size 11. Based on these findings, we establish a new upper bound on (cr) over bar (K(n)) for general n. The bound stems from a novel construction of drawings of K(n) with few crossings.", "paper_title": "On the crossing number of complete graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000232919600010"}
