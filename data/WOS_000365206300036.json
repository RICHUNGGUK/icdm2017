To achieve the high coverage of simulation, this brief proposes a covalidation method to generate the RTL testbench based on the model-checking technique. An object-oriented event-mapping technique is proposed to transform the sequential traces created by formal method to parallel RTL stimulus. A case study on the modified, exclusive, shared and invalid protocol was performed and showed that the covalidation method could save significant effort to create RTL testbenches while maintaining high coverage.", "paper_title": "Parallel Stimulus Generation Based on Model Checking for Coherence Protocol Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300036"}
