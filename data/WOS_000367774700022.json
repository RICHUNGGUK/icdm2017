One of them is the Reverse Nearest Neighbour (RNN) Queries, which its concept is to have a set of objects that considers a query object as the nearest neighbour. One solution to the RNN queries is through region approach, which in this case every single object in the space has a certain region where all objects inside this region will think of the query object as their nearest neighbour. This approach is very efficient, especially when it is implemented in mobile environment. However, current RNN queries with region approach can only be applicable to a single query object. In real life, there are some cases where we want to find a region for several objects altogether, not only for a single object. Hence, we propose a solution to this problem through the Group Reverse kNN. We will find a specific region based on multiple query objects, where any objects located inside this region will always consider all of the query objects as the nearest compared to the non-query objects. The development of the algorithm is achieved through the application of computational geometry. Our experiments demonstrate the performance efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.
