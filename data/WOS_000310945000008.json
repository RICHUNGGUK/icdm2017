In prostate cancer, definitive therapy such as radical prostatectomy, is more effective when the cancer is organ-confined. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of some fuzzy expert systems in the classification of patients with confined or non-confined cancer. To deal with the intrinsic uncertainty about the variables utilized to predict cancer stage, the developed approach is based on Fuzzy Set Theory. A fuzzy expert system was developed with the fuzzy rules and membership functions tuned by a genetic algorithm. As a result, the utilized approach reached better precision taking into account some correlated studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
