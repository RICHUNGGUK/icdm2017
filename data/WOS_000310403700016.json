In this paper we propose a sparse dimension reduction method to perform interpretable dimension reduction. It is designed for situations in which the number of correlated predictors is very large relative to the sample size. The new procedure is based on the optimal scoring interpretation of the sliced inverse regression method. As a result, the regression framework of optimal scoring facilitates the use of commonly used regularization techniques. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
