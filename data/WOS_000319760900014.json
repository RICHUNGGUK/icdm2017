We show that the k most vital edges MST problem is NP-hard even for complete graphs with weights 0 or 1 and 3-approximable for graphs with weights 0 or 1. We also prove that the k most vital nodes MST problem is not approximable within a factor n (1-I mu) , for any I mu > 0, unless NP=ZPP, even for complete graphs of order n with weights 0 or 1. Furthermore, we show that the min edge blocker MST problem is NP-hard even for complete graphs with weights 0 or 1 and that the min node blocker MST problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor 1.36 even for graphs with weights 0 or 1.", "paper_title": "Critical edges/nodes for the minimum spanning tree problem: complexity and approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319760900014"}
