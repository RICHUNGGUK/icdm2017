State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms perform interpolation along edges, but these edges are estimated locally. We propose a level-set-based geometric method to estimate image edges, inspired by the image inpainting literature. This method has a time complexity of O(S), where S is the number of pixels in the image, and compares favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms both visually and in most relevant image quality measures.", "paper_title": "Geometry-Based Demosaicking", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604700017"}
