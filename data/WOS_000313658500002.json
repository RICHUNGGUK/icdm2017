We show that termination of such loops is undecidable in some cases, in particular, when the body of the loop is expressed by a set of linear inequalities where the coefficients are from Z boolean OR {r} with r an arbitrary irrational; when the loop is a sequence of instructions, that compute either linear expressions or the step function; and when the loop body is a piecewise linear deterministic update with two pieces. The undecidability result is proven by a reduction from counter programs, whose termination is known to be undecidable. For the common case of integer linear-constraint loops with rational coefficients we have not succeeded in proving either decidability or undecidability of termination, but we show that a Petri net can be simulated with such a loop; this implies some interesting lower bounds. For example, termination for a partially specified input is at least EXPSPACE-hard.", "paper_title": "On the Termination of Integer Loops", "paper_id": "WOS:000313658500002"}
