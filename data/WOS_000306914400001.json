Manifold optimization appears in a wide variety of computational problems in the applied sciences. In this article, we present GrassmannOptim, an R package for Grassmann manifold optimization. The implementation uses gradient-based algorithms and embeds a stochastic gradient method for global search. We describe the algorithms, provide some illustrative examples on the relevance of manifold optimization and finally, show some practical usages of the package.", "paper_title": "GrassmannOptim: An R Package for Grassmann Manifold Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000306914400001"}
