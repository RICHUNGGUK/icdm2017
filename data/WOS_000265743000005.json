In particular, we show how the use of Embedded Graph Grammars (EGGs) provides a tool for characterizing local interaction and control laws. This paper highlights some key implementation aspects of the EGG formalism, and develops and discusses experimental results for a hexapod-based multi-robot system, as well as a multi-robot system of wheeled robots.", "paper_title": "Multi-robot deployment and coordination with Embedded Graph Grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000265743000005"}
