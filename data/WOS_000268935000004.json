By developing a novel synchronisation and coupling position error, a non-singular fast TSM is proposed in coupling position error space. The proposed controller can guarantee position error and synchronisation error converge to zero in a finite time simultaneously without requiring the explicit using system dynamic model. The corresponding stability analysis is presented to lay a foundation for theoretical understanding to the underlying issues as well as safe operation for real systems. An illustrative example is demonstrated in support of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Finite time position synchronised control for parallel manipulators using fast terminal sliding mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000268935000004"}
