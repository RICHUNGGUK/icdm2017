This framework has two levels: one is local to a single ATM, while the other is network-wide. The framework employs vaccination and adaptability analogies of the immune system. For discriminating between normal and erroneous states, an immune-inspired one-class supervised algorithm was employed, which supports continual learning and adaptation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was confirmed in terms of classification performance and impact on availability. The overall results are encouraging as the downtime of ATMs can de reduced by anticipating the occurrence of failures before they actually occur.", "paper_title": "Immune-inspired adaptable error detection for automated teller machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000249023700012"}
