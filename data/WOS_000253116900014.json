Using this system, the users can select adequate machine tools, cutters, and cutting parameters for the turning process. The users can also evaluate the machining performance by obtaining the turning force. power consumption, vibration status, and workpiece distortion from this system. Engineers at geographically distributed sites, which are connected by the Internet using a standard browser, can use this system to realize process planning and optimization. This web-based machining parameter selection system for agile turning can shorten the product life cycle cost, enhance the product quality, and decrease the product lead-time significantly.
