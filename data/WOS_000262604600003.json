By using the proposed model, both the model itself and the parameter estimation of the corresponding model are simplified. By defining the polarity of a particular model parameter, the model has the flexibility to deal with both 'soft NLOS' and 'hard NLOS' indoor propagation environments. Therefore, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) generated by the proposed model 'resemble' the measured CIR better than the SV (Saleh-Valenzuela)/IEEE 802.15.3a model not only in terms of the average values, but also in terms of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the small-scale statistics.
