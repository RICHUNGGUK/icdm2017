In this design, a level shifter is introduced at the receiver, in order to improve digital audio quality by threshold convergence. Measurement results demonstrate that the implemented optical receiver in a 0.25-mu m CMOS technology can successfully reduce pulse width distortion within -2% and circuit complexity.", "paper_title": "A CMOS optical receiver with subtraction-based level shifter for high-definition digital audio interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000248761600005"}
