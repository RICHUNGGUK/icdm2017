The interface provides support for hypergraph-based sparse matrix partitioning methods which are used for efficient parallelization of sparse matrix-vector multiplication operations. The interface also offers tools for visualizing and measuring the quality of a given matrix partition. We propose a novel, multilevel, 20 coarsening-based 20 matrix partitioning method and implement it using the interface. We have performed extensive comparison of the proposed method against our implementation of orthogonal recursive bisection and fine-grain methods on a large set of publicly available test matrices. The conclusion of the experiments is that the new method can compete with the fine-grain method while also suggesting new research directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.
