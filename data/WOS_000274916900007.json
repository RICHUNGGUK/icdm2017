The method is a \"reassigned\" version of the Hough-wavelet transform and it is compared to the matched filter approach and the Hough-wavelet transform itself. Extensions to previous results obtained with these two methods are also presented. As target application, the problem of gravitational waves at interferometric detectors is considered. Our main conclusion is that there is no gain in introducing the reassignment operation.", "paper_title": "TIME-SCALE APPROACH FOR CHIRP DETECTION II", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916900007"}
