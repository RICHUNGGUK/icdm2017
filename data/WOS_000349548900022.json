With OFDM and coherent receiving technology, the access network achieves high bandwidth utility efficiency and excellent transporting properties. Using optical heterodyne, the network implements 60 GHz wireless access without adding a radio source. We evaluate the performance of the system in terms of bit error rate, coverage area, and receiving constellation and obtain a network with an excellent access property.", "paper_title": "Design of WDM-RoF-PON Based on Improved OFDM Mechanism and Optical Coherent Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000349548900022"}
