The main symptom of glaucoma is the progressive deterioration of the visual field. Glaucoma management involves monitoring the progress of the disease using regular visual field tests but currently there is no standard method for classifying changes in visual field measurements. Sequence matching techniques typically rely on similarity measures. However, visual field measurements are very noisy, particularly in people with glaucoma. It is therefore difficult to establish a reference data set including both stable and progressive visual fields. We describe method that uses a baseline computed from a query sequence, to match stable sequences in a database collected from volunteers. The results suggest that the new method is more accurate than other techniques for identifying progressive sequences, though there is a small penalty for stable sequences.", "paper_title": "Monitoring glaucomatous progression: Classification of visual field measurements using stable reference data", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100078"}
