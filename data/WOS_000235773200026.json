Those methods are robust. They require an important processing power and a high memory bandwidth which becomes a handicap for real-time applications. The recent evolution of commodity PC computer graphics boards (CPU) has the potential to accelerate those algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel use of graphics hardware for object detection in advanced computer vision applications. We implement a system for object-detection based on AdaBoost [1]. This system can be tuned to run partially or totally on the CPU. This system is evaluated with two face-detection applications. Those applications are based on the boosted cascade of classifiers: Multiple Layers Face Detection (MLFD), and Single Layer Face Detection (SLFD). We show that the SLFD implementation on CPU performs up to nine times faster than its CPU counterpart. The MLFD, in the other hand, can be accelerated using the CPU and performs up to three times faster than the CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to implement a sliding window technique for visual object-detection on CPU, with promessing performance.", "paper_title": "Boosted algorithms for visual object detection on graphics processing units", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200026"}
