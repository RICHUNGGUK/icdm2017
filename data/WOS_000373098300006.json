Our investigation relies on the use of a few body-worn wireless inertial nodes and represents a first step in the design of a portable system, amenable to be integrated in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, for automatic detection of the degree of severity (in terms of UPDRS score) of PD. The experimental investigation is carried out considering 24 PD patients.", "paper_title": "Assigning UPDRS Scores in the Leg Agility Task of Parkinsonians: Can It Be Done Through BSN-Based Kinematic Variables?", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098300006"}
