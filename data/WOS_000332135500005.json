The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - It has been shown that for hexahedral elements the FDM equations may be presented in the form similar to the EEM equations, providing the products of the nodal potentials and distances between the nodes are used as unknowns in FDM, instead of the usual nodal potentials. Findings - The analogy between the FDM and the EEM approach has been established. Originality/value - It has been demonstrated, following from this and previous publications, that analogy exists between all fundamental methods of field solutions relying on space discretisation. This is helpful in terms of classification of the methods and aids the understanding of physical processes involved.", "paper_title": "On the equivalence of finite difference and edge element formulations in magnetic field analysis using vector potential", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500005"}
