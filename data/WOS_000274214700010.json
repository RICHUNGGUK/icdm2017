While multipath routing provides better resilience to various faults ill sensor networks, it has two problems regarding the authentication design One is that, due to the large number of partially overlapped routing paths between the source and sink nodes, the authentication overhead could be very high if these paths are authenticated individually; the other is that false reports may escape the authentication check through the newly identified node association attack. In this paper., we propose enhancements to solve both problems Such that secure and efficient authentication call be achieved in multipath routing. The proposed scheme is (t + 1)-resilient, i.e. it is secure with tip to t compromised nodes. The upper bound that a false report may be forwarded in the network is O(t(2)).", "paper_title": "The design and evaluation of interleaved authentication for filtering false reports in multipath routing WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000274214700010"}
