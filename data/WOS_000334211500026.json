In the method, the two-tuple linguistic representation developed in recent years is used to aggregate the linguistic assessment information. According to the traditional ideas of project method, the optimal alternative(s) is determined by calculating the project values of every alternative and positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution. It is based on the concept that the optimal alternative should have the largest degree of relative closeness from positive ideal solution. The method has exact characteristic in linguistic information processing. It avoided information distortion and losing which occur formerly in the linguistic information processing. Finally, a numerical example for performance evaluation of engineering cost management is used to illustrate the use of the proposed method. The result shows the approach is simple, effective and easy to calculate.", "paper_title": "Project method for multiple attribute group decision making with two-tuple linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500026"}
