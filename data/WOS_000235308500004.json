They reduce network traffic through the cut down of repetitive information. However, traditional proxy server does not support multimedia streaming. One of the reasons is that general scheduling strategy adopted by most of the traditional proxy servers does not provide real-time support to multimedia services. Based on the concept of contractual scheduling, we have developed a proxy server that supports real-time multimedia applications. Moreover, we developed the group scheduling mechanism to enable processing power transfer between tasks that can hardly be achieved by traditional schedulers. They result in a substantially improved performance particularly when both time-constrained and non-time-constrained processes coexist within the proxy server. In this paper, the design and implementation of this proxy server and the proposed scheduler are detailed.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of contractual based real-time scheduler for multimedia streaming proxy server", "paper_id": "WOS:000235308500004"}
