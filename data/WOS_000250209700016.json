Existing schemes of immersed boundary methods for incompressible flow violate the wall condition in the discrete equation system during time-advancement. This problem arises from the inconsistency of the pressure with the velocity interpolated to represent the solid wall, which does not coincide with the computational grid. The numerical discrepancy does Dot become evident in the laminar flow simulation but in the turbulent flow simulation. To eliminate this inconsistency, a modified pressure equation based on the interpolated pressure gradient was derived for the spatial second-order discrete equation system. The conservation of the wall condition, mass, momentum and energy in the present method was theoretically demonstrated. To verify the theory, large eddy simulations for a plane channel, circular pipe and nuclear rod bundle were successfully performed. Both these theoretical and numerical validations improve the reliability and the applicability of the immersed boundary method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
