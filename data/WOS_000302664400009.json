A comparison of three major telecommunication companies is empirically studied based upon the consumers' perspective. To facilitate this main issue, we selected thirty-three assessment attributes of service quality in ten dimensions, as based on the literature and characteristics of consumers in Taiwan. Then, the Lin's modified P-I analysis was applied to evaluate service quality for the selected mobile application stores of three telecommunication companies. Finally, the results of this study show that nine service qualities are valued by all mobile communication users of three telecommunication companies. These service qualities are 'answers questions rapidly', 'sincerity in responses to users' questions', 'the importance of solving users' problems', 'provision of reliable information', 'provide the application information required by users', 'stable network connection service', 'provide precise connection signal', 'importance of communication network for users' and 'mobile phone devices allow successful transactions', respectively. Moreover, this study suggested that, if companies intend to promote their business developments, they must continuously improve their service quality to promote customer satisfaction.", "paper_title": "EVALUATING SERVICE QUALITY OF MOBILE APPLICATION STORES: A COMPARISON OF THREE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES IN TAIWAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400009"}
