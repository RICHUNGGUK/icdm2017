A comparison between cooperation with and without frame combiner is also performed. In channels with a strong Line of Sight (LOS) component and low Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), the efficiency of the proposed protocol is many times higher than for other ARQ schemes. For non-LOS scenarios, the cooperative ARQ without frame combiner achieves the best efficiency results, and the overhead introduced by the frame combiner mechanism leads to results that can be even below the classical ARQ mechanism. In AWGN channels, the saturation throughput of the proposed scheme integrated into a IEEE 802.11 DCF based MAC is also studied. When the number of active stations is high, the cooperative ARQ without frame combiner shows to be the best option, while for light network loads, the presented scheme performs better.", "paper_title": "A cooperative-ARQ protocol with frame combining", "paper_id": "WOS:000289730300009"}
