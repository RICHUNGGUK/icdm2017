In some situations, nonverbal communication may even take the place of verbal communication. In this paper, we introduce how nonverbal acoustic communication can be utilized in human-computer interaction. We first overview acoustic techniques for nonverbal communication. Then we provide a design framework of nonverbal communication based intelligent agents. We demonstrate an example of the design using an experimental iPad game.", "paper_title": "Nonverbal acoustic communication in human-computer interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000288660200002"}
