Since the computing power and memory size of the embedded system are not as good as those on a personal computer, special techniques have been applied in the algorithm to enhance the performance of lane recognition while maintaining the reliability of the results. The applied median filter can obtain the median element of a 4-by-3 array using only 19 comparison operations. Furthermore, the edge enhancing filter can washout the foreign objects in the region of interest and keep the lane marks with tilt/slope pattern. Using these two tools as the basis, the applied algorithm can detect the event of lane-departure and alarm the warning to assist drivers for driving safety on the road. Besides the basic techniques, the lane mark enhancement is implemented to improve the accuracy of detection and double-line detection is also added to alert the driver for eventual traffic rule violation. The system has been implemented and tested on a DSP-based embedded platform. It can perform the required processes in real-time under various weather conditions.", "paper_title": "A DSP-BASED LANE RECOGNITION METHOD FOR THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM OF SMART VEHICLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800012"}
