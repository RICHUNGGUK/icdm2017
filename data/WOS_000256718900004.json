At present, ROPS design standards require full-scale destructive testing that can be expensive, time consuming, and unsuitable for small companies. More economical analytical methods are not permitted due to a lack of understanding of post yield behavior and the energy absorption capacity of ROPS. To address this, a comprehensive research project was undertaken to investigate ROPS behavior using analytical techniques supported by experiments. This article presents the dynamic impact analysis of a bulldozer ROPS using calibrated finite element models. Results indicate that (1) ROPS posts have significant influence on the energy-absorbing capacity, (2) dynamic amplifications in energy could be up to 25%, (3) stiffer ROPS cause high peak decelerations that may be detrimental to the operator, and (4) analytical techniques may be used for evaluating ROPS performance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic response of a Rollover Protective Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000256718900004"}
