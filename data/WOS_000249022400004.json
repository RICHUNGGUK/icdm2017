For a systematic investigation small and easily assignable molecules substituted with a chain of varying length were synthesized. In a subsequent step these so-called sensor molecules were attached to commercially available resins. After swelling experiments, C-13 NMR spectra of the solid phase systems in gel form were recorded using Composite Pulse Decoupling (CPD) and Attached Proton Test (APT) techniques. The quality of the resulting spectra was analyzed using the half-height linewidths of the signals as the most important criterion. Based on these data, the parameters to obtain high quality spectra were determined.", "paper_title": "Gel-phase C-13 NMR spectroscopy of selected solid phase systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249022400004"}
