However, their weight distributions are known only for a few cases mainly on the codes with no more than three nonzeros. In this paper, the weight distributions of two classes of cyclic codes with three or four nonzeros are determined.", "paper_title": "The weight distributions of some cyclic codes with three or four nonzeros over F-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700003"}
