In this paper a formal process modeling language is developed which incorporates IEB (Integrated Enterprise Balancing)/4R (Risk, Return, Regulation, Reporting) requirements formulated by Faisst and Buhl [FaBu05]. This is realized through the inclusion of 4R elements and 4R relations into the new 4R process modeling language. An evaluation of the process modeling language with regard to the assessment criterion \"feasibility of implementation\" was successfully executed using the meta modeling platform ADONIS. For that purpose the ADONIS modeling language for business processes (ADONIS BPMS) was extended with additional 4R modeling elements. Furthermore a new model type as well as required classes and relation classes have been developed which enable the connection of the 4R process modeling language to the research results of the above mentioned contribution.", "paper_title": "Modelling for integrated enterprise balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000251374100002"}
