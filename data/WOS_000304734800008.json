Reliable numerical methods for simulation produce approximate solutions that converge to the physically relevant solution of the PDE as the discretization is refined. We focus on two such methods and assess their performance via simulations for two scenarios. One method is provably convergent and is used as a reference method. The other method is less efficient in reducing numerical errors, but faster and more easily implemented. Furthermore, we demonstrate some pitfalls when deriving numerical methods for this type of PDE and can thereby rule out certain methods as unsuitable; among others, the wide-spread Takacs method.
