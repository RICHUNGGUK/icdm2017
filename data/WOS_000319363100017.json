This effort is different from the existing approaches to developing conceptual models in that the model is derived step by step from a natural language description of the design chain management. The derived DCM model is called a wheel model since the model would evolve because of its internal conflicts. An industrial example is used to show how the proposed formalization can be used to solve a problem in the DCM.", "paper_title": "Formalization of design chain management using environment-based design (EBD) theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000319363100017"}
