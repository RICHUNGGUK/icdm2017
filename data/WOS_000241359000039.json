This paper describes the work of Alicante 1 group. Thinking of future developments, we have designed a modular framework based on XML that will easily let us integrate, combine and test system components based on different approaches. In this context, several modifications have been introduced, such as a new machine learning based question classification module. We took part in the monolingual Spanish task.", "paper_title": "An XML-based system for Spanish question answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000039"}
