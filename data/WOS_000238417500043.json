Therefore, we need some method to measure the relevance of the documents to the query. In this paper we propose algorithms for computing k-keyword proximity score [3] in more realistic environments. Furthermore, we show that they can be used to find longest repetitive substring with constraints in a set of strings.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for the generalized k-keyword proximity problem and finding longest repetitive substring in a set of strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500043"}
