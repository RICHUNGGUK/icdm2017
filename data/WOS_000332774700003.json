Online gamers often participate in teams also. This study investigates whether and how team participation improves loyalty. We utilized a cross-sectional design and an online survey, with 546 valid responses from online game subjects. Confirmatory factor analysis was applied to assess measurement reliability and validity directly, and structural equation modeling was utilized to test our hypotheses. The results indicate that participation in teams motivates online gamers to adhere to team norms and satisfies their social needs, also enhancing their loyalty. The contribution of this research is the introduction of social norms to explain online gamer loyalty. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
