Both almost sure (sample) stability and stability in mean square are investigated. Based on Lyapunov functional methods and linear matrix inequality techniques, new criteria for exponential robust stability of switched stochastic delay systems with non-linear uncertainties are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities and average dwell-time conditions. Numerical examples are also given to illustrate the results.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability of switched stochastic delay systems with non-linear uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000267286800007"}
