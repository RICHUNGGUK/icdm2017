It is proved that the set consisting of truth degrees of all formulas is dense in [0, 1], and a general expression of truth degrees of formulas as well as a deduction rule of truth degrees is then obtained. Moreover, similarity degrees among formulas are proposed and a pseudo-metric is defined therefrom on the set of formulas, and hence a possible framework suitable for developing approximate reasoning theory in n-valued generalized Lukasiewicz propositional logic is established.", "paper_title": "Theory of truth degrees of propositions in the logic system L-n(*)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240614500006"}
