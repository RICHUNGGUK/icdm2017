Different from previous work, three intuitive factors of motion, namely, content, identity and style, can be manipulated directly with the new model. With the new generative model, motion editing can be achieved in various aspects, including transferring an unknown style from an actor to another, synthesizing other styles for an unknown actor and generating a new motion with other content.
