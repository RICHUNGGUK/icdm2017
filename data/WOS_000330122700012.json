The proposed approach is based on an adaptive dynamic surface control, where the system uncertainties are approximately modeled by interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks. In this paper, the robust stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theorem, and all error signals are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. In addition to simulations, the proposed method is applied to a real ball-and-beam system for performance evaluations. To highlight the system robustness, different initial settings of ball-and-beam parameters are considered. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed control scheme has superior responses, compared to conventional dynamic surface control.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems With Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330122700012"}
