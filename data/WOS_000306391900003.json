Traditional channel estimation algorithms are based on the assumption of Gaussian noise, or the need to locate the positions of impulsive noise. The algorithms may lose optimality when impulsive noise exists in the channel, or if the location estimation of impulsive noise is inaccurate. In the present paper, an effective channel estimation algorithm based on a robust cost function is proposed to mitigate impulsive noise. The proposed method can provide a closed-form solution, and the application of robust estimation theory enables the proposed method to be free from localization of impulsive noise and thus can guarantee that the proposed method has better performance. Simulations verified the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Robust Approach for Channel Estimation in Power Line Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000306391900003"}
