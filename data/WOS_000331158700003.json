The proposed scheme seamlessly integrates cryptographic algorithms and Erasure Correction Codes (ECCs) to SVC video streams Such that the authenticated streams are format compliant with the SVC specifications and preserve the three-dimensional scalability (i.e., spatial, quality and temporal) of the original streams. We implement our scheme on a smart phone and study its performance over a realistic bursty. packet-lossy wireless mobile network. Our analysis and experimental results show that the scheme achieves very high verification rates with lower communication overhead and much smaller decoding delay compared with the existing solutions.
