To identify relative importance of website success factors and to rank alternative websites with respect to success factors, Updated Delone and McLean Information System Success Model is extended through applying an analytic network process (ANP) approach. A field study with 383 academic internet users was performed. Relative importance of each website success factor with respect to their influence on using the e-recruitment website, and user satisfaction are identified. Furthermore relative significance of using the e-recruitment website and user satisfaction in achieving positive benefits are discovered. This study also found the relative preference of each website with respect to different success variable. Results indicate that ANP is an effective tool to provide an accurate solution for interdependencies that are able to affect the decision to be made for network like models. The findings of this study provide decision makers of e-commerce companies with useful insights to compare the preference of their website with others with respect to different success variables. Moreover, relative significance of different success variables in websites can be compared. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
