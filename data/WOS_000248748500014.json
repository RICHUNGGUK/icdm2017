OBS can realize statistic multiplexing while having the advantage of simplicity in deployment. A key issue in OBS is how to reduce the rate of the burst dropping caused by the absence of optical buffers or by the limited number of Fiber Delay Line (FDL). Existing work addresses this issue in the wavelength, time, or space domains. This paper proposes an algorithm, which works from a new domain to address this problem. Specially, it works by using the idle bandwidth in upstream links to transmit redundant copies of bursts to provide more sending chances at the downstream node. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the high performance of our algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
