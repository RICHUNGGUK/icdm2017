The preprocessing time and space complexities of our proposed algorithm are 0(n log n) and O(n) respectively; the query time complexity is O(log 2 n). We will use this method for solving the following problem proposed by Bose and Wang [3] - given r simple polygons with a total of m vertices along with the point set P, compute the smallest enclosing circle of P whose center lies in one of the r polygons. This can be solved in O (n log n + m log(2) n) time using our method in a much simpler way than [3]; the time complexity of the problem is also being improved.", "paper_title": "Constrained minimum enclosing circle with center on a query line segment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700066"}
