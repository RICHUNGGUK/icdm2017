In this work we present the automatic localization of a wide variety of differently shaped objects scanned with a laser range sensor from one view in a cluttered setting. The daily-life objects are modeled using approximated Superquadrics, which can be obtained from showing the object or another modeling process. Detection is based on a hierarchical RANSAC search to obtain fast detection results and the voting of sorted quality-of-fit criteria. The probabilistic search starts from low resolution and refines hypotheses at increasingly higher resolution levels. Criteria for object shape and the relationship of object parts together with a ranking procedure and a ranked voting process result in a combined ranking of hypothesis using a minimum number of parameters. The experimental evaluation of the method and experiments from cluttered table top scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, feasible for real world object localization and robot grasp planning.", "paper_title": "Model-based 3D object detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000277415700007"}
