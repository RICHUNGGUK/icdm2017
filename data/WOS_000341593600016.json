To eliminate redundancy in high-dimensional EEG signals and reduce the coupling among different classes of EEG signals, we use principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to extract features that represent the raw signals. Next, we introduce the voting-based extreme learning machine to classify the features. Experiments performed on real-world data from the 2003 BCI competition indicate that our classification method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Voting Optimized Strategy Based on ELM for Improving Classification of Motor Imagery BCI Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000341593600016"}
