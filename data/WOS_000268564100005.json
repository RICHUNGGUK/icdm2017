It is known that the unweighted problem with two agents is NP-hard in the ordinary sense. For this case, we can reduce our problem to a Multi-Objective Shortest-Path (MOSP) problem and this reduction leads to several results including Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (FPTAS). We also provide an efficient approximation algorithm with a reasonably good worst-case ratio. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
