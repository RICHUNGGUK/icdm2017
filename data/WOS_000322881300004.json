The method assumes that the P Delta Es are defined on a quadrilateral, and consistent around the cube. Next, the method is extended to systems of P Delta Es where one has to carefully account for equations defined on edges of the quadrilateral. Lax pairs are presented for scalar integrable P Delta Es classified by Adler, Bobenko, and Suris and systems of P Delta Es including the integrable two-component potential Korteweg-de Vries lattice system, as well as nonlinear Schrodinger and Boussinesq-type lattice systems. Previously unknown Lax pairs are presented for P Delta Es recently derived by Hietarinta (J. Phys. A, Math. Theor. 44:165204, 2011). The method is algorithmic and is being implemented in Mathematica.", "paper_title": "Symbolic Computation of Lax Pairs of Partial Difference Equations using Consistency Around the Cube", "paper_id": "WOS:000322881300004"}
