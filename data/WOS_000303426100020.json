Firstly, the concept of GHR of general nonlinear time-delay systems is proposed, and several new GHR methods are given. Then, based on the new GHR methods obtained, the stability of time-delay systems is investigated, and several delay-dependent sufficient conditions in term of matrix inequalities are derived, for the stability analysis by constructing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functionals. Finally, an illustrative example shows that the results obtained in this paper have less conservatism, and work very well in the stability analysis of some nonlinear time-delay Hamiltonian systems.", "paper_title": "Stability for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems via Hamiltonian functional method", "paper_id": "WOS:000303426100020"}
