In this paper, the problem of how to balance the needs on constraining end-to-end (e2e) quality and prolonging lifetime in an established route can be interpreted as a nonlinear optimization paradigm, which is then shown to be a max-min composite formulation when an e2e frame-error probability is given. To solve this max-min problem, we propose two novel methods: route-associated power management (RAPM) and link-associated power management (LAPM). For computation-restricted sensor nodes, the RAPM scheme with adding a simplification condition on power management can effectively reduce the power cost at computation and also rapidly determine optimum lifetime from numerous candidate routes. On the other hand, if computing power is not the major concern in a sink node, rather than using a heuristic method, we employ the LAPM algorithm to solve the lifetime maximization problem in a more accurate fashion. Solid theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to validate our proposed schemes. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the LAPM scheme is very comparable to the heuristic approach.
