In this paper, a technique to replace the constant dc current source with active building blocks typically required in transceivers is proposed. By using this method the total current consumption of the transceiver can be efficiently reduced without modifying its performance. A design example where the proposed technique reduces the receiver current consumption by 45% is given.", "paper_title": "Efficient current reuse for low-power transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000009"}
