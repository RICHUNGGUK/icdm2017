Particularly, SCSPO searches an optimal compression codebook of all unique repeat patterns and then DNA sequences are compressed by replacing the duplicate fragments with the indexes of the corresponding matched code vectors in the codebook. Featured with a crucial self-configuration process, SCSPO optimizes the codebook with no predefined parameter settings required. Experimental results on benchmark numerical functions and real-world DNA sequences demonstrate that SCSPO is capable of attaining better fitness value than many other PSO variants and the proposed DNA sequence compression algorithm based on SCSPO attains encouraging compression performance.", "paper_title": "Self-configuration single particle optimizer for DNA sequence compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000316334400016"}
