However, most pulse shaping methods do not consider the antenna distortion which cannot be neglected in the UWB communication systems compared with the conventional systems. To this end, an orthogonal wavelet based pulse shaping method is proposed in this paper to integrate compensation of antenna distortion into pulse shaping. Simulation results show that the novel pulse shaping method can be used to achieve compensation for antenna distortion, optimization of transmission power spectrum, and simplification of the algorithm, as well as simple implementation of the pulse generator.", "paper_title": "Pulse shaping method to compensate for antenna distortion in ultra-wideband communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251020500006"}
