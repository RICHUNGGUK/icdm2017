The dissimilarity employed is the Alpha-Beta divergence (AB-divergence), which can be asymmetrized using its parameters. We compute the degree of asymmetry of the AB-divergence on the basis of the within-cluster variances. In this way, the proposed approach is able to flexibly model even clusters with significantly different variances. Consequently, this method overcomes one of the major drawbacks of the standard symmetric centroid-based clustering. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
