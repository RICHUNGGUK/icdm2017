The masterpieces are often placed in locations which are difficult to reach, moreover many artifacts, coming from man's creativity, have very complex functioning. The authors of this paper describe their experience in using the computer graphics capabilities in order to reproduce four ancient clocks functioning coming from different Italian regions. The study is based not only on the 3D-shapes reconstruction but also on the simulation of their complex mechanisms in order to mimic their functioning. The realism of the reconstruction allows to use the graphical products in exhibits, museums and also for maintenance: programs. The rendering techniques together with an accurate camera path, allow to get into the clock mechanisms and to appreciate all the features (and even secrets) that a simple glance cannot reveal.
