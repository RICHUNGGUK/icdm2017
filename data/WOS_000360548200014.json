There is an urgent need to address the diverse set of challenges regarding different aspects of FD network design, theory, and development. In addition to the self-interference cancellation signal processing algorithms, network protocols such as resource management are also essential in the practical design and implementation of FD wireless networks. This article aims to present the latest development and future directions of resource allocation in different full duplex systems by exploring the network resources in different domains, including power, space, frequency, and device dimensions. Four representative application scenarios are considered: FD MIMO networks, FD cooperative networks, FD OFDMA cellular networks, and FD heterogeneous networks. Resource management problems and novel algorithms in these systems are presented, and key open research directions are discussed.", "paper_title": "RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN FULL-DUPLEX COMMUNICATIONS FOR FUTURE WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200014"}
