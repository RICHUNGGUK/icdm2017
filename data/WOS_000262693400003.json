Compared with previous methods, this paper has two unique aspects: first, a more general n-link robot system using on-line adaptive T-S fuzzy-neural controller is investigated, and second, the complete proof of the controller is given. The general robot systems are linearized via the mean value theorem, and then the T-S fuzzy-neural model can approximate the linearized system. Also, we propose an on-line identification algorithm and put significant emphasis on robust tracking controller design using an adaptive scheme for the robot systems. Finally, an example including two cases is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "On-line Adaptive T-S Fuzzy-Neural Control for A Class of General Multi-Link Robot Manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000262693400003"}
