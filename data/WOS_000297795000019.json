Compared with the previous works in the controller design of underwater robot, the main advantages of this work are: (1) A new disturbance prediction and compensation model is proposed; (2) A new adaptive fuzzy smoother is proposed for the control input; (3) A time-varying flow disturbance is considered for the control design which is always neglected in many previous works and several practical experiments under different environment were implemented to verify the control performance. The Lyapunov stability theory proves the stability and convergence of this new control system. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the performance and the effectiveness of this new algorithm.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear underwater robot controller design with adaptive disturbance prediction and smoother", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000019"}
