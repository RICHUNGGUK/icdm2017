Nevertheless, the programming environment for multi-core processor-based systems is still quite immature and lacks efficient tools. In this work, we present a new VERTAF/Multi-Core framework and show how software code can be automatically generated from SysML models of multi-core embedded systems. We illustrate how model-driven design based on SysML can be seamlessly integrated with Intel's threading building blocks (TBB) and the quantum framework (QF) middleware. We use a digital video recording system to illustrate the benefits of the framework. Our experiments show how SysML/QF/TBB help in making multi-core embedded system programming model-driven, easy, and efficient.", "paper_title": "VERTAF/Multi-Core: A SysML-Based Application Framework for Multi-Core Embedded Software Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000290744700011"}
