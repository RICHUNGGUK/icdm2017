A bi-level decision support model with link capacity expansion is developed to simultaneously reduce travel delay to road users and mitigate vulnerability of road network. A tractable solution scheme for BDSS is developed. Due to some hierarchy in decision-making order of BDSS, a bi-level programming is employed. A risk-averse Stackelberg solution is established for a normative BOSS under travel demand uncertainty. Numerical computations are performed using a real-data road network. Computational results indicate that the proposed solution scheme can effectively improve a worst-case performance of BOSS with greater success while incurring a relatively slighter loss of optimality when compared to deterministic solutions at nominal condition. Particularly, our computation results showed that proposed solution becomes more attractive as the realization taken by unknown demand growth factor increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
