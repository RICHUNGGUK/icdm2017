From this point of view, we construct a self-organization model using the spatiotemporal patterns, where Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) tunes the conduction delays between neurons. STDP forms more smoothed map with the spatially random and dispersed patterns, whereas it causes spatially distributed clustering patterns from spatially continuous and synchronous inputs. These results suggest that STDP forms highly synchronous cell assemblies changing through external stimuli to solve a binding problem.", "paper_title": "Self-organization through Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity using localized synfire-chain patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100006"}
