These transactions are not atomic and, in case of executions which cannot be completed, a compensation mechanism must be provided. In this paper we develop a model of Hierarchical Timed Automata suitable to describe the aspects mentioned. The automaton-theoretic approach allows the verification of properties by model checking. As a case study, we model and analyze an example of long-running transaction.", "paper_title": "Modeling long-running transactions with communicating hierarchical timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239478000010"}
