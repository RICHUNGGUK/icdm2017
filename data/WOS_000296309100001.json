The proposed technique also includes large sag and extensibility effects, and is based on an original finite difference scheme combined to a nonlinear least squares numerical solution. The mathematical formulation is developed for various loading cases, and an innovative computational strategy is used to transform the resulting nonlinear system of equations into a scaled nonlinear least squares problem. The numerical scheme is programmed and its application illustrated through examples highlighting the effects of coupling between the tension in a cable and the deformation of its cross-section as well as the use of cables made of neo-Hookean materials. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with analytical solutions when available. The proposed technique can be easily programmed and constitutes a valuable tool for large deflection analysis of suspended cables made of nonlinear elastic materials. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
