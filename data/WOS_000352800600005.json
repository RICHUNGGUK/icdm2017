The obtained equilibrium geometries, rotational constants, fundamental vibrational wave numbers, and centrifugal distortion constants are compared with the available experimental data or the previous theoretical values. The MP2/cc-pVQZ results of SiF2 are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and afford a marked improvement over B3LYP/cc-pVQZ and B3PW91/cc-pVQZ in the calculation of spectroscopic constants and force constants of SiF2. The basis set enhancement beyond cc-pVQZ does not lead to a major improvement so that the cc-pVQZ basis set is sufficient for SiF2. The MP2/cc-pVQZ results may provide useful data for the spectroscopic experiment studies of SiF2. The used DFT method is also an advisable choice to study anharmonic force field of SiF2.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of spectroscopic constants and anharmonic force field of SiF2", "paper_id": "WOS:000352800600005"}
