There are two control channels for controlling the magnitude and phase of the voltage. When this device is used for damping inter-area oscillations in multi-machine power systems, a damping stabilizer can be included in both channels. In this paper, a method for the simultaneous coordinated design of a Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and a SSSC-based stabilizer is presented using quadratic mathematical program-riming. In this method, the gain and phase of a lead-lag stabilizer can be simultaneously calculated. By this method the effect of the SSSC-based stabilizer in both control channels on damping inter-area oscillations has been assessed. Obtained results including eigenvalue analysis and non-linear simulations, on two multi-machine power systems under different operating conditions, show that the usage of a SSSC stabilizer in a suitable control channel can significantly reduce the control cost of the stabilizer.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Coordinated Tuning of SSSC-Based Stabilizer and PSS Using Quadratic Mathematical Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000287001400006"}
