In this article, we study answering range queries over uncertain data. Specifically, we are given a collection P of n uncertain points in R, each represented by its one-dimensional probability density function (pdf). The goal is to build a data structure on P such that, given a query interval I and a probability threshold tau, we can quickly report all points of P that lie in I with probability at least tau. We present various structures with linear or near-linear space and (poly) logarithmic query time. Our structures support pdf's that are either histograms or more complex ones such as Gaussian or piecewise algebraic.", "paper_title": "Range Searching on Uncertain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000309426300011"}
