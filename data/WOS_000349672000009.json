There exists a pressing need for an approach to accurately and uniquely capture the features without loss or destruction of the interactions amongst the modes (typically) of space, time, and frequency. Moreover, the approach must be able to quickly analyze the neural data of exponentially growing scales and sizes, in tens or even hundreds of channels, so that timely conclusions and decisions may be made. A salient approach to multi-way data analysis is the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) that manifests its effectiveness in the decomposition of the electroencephalography (EEG). However, the conventional PARAFAC is only suited for offline data analysis due to the high complexity, which computes to be O(n(2)) with the increasing data size. In this study, a large-scale PARAFAC method has been developed, which is supported by general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU). Comparing to the PARAFAC running on conventional CPU-based platform, the new approach dramatically excels by >360 times in run-time performance, and effectively scales by >400 times in all dimensions. Moreover, the proposed approach forms the basis of a model for the analysis of electrocochleography (ECoG) recordings obtained from epilepsy patients, which proves to be effective in the epilepsy state detection. The time evolutions of the proposed model are well correlated with the clinical observations. Moreover, the frequency signature is stable and high in the ictal phase. Furthermore, the spatial signature explicitly identifies the propagation of neural activities among various brain regions. The model supports real-time analysis of ECoG in >1; 000 channels on an inexpensive and available cyber-infrastructure.", "paper_title": "Fast and Scalable Multi-Way Analysis of Massive Neural Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000009"}
