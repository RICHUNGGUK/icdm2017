The social cost is the global maximum congestion over all edges in the network. We show that the price of stability is 1. The price of anarchy, PoA, is determined by topological properties of the network. In particular, PoA = O(l + log n), where l is the length of the longest path in the player strategy sets, and n is the size of the network. Further, kappa - 1 <= PoA <= c(kappa(2) + log(2) n). where kappa is the length of the longest cycle in the network, and c is a constant. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
