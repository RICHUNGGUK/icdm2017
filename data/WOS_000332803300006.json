However, since sensor nodes are battery powered, communication protocols and applications for these networks must be carefully designed in order to limit the power consumption. In this work, a new MAC protocol able to significantly reduce the power consumption and compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, is designed and validated. The defined protocol is based on an efficient setting of the node's duty cycle as a function of the transmission times of the neighbor nodes. In a duty cycle period, each node wakes up once to transmit and N times to receive, where N is the number of neighbors, while it remains in sleep mode for the rest of the time. The defined protocol has been validated through both an analytical and a simulative approach. By using the first approach, the proposed solution is compared with another energy-efficient protocol, namely AS-MAC; then, the differences between the simulated scenario and the analytical one are analyzed. By using the second approach (through Omnet++ simulator), we carried out a performance comparison between our protocol and the current MAC protocol compliant with the ZigBee standard. All the results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which has proved to be flexible and efficient, since it is able to provide high energy savings at different date rate, without a negative impact on the packets delivery.
