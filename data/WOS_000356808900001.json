A 2D periodic structure previously introduced by the same authors is dimensioned here for adjusting EBG parameters in view of meeting applications requirements by decreasing the phase velocity of the propagating waves. This adjustment corresponds to decreasing the lower bound of the EBG spectra. The positions of the EBGs' in frequency are determined through full-wave simulation, by solving the corresponding eigenmode equation and by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions on all faces of the unit cell. The operation of a device relying on a finite surface is also demonstrated. Obtained results show that the proposed structure fits for the signal integrity related applications as verified also by comparing the transmission along a finite structure of an ideal signal line and one with an induced discontinuity.", "paper_title": "Signal Integrity Applications of an EBG Surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000356808900001"}
