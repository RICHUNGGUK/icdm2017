Here, we develop a discrete approximate reconstruction algorithm. Our algorithm computes an image that has only grey values belonging to a given finite set. It also guarantees that the difference between the given projections and the projections of the reconstructed discrete image is bounded. The bound, which is computable, is independent of the image size. We present reconstruction experiments for a range of phantom images and a varying number of grey values.", "paper_title": "Approximate Discrete Reconstruction Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000322028300003"}
