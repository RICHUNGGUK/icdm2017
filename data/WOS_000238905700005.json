The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of 3D VizStruct, a novel multi-dimensional data visualization technique for analyzing patterns in SNP datasets. Results: VizStruct is an interactive visualization technique that reduces multi-dimensional data to two dimensions using the complex-valued harmonics of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). In the 3D VizStruct extension, the multi-dimensional SNP data vectors are reduced to three dimensions using a combination of the DFT and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The performance of 3D VizStruct was challenged with several biologically relevant published datasets that included human Chromosome 21, the human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene locus and the multi-locus genotypes of coral populations. In every case, the 3D VizStruct mapping provided an intuitive visual description of the key characteristics of the underlying multi-dimensional genotype.", "paper_title": "VizStruct for visualization of genome-wide SNP analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000238905700005"}
