State-of-the-art objective image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms are generally devised for specific distortion types or based on training procedure of large databases. In this work, we propose a general-purpose full-reference/no-reference (FR/NR) IQA framework for image distortions, nominated by Image Quality/Distortion Metric (IQDM). The leptokurtic and heavy-tailed behaviors of image wavelet coefficients are characterized by symmetric alpha-stable (S alpha S) density, and the statistical studies indicate that the model parameters may be altered because of the presence of distortion. This important priori knowledge of original image's distribution is then used to gauge the distortion between degraded and reference S alpha S models in multi-scale wavelet sub-bands. We investigate the relationship between original and degraded parameters over scales, accordingly infer the original parameters from the degraded ones. A characteristic probability density function for S alpha S and its closed-form Kullback-Leibler distance are derived for FR/NR-IQDM using the model parameters. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed FR/NR-IQDM scheme is efficacious to most common types of distortion, and leads to a highly comparable performance to the benchmarks and prevalent competitors in consistency with subjective judgements.
