The productivity heterogeneity leads to difference in component failure behaviour as well as in operational and replacement costs. Thus, the choice of load or productivity of components can greatly affect the system reliability and mission cost. To make the optimal choice of component loading, we first suggest a method for analysing the reliability and expected mission cost of 1-out-of-N: G non-repairable CS systems with heterogeneous components. The optimal dynamic load distribution problem is then formulated and solved, in which the component loading is chosen depending on the amount of work completed prior to the component activation. The optimal loading is aimed at minimizing the expected mission cost, while meeting a certain system reliability constraint. Examples are given to demonstrate the proposed methodology and the improvement in the optimal design solution through introducing the component productivity's dependence on the completed work.", "paper_title": "Optimal completed work dependent loading of components in cold standby systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351276000005"}
