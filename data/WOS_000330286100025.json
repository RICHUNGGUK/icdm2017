Each node begins with a subset of the desired packets and exchanges coded packets with its neighbors. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize the set of all transmission strategies that permit every node to ultimately learn (recover) all k packets. When the network satisfies certain regularity conditions and packets are randomly distributed, this paper provides tight concentration results on the number of transmissions required to achieve universal recovery. For the case of a fully connected network, a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal transmission strategy is derived. An application to secrecy generation is discussed.", "paper_title": "Coded Cooperative Data Exchange in Multihop Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330286100025"}
