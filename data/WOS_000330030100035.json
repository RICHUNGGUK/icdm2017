Since the first noticing of these types of diseases, many efforts have been made and researches performed in order to recognize them and find a cure for them. These disorders affect genes and they appear as abnormal traits in a genetic organism. In order to recognize abnormal genes, we need to predict splice sites in a DNA signal; then, we can process the genetic codes between two continuous splice sites and analyze the trait that it represents. In addition to abnormal genes and their consequent disorders, we can also identify other normal human traits like physical and mental features. So the primary issue here is to estimate splice sites precisely. In this paper, we have introduced two new methods in using neuro-fuzzy network and clustering for DNA splice site prediction. In this method, instead of using raw data and nucleotide sequence as an input to neural network, a survey on the first bunch of the nucleotide sequence of true and false categories of the input is carried out and training of the neuro-fuzzy network is achieved based on the similarities and dissimilarities of the selected sequences. In addition, sequences of the large input data are clustered into smaller categories to improve the prediction as they are really spliced based on different mechanisms. Experimental results show that these improvements have increased the recognition rate of the splice sites.", "paper_title": "Two new methods for DNA splice site prediction based on neuro-fuzzy network and clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100035"}
