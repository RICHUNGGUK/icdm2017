Visualization experience, proposed herein, reflects human sensations arising during the visualization process. It provides a basis in which to objectively measure and evaluate human participation in the visualization process; and thereby provides methods of control. Visualization experience modeling allows leveraging on the natural environment to augment understanding, therefore improve decision making. The application emphasis in this paper is on the theoretical development of visualization experience in the visualization process as applied to Ambient Assisted Living and Clinical Decision Support Systems.
