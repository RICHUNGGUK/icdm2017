This paper aims at tackling the two problems by studying an And-Or Tree (AoT) representation that consists of two parts: i) a geometry-AoT quantizing the geometry space, i.e. the possible compositions of 3D volumetric parts and 2D surfaces within the volumes; and ii) an appearance-AoT quantizing the appearance space, i.e. the appearance variations of those shapes in different views. In this AoT, an And-node decomposes an entity into constituent parts, and an Or-node represents alternative ways of decompositions. Thus it can express a combinatorial number of geometry and appearance configurations through small dictionaries of 3D shape primitives and 2D image primitives. In the quantized space, the problem of learning a 3D object template is transformed to a structure search problem which can be efficiently solved in a dynamic programming algorithm by maximizing the information gain. We focus on learning 3D car templates from the AoT and collect a new car dataset featuring more diverse views. The learned car templates integrate both the shape-based model and the appearance-based model to combine the benefits of both. In experiments, we show three aspects: 1) the AoT is more efficient than the frequently used octree method in space representation; 2) the learned 3D car template matches the state-of-the art performances on car detection and pose estimation in a public multi-view car dataset; and 3) in our new dataset, the learned 3D template solves the joint task of simultaneous object detection, pose/view estimation, and part localization. It can generalize over unseen views and performs better than the version 5 of the DPM model in terms of object detection and semantic part localization.", "paper_title": "Learning 3D Object Templates by Quantizing Geometry and Appearance Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000354377100006"}
