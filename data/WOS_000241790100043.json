This class of delayed differential systems includes Hopfield and Cellular neural networks with discontinuous activations as special cases. We prove that under some mild conditions, this system has a unique almost-periodic solution, which is globally exponential stable.", "paper_title": "Dynamical behaviors of a large class of delayed differential systems with discontinuous right-hand side", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100043"}
