Recently, the main study of these new architectures is limited to load balancing or improvement of architectures while the security study of DCN is still in its preliminary, especially for the vulnerability study. In our previous researches, we mainly concern about the invulnerability study from the protection of important nodes and vita edges. Differ from the previous one, in this paper; we engaged in the invulnerability studies from the perspective of network attack. Taking typical instances of DCN for example, based on invulnerability measurement of the average shortest path distance, we analysis the invulnerability of DCN by choosing deliberate attack and random attack. Experimental results show that for most architectures of DCN, the deliberate attacks of degree get the same result with the deliberate attacks of betweenness, especially, the deliberate attacks of degree are often harmful than betweenness attacks when attack a few nodes. However, from the perspective of random attacks, random attacks of betweenness are more harmful than degree attacks. The main contribution can be summarized as follows. We firstly engaged in the invulnerability research of DCN from the perspective of network attack and then conclude the network invulnerability of DCN by amount of experiments. The result in this paper can be widely used for the protection of DCN.", "paper_title": "The Invulnerability Studies on Data Center Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600017"}
