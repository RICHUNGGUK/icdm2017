If the paxtition of the vertices into probes and nonprobes is part of the input, then we call the graph a partitioned probe graph of G. We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing partitioned probe distance-hereditary graphs. By using a novel data structure for storing a multiset of sets of numbers, the running time of this algorithm is O(n(2)), where n, is the number of vertices of the input graph. We also show that the recognition of both partitioned and unpartitioned probe cographs can be done in O(n(2)) time.", "paper_title": "Recognition of probe cographs and partitioned probe distance hereditary graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600025"}
