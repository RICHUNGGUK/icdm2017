The codebook is designed with a feature of hierarchy, and can be organized into a binary tree, which makes the implementation of binary search possible. Meanwhile, based on the designed codebook, a suboptimal binary search like (BSL) algorithm is proposed for beamforming. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art search schemes, the proposed scheme dramatically decreases the search time.", "paper_title": "Suboptimal Beam Search Algorithm and Codebook Design for Millimeter-Wave Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350570600009"}
