One way to do this is to reduce the electric power consumption spent running the polyurethane foaming line in which a number of heavy foaming jigs are continuously circulating, by optimally designing the reinforcement structure of the jig. In this paper, topology optimization and parameter optimization utilizing the response surface method (RSM) are applied for the optimum design of the jig reinforcement structure, in order to minimize the total jig weight while securing the dimension precision of the foamed urethane case. Both the reliability of the approximated response surfaces and the validity of the proposed optimization procedure are verified through illustrative optimization experiments. In addition, it is confirmed that the proposed procedure provides us with an optimum reinforcement structure which remarkably reduces the total jig weight. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
