The main reason for the development of the program is to provide students with a useable tool for gaining an intuitive feel for power system transient and power quality problems. Emphasis was consistently laid on the development, validation and application of software for transient studies. To this end the primary focus of the research was the development of a generally oriented program in the form of a single module which is able to simulate any arbitrary configuration of power system in the time domain. Apart from the main program, sub-programs have been developed to derive the required data for transmission line, transformer, machine and other equipment parameters. A novel variety of trapezoidal integration (called trigonometric) has been used, it has accuracy and therefore speed advantages over ordinary trapezoidal integration. This method is compared with ordinary trapezoidal integration, backward Euler, Gear second order and Simpson. The comparison is based upon the error and the performance of each method as differentiator. At each step, the variables associated with the switches are checked and if any constraints are violated, the process backtracks to the time when the violation occurred and the node voltages and branch currents are calculated for this time instant. In order to reduce the simulation time the program accepts the branch currents and node voltages as initial conditions which allow the steady state to be reached in less time.
