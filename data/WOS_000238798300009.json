Aiming at being closer to cloth manufacturers needs, this work proposes an integration of a particle-based modelling approach within a CAD oriented system for real design of apparel and complex-shaped cloth. The particle-based model. originally defined oil single textile layers, is extended to take into account the physical effects of seams and darts. construction constraints. layered parts. and other manufacturing processes that contribute to the final shape of the garments. Starting front an initial 3D configuration of the particle grid consistent with mannequin and support geometries, the physical simulation process is then computed. based on constrained Newtonian dynamics laws. Stable and efficient algorithms for the time discretization of the Newtonian ODE problem are proposed, based on implicit and semi-implicit BDF(2) or hybrid Euler-BDF(2) techniques. As applications. several test models are considered, simulated on rigid supports or mannequins, for both numerical comparisons and global shape analysis. from simple cloth geometries up to complex-shaped models for real apparel manufacturing.
