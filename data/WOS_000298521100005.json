First, a novel global measure of stress is proposed, and the optimization problem is formulated to minimize the global measure of stress subject to a constraint of material volume. In order to solve this optimization problem, the level set method is employed. The finite element analysis is accomplished by modifying a fixed background mesh, and the artificial weak material that is conventionally used in the level set method to mimic void is avoided in the present work.
