We pose image registration as an optimization problem that uses knowledge of the sun's position to estimate shadows in a scene, and use the shadows produced as a cue to solve for the registration parameters. Results are presented on a controlled experiment and for a large scale model of an archaeological site in Sicily.", "paper_title": "Shadow based texture registration for 3D modeling of outdoor scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000246153200001"}
