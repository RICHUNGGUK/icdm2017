Adding a new embankment to an existing embankment induces additional stresses and deformations beneath the widened and existing portions of the embankment. Differential settlement may develop between and within the new and existing portions of the embankment, especially over soft soils. This differential settlement often causes pavement distress, such as longitudinal cracks or the drop-off (or sinking) of pavement sections. Different techniques have been adopted to remedy these problems, including the use of foundation columns, such as deep mixed columns, vibro-concrete columns, stone columns, and aggregate piers. However, design procedures for foundation columns constructed for this purpose are not well developed. The analyses of eight cases of column-supported widened embankments and two untreated foundations are presented in this paper. The factors considered include the consolidation of foundation soils under existing embankments and the spacing, region, and modulus of foundation columns. Two-dimensional finite difference software was used after the calibration of the model against a field case study and numerical analyses were conducted to investigate stresses and deformations of the widened embankments over soft soil with or without the remediation of foundation columns. The results presented in this paper include the vertical and the horizontal displacements, the maximum settlements, the transverse gradient change, and the distribution of the additional stresses induced by the widening. Recommendations are made for the design of foundation columns to remedy roadway pavement failure due to widening of embankments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
