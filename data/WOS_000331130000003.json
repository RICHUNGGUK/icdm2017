To uncover their structural design principles, the paper introduces a general class of memristive neural networks with time delays. Passivity analysis is conducted by constructing suitable Lyapunov functional. The analysis in the paper employs the results from the theories of nonsmooth analysis and linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed results. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
