In this paper, we propose ARC-H, an adaptive cache replacement algorithm for heterogeneous storage systems consisting of a hard disk and a NAND flash memory. ARC-H employs a dynamically adaptive management policy based on ghost buffers and takes account of recency, I/O cost per device, and workload patterns in making cache replacement decisions. Realistic trace-driven simulations show that ARC-H reduces service time by up to 88% compared with existing caching algorithms with a 20 Mb cache. ARC-H also reduces energy consumption by up to 81%.
