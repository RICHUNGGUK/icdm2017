In this paper, we find that, in addition to rectangular blocks, the 2-D DCT is also orthogonal in the trapezoid and triangular blocks. Therefore, instead of eight by eight blocks, we can generalize the JPEG algorithm and divide an image into trapezoid and triangular blocks according to the shapes of objects and achieve higher compression ratio. Compared with the existing shape adaptive compression algorithms, as we do not try to match the shape of each object exactly, the number of bytes used for encoding the edges can be less and the error caused from the high frequency component at the boundary can be avoided. The simulations show that, when the bit rate is fixed, our proposed algorithm can achieve higher PSNR than the JPEG algorithm and other shape adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, in addition to the 2-D DCT, we can also use our proposed method to generate the 2-D complete and orthogonal sine basis, Hartley basis, Walsh basis, and discrete polynomial basis in a trapezoid or a triangular block.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Orthogonal DCT Expansion in Trapezoid and Triangular Blocks and Modified JPEG Image Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000324382700019"}
