Visual function is a primary requirement for a human being to engage in computer usage efficiently. There are situations in which common forms of vision correction, such as contact lenses or glasses are not sufficient to provide the necessary compensation for some users to interact with graphic displays. This paper presents a model for the visual function of an imaging system, the implementation of an artificial eye with high-order wavefront aberrations, as well as a method for providing compensation of the artificial eye through a graphic display.", "paper_title": "HOWARD: High-order wavefront aberration regularized deconvolution for enhancing graphic displays for visually impaired computer users", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000168"}
