At the user level, it has been employed extensively to develop various analysis, bug-finding, and security tools. Such tools are currently not available for operating system (OS) binaries since no comprehensive DBT framework exists for the OS kernel. To address this problem, we have developed a DBT framework that runs as a Linux kernel module, based on the user-level DynamoRIO framework. Our approach is unique in that it controls all kernel execution, including interrupt and exception handlers and device drivers, enabling comprehensive instrumentation of the OS without imposing any overhead on user-level code. In this paper, we discuss the key challenges in designing and building an in-kernel DBT framework and how the design differs from user-space. We use our framework to build several sample instrumentations, including simple instruction counting as well as an implementation of shadow memory for the kernel. Using the shadow memory, we build a kernel stack overflow protection tool and a memory addressability checking tool. Qualitatively, the system is fast enough and stable enough to run the normal desktop workload of one of the authors for several weeks.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Kernel Instrumentation via Dynamic Binary Translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209339300012"}
