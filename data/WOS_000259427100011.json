Generally speaking, a workflow management system (WfMS) is composed of two primary components, a design environment and a run-time system. Structural, timing and resource verifications of a workflow specification are required to assure the correctness of the specified system. In this paper, an incremental methodology is constructed to analyze resource consistency and temporal constraints after each edit unit defined on a workflow specification. The methodology introduces several algorithms for general and temporal analyses. The output returned right away can improve the judgment and thus the speed and quality on designing.
