The method makes use of a procedure for identifying some components of the solution by bounding it with an interval vector. It is shown that the method computes an approximate solution of the variational inequality problem by solving at most n reduced systems of equations, where n is the dimension of the problem. Among those systems, only the one of the smallest dimension has to be solved with high accuracy. The others are solved merely to identify some components of the solution, and so the computation can be done under a very mild requirement of accuracy. Numerical results are presented for the obstacle problem, to illustrate the efficiency of the method.", "paper_title": "Components identification based method for box constrained variational inequality problems with almost linear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000261618700011"}
