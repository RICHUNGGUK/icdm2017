The uncertainty reduction however is not available through simple operations and easy interpretation. This research solves this problem by proposing an evidential weight based on preferences (EWP). The key technique of EWP is the integration of the roughness measures of an induction rule to reduce noises in doubts. The utilities composed of the derived weight from EWP are empirically used on World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 to analyze the benchmarking nations. This case study shows European welfare nations (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) focus on the long term strategic competitiveness while Asian tiger nations (Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan) are energetic on short term surviving competitiveness.
