It is well known that one can protect the network traffic against packet erasures by forward-error-correcting-codes (FEC). In addition to ensuring reliable delivery, FECs could substantially reduce the amount of feedback traffic, which is critical when designing high-performance AP protocols. In this work, we generalize the FEC-based schemes, also known as intra-flow coding schemes, for multiple downlink flows. In contrast with the classic approach that performs FEC separately on individual flows, we propose a new protocol MU-FEC, which incorporates the recent idea of inter-flow coding to further enhance the achievable throughput. Specifically, MU-FEC guarantees 100% reliability, is oblivious and robust to the underlying erasure probabilities, has near-optimal throughput higher than any existing inter-flow coding protocols, and can be practically implemented on top of 802.11. The design of MU-FEC consists of three components: batch-based operations, a systematic phase-based network coding decision policy, and smooth integration of inter-flow and intra-flow coding. We analytically show that MU-FEC can achieve much higher throughput than intra- or inter-flow coding alone, and validate its performance gain via extensive simulations. To our knowledge, MU-FEC is the first practical protocol that leverages both intra-flow and inter-flow network coding to solve a real-world problem in single-hop wireless networks.
