Based on the complex networks and SIR model, dynamical evolution equations were setup. Then methods used to evaluate the four indexes of bomb power were given, including influence breadth, influence strength, peak time and relaxation time. At last, the power of information was ascertained through these indexes. The process of information propagation is simulated to illustrate the spreading characteristics through the results. Then parameters which impact on the power of information bomb are analyzed and some methods which control the propagation of information are given.", "paper_title": "Influence analysis of information erupted on social networks based on SIR model", "paper_id": "WOS:000350338800007"}
