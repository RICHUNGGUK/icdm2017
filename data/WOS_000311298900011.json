Since it is hard to assemble scanned segments into complete models, traditional methods for object recognition and reconstruction would be inefficient. We present a search-classify approach which interleaves segmentation and classification in an iterative manner. Using a robust classifier we traverse the scene and gradually propagate classification information. We reinforce classification by a template fitting step which yields a scene reconstruction. We deform-to-fit templates to classified objects to resolve classification ambiguities. The resulting reconstruction is an approximation which captures the general scene arrangement. Our results demonstrate successful classification and reconstruction of cluttered indoor scenes, captured in just few minutes.", "paper_title": "A Search-Classify Approach for Cluttered Indoor Scene Understanding", "paper_id": "WOS:000311298900011"}
