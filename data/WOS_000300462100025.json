The studied methods include a linear and a nonlinear FEM-FCT scheme, simple upwinding, an ENO scheme of order 3, and a fifth order WENO scheme. Both finite element methods are combined with the Crank-Nicolson scheme and the finite difference discretizations are coupled with explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta methods. An assessment of the methods with respect to accuracy, size of under- and overshoots, and efficiency is presented, in the situation of a domain which is a tensor product of intervals and of uniform grids in time and space. Some comments to the aspects of adaptivity and more complicated domains are given. The obtained results lead to recommendations concerning the use of the methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
