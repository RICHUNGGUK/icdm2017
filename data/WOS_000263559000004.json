The design and implementation of the WONDER network aim to assess the effectiveness of optical technologies with respect to electronic ones, trying to identify an optimal mix of the two technologies. The architecture shows interesting resilience properties that enable the design of fast fault-recovery schemes. In this paper, we present the physical topology and node structure of the prototype, and discuss the implementation and performance of a fault-recovery algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
