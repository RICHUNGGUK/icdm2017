For a given abstract tree topology, we propose DLE-3D (deferred layer embedding for 3D ICs), which optimally finds the embedding layers of tree nodes, so that the TSV cost required for a tree topology is minimized, and DME-3D (deferred merge embedding for 3D ICs), which is an extended algorithm of the 2D merging segment, to minimize the total wirelength in 3D design space, with the consideration of the TSV effect on delay. In addition, when an abstract tree topology is not given, we propose NN-3D (nearest neighbor selection for 3D ICs), which constructs a (TSV and wirelength) cost-effective abstract tree topology for 3D ICs. Through experimentation, we have confirmed that the clock tree synthesis flow using the proposed algorithms is very effective, outperforming the existing 3D clock tree synthesis in terms of the number of TSVs, total wirelength, and clock power consumption.", "paper_title": "Clock Tree Synthesis for TSV-Based 3D IC Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000297137800012"}
