The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we overview and investigate the existence and computation of minimal fixed-points of multivalued mappings, whose domain is a complete lattice and whose range is its power set. Second, we show how these results are applied to a general form of logic programs, where the truth space is a complete lattice. We show that a multivalued operator can be defined whose fixed-points are in one-to-one correspondence with the models of the logic program.", "paper_title": "ON FIXED-POINTS OF MULTIVALUED FUNCTIONS ON COMPLETE LATTICES AND THEIR APPLICATION TO GENERALIZED LOGIC PROGRAMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208048500004"}
