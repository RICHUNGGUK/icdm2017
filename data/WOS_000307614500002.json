FONWebGPSS is an application that provides a web-based interface for creating, storing and executing discrete system simulation models in the GPSS language. The primary goal of the paper is to improve the process of learning simulation by integration of the FONWebGPSS in the existing e-learning system, Moodle. Evaluation of the developed integrated solution for learning simulation has been performed within an undergraduate course, Simulation and simulation languages, at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade on a testing sample of 208 students divided into an experimental and a control groups. The research results show that students achieve better results on the final test when using the FONWebGPSS application integrated into the e-learning system in comparison with the standard desktop version of the GPSS.
