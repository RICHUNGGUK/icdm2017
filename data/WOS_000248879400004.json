In this paper, the development and implementation of a multi-modal display system (MMDs) for tracing 2D boundaries in graphic images are discussed. A method is proposed that provides a type of haptic feedback designed to assist a user to trace the contours of objects seen in images. This method is an example of a family of haptic synthesis methods whereby the force field explored by the user is dynamic in the sense that it depends both on movement as well as on the object being haptically represented. The proposed performance-based method provides users with a movement guidance through an active haptic sense rather than common impedance technique. The tracing effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimentally. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
