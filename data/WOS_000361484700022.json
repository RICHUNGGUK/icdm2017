However, little effort has been devoted to the single-source KSP approaches. This paper proposes a novel single-source KSP algorithm in a given directed weighted graph where loops are allowed. The proposed method is designed to compute a set of shortest paths with exactly k distinctive lengths in a non-decreasing order. Meanwhile, it can also find all shortest paths with the length less than a given threshold. Inspired by water flowing principle, we imagine that there are waters flowing from a source node to each other node along edges at a constant speed. When the water reaches a node, the node will generate new waters flowing along its outgoing edges. By stepping back the traces of the water, the ordered shortest paths can be obtained. We also address the correctness and effectiveness of the method. Simulations are carried out using synthetic data and practical graph data, which demonstrate the considerable performance of the proposed approach especially for single-source KSP problems.", "paper_title": "Computing k shortest paths from a source node to each other node", "paper_id": "WOS:000361484700022"}
