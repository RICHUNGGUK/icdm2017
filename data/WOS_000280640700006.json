A computational study of comparative molecular fields analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) was performed, initially on each series of agonists, and subsequently on all compounds together, in order to identify the key structural features impacting their binding affinity. The final CoMSIA model resulted to be the more predictive, showing cross-validated r(2) (r(cv)(2)) = 0.680, non cross-validated r(2) (r(ncv)(2)) = 0.97 and test set r(2) (r(pred)(2)) = 0.93. The study provides useful suggestions for the design of new analogues with improved affinity.", "paper_title": "CoMFA and CoMSIA analyses on 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrrolo [3,4-b]indole and benzimidazole derivatives as selective CB2 receptor agonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000280640700006"}
