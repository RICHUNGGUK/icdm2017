The atoms in molecules (AIM) theory was also applied to verify covalent interactions in the H+ complexes and confirm that HB=BH ((3)Sigma(-)(g)) can be a weaker pi-electron donor than HB=BH ((1)Delta(g)), H2C=CH2 or HC=CH in the cation-pi interaction. Analyses of natural bond orbital (NBO) and electron density shifts revealed that the origin of the cation-pi interaction is mainly that many of the lost densities from the pi-orbital of B=B and CC multiple bonds are shifted toward the cations.", "paper_title": "A UB3LYP and UMP2 theoretical investigation on unusual cation-pi interaction between the triplet state HB=BH (3 Sigma(-)(g)) and H+, Li+, Na+, Be2+ or Mg2+", "paper_id": "WOS:000275122000002"}
