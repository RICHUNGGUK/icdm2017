Then, the gradient vector field can be estimated because the components of the gradient vector are the directional derivatives along the main axis of coordinates. A typical example is the estimation of the hydraulic gradient from head data in groundwater hydrology. The only inferential requirement is the covariance (or semi-variogram) from the measurements of the variable and any other necessary covariance or cross-covariance is obtained by linear systems theory. There is, then, the possibility of including direct measurements of the gradient (if available, and no matter how few) in the estimation of a directional derivative or in the estimation of the gradient field. This is therefore an application of kriging for estimating a vector field from scalars and where experimental vector values could be used in the estimation. The program implements a number of possibilities for estimating the gradient as described in the appropriate section. The program, written in Fortran, can be easily modified for particular needs if desired. A case study is provided to illustrate the performance and implementation of the program.
