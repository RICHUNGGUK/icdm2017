Focusing on nonasymptotic bounds on convergence rates, we show that if pairs of function values are available, algorithms for d-dimensional optimization that use gradient estimates based on random perturbations suffer a factor of at most root d in convergence rate over traditional stochastic gradient methods. We establish such results for both smooth and nonsmooth cases, sharpening previous analyses that suggested a worse dimension dependence, and extend our results to the case of multiple (m >= 2) evaluations. We complement our algorithmic development with information-theoretic lower bounds on the minimax convergence rate of such problems, establishing the sharpness of our achievable results up to constant (sometimes logarithmic) factors.", "paper_title": "Optimal Rates for Zero-Order Convex Optimization: The Power of Two Function Evaluations", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700036"}
