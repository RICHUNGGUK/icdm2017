To this end, we propose a number of modifications of the filter approach, which are well suited for our purposes. Then, we discuss possible ways of cooperation between the filter method and a PDE solver, and one of them is selected and tested.", "paper_title": "A MODIFIED FILTER SQP METHOD AS A TOOL FOR OPTIMAL CONTROL OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305834600006"}
