However, the mapping function usually does not consider the preservation of small dissimilarities as important, since the cost is small with respect to the preservation of large dissimilarities. As a consequence, an item's neighborhoods may be sacrificed for the benefit of the overall mapping. We have subsequently designed a mapping method devoted to the preservation of neighborhood ranks rather than their dissimilarities: RankVisu. A mapping of data is obtained in which neighborhood ranks are as close as possible according to the original space. A comparison with both metric and non-metric MDS highlights the pros (in particular, cluster enhancement) and cons of RankVisu. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
