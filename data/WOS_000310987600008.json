While recent communication technologies such as mobile and wireless combined with medical sensors have allowed new successful eHealth applications, another level of innovation is required to deliver scalable and cost-effective solutions via developing devices that operate and communicate directly inside the body. This work presents the application of nano technology for the development of miniaturized bio-nanosensors that are able to communicate and exchange information about sensed molecules or chemical compound concentration and therefore draw a global response in the case of health anomalies. Two communication techniques are reviewed: electromagnetic wireless communication in the terahertz band and molecular communication. The characteristics of these two modes of communication are highlighted, and a general architecture for bio-nanosensors is proposed along with examples of cooperation schemes. An implementation of the bio-nanosensor part of the nanomachine is presented along with some experimental results of sensing biomolecules. Finally, a general example of coordination among bio-nanomachines using both communication technologies is presented, and challenges in terms of communication protocols, data transmission, and coordination among nanomachines are discussed.", "paper_title": "ENABLING COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION IN BIO-NANOSENSOR NETWORKS: TOWARD INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310987600008"}
