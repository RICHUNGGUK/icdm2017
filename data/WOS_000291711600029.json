The main advantage of embedding messages in the representation domain is that the visual effect of the embedded models is identical to that of the original ones. In this paper, a vertex rearrangement scheme and a face rearrangement scheme for embedding messages are developed. After rearrangement, the secret messages are embedded in the new indices of vertices and faces of the host model. Moreover, the face rearrangement embedding scheme is integrated with a face formation type rearrangement scheme to increase embedding capacity. For a model with n vertices, the proposed method can yield an embedding capacity of approximately Sign bits per vertex. The bit-per-vertex (bpv) embedding capacity increases with the size of the mesh. The proposed method is robust against similarity transformations such as translation, rotation and uniform resizing. At last, a security enhancement algorithm is proposed to prevent malicious attackers retrieving the embedded information using a brute force method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is a high-capacity data-hiding approach without distortion.", "paper_title": "HIDING DATA IN TRIANGLE MESHES BY REARRANGING REPRESENTATION ORDER", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600029"}
