Two elements are believed to be important in constructing an ensemble: (a) the performance of each individual classifier; and (b) diversity among the classifiers. Nevertheless, most works based on diversity suggest that there exists only weak correlation between classifier performance and ensemble accuracy. We propose compound diversity functions which combine the diversities with the performance of each individual classifier, and show that there is a strong correlation between the proposed functions and ensemble accuracy. Calculation of the correlations with different ensemble creation methods, different problems and different classification algorithms on 0.624 million ensembles suggests that most compound diversity functions are better than traditional diversity measures. The population-based Genetic Algorithm was used to search for the best ensembles on a handwritten numerals recognition problem and to evaluate 42.24 million ensembles. The statistical results indicate that compound diversity functions perform better than traditional diversity measures, and are helpful in selecting the best ensembles.", "paper_title": "COMPOUND DIVERSITY FUNCTIONS FOR ENSEMBLE SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000267117500001"}
