Each agent could access the information with its neighbors under the directed network topology. A distributed dynamic state feedback control law is designed. A stability region is given for the discrete-time multi-agent systems, and internal model method is used for the robust output regulation problem. At last, numerical simulation is utilized to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
