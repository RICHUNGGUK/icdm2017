The main construction aspects of a mechanised excavation are modelled. Their influence on calculated ground displacements are investigated by means of a series of parametric analyses. With the aim of testing the performance of the proposed 3D numerical model, a series of 25 Class C predictions has been carried out. Case Histories related to the construction of the 1995-2003 Madrid Metro Extension Project were considered for this purpose. As a general rule, the results obtained with the Modified Cam-Clay model closely fit in situ measurements. When the Linear-Elastic or the Mohr-Coulomb models are used, it is not as easy to summarise the results obtained, as higher fluctuations are observed around in situ measured data. A good agreement is also shown when the distribution of horizontal displacements along depth is considered. For some sections, the mechanised excavation model is not capable of reproducing the high values of the surface settlements measured in situ. A closer look at the results shows that mixed face conditions are found for these cases, with the TBM excavating through layered soil formations having sharply different mechanical behaviour.
