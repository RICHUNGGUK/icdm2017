Applying Birkhoff's theorem, we prove that an arbitrary element of S-pq can be decomposed into a product of three permutations, the first and the third being elements of the Young subgroup S-p(q), whereas the second one is an element of the dual Young subgroup S-p(q). This leads to synthesis methods for arbitrary reversible logic circuits of logic width w. These circuits form a group isomorphic to S(2)w. A particularly efficient synthesis is found by choosing p = 2 and thus q = 2(w-1). The approach illustrates a direct link between combinatorics, group theory, and reversible computing.", "paper_title": "Young subgroups for reversible computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000256120100006"}
