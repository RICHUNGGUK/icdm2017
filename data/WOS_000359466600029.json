The first step of the proposed detection scheme finds another basis channel matrix H' which has good properties from the channel matrix H by using lattice-reduction algorithm. And QRD-M detection scheme using threshold algorithm is executed in the next step. Simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than the conventional QRD-M detection scheme at high SNR. Also, it reduces candidate symbols because of the threshold algorithm.", "paper_title": "Improved Detection Scheme Based on Lattice-Reduction and Threshold Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600029"}
