However, existing approaches rely on feedback ratings, which usually lead to the subjectivity and unfairness of reputation measure. The authors propose a reputation measure approach for web services. The approach employs three phases (i.e. feedback checking, feedback adjustment and malicious feedback detection) to enhance the reputation measure accuracy. A user survey form was first established to check the feedback ratings from these users who are lacking in feedback ability. Then the feedback ratings are adjusted with different user feedback preferences by calculating feedback similarity. Finally, the authors detect malicious feedback ratings by adopting cumulative sum method. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective and can greatly improve service selection process in service-oriented business applications.", "paper_title": "Reputation measure approach of web service for service selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000295621700005"}
