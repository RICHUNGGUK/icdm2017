It bridges an important abstraction gap for developing advanced fusion applications that takes into account the dynamic nature of applications and sensor networks. Elements of the DFuse architecture include a fusion API, a distributed role assignment algorithm that dynamically adapts the placement of the application task graph on the network, and an abstraction migration facility that aids such dynamic role assignment. Experimental evaluations show that the API has low overhead, and simulation results show that the role assignment algorithm significantly increases the network lifetime over static placement.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Data Fusion for Future Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205013000005"}
