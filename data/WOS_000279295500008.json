Quick and accurate tag estimation is very important to improve tag identification efficiency. In this paper, we propose a scalable and reliable zero estimation method with high estimate speed. We analyze the estimation scheme, evaluate the estimation error, and show that the time needed to estimate the number of tags is much less than schemes presented in related work. Theoretical and simulated results indicate that the proposed estimation algorithm can obtain a given accuracy within very short time duration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
