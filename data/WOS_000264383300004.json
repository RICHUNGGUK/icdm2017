The formulas are derived for the equivalent loss tangent and resistance of the arbitrary thick rectangular electrodes. An equivalent surface resistance is introduced for an arbitrary thick conductor. The accuracy, of the model is demonstrated by comparison with rigorous Sonnet simulation and available alternative approach. The formula for the resistance of electrically thick circular electrodes is obtained. The derived expressions are verified via comparison with rigorous HFSS (high frequency structure simulator) simulations using eigen-mode solver. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
