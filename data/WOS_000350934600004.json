Based on the recent success of Low-Rank Representation (LRR), we propose a novel image classification method for robust face recognition, named Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). Based on seeking the lowest-rank representation of a set of test samples with respect to a set of training samples, the algorithm has the natural discrimination to perform classification. We also propose a Kernel Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (KLRRC), which is a nonlinear extension of LRRC. KLRRC is firstly utilized to face recognition. By using the kernel tricks, we implicitly map the input data into the kernel feature space associated with a kernel function. We construct a transformation matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the kernel feature space, where LRRC is performed. Experimental results on several face data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
