We implemented an intelligent meta-search and recommendation system for products through consideration of multiple attributes by using ontology mapping and Web services. Under the assumption that each shopping site offers product ontology and product search service with Web services, we proposed a meta-search framework to configure a customer's search intent, make and dispatch proper queries to each shopping site, evaluate search results from shopping sites, and show the customer the relevant product list with associated rankings. Ontology mapping is used for generating proper queries for shopping sites that have different product categories. We also implemented our framework and performed empirical evaluation of our approach with two leading shopping sites in the world.", "paper_title": "Agent based intelligent search framework for product information using ontology mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000256311300002"}
