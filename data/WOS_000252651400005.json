Traders can use the software as an effective decision-making tool by modeling and simulating a power market. The software uses different features of a decision support system by creating a framework for assessing new trading strategies in a competitive electricity trading environment. The practicality of the software is confirmed by comparing its estimation accuracy with those of other methods (e.g., neural network and genetic algorithm). The software has been applied to a data set regarding the California electricity crisis in order to examine whether the learning (convergence) speed of traders is different between the two periods (before and during the crisis). Such an application confirms the validity of the proposed software. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
