REPENTINO wishes to minimize the problems developers face due to the limited availability of this type of lexical-semantic resources for Portuguese. The data stored in REPENTINO was mostly extracted from corpora and from the web using simple semi-automated methods. Currently, REPENTINO stores nearly 450k instances of named entities divided in more than 100 categories and subcategories covering a much wider set of domains than those usually included in traditional gazetteers. We will present some figures regarding the current content of the gazetteer and describe future work regarding the evaluation of this resource and its enrichment with additional information.", "paper_title": "REPENTINO - A wide-scope gazetteer for entity recognition in Portuguese", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800004"}
