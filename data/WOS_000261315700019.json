Design/methodology/approach - Using bio-inspired approach to investigate generic principle governing the formation of systems or artifacts by analogy with embryogenesis and using matrices and graphs to formalize design information. Findings - A six-stage design framework is proposed and represented as six models: the function model which interprets design requirements, the surrogate model which transforms the subjective intention into the objective property, the property model which illustrates basic constituents of property, the specification model which specifies abstract properties by concrete property values or equations, the feature model which transforms properties into the feature of topology and materials of the structure, and the parameter model which parameterizes the detail description of structure. The transformations between stages are achieved mainly by means of induction, duality, decision making and nonlinear programming. Research limitations/implications - Bio-inspired approach provides mechanisms to map function into structure. Practical implications - A normative framework for engineering design and system design. Originality/value - The framework distinguishes itself by biological approach, developmental process simulating to the development of embryo, induction and duality strategies to map, stages, as well as mathematical representation.", "paper_title": "Six-stage design framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700019"}
