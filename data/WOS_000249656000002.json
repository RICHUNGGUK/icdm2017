Not much is known for GS (3, 4, v, 2)s except for a recursive construction and two small designs for v = 8,10 given by Etzion. In this paper, more small designs are found by computer search and also given are direct constructions based on finite fields and rotational Steiner quadruple systems and recursive constructions using three-wise balanced designs. Some infinite families are also obtained.", "paper_title": "Constructions for generalized Steiner systems GS(3, 4, v, 2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000249656000002"}
