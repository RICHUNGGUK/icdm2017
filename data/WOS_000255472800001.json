The calculation of harmonic and transient wave propagation is based on a direct stiffness formulation that is introduced in a computer program Spectral and integrated as an external function in the Elastodynamics Toolbox. The learning environment contains pre- and postprocessing modules, an on-line user's manual and a set of documented examples where various aspects of seismic wave propagation are described and illustrated. The primary motivation for this work is to support a course on seismic wave propagation in layered media. The toolbox has also potential to be used in a research environment to compute the Green's functions of multilayered elastic media, which are needed in boundary element formulations to solve dynamic soil-structure interaction problems.
