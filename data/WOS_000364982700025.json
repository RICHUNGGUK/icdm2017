In this paper, an efficient, saliency analysis-based residential area extraction method is proposed. In the proposed model, an adaptive directional prediction-based lifting wavelet transform (ADP-LWT) is introduced to obtain the orientation feature. A logarithm co-occurrence histogram is employed to compute the intensity feature. The color opponency and diagram objection based on the information are proposed to extract color feature from the contrast in the red-green opponent channel. The saliency map is obtained through a weighted combination based on the feature competition and the residential area is extracted by saliency map threshold segmentation. The experimental results reveal that the residential area extracted by our model has more demarcated boundaries and better performance in background subtraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
