The presented framework optimizes lossless data compression in communications given the resource constraint of sensor nodes. The insights and analyses obtained from the framework can directly lead to innovative and better design of data gathering protocols for wireless sensor networks operated in noisy environments to dramatically reduce the energy consumptions.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Energy Consumptions in Wireless Sensor Networks via Two-Modal Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000273227000002"}
