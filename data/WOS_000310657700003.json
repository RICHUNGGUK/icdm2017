Similar to active shape models and active contours, a force field is used in our approach. But the object to be detected is described with a geometric shape, represented by parametric equations. Our model associates each parameter of this geometric shape with a combination of integrals (summations in the discrete case) of the force field along the contour. By iteratively updating the shape parameters according to these integrals, we are able to find the optimal fit of the shape in the image. In this paper, we first explore simple cases such as fitting a line, circle, ellipse or cubic spline contour using this approach. Then we employ this technique to detect the cross-sections of subarachnoid spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PC-MR) images, where the object of interest can be described by a distorted ellipse. The detection results can be further used by an s-t graph cut to generate a segmentation of the CSF structure. We demonstrate that, given a properly configured geometric shape model and force field, this approach is robust to noise and defects (disconnections and non-uniform contrast) in the image. By using a geometric shape model, this approach does not rely on large training datasets, and requires no manual labeling of the training images as is needed when using point distribution models.
