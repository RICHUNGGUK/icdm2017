The effect of droplet size spectra of incoming wet steam is also discussed. Numerical results of three-dimensional flow of wet steam in a turbine cascade show the effect of surface tension correction.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of transonic flow of wet steam in nozzles and turbines", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100018"}
