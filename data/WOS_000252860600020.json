In this paper, we present a theory how to combine the regularized 13-moment-equations derived from Boltzmann's equation with boundary conditions obtained from Maxwell's kinetic accommodation model. While for the linear case these kinetic boundary conditions suffice, we need additional conditions in the non-linear case. These are provided by the bulk solutions obtained after properly transforming the equations while keeping their asymptotic accuracy with respect to Boltzmann's equation. After finding a suitable set of boundary conditions and equations, a numerical method for generic shear flow problems is formulated. Several test simulations demonstrate the stable and oscillation-free performance of the new approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
