Single error correcting and double error detecting (SEC-DED) codes are generally used for this purpose. Such circuits are widely used in industry in all types of memory, including caches and embedded memory. In this paper, a new genetic design for ECC is proposed to perform SEC-DED in the memory check circuit. The design is aimed at finding the implementation of ECC which consumes minimal power. We formulate the ECC design into a permutable optimization problem and employ special genetic operators appropriate for this formulation. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A NEW GENETIC DESIGN FOR ERROR CORRECTING CODE FOR POWER MINIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264490800001"}
