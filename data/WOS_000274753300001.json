This article proposes a Low Power Self Scheduling protocol for mobile point source reconstruction. The motivation is clear, to provide high level QoS (reconstruction distortion) and reduce energy consumption. This article first obtains a distance to the event source, in which all sensing reports are collected to minimize the reconstruction distortion. This distance is relatively constant under different network densities. Then the mobility of the event source is considered. Sensor nodes are self-scheduled to join or leave the representative nodes group, which guarantee that those appropriate nodes will always be the group member. Simulation validates the effectiveness of the presented scheme.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Energy-Efficient Reconstruction of Mobile Point Source in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274753300001"}
