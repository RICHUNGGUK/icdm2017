In this paper we investigate the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions (functions invariant under some transitive group action). We prove a Omega(N-1/3) lower bound for the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions. We also construct a weakly symmetric function which has block sensitivity (O) over tilde (N-3/7).", "paper_title": "Block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800032"}
