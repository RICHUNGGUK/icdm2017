Li claimed that an eaves dropper Eve cannot prevent his existence from being found by participants. However, this study shows that the session key can be obtained by Eve without being detected.", "paper_title": "Security of \"asymmetrical quantum key distribution protocol\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000250954800002"}
