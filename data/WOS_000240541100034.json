It can verify the formal correctness of pages, i.e. mathematical papers expressed suitably. The present paper is an example of such a Logiweb page and the present paper is formally correct in the sense that it has been verified by Logiweb. The paper may of course contain informal errors like any other paper. Logiweb is neutral with respect to choice of logic and choice of notation and can support any kind of formal reasoning. Logiweb uses the World Wide Web to publish Logiweb pages and Logiweb pages can be viewed by ordinary Web browsers. Logiweb pages can reference definitions, lemmas, and proofs on previously referenced Logiweb pages across the Internet. When Logiweb verifies a Logiweb page, it takes all transitively referenced pages into account.", "paper_title": "Logiweb - A system for Web publication of mathematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240541100034"}
