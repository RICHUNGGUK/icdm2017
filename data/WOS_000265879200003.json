However, aggressive power assignment at non-leaf nodes, although conserving more energy, results in multicast trees that suffer from higher hop count and jeopardizes delay-sensitive applications, signifying a clear tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. This article formulates these issues as a constrained Steiner tree problem, and describes a distributed constrained Steiner tree algorithm, which jointly conserves energy and bounds delay for multicast routing in ad hoc networks. In particular, the proposed algorithm concurrently constructs a constrained Steiner tree, performs transmission power assignment at non-leaf nodes, and strives to minimize the sum of transmission power of non-leaf nodes, subject to the given maximum hop count constraint. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and reveal the characteristics of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Ant-Based Distributed Constrained Steiner Tree Algorithm for Jointly Conserving Energy and Bounding Delay in Ad Hoc Multicast Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000265879200003"}
