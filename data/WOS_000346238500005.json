The perpendicularity of the hole has an important influence on the quality of airplane assembly. Aiming at the robot drilling perpendicularity, a micro-adjusting attitude mechanism and a surface normal measurement algorithm are proposed in this paper. In the mechanism, two rounded eccentric discs are used and the small one is embedded in the big one, which makes the drill's point static when adjusting the drill's attitude. Thus, removal of drill's point position after adjusting the drill attitude can be avoided. Before the micro-adjusting progress, four non-coplanar points in space are used to determine a unique sphere. The normal at the drilling point is measured by four laser ranging sensors. The adjusting angles at which the motors should be rotated to adjust attitude can be calculated by using the deviation between the normal and the drill axis. Finally, the motors will drive the two eccentric discs to achieve micro-adjusting progress. Experiments on drilling robot system and the results demonstrate that the adjusting mechanism and the algorithm for surface normal measurement are effective with high accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "A micro-adjusting attitude mechanism for autonomous drilling robot end-effector", "paper_id": "WOS:000346238500005"}
