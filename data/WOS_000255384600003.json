The necessary procedures of using semantic patterns in a QA system are also presented, which include question structure analysis, pattern matching, pattern generation, pattern classification and answer extraction. Both the manual creation method and the automatic generation method are proposed for patterns for different applications. A pattern instantiation level metrics is also presented for the predication of the quality of generated or learned patterns. We implemented a user interface for using the semantic pattern in our QA system, which allows users to effectively post and answer questions.
