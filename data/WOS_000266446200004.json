It was previously conjectured that the conservation laws in 1D Rectangular RCA can be described as linear combinations of independent constant-speed flows to the right or to the left. This is indeed the case; so is a similar statement about a more general class of Rectangular RCA in any dimension.", "paper_title": "Conservation Laws in Rectangular CA", "paper_id": "WOS:000266446200004"}
