In this perspective, this article presents the automatic computation of DC operating point and the generation of suitable design plans for analog IPs. The analog IP is built as a hierarchy of subcircuits inside our dedicated framework CAIRO+. Leaf subcircuits are known as devices and higher-level subcircuits are known as modules. Each subcircuit is represented by a dependency graph. The dependency graph expresses electrical dependencies of circuit parameters on a selected set of design parameters. The dependency graph of the analog IP is constructed, in a hierarchical bottom-up approach, by merging graphs of children devices and modules. The graph is converted to a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by detecting and removing existing directed cycles. The resulting DAG is the design plan for the analog IP. Upon construction, the DAG is executed, in a top-down approach, to compute the DC operating point and the dimensions of the transistors. The computed DC operating point is compared to a DC simulation to ensure its correctness. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to size and bias two analog IPs: a single-ended two-stage operational amplifier and a differential cascode current-mode integrator. The results prove the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Automatic DC operating point computation and design plan generation for analog IPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788200011"}
