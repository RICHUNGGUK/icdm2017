We generalize it into the spanning kappa-tree forest problem,which is to find a maximum spanning forest in which each tree component has a central vertex and other vertices in the component have distance at most kappa away from the central vertex. We show that this new problem can be approximated with ratio 1 - 1/kappa+1 in polynomial time for both undirected and directed graphs. In the weighted distance model, a 1/2-approximation algorithm is presented for it.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATING THE SPANNING kappa-TREE FOREST PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000314423000010"}
