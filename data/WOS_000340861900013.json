Interactions between ligand, receptor, and solvent molecules have to be described precisely, and a large number of conformational microstates has to be sampled, particularly for ligand binding to a flexible protein. Linear interaction energy models are computationally efficient methods that have found considerable success in the prediction of binding free energies. Here, we parametrize a linear interaction model for implicit solvation with coefficients adapted by ligand and binding site relative polarities in order to predict ligand binding free energies. Results obtained for a diverse series of ligands suggest that the model has good predictive power and transferability. We also apply implicit ligand theory and propose approximations to average contributions of multiple ligand-receptor poses built from a protein conformational ensemble and find that exponential averages require proper energy discrimination between plausible binding poses and false-positives (i.e., decoys). The linear interaction model and the averaging procedures presented can be applied independently of each other and of the method used to obtain the receptor structural representation.", "paper_title": "Ligand-Receptor Affinities Computed by an Adapted Linear Interaction Model for Continuum Electrostatics and by Protein Conformational Averaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000340861900013"}
