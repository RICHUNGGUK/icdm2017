This paper gives a method for finding the linear approximations of SMS4. With this method, 19-round one-dimensional approximations are given, which are used to improve the previous linear cryptanalysis of SMS4. The 19-round approximations hold with bias 2(-62.27); we use one of them to leverage a linear attack on 23-round SMS4. Our attack improves the previous 23-round attacks by reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, the data complexity of our attack is further improved by the multidimensional linear approach.", "paper_title": "Improved Linear Attacks on the Chinese Block Cipher Standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000345382500016"}
