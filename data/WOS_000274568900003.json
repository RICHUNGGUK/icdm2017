We set out to provide patient-specific Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based clinical summaries for providers taking care of HIV-positive adult patients in the resource-limited setting of Mbarara, Uganda. Methods: We evaluated the impact of implementing these clinical summaries using time-motion techniques and provider surveys. Results: After implementation of EMR-based clinical summaries, providers spent more time in direct care of patients (2.9 min vs. 2.3 min, p < 0.001), and the length of patient visits was reduced by 11.5 min. Survey respondents indicated that clinical summaries improved care, reduced mistakes, and were generally accurate. Current antiretroviral medication, patient identifying information, adherence information, current medication, and current medical problems were among the highest-rated elements of the summary. Conclusions: By taking advantage of data stored in EMRs, efficiency and quality of care can be improved through clinical summaries, even in settings with limited resources.
