The problem is to use the frequencies efficiently, i.e., minimize the span of frequencies used. The frequency allocation problem can be regarded as a multicoloring problem on a weighted hexagonal graph. In this paper, we give a 1-local asymptotic 4/3-competitive distributed algorithm for multicoloring a triangle-free hexagonal graph, which is a special case of hexagonal graph. Based on this result, we then propose a 1-local asymptotic13/9-competitive algorithm for multicoloring the (general-case) hexagonal graph, thereby improving the previous 1-local 3/2-competitive algorithm.", "paper_title": "A 1-Local Asymptotic 13/9-Competitive Algorithm for Multicoloring Hexagonal Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265880400007"}
