The usual way of managing consistent data replicas between distributed sites is to periodically update the remotely located data replicas. However, this method doesn't guarantee the replica consistency in such a case that remote clients who retain the replicas irregularly update or modify their replicas. In this paper, we introduce two kinds of data replication techniques, called owner-initiated data replication and client-initiated data replication, that are developed to support data replica consistency without requiring any special file system-level locking functions. Also, we present performance results on Linux clusters located at Sejong University.", "paper_title": "The replica management for wide-area distributed computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400021"}
