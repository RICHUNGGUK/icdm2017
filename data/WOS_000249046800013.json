The formulation employs the geometrically exact Reissner planar beam theory which accounts for finite displacements and rotations, and finite membrane, shear and bending strains. The system of semi-discrete dynamic equations of motion is derived from the modified Hamilton principle in which only the strain variables are interpolated. Such a choice of the interpolated variables is an advantage over approaches, in which the displacements and rotations are interpolated, since the field consistency problem and related locking phenomena do not arise. The performance and accuracy of the formulation are illustrated by several numerical examples. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
