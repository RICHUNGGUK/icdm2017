In this study, the function of the standard control plane of the automatically switched optical network is enhanced to perceive transmission impairments and control tunable physical impairment compensators in the physical layer. The QoT optimization model and algorithm are also developed to make a set of joint compensation budgets, and the compensator performance is adjusted dynamically according to these budgets. Thus end-to-end QoT optimization can be realized on the fly. Simulation results indicate that dynamic end-to-end QoT optimization can implement smooth distribution of signal quality and acceptable transmission performance. Simultaneously, compared with the case of separate compensation by using individual adaptive impairment compensators along the route, end-to-end QoT optimization can also avoid unnecessary compensator adjustments and can lower operating expenditures.
