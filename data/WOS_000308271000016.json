For degraded document images, adaptive binarization methods often incorporate local information to determine the binarization threshold for each individual pixel in the document image. We propose a two-stage parameter-free window-based method to binarize the degraded document images. In the first stage, an incremental scheme is used to determine a proper window size beyond which no substantial increase in the local variation of pixel intensities is observed. In the second stage, based on the determined window size, a noise-suppressing scheme delivers the final binarized image by contrasting two binarized images which are produced by two adaptive thresholding schemes which incorporate the local mean gray and gradient values. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive when compared to the existing adaptive binarization methods and achieves better performance in precision, accuracy, and F-measure.
