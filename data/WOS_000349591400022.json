The machine suffers unexpected breakdowns and follows the Weibull failure function. A joint model for integrating run-based preventive maintenance (PM) into the production scheduling problem is proposed, in which the sequence of jobs, the PM times and the planned completion times of jobs are proactively determined simultaneously. Aiming at optimizing the bi-objective of system robustness and stability, a genetic algorithm based on the properties of the optimal schedule is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective under practical problem sizes. In addition, the impact of degree of uncertainty on the performance and the tradeoff between robustness and stability are explored in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
