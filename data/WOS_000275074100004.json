Arrows arc classically defined by extending lambda calculus With three constructs satisfying nine (somewhat idiosyncratic) laws; in contrast, the arrow Calculus adds four constructs satisfying five laws (which fit two well-known patterns). The five laws were previous]), known to be sound; we show that they are also complete, and hence that the five laws may replace the nine.", "paper_title": "The arrow calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000275074100004"}
