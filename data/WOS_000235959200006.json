The major current service registry specifications, UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration), has the following drawbacks. First, it replicates all public service publications in all UBR (Universal Business Registry) nodes, which is not scalable and efficient, and second, it collects service information in a passive manner, which means it waits for service publication, updating or discovery request passively and thus cannot guarantee the real-time validity of the services information. In this paper, we propose an active and distributed UDDI architecture called Ad-UDDI, which extends and organizes the private or semi-private UDDIs based on industry classifications. Further, Ad-UDDI adopts an active monitoring mechanism, so that service information can be updated automatically and the service requestors may find the latest service information conveniently. We evaluate Ad-UDDI by comprehensive simulations and experimental results show that it outperforms existing approaches significantly.", "paper_title": "Ad-UDDI: An active and distributed service registry", "paper_id": "WOS:000235959200006"}
