The individual processes operate on unbounded local variables ranging over the natural numbers. In addition, processes may communicate via broadcast, rendez-vous and shared variables. The procedure operates on an over-approximation of the transition system induced by the parameterized system. We verify mutual exclusion for complex protocols such as atomic, non-atomic and distributed versions of Lamport's bakery algorithm.", "paper_title": "Approximated parameterized verification of infinite-state processes with global conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000263683200003"}
