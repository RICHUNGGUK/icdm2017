The importance of this problem stems from the decreasing size of periodic structures in photonic devices, together with an increasing demand in fast non-destructive testing. This demand makes qualitative inverse scattering techniques particularly attractive since they do not use time consuming optimization techniques for reconstruction but rather directly transform measured data into a picture of the scattering object. We present the Factorization method as an algorithm for imaging of a special class of periodic dielectric structures known as diffraction gratings. Our sampling method computes a picture of the shape of the periodic structure from measured near-field data in a rapid way. We provide numerical examples illustrating this imaging technique.", "paper_title": "Imaging of periodic dielectrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000274956300005"}
