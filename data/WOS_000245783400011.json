Various attempts have been made successfully in the area of music composition. Artificial intelligence methods have been extensively applied in this area. Representation of musical pieces in a computer-understand able form plays an important role in computer aided music research. This paper presents a neural network-based knowledge representation schema for representing notes, melodies, and time in first species counterpoint pieces. A musical note is composed of pitch and duration in this representation schema. The proposed representation technique was tested using the back-propagation algorithm to generate two-voice counterpoint pieces. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
