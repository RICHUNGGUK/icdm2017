In this paper, we focus on the simulation in the random unstructured P2P network. The correlation between topology and search algorithm is less paid attention to in unstructured P2P network, current techniques used in existing unstructured P2P system are often very inefficient because of the existence of large number of redundant messages. In this paper, we analyze the reason of engendering redundant data packet and focus on designing better search algorithm to adapt to the current network rather than to design the universal algorithm to adapt to a variety of network. Analyzing the characteristics that the flooding algorithm showing in different search stages in different network, we put forward the segment search algorithm. Furthermore, we present an effective simulation method in the random unstructured P2P network. Through simulation analysis, we find that our algorithm is better than the original flooding algorithm. In addition, we design our algorithm to be simple as a module, which can be easily applied to existing unstructured P2P systems for immediate impact. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
