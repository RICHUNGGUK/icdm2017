An enhancement to this system, named pulsed-OFDM, has been proposed to reduce the complexity and power consumption of the transceiver without sacrificing performance. In this paper, we describe a detailed implementation of a pulsed-OFDM transceiver. The main focus of the paper is designing each section with maximum power saving and minimum complexity. Specially we design each section such that each part of the pulsed-OFDM transceiver has less or equal complexity and power consumption than the corresponding part in the original multi-band OFDM transceiver. Different options to implement encoder and decoder as well as modulator and demodulator (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform) are examined. We also present the simulation results to choose appropriate resolution for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADC and DAC). Finally we investigate the effect of fixed point arithmetic in calculating FFTs and required resolution using simulation results.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a multi-band pulsed-OFDM transceiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000237361700006"}
