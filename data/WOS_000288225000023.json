In this paper, we describe practical machine learning approaches for identifying MEDLINE documents and Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL protein records, for incorporation into a specialized biological database of transport proteins named TCDB. We show that both learning approaches outperform rules created by hand by a human expert. As one of the first case studies involving two different approaches to updating a deployed database, both the methods compared and the results will be of interest to curators of many specialized databases.", "paper_title": "Identifying Relevant Data for a Biological Database: Handcrafted Rules versus Machine Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000288225000023"}
