It is necessary for a data center with a scalability property of which each expansion of a data center network is done with a few modifications. Besides the scalability property, we also need a data center to have good performance, such as high throughput. For these purposes, we propose Decluster, a complex network model-based data center network topology. The complex network model of Decluster is derived from a random network. Such a model just satisfies the requirement of scalability. Decluster employs a complex network model to achieve high throughput via reducing the variance of local clustering coefficients. We have carried out extensive simulations to demonstrate that Decluster enjoys good performance while keeping scalability.", "paper_title": "Decluster: a complex network model-based data center network topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000344813000019"}
