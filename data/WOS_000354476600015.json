Narrative inquiry was used as a research method, allowing two focus groupsone composed of teens and the other of undergraduate studentsto map out 4 cyberbullying stories. Each cyberbullying story revealed 2 subplotsthe story that is (as perceived by these participants) and the story that could be (if the participants' design recommendations were embedded in social media). The study resulted in a user-generated framework for designing affordances on social media sites to counter acts of cyberbullying. Seven emergent design themes are evident in the participants' cyberbullying narratives: design for hesitation, design for consequence, design for empathy, design for personal empowerment, design for fear, design for attention, and design for control and suppression. We conclude with a typological analysis of the values present in the participants' design recommendations, applying Cheng and Fleischman's values framework (2010).", "paper_title": "From cyberbullying to well-being: A narrative-based participatory approach to values-oriented design for social media", "paper_id": "WOS:000354476600015"}
