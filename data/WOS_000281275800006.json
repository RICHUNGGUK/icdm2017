Simulations of fully developed turbulent flow in a square duct show that the proposed test filter gives the results of similar accuracy to the best modern filters developed for non-uniform orthogonal grids, but a second-order correction is required to produce solutions of sufficient accuracy. The discrete filter technique is also used to simulate stationary and pulsatile turbulent flow in a 75% constricted tube, in which the flow undergoes transition to turbulence. Comparisons to previous published results confirm that the results obtained using the proposed discrete test filter are in a good agreement with the existing experimental and numerical results.
