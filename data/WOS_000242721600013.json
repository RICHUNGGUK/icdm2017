Since mobile devices have limited energy capacities associated with their reliance on battery power, it is important to minimize the time and energy spent on accessing broadcast data. The indexing and scheduling of broadcast data play a key. role in this problem. In this paper, we formulate the index and data allocation problem and propose a solution that can adapt to any number of broadcast channels. We first restrict the considered problem to a scenario with no index/data replication, and introduce an optimal solution and a heuristic solution to the single-channel and multichannel cases, respectively. Then, we discuss how to replicate indexes on the allocation to further improve the performance. The results from some experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.
