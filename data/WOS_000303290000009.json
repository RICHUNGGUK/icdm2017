While an online social network can be attractive for many socially interesting features, its competitive edge will diminish if it is not able to keep pace with increasing user activities. Deploying more servers is an intuitive way to make the system scale, but for the best performance one needs to determine where best to put the data, whether replication is needed, and, if so, how. This paper is focused on replication; specifically, we propose S-CLONE, a socially-aware data replication scheme which can significantly improve a social network's efficiency by taking into account social relationships of its data. S-CLONE's performance is substantiated in our evaluation study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
