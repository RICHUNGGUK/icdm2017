This class includes a number of location/routing problems; it also includes a problem in which we are given as input a parameter , and want to find a forest such that each component has at least vertices. Goemans and Williamson gave a 2-approximation algorithm for this class of problems. We give an improved 3/2-approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "A 3/2-approximation algorithm for some minimum-cost graph problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351228300003"}
