Traditional exercises to improve procedures interoperability and harmonization between agencies are complex and expensive. Research on command and control systems specifically designed for emergency management and on virtual reality use leads towards enhancing real world applications' capabilities, facilitating management and optimizing resource usage. This paper proposes a new architecture for a training system based on the interconnection between real and virtual worlds extending the MPEG-V standard; allowing real and virtual units' simultaneous and real-time training using commercial off-the-shelf equipment, and including a novel subsystem for video management from both real and virtual sources.
