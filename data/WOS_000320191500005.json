For such nonlinear descriptor systems, novel sufficient conditions of PS and FTS are established. When the descriptor systems follow the proposed theorems, PS and FTS can be obtained alternatively. Meanwhile, with linear matrix inequalities used, we devise practical and finite-time adaptive controllers for fuzzy descriptor systems, partially based on the parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) and non-PDC. Furthermore, numerical examples on feasible region and controllers applied to inverted pendulum model are presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Practical and finite-time fuzzy adaptive control for nonlinear descriptor systems with uncertainties of unknown bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500005"}
