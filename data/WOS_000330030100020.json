In this paper, an enhanced fuzzy C-means algorithm, specifically the modified point symmetry-based fuzzy C-means algorithm (MPSDFCM), was proposed, in order to determine the optimal initial locations for the translation vectors. The proposed neural network models were then employed in approximating five different nonlinear continuous functions. Assessment analysis showed that integration of the MPSDFCM in the learning phase of WNNs would lead to a significant improvement in WNNs prediction accuracy. Performance comparison with the approaches reported in the literature in approximating the same benchmark piecewise function verified the superiority of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Design of wavelet neural networks based on symmetry fuzzy C-means for function approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100020"}
