Combining these information sources provides complementary information. Significant geometric lines such as occluding contours and suggestive contours are extracted from the range data, while textured areas corresponding to shading features are extracted from the photograph. These are combined, and then distorted to produce the final caricature. The final output may be produced using a choice of non-photorealistic rendering styles. Our system method works well for low resolution range images; for these it is fast enough to allow the viewpoint to be chosen in real time. The final output combines significant lines, textured areas, and optional shading, giving a pleasing result which preserves not only the shape cues of the geometric description, but also other essential visual characteristics of the facial image that cannot be deduced from geometry alone.", "paper_title": "Portrait drawing from corresponding range and intensity images", "paper_id": "WOS:000321971400007"}
