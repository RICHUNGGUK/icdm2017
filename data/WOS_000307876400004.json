This construction has a strict requirement for its initial functions. In this paper, we first concentrate on the design of the initial functions in the Rothaus construction. We show how to construct Maiorana-McFarland's (M-M) bent functions, which can then be used as initial functions, from Boolean permutations and orthomorphic permutations. We deduce that at least (2(n)! x 2(2n))(2(2n) x 2(2n-1))(2) bent functions in 2n + 2 variables can be constructed by using Rothaus' construction. In the second part of the note, we present a new secondary construction of bent functions which generalizes the Rothaus construction. This construction requires initial functions with stronger conditions; we give examples of functions satisfying them. Further, we generalize the new secondary construction of bent functions and illustrate it with examples.", "paper_title": "SECONDARY CONSTRUCTIONS OF BENT FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000307876400004"}
