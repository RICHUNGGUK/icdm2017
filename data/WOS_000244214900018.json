For random binary search trees of size n we study (i) the difference between the left and the right depth of a randomly chosen node, (ii) the difference between the left and the right depth of a specified node j = j (n), and (ii i) the difference between the left and the right pathlength, and show for all three imbalance measures limiting distribution results.
