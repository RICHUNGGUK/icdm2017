In the present paper, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a fuzzy relation being inverted perpendicular-Euclidean are investigated in three different fuzzy rough approximation spaces. Meanwhile, it is proved that in (I, inverted perpendicular)-fuzzy rough approximation space, where I is an R-implication, the properties the inverted perpendicular-Euclidean (I, inverted perpendicular)-fuzzy rough approximation operators possess are just the same as those in rough fuzzy approximation space.
