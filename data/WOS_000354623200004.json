Therefore, the optimal resource utilization is a crucial consideration for efficient architectural designs. This paper studies the practicality of the Constraint Programming (CP) models for NoC architecture designs that effectively use a regular mesh with wormhole switching and the XY routing. The complexity of the CP models is compared with the earlier Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models. Practical CP-based mapping and scheduling models are developed and results are reported on the benchmark datasets. Results indicate that mapping and scheduling problems can be solved at near optimality even under relatively shorter run-time limits as compared to those required by the MIP models.", "paper_title": "Using constraint programming for the design of network-on-chip architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000354623200004"}
