The polar-space kinematic model of the platform with three independent driving omnidirectional wheels equally spaced at 120 from one another is briefly introduced, and the dynamic models of the three uncertain servomotors mounted on the driving wheels are also described. With the platform's kinematic model and the motors' dynamic model associated two unknown parameters, the adaptive robust controller is synthesized via the integral backstepping approach. Computer simulations and experimental results are conducted to show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control method in comparison with a conventional PI feedback control method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive robust control of an omnidirectional mobile platform for autonomous service robots in polar coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000254106500003"}
