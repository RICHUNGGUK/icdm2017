Each application is designed with an increasing level of difficulty, designed to increase the students' concentration and train their spatial perception. In order to foment a degree of competition among the users and motivate them to try to improve the result achieved in each exercise, a scoring system was implemented, showing the best score obtained both by the user and in the class as a whole. Macromedia Flash tools were used to develop the applications, as these allow the generation of Web-viewable applications of a very small size. In this way, we were able to develop applications accessible to the students and that do not entail any very demanding minimum requirements. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
