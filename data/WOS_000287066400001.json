Modeling of each component, implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, is briefly presented. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) FC and Ni-MH battery models are designed from commercial available components. Two control strategies are presented and tested for the energy management of the hybrid system: cascade and fuzzy logic. The objective of both strategies is to manage the primary (PEM FC) and secondary (battery) energy source to supply the power requirements of the tramway forcing the FC to work around its maximum efficiency point and maintaining the battery state of charge (SOC) in a desired level.
