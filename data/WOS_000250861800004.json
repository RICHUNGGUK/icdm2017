We present a preliminary study of two-input one-dimensional cellular automation rules called eventually number-conserving cellular automation rules whose limit sets, reached after a number of time steps of the order of the cellular automation size, consist of states having a constant number of active sites. In particular, we show how to find rules having given limit sets satisfying a conservation rule. Viewed as models of systems of interacting particles, these rules obey a kind of Darwinian principle by iether annihilating unnecessary particles or creating necessary ones.", "paper_title": "Eventually number-conserving cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000250861800004"}
