The decidability of safety and inevitability properties is shown via the introduction of a priority embedding,a well-quasi-ordering that has not previously been used in well-structured systems. We then show how Priority Channel Systems can compute fast-growing functions and prove that the aforementioned veri fi cation problems are F-epsilon 0-complete.", "paper_title": "THE POWER OF PRIORITY CHANNEL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900003"}
