We applied this model to simulate natural convection heat transfer in a horizontal concentric annulus bounded by two stationary cylinders with different temperatures. Velocity and temperature distributions as well as Nusselt numbers were obtained for the Rayleigh numbers ranging from 2.38 x 10(3) to 1.02 x 10(5) with the Prandtl number around 0.718. It is found that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results reported in the literature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
