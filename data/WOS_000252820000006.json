Our approach is based on a computational complexity rate-distortion (C-R-D) analysis, which adds a complexity dimension to the conventional rate-distortion (R-D) analysis. Both theoretically and experimentally, we prove that by implementing the proposed approach for the dynamic allocation better results are achieved. We also prove that the optimal computational complexity allocation along with optimal bit allocation is better than the constant computational complexity allocation along with optimal bit allocation. In addition, we present a method and system for implementing the proposed approach, and for controlling computational complexity and bit allocation in real-time and off-line video coding. We divide each frame into one or more basic units, wherein each basic unit consists of at least one macroblock (MB), whose contents are related to a number of coding modes. We determine how much computational complexity and bits should be allocated for encoding each basic unit, and then allocate a corresponding group of coding modes and a quantization step-size, according to the estimated distortion (calculated by a linear regression model) of each basic unit and according to the remaining computational complexity and bits for encoding remaining basic units. For allocating the corresponding group of coding modes and the quantization step-size, we develop computational complexity-complexity step-rate (C-I-R) and rate-quantization step-size-computational complexity (R-Q-C) models.
