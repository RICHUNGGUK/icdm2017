In [1], an algorithm which performs four of these filling operations has a time complexity of O(N-2 log N), where N is the size of projections, and leads to a reconstruction algorithm for convex polyominoes running in O(N-6 log N)-time. In this paper we first improve the implementation of these four filling operations to a time complexity of O(N 2), and additionally we provide an implementation of a fifth filling operation (introduced in [2]) in O(N 2 log N) that permits to decrease the overall time-complexity of the reconstruction algorithm to O(N-4 log N). More generally, the reconstruction of Q-convex sets and convex lattice sets (intersection of a convex polygon with Z(2)) can be done in O(N-4 log N)-time.", "paper_title": "Fast filling operations used in the reconstruction of convex lattice sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600009"}
