The space to fully develop the active wedge is restricted for walls with a limited backfill space. This paper presents a numerical study on the behaviour of active earth pressures behind a rigid retaining wall with limited backfill space of various geometries. The active earth pressure for a wall built with limited backfill space is considerably less than that of the Coulomb solution, and the location of the resultant of active earth pressures is noticeably higher than one-third of the wall height. The coefficient of active earth pressures is as low as 0.5-0.6 times the Coulomb solution and the h/H value reaches up to 0.4-0.37 if aspect ratio of the fill space is in the range from 0.1 to 0.2. A clear trend between the ratio of the coefficient of active earth pressures at constrained fill conditions over the Coulomb K(a) value and the aspect ratio of the fill-space geometry is obtained.
