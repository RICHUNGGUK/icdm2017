In this paper, we propose a hybrid pursuit policy for a probabilistic PEG, which possesses the combined merits of local-max and global-max pursuit policies proposed in previous literature. A method to find optimal pursuit and evasion polices for two competitive parties of the pursuers and evaders is also proposed. For this, we employ an episodic parameter optimization (EPO) algorithm to learn good values for the weighting parameters of a hybrid pursuit policy and an intelligent evasion policy. The EPO algorithm is performed during the numerous repeated simulation runs of the PEG and the reward of each episode is updated using reinforcement learning, and the optimal weighting parameters are selected by using particle swarm optimization. We analyze the trend of the optimal parameter values with respect to the number of the pursuers and evaders. The proposed strategy is validated both in simulations and experiments with small ground robots.", "paper_title": "Policy Improvements for Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900011"}
