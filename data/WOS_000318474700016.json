The method employs a conventional body birdcage coil, but the quadrature hybrid is eliminated so that the two excitation channels can be used separately. The transmit array system provides RF excitations such that the body birdcage coil creates linearly polarized and changing RF pulses instead of a conventional rotational forward-polarized excitation. The receive coils and their operations are not modified. Inductively coupled RF coils are constructed on catheters for detecting rotational orientation and for tracking purposes. Signals from the anatomy and from tissue close to the ICRF coil are different due to the new RF excitation scheme: the ICRF coil can be separated from the anatomy in real time, and after doing so, a color-coded image is reconstructed. More importantly, this novel method enables a real-time calculation of the absolute rotational orientation of an ICRF coil constructed on a catheter. Modified FLASH and TrueFISP sequences are used for the experiments. The acquired images from this technique show the feasibility of different applications, such as catheter tracking. Furthermore, applications where knowledge of the rotational orientation of the catheter is important, such as magnetic resonance-guided endoluminal-focused ultrasound, RF ablation, side-looking optical imaging, and catheters with side ports for needles, become feasible with this method.", "paper_title": "Tracking the Position and Rotational Orientation of a Catheter Using a Transmit Array System", "paper_id": "WOS:000318474700016"}
