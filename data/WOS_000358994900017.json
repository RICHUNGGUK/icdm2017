During human tracking and activity recognition, initially, dense depth images are captured using depth camera. In order to track human silhouettes, we considered spatial/temporal continuity, constraints of human motion information and compute centroids of each activity based on chain coding mechanism and centroids point extraction. In body skin joints features, we estimate human body skin color to identify human body parts (i.e., head, hands, and feet) likely to extract joint points information. These joints points are further processed as feature extraction process including distance position features and centroid distance features. Lastly, self-organized maps are used to recognize different activities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is reliable and efficient in recognizing human poses at different realistic scenes. The proposed system should be applicable to different consumer application systems such as healthcare system, video surveillance system and indoor monitoring systems which track and recognize different activities of multiple users.", "paper_title": "Dense RGB-D Map-Based Human Tracking and Activity Recognition using Skin Joints Features and Self-Organizing Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900017"}
