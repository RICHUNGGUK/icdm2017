It is shown that global exponential stability of such networks can be achieved when the external stimuli are sufficiently strong, without the need for other conditions. A sufficient condition on the bounds of stimuli is derived for global exponential stability of memristor-based recurrent networks. And all the results are in the sense of Filippov solutions. Simulation results illustrate the uses of the criteria to ascertain the global exponential stability of specific networks.", "paper_title": "Dynamics Analysis of a Class of Memristor-Based Recurrent Networks with Time-Varying Delays in the Presence of Strong External Stimuli", "paper_id": "WOS:000301588000004"}
