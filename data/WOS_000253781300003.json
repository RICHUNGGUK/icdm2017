The circuit employs two operational amplifiers and several resistors and mimics the exponential and logarithmic functions over predefined ranges. Control of the pseudo-functions is achieved by a single resistance, which may be digitally switched or implemented by tunable transconductors. Measured results using digitally switched resistors and commercially available components demonstrate the versatility of the circuit for audio/video applications.", "paper_title": "An improved pseudo-exponential, pseudo-logarithmic circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000253781300003"}
