This article suggests that by adopting the enactive approach to perceptionaccording to which perceiving is a way of actingwe may be able to improve our understanding of the traumatic experience and the factors which result in the development of post-traumatic symptoms. The central argument presented in this paper is that when the options of flight or fight are unavailable as a coping/defense mechanism, one freezes (freeze response). In this situation, the ability to master one's movements is damaged and, in radical cases, the ability to move is lost altogether; as a result the sensorimotor loop may collapse. This, in turn, leads to distorted perception and, in consequence, memory disorders may develop.", "paper_title": "Trauma from an enactive perspective: the collapse of the knowing-how structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000355274500002"}
