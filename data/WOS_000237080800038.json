How to realize cooperative planning among heterogeneous CAPP systems in a networked manufacturing environment is a challenging issue. In this paper we adopt screen-sharing technology to solve this problem. We first propose an idea for cooperative process planning. Then we discuss potential solutions to the problems of screen-sharing technology, including cooperative control command management and shared data processing. An example of the networked manufacturing oriented cooperative CAPP system is briefly introduced at the end of this paper.", "paper_title": "Screen-sharing technology for cooperative CAPP system in a networked manufacturing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800038"}
