Unit-linking PCNN, which has been developed from PCNN exhibiting synchronous pulse bursts in cat and monkey visual cortexes, is a kind of time-space-coding SNN (Spiking Neural Network). We have used Unit-linking PCNN to produce the global image icons with translation and rotation invariance. Unit-linking PCNN image icon (namely global image icons) is the 1-dimentional time series, and is a kind of image feature extracted from the time information that Unit-linking PCNN code the 2-dimentional image into. Its translation and rotation invariance is a good property in object detection. In addition to translation, rotation invariance, the object detection approach in this paper is also independent of scale variation.", "paper_title": "Object detection using unit-linking PCNN image icons", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000091"}
