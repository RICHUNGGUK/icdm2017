The restricted k-partitioning problem refers to the case where the number of elements in each group is fixed to N/L In the case k = 2 it has been shown that the properly rescaled differences of the two sums in the close to optimal partitions converge to a Poisson point process, as if they were independent random variables. We generalize this result to the case k > 2 in the restricted problem and show that the vector of differences between the k sums converges to a k - 1 -dimensional Poisson point process.
