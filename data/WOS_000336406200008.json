This is done by taking advantage of the global expression of the DG method and re-expanding it in terms of a multiwavelet basis, which is a sum of the global average and finer details on different levels. Examining the higher level difference coefficients acts as a troubled-cell indicator, thus avoiding unnecessary increased computational cost of a new expansion. In two-dimensions the multiwavelet decomposition uses combinations of scaling functions and multiwavelets in the x- and y-directions for improved troubled-cell indication. By using such a troubled-cell indicator, we are able to reduce the computational cost by avoiding limiting in smooth regions. We present numerical examples in one- and two-dimensions and compare our troubled-cell indicator to the subcell resolution technique of Harten (1989) [11] and the shock detector of Krivodonova et al. (2004) [18], which were previously investigated by Qiu and Shu (2005) [23]. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
