The MACBSE approaches are batch fixed-point learning algorithms for extraction of source signals with linear autocorrelations. The fixed-point algorithms are very simple and do not need to choose any learning step sizes. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the algorithms are analyzed. Their efficiencies are demonstrated by extensive computer simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
