Recent machine learning approaches with the ability of metric adaptation but based on different concepts are considered in comparison to variants of relevance learning vector quantization. We compare these methods with respect to their theoretical motivation and we demonstrate the differences of their behavior for several real world data sets. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
