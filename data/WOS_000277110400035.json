This study identifies Communal Constructivism as a potentially appropriate pedagogy for use in the virtual world Second Life Five groups of learners took part in a learning experience specifically designed to provide opportunity for the features of Communal Constructivism to emerge through the affordances of the technology. The chat logs, learning artefacts, post-activity semi-structured interviews and researcher's observations from each of the five groups were analysed to explore participants' experiences and both the operation and outcome of the pedagogy in action Findings from the qualitative analysis of the data sets indicate that learners collaboratively constructed knowledge for themselves as a group and for others, as the features of the pedagogy emerged (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Identifying an appropriate pedagogy for virtual worlds: A Communal Constructivism case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000277110400035"}
