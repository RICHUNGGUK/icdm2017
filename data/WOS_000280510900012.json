This method, denoted as ASIFT-SH, consists of the following steps (i) determination of initial corresponding points, (ii) grouping of initial corresponding points into subsets, (iii) calculation of local homographies for a particular subset of points, and (iv) determination of any correspondence between arbitrary points from a particular camera's view by using a suitable local homography The ASIFT-SH method, when compared to searching the area surrounding an epipolar line (EPI method), provides more accurate results, especially on surfaces with similar pixel intensities The average error in our method it is in the order of a few pixels, whilst for the EPI method in the order of a few hundred pixels.
