For this problem, we investigate two methods of augmentation, which both yield high retrieval quality. As retrieval effectiveness, we consider the ratio of retrieval quality and response time; thus, fast approximations to the 'correct' retrieval result may yield higher effectiveness. We present a classification scheme for algorithms addressing this issue, and adopt known algorithms from standard document retrieval for XML retrieval. As a new strategy, we propose incremental-interruptible retrieval, which allows for instant presentation of the top ranking documents. We develop a new algorithm implementing this strategy and evaluate the different methods with the INEX collection.", "paper_title": "Retrieval quality vs. effectiveness of specificity-oriented search in XML collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000235307800003"}
