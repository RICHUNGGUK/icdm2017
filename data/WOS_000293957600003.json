This paper introduces an incremental propagation algorithm for MDDs, and explores several methods for incorporating explanations with MDD-based propagators. We demonstrate that these techniques can provide significantly improved performance when solving a variety of problems.", "paper_title": "MDD propagators with explanation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293957600003"}
