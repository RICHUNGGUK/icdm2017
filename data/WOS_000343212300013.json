Reworking actions and different defect rates of workstations are both taken into account in the MMN model. The capacity analysis and performance evaluation are implemented accordingly. In particular, a technique in terms of 'prior-set' is developed to deal with multiple reworking actions. Subsequently, two simple algorithms are proposed to generate all minimal capacity vectors that workstations should provide to satisfy a given demand. In terms of such vectors, the probability of demand satisfaction can be derived. Such a probability is referred to as the system reliability, which is a performance indicator to state the capability of the MMN. According to each specific minimal capacity vector, the production manager may further determine a better strategy to produce products.", "paper_title": "A novel model for a manufacturing system with joint production lines in terms of prior-set", "paper_id": "WOS:000343212300013"}
