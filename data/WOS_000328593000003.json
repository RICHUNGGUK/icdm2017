Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is one of the important researches that carry out dynamic simulation of particle motion. Based on the KMC method, a simulation algorithm of the evolution of dust particles under the influence of the natural factors and human factors in a virtual campus is proposed. The experimental results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the simulation algorithm by contrast with the actual results. The simulation and visualization results will provide a reference for city planning and pollution prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
