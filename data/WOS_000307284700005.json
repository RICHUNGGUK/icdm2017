While graph-based methods are robust to non-rigid object deformations, they require intensive computation which can be reduced by the use of appropriate representations, addressed through geometry-based methods. In this respect, we present a 3D object retrieval methodology, which combines the above advantages in a unified manner. Furthermore, we propose a string matching strategy for the comparison of graphs which describe 3D objects.", "paper_title": "Non-rigid 3D object retrieval using topological information guided by conformal factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000307284700005"}
