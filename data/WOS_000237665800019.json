Based on Rhetorical Structure Theory, DiZer is a symbolic analyzer that makes use of linguistic patterns learned from a corpus of scientific texts to identify and build the discourse structure of texts. DiZer evaluation shows satisfactory results for scientific texts. In order to test its portability, DiZer is also evaluated with news texts and presents acceptable performance.", "paper_title": "Review and evaluation of DiZer - An automatic discourse analyzer for Brazilian Portuguese", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800019"}
