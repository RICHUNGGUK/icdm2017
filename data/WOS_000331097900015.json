However, migrating VMs requires more hardware resources to reserve target slots during the migration. A large number of simultaneous migrations can exhaust the physical resources of a data center. Consequently, the system may deny new service requests. In this paper, we introduce an efficient strategy to limit the number of target slots used for the migration process with the aim of maintaining high data center availability. In particular, the number of target slots is determined by the tradeoff between the waiting time of the queued migration processes and the probability that the system rejects new user requests due to the lack of available resources. We also propose a method to reduce the waiting time of the migration process by adding a sufficient number of slots during the migration process. Accordingly, a data center can use fewer resources while still guaranteeing the quality of the service. The efficiency of our proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental results.", "paper_title": "An Improvement of Resource Allocation for Migration Process in Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000331097900015"}
