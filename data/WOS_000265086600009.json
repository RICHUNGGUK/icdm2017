The receiver can prove the dishonesty of the sender to any one if the sender repudiates his/her signature. Recently, many researchers have proposed convertible authenticated encryption schemes based on cryptological algorithms. In this paper, the authors shall present a new convertible authenticated encryption scheme based on the ElGamal cryptosystem. The proposed scheme is more efficient than Wu-Hsu's scheme in terms of computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A NEW CONVERTIBLE AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION SCHEME BASED ON THE ELGAMAL CRYPTOSYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000265086600009"}
