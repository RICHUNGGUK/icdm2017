To solve the problem posed by nonlinear characteristics, kernel partial least squares (KPLS) approaches have been proposed. In this paper, MBKPLS algorithm is first proposed and applied to monitor large-scale processes. The advantages of MBKPLS are: 1) MBKPLS can capture more useful information between and within blocks compared to partial least squares (PLS); 2) MBKPLS gives nonlinear interpretation compared to MBPLS; 3) Fault diagnosis becomes possible if number of sub-blocks is equal to the number of the variables compared to KPLS. The proposed methods are applied to process monitoring of a continuous annealing process. Application results indicate that the proposed decentralized monitoring scheme effectively captures the complex relations in the process and improves the diagnosis ability tremendously.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Fault Diagnosis of Large-Scale Processes Using Multiblock Kernel Partial Least Squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000274383700002"}
