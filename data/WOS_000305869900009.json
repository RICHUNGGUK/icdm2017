In our algorithm, the bi-level linear fractional programming problem is transformed into an equivalent single level programming problem by forcing the dual gap of the lower level problem to zero. Then, by obtaining all vertices of a polyhedron, the single level programming problem can be converted into a series of linear fractional programming problems. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of examples taken from the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
