Unmanned aerial vehicles have speed and mobility advantages over ground vehicles and can operate in 3-dimensional workspaces. In particular, the usefulness of these capabilities is highlighted in areas where ground robots cannot reach or terrains they are unable to navigate. However, most UAVs operating in near-earth or indoor environments still do not have the payload capabilities to support multi-degree of freedom manipulators. We present a rotorcraft emulation environment using a 7 degree of freedom manipulator. Since UAVs require significant setup time and to avoid potential crashes, our test and evaluation environment provides repeatable experiments and captures reactionary forces experienced during ground interaction. Recent experiments in insertion tests are presented. The lessons learned from these experiments will be ported onto an actual air vehicle with manipulator.", "paper_title": "Hardware-in-the-Loop Verification for Mobile Manipulating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400047"}
