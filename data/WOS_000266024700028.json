First, a homogeneous polynomial matrix function is proposed, then by applying the homogeneous polynomial matrix function to the controller and Lyapunov function, some new conditions are obtained. It is shown that as the degree of the the homogeneous polynomial matrix function increases the conditions become less conservative. Numerical examples are included for illustration and comparison.", "paper_title": "NEW RELAXED STABILIZATION CONDITIONS FOR FUZZY CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700028"}
