The current state of the art involves the use of (multiple) spaced seeds for producing high quality alignments. A particular important class is that of neighbor seeds which combine high sensitivity with reduced space requirements. Current algorithms for computing good neighbor seeds are very slow (exponential). Results: We give a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm that computes better neighbor seeds than previous ones while being several orders of magnitude faster.", "paper_title": "Fast computation of neighbor seeds", "paper_id": "WOS:000264189600018"}
