In LEGO terminology, the composite EBG structure is broken up (diakopted) into constitutive elements called \"bricks\" that we characterize through scattering operators by invoking Love's equivalence principle, while, at the same time, the electromagnetic interaction among the bricks is captured by transfer operators. The resulting electromagnetic problem is then succinctly formulated through an integral equation involving the total inverse scattering operator S-1 of the structure. To perform local optimization, the formulation of the problem allows for variations of the electromagnetic properties and the shape of a set of objects in the EBG structure with respect to those of the others, thereby allowing us to tune a compact designated domain within a large one. Finally, the method of moments and the EEM are applied to achieve a considerable reduction in memory use for the overall problem.", "paper_title": "An efficient approach to the local optimization of finite electromagnetic band-gap structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000332942900003"}
