To address this problem we developed a research design that included a meta-analysis of the literature, a field experiment and survey. The meta-analysis identified factors which impact on the effectiveness of virtual teams which were then validated by a field experiment and Survey. The results of the study indicate that social dimensional factors need to be considered early oil in the virtual team creation process and are critical to the effectiveness of the team. Communication is a tool that directly influences the social dimensions of the team and in addition the performance of the team has a positive impact on satisfaction with the virtual team. A major contribution of the paper is an integrated model of factors that contribute to virtual team effectiveness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
