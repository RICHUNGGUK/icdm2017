Our approach differs from others in that both hardware and software components are viewed as hardware-like devices in which an output value can change instantaneously when input values change and all components operate synchronously rather than in sequence. We define what we mean by completeness and consistency and illustrate how the documents can be used to verify a design before it is implemented.", "paper_title": "Documenting and verifying systems assembled from components", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504200001"}
