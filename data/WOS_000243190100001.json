Similar to the well-known simple isotropic material with penalization method, the mass concentration of each material phase is considered as design variable. However, a variational approach is taken with the Cahn-Hilliard theory to define a thermodynamic model, taking into account of the bulk energy and interface energy of the phases and the elastic strain energy of the structure. As a result, the structural optimization problem is transformed into a phase transition problem defined by a set of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. The generalized Cahn-Hilliard model regularizes the original ill-posed topology optimization problem and provides flexibility of topology changes with interface coalescence and break-up due to phase separation and coarsening. We employ a powerful multigrid algorithm and extend it to include four material phases for numerical solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equations. We demonstrate our approach through several 2-D and 3-D examples to minimize mean compliance of the multimaterial structures.", "paper_title": "Multimaterial structural topology optimization with a generalized Cahn-Hilliard model of multiphase transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000243190100001"}
