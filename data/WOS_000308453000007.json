Development of peening parameters needed to obtain a specific component shape can be both costly and challenging due to the use of empirical methods which involve large quantities of physical experiments coupled with trial and error processing of prototype components. Many iterations are often required to get the desired shape with no guarantee that a specific component geometry can be achieved. Reliable numerical simulations could substantially reduce the time, cost and risk associated with process development. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the use of numerical tools to model the peen forming process. This work combines static and dynamic simulation techniques to predict the development of curvature on representative wing skin panels that include features such as integral stiffeners. This work illustrates the considerable potential of finite element simulations to determine the process parameters needed to produce a component design, and substantially reduce the dependence upon physical testing.
