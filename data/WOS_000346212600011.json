Existing methods are largely based on Fourier transform and wavelet transform, and there is a lack of methods capable of (1) measuring the synchronization strength of multivariate data by adapting to non-stationary, non-linear dynamics, and (2) meeting the needs of sophisticated scientific or engineering applications. This study proposes an approach that measures the synchronization strength of bivariate non-stationary nonlinear data against phase differences. The approach (briefed as AD-PDSA) relies on adaptive algorithms for data decomposition. A parallelized approach was also developed with general-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU), which largely improved the scalability of data processing, namely, GAD-PDSA. We developed a model on the basis of GAD-PDSA to verify its effectiveness in analyzing multi-channel, event-related potential (ERP) recordings against Daubechies (DB) wavelet with reference to the Morlet wavelet transform (MWT). GADPDSA was applied to an EEG dataset obtained from epilepsy patients, and the synchronization analysis manifested an effective indicator of epileptic focus localization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
