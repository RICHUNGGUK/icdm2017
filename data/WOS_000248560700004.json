Supervisory systems in these new scenarios will have to be able to integrate large volumes of information and knowledge coming both from local and remote points of large processes. These systems will therefore require new tools for management and integration of information and knowledge. In this work, the authors present an internet-based remote supervision system of industrial processes that incorporates powerful data and knowledge visualization tools based on self-organizing maps (SOM). This architecture adds an intermediate layer (database) to the well-known client and server layers, that isolates the client part from the industrial process, allowing to incorporate the required data management and neural network processing tasks. Remote users have access to advanced information visualization tools based on SOM, including both static visualizations, such as component planes or distance maps, and dynamical ones, such as residuals and state trajectory, allowing the interpretation of knowledge extracted by the SOM as well as the analysis and detection of possible abnormal conditions. This architecture has been validated through the supervision of an industrial pilot plant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
