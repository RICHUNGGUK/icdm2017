There are not proposals to support the joint modeling of collaborative and interactive issues of this kind of systems, that is, proposals that allow designing the presentation layer of these applications. In order to solve this lack we propose a methodological approach, based on a set of notations of both a graphical and a textual nature.", "paper_title": "CIAM: A methodology for the development of groupware user interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000259759300004"}
