The macroscopic feature emerges from the total of shape elements, and the feature is important in the styling design. The mathematical formulation of macroscopic feature is difficult using conventional microscopic shape information such as dimension and curvature. In this paper, for formulation of macroscopic feature, the importance of \"condition\" that is various physical elements in the circumstance is mentioned. Moreover, this paper describes the mathematical formulation of macroscopic feature \"complexity,\" and its application for design. The formulation consists of curvature integration and multi-resolution representation. In application, shape generation method based on a genetic algorithm is introduced.
