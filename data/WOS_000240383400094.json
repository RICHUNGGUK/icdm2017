This paper preserves a new IHS-WT method based on weighted regional features for the fusion of a high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution, multi-spectral image. Firstly, the multi-spectral image is transformed into IHS component. Secondly, the histogram-matched panchromatic (New PAN) image and intensity component (I) are decomposed into wavelet coefficients respectively. Thirdly, the new intensity component can be obtained by fused the wavelet coefficient data of New PAN and I through adaptive weights based on window region features. Finally, the new intensity, hue, and saturation components are transformed back to RGB. A comparative analysis is carried out against other existing strategies. The results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance in combing and preserving spectral-spatial information for the test images.", "paper_title": "A new IHS-WT image fusion method based on weighted regional features", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400094"}
