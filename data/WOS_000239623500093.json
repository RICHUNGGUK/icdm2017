As a result, the Semantic Web represents a promising technology for realizing the e-Learning requirement. In this paper, we present our approach for migrating the Semantic Web technologies into the knowledge management in the e-Learning environment. Based on the semantic layer, our e-Learning framework provides dynamic knowledge management and representation, including tightly integration with the related e-Learning standards.", "paper_title": "Migration of the Semantic Web technologies into e-Learning knowledge management", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500093"}
