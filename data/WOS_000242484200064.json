Marginal distribution functions are assumed to be known, and a bivariate chi-square test of fit is applied in a fully parametric copula approach. Several marginal models and families of copulas are fitted and compared with Spanish stock market data. The results show the difficulty in adjusting the bivariate distribution of raw returns, and highlight the effect of a GARCH filtering in the selection of the best fitting copula.
