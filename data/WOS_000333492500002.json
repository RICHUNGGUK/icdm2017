CRYSTAL ISLAND: UNCHARTED DISCOVERY, is a game-based learning environment designed for upper elementary science education that has been under development in our laboratory for the past four years. This article discusses curricular and narrative interaction design requirements, presents the design of the CRYSTAL ISLAND learning environment, and describes its evolution through a series of pilots and field tests. Additionally, a classroom integration study was conducted to initiate a shift towards ecological validity. Results-indicated that CRYSTAL ISLAND produced significant learning gains on both science content and problem-solving measures. Importantly, gains were consistent for gender across studies. This finding is key in light of past studies that revealed disproportionate participation by boys within game-based learning environments.
