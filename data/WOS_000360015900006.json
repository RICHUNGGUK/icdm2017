The second-order term in the large-n expansion of the maximal channel coding rate is characterized both for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and for quasi-static fading channels with perfect channel state information available at both the transmitter and the receiver. It is shown that in both the cases, the second-order term is proportional to (n(-1) ln n)(1/2). For the quasi-static fading case, this second-order term is achieved by truncated channel inversion, namely, by concatenating a dispersion-optimal code for an AWGN channel subject to a short-term power constraint, with a power controller that inverts the channel whenever the fading gain is above a certain threshold. Easy-to-evaluate approximations of the maximal channel coding rate are developed for both the AWGN and the quasi-static fading case.", "paper_title": "Optimum Power Control at Finite Blocklength", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900006"}
