Firstly, the base station planning problem is decomposed into several \"sub-problems\" for every set of activated base stations to optimally assign test points to them. Subsequently, the relationship between the integer sub-problems and their linear relaxations is investigated, which leads to the equivalence of the integral optimal solutions to the original integer programming model and its relaxation. Finally the classic Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to solve WCDMA base station planning problem. Simulation results show that the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm can meet the requirements in practical applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
