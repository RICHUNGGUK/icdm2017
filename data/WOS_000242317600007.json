Towards this goal, we build on a technique that was recently developed to transfer colors from a user-selected source image to a target grayscale image. More specifically, in order to eliminate the need for manual selection of the source image, we use content-based image retrieval methods to find suitable source images in an image database. To assess the merit of our methodology, we performed a survey where volunteers were asked to rate the plausibility of the colorings generated automatically for grayscale images. In most cases, automatically-colored images were rated either as totally plausible or as mostly plausible. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
