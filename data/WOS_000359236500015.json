Cloud computing resources are a natural fit for processing big data streams as they allow big data application to run at a scale which is required for handling its complexities (data volume, variety and velocity). With the data no longer under users' direct control, data security in cloud computing is becoming one of the most concerns in the adoption of cloud computing resources. In order to improve data reliability and availability, storing multiple replicas along with original datasets is a common strategy for cloud service providers. Public data auditing schemes allow users to verify their outsourced data storage without having to retrieve the whole dataset. However, existing data auditing techniques suffers from efficiency and security problems. First, for dynamic datasets with multiple replicas, the communication overhead for update verifications is very large, because each update requires updating of all replicas, where verification for each update requires O(log n) communication complexity. Second, existing schemes cannot provide public auditing and authentication of block indices at the same time. Without authentication of block indices, the server can build a valid proof based on data blocks other than the blocks client requested to verify. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we present a novel public auditing scheme named MuR-DPA. The new scheme incorporated a novel authenticated data structure (ADS) based on the Merkle hash tree (MHT), which we call MR-MHT. To support full dynamic data updates and authentication of block indices, we included rank and level values in computation of MHT nodes. In contrast to existing schemes, level values of nodes in MR-MHT are assigned in a top-down order, and all replica blocks for each data block are organized into a same replica sub-tree. Such a configuration allows efficient verification of updates for multiple replicas. Compared to existing integrity verification and public auditing schemes, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed MuR-DPA scheme can not only incur much less communication overhead for both update verification and integrity verification of cloud datasets with multiple replicas, but also provide enhanced security against dishonest cloud service providers.", "paper_title": "MuR-DPA: Top-Down Levelled Multi-Replica Merkle Hash Tree Based Secure Public Auditing for Dynamic Big Data Storage on Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000359236500015"}
