This algorithm has been devised as an improvement over existing statistical restoration based algorithms in order to reduce the additive noise which occurs due to embedding. It is shown that the proposed scheme substantially reduces the additive noise compared to existing statistical restoration based schemes.", "paper_title": "Pixel rearrangement based statistical restoration scheme reducing embedding noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000331084000014"}
