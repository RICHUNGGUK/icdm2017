Noticeably, this context raises original constraints-e.g. embeddability, real time, broadband environments, noise and reverberation-which are seldom simultaneously taken into account in acoustics or signal processing. A comprehensive review is proposed of recent robotics achievements, be they binaural or rooted in array processing techniques. The connections are highlighted with the underlying theory as well as with elements of physiology and neurology of human hearing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
