With today's general OPC interface, it is easy to connect a PLC to a simulation tool for, e. g., verification purposes. However, there are some problems with this approach that can lead to an unreliable verification result. In this paper, four major problems with the OPC interface are described, and two possible solutions to the problems are presented: a general IEC 61131-3-based software solution, and a new OPC standard solution.", "paper_title": "Methods for Reliable Simulation-Based PLC Code Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000302720000007"}
