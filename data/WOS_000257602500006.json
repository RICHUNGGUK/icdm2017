But with more integrating network technologies, bandwidth management is more complicated. This paper proposes a bandwidth management method, called Bandwidth Management and Disposition (BMD). The BMD calculates the Reword Point (RP) to quantify the Mobile Host's (MH) requests, and calculates the Upgrade Order (UO) or Degrade Order (DO) to quantify the upgraded or downgraded sequence of bandwidth, respectively. In the future, when a new service type or network technology is created, the proposed system functions also can be directly applied. This paper analyzes the BMD is more feasible than the other existed methods. The simulation results also demonstrate the functionality of the BMD.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth Management and Disposition for 4G wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000257602500006"}
