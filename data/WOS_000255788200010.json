This paper looks at the limitations of conventional programming schemes for these devices, as well as new methods to achieve ultra-low current levels, reliably, in these devices. Currents range from 1 mu A down to 100 fA. We present measured results programming an array of bandpass filters using floating-gate transistors using the Kappa Projection Algorithm (KPA) from 10 Hz to 48 kHz. We program out device offsets and mismatches to result in very precise device behavior within the circuit elements. Experimental data is presented from circuits fabricated on a 0.5 mu m nwell CMOS process available through MOSIS.", "paper_title": "A kappa projection algorithm (KPA) for programming to femtoampere currents in standard CMOS floating-gate elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788200010"}
