The SNNM is composed of a discrete-time linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator. Based on the global asymptotic stability analysis of the SNNMs, linear and nonlinear dynamic output feedback controllers are designed for the SNNMs to stabilize the closed-loop systems, respectively. The control design equations are shown to be a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms to determine the control signals. Most neural-network-based (or fuzzy) discrete-time intelligent systems with time delays or without time delays can be transformed into the SNNMs for controller synthesis in a unified way. Three application examples show that the SNNMs not only make controller synthesis of neural-network-based (or fuzzy) discrete-time intelligent systems much easier, but also provide a new approach to the synthesis of the controllers for the other type of nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Unified stabilizing controller synthesis approach for discrete-time intelligent systems with time delays by dynamic output feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300011"}
