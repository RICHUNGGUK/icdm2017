The mutual information between the measurements of sensors and the estimated distribution of the target state is considered as the information utility function to evaluate the information contribution of sensors. And only those sensors with larger mutual information are selected to participate in the Kalman filtering iterations. Then the geographic routing mechanism is utilized to visit these selected sensors sequentially and set up a path to transport the state estimation information to the sink node. Simulation results show that compared with the shortest path tree algorithm, the information-driven sensor selection algorithm involves smaller participated sensors, and shorter total communication distance, while the estimation performance approaches the same bound.", "paper_title": "Information-driven sensor selection algorithm for kalman filtering in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600051"}
