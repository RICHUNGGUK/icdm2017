In contrast to the real setting, infinitely many different wavelet bases are generated by a p-adic MRA. We give an explicit description for all wavelet functions corresponding to the quincunx Haar MRA. Each one generates an orthogonal basis, one of them was presented in Ref. 12. A connection between quincunx Haar MRA and two-dimensional separable Haar MRA is also found.", "paper_title": "HAAR BASES FOR L-2(Q(2)(2)) GENERATED BY ONE WAVELET FUNCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000310462400002"}
