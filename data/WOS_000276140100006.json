The results of a considerable amount of research dealing with automated access to video surveillance have appeared in the literature; however, significant semantic gaps in event models and content-based access to surveillance video remain. In this paper, we propose a scenario-based query-processing system for video surveillance archives. In our system, a scenario is specified as a sequence of event predicates that can be enriched with object-based low-level features and directional predicates. We introduce an inverted tracking scheme, which effectively tracks the moving objects and enables view-based addressing of the scene. Our query-processing system also supports inverse querying and view-based querying, for after-the-fact activity analysis. We propose a specific surveillance query language to express the supported query types in a scenario-based manner. We also present a visual query-specification interface devised to facilitate the query-specification process. We have conducted performance experiments to show that our query-processing technique has a high expressive power and satisfactory retrieval accuracy in video surveillance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
