We call these sequences multiple L-shift complementary sequences. It is well-known that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) value of any Golay complementary sequence is less than or equal to 2. In this paper, we show that the PAPR of each multiple L-shift complementary sequence is less than or equal to 2L. We also discuss other properties of the sequences and consider their construction.", "paper_title": "Multiple L-shift complementary sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800024"}
