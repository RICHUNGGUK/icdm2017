Since the view changes of faces induce large variation in appearance in the horizontal direction, local kernels are applied to horizontal rectangular regions to model such appearance changes. Local kernels are integrated by summation, and then used as a summation kernel for support vector machine (SVM). View independence is shown to be realized by the integration of local horizontal rectangular kernels. However, in general, local kernels (features) of various sizes have different similarity measures, such as detailed and rough similarity, and thus their error patterns are different. If the local and global kernels are combined well, the generalization ability is improved. This research demonstrates the comparative effectiveness of combining the global kernel and local kernels of various sizes as a Summation kernel for SVM against use of only the global kernel, only the combination of local kernels and Aclaboost with SVMs with a kind of local kernel.
