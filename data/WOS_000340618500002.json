Several pieces of evidence are presented in this work that support our claim that syntax might bring valuable information for dialogue act recognition. In particular, a parallel is drawn with the related domain of automatic punctuation generation and a set of syntactic features derived from a deep parse tree is further proposed and successfully used in a Czech dialogue act recognition system based on conditional random fields. We finally discuss the possible reasons why so few works have exploited this type of information before and propose future research directions to further progress in this area.", "paper_title": "Automatic dialogue act recognition with syntactic features", "paper_id": "WOS:000340618500002"}
