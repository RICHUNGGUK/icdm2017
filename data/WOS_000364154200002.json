Nevertheless, it is not straightforward to build a template of [123I]FP-CIT SPECT brain images because they exhibit very low intensity values outside the striatum. In this work, we present a procedure to automatically build a [123I]FP-CIT SPECT template in the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The proposed methodology consists of a head voxel selection using the Otsu's method, followed by a posterization of the source images to three different levels: background, head, and striatum. Analogously, we also design a posterized version of a brain image in the MNI space; subsequently, we perform a spatial affine registration of the posterized source images to this image. The intensity of the transformed images is normalized linearly, assuming that the histogram of the intensity values follows an alpha-stable distribution. Lastly, we build the [123I]FP-CIT SPECT template by means of the transformed and normalized images. The proposed methodology is a fully automatic procedure that has been shown to work accurately even when a high-resolution magnetic resonance image for each subject is not available.", "paper_title": "Building a FP-CIT SPECT Brain Template Using a Posterization Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000364154200002"}
