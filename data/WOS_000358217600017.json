Image tampering can easily devastate the credibility of images as a medium for personal authentication and a record of events. With the daily upload of millions of pictures to the Internet and the move towards paperless workplaces and e-government services, it becomes essential to develop automatic tampering detection techniques with reliable results. This paper proposes an enhanced technique for blind detection of image splicing. It extracts and combines Markov features in spatial and Discrete Cosine Transform domains to detect the artifacts introduced by the tampering operation. To reduce the computational complexity due to high dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis is used to select the most relevant features. Then, an optimized support vector machine with radial-basis function kernel is built to classify the image as being tampered or authentic. The proposed technique is evaluated on a publicly available image splicing dataset using cross validation. The results showed that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art splicing detection methods.", "paper_title": "Combining spatial and DCT based Markov features for enhanced blind detection of image splicing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358217600017"}
