In contrast to forced vibration test, they do not require service interruption and expensive devices to excite the structure. To this aim, we combine the recently proposed H-fractional spectral moments representation of stationary processes with a modification of the Kalman filter to the scope of structural parameter identification. This paper shows that the method is particularly suited to dealing with long-correlated loads, i.e. stochastic processes with inverse power-law correlation, where many existing methods are not applicable or insufficiently accurate.
