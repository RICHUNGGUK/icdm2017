In this work, we propose a mixed routing strategy by considering the global static information (topology of the network) and local dynamic information (queue length of neighbor nodes). Under this routing strategy, the traffic capacity can be remarkably promoted compared with that by former efficient routing strategy [G. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)]. Besides, the traffic capacity, the average packet number as well as the travel time are almost independent of a time delay in updating the local dynamic information.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATING LOCAL DYNAMIC AND GLOBAL STATIC INFORMATION FOR ROUTING TRAFFIC ON NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293018700008"}
