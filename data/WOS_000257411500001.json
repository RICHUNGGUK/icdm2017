Hence, our aim will be to introduce some versions of this upper continuity weakened in the sense that the conditions imposed in [7] to the whole definition domain of the possibilistic measure in question will be restricted just to certain subdomains. The resulting notion of partial upper convergence and continuity of lattice-valued possibilistic measures will be analyzed in more detail and some results will be introduced and proved.", "paper_title": "Partial convergence and continuity of lattice-valued possibilistic measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000257411500001"}
