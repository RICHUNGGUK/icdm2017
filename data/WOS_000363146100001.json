However, previous study about this problem has primarily faced two main challenges. One is that positioning fingerprint feature using received signal strength is unstable due to heterogeneous devices and dynamic environment status, which will greatly degrade the positioning accuracy. Another is that some improved positioning fingerprint features will suffer the curse of dimensionality in online positioning. In this paper, we designed a novel positioning fingerprint feature using the segment similarity of Wi-Fi access points, considering both the received signal strength value and the Wi-Fi access point. Based on this designed fingerprint feature, we proposed a two-stage positioning algorithm for indoor fingerprint-based positioning. Experiment results indicate that our proposed positioning methodology can not only achieve better positioning performance but also consume less positioning time compared to three baseline methods.", "paper_title": "Feature Learning for Fingerprint-Based Positioning in Indoor Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000363146100001"}
