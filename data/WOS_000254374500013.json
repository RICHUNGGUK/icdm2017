The proposed method is based on a modified version of classical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, known as the Multi-Elitist PSO (MEPSO) model. It also employs a kemel-induced similarity measure instead of the conventional sum-of-squares distance. Use of the kernel function makes it possible to cluster data that is linearly non-separable in the original input space into homogeneous groups in a transformed high-dimensional feature space. A new particle representation scheme has been adopted for selecting the optimal number of clusters from several possible choices. The performance of the proposed method has been extensively compared with a few state of the art clustering techniques over a test suit of several artificial and real life datasets. Based on the computer simulations, some empirical guidelines have been provided for selecting the suitable parameters of the PSO algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
