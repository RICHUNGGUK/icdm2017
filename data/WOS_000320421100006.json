The idea takes into account not only the energy efficiency of cloud providers, also the needs of users' QoS. The main work includes: construct QoS model, resource model of cloud infrastructure and the mapping between low-level resource metrics and QoS attributes; model load status of the virtual machine instance, and estimate the resource utilization ratio of the virtual machine cluster quantitatively; design the task scheduling algorithm and elastic scaling algorithm to achieve the tasks distribution and the elastic scaling of the virtual machines cluster respectively. By simulation using CloudSim platform, the result shows that this novel method has better load balance degree and complement time compared with other common algorithms such as round robin and green load, achieving the purpose of optimal load balancing in premise of ensuring QoS.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL CLOUD LOAD BALANCING MECHANISM IN PREMISE OF ENSURING QOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100006"}
