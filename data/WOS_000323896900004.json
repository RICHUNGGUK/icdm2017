Subjects wore a head-mounted camera that recorded their hand usage during their daily work activities in their typical place of work. For each subject, 7.45 hours of video was analyzed, recording the type of grasp being used and its duration. From this data, we extracted overall grasp frequency, duration distributions for each grasp, and common transitions between grasps. The results show that for 80 percent of the study duration the housekeepers used just five grasps and the machinists used 10. The grasping patterns for the different subjects were compared, and the overall top 10 grasps are discussed in detail. The results of this study not only lend insight into how people use their hands during daily tasks, but can also inform the design of effective robotic and prosthetic hands.", "paper_title": "Grasp Frequency and Usage in Daily Household and Machine Shop Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323896900004"}
