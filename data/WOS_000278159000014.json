In this paper, we focus on the capacity of MIMO-OFDM systems and how to increase the capacity. It has been proved that the capacity of a MIMO system with space-dimensional water-filling power allocation is greater than that of the system with uniform power allocation. In MIMO-OFDM systems, there is an additional degree of freedom to allocate power with respect to MIMO systems: the OFDM sub-channels in frequency-domain. With the singular value decomposition (SVD) applied to the channel frequency response matrix, the two-dimensional water-filling power allocation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed based on the Lagrange method, and the corresponding capacity analysis formula is derived. Simulation results show that the capacity of a MIMO-OFDM system with the proposed two-dimensional water-filling power allocation is greater than that of the system with uniform power allocation and also greater than that of the system with the one-dimensional water-filling power allocation.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional water-filling power allocation algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000014"}
