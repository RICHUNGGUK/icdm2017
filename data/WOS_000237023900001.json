It has the capability of climbing stairs and traversing obstacles, and adaptability toward uphill, downhill and slope surfaces. MSRox with 82 cm in length, 54 cm in width and 29 cm in height has been designed to climb stairs of 10 cm in height and 15 cm in width; nevertheless, it has the capability of climbing stairs Lip to about 17 cm in height and unlimited widt. In this paper, the motion systems and the capabilities of MSRox are described. Furthermore, experimental results of stair climbing and a comparison of the results with others are presented.", "paper_title": "Stair climber smart mobile robot (MSRox)", "paper_id": "WOS:000237023900001"}
