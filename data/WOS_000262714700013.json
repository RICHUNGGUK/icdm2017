Based on the design premises, some recent studies, including skyscraper broadcasting (SkB), client-centric approach (CCA), greedy disk-conserving broadcasting (GDB), and reverse fast broadcasting (RFB) schemes, etc., have been reported. To study the client segment downloading process, this paper first introduces an applicable sequence-based broadcasting model that can be used to minimize the required buffer size. By extending RFB, this paper further proposes a reverse sequence-based broadcasting model, which can generally improve the existing schemes such as SkB, CCA, GDB, and FB in terms of the relaxed client buffer size. To have a deeper understanding on the proposed reverse model, the upper bound of the client buffer requirement is obtained through a comprehensive analysis, which is proved to be much smaller than the conventional sequence model by 25% to 50%. Based on the proposed reverse model, a reverse sequence-based broadcasting scheme is developed for achieving smaller delay than CCA and GDB.", "paper_title": "Generalized Sequence-Based and Reverse Sequence-Based Models for Broadcasting Hot Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000262714700013"}
