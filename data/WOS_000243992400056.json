Most programs are commercial packages, some are free. In the latter group only few propose automatic grid alignment and batch mode. More often than not a program implements only one quantification algorithm. AGScan is an open source program that works on all major platforms. It is based on the ImageJ library [Rasband (1997-2006)] and offers a plug-in extension system to add new functions to manipulate images, align grid and quantify spots. It is appropriate for daily laboratory use and also as a framework for new algorithms.", "paper_title": "AGScan: a pluggable microarray image quantification software based on the ImageJ library", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400056"}
