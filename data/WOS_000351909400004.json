This paper takes an ecological or action-oriented perspective of the use of learning analytics in higher education, drawing on research sources in psychology, humancomputer interaction and visual analytics. We unpack the circumstances during the learning interactions of academics with course materials and students where analytics could trigger or influence action. This leads to a framework based around different academic timescales, and the strategies for synchronising the recognition of need with the potential for execution of teaching and learning interventions.", "paper_title": "Learning Analytics for the Academic: An Action Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000351909400004"}
