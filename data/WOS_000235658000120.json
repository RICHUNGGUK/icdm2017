It focuses on water quality and the ecosystem health of our freshwater, estuarine and marine systems through the implementation of actions by individual partners and the collective oversight of a regional work program that assists partners to prioritise their investments and address emerging issues, This regional program includes monitoring, reporting, marketing and communication, development of decision support tools, research that is directed to problem solving, and maintaining extensive consultative and engagement arrangements. The Partnership has produced information-based outcomes which have led to significant cost savings in the protection of water quality and ecosystem resources by its stakeholders. This has been achieved by: providing a clear focus for management actions that has ownership of governments, industry and community; targeted scientific research to address issues requiring appropriate management actions; management actions based on a sound understanding of the waterways and rigorous public consultation; and, development and implementation of a strategy that incorporates commitments from all levels of stakeholders. While focusing on our waterways, the Partnership's approach includes addressing catchment management issues particularly relating to the management of diffuse pollution sources in both urban and rural landscapes as well as point source loads. We are now working with other stakeholders to develop a framework for integrated water management that will link water quality and water quantity goals and priorities.", "paper_title": "Healthy waterways: Healthy catchments - An integrated research/management program to understand and reduce impacts of sediments and nutrients on waterways in Queensland, Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000120"}
