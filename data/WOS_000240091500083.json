It is necessary to select and implement innovative tools able to handle the huge amount of available data concerning territorial systems in order to extract useful information from them to enhance the quality of evaluation procedure for urban/territorial planning. This paper selects some tools derived from Artificial Intelligence, and incorporated GIS through the elaboration of various types of available data, to extract and build knowledge directly from experimental data and also to represent the extracted knowledge very effectively and communicatively, in the form of sets of spatial transformation rules. It describes the structure of the data mining tools which are most suitable for applications in the field of urban planning, aimed at discovering the transformation rules driving the evolution of cities in special of metropolitan in analysis.", "paper_title": "Developing methodologies of knowledge discovery and data mining to investigate metropolitan land use evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500083"}
