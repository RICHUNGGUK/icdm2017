Direct Curvature Scale Space (DCSS) is defined as CSS that results from convolving the curvature of a curve with a Gaussian kernel directly. Recently a theory of DCSS in corner detection has been established. In the present paper the DCSS theory is considered to transform the DCSS image of a given curve into a tree organization, and then corners on the curve are detected and located in a multiscale sense. Experiments are conducted to show that the DOSS corner detector can work equally well as the CSS corner detector does on curves with multiple-size features, however, at much less computational cost.", "paper_title": "Direct Curvature Scale Space in corner detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100025"}
