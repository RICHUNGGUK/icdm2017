In this paper, a novel saliency detection model is introduced by utilizing low-level features obtained from the wavelet transform domain. Firstly, wavelet transform is employed to create the multi-scale feature maps which can represent different features from edge to texture. Then, we propose a computational model for the saliency map from these features. The proposed model aims to modulate local contrast at a location with its global saliency computed based on the likelihood of the features, and the proposed model considers local center-surround differences and global contrast in the final saliency map. Experimental evaluation depicts the promising results from the proposed model by outperforming the relevant state of the art saliency detection models.", "paper_title": "A Saliency Detection Model Using Low-Level Features Based on Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000312646600008"}
