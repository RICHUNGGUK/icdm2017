Although the detection of many SSH attacks in a flow-based fashion is fairly straightforward, no insight is typically provided in whether an attack was successful. We address this shortcoming by presenting a detection algorithm for the flow-based detection of compromises, i.e., hosts that have been compromised during an attack. Our algorithm has been implemented as part of our open-source IDS SSHCure and validated using almost 100 servers, workstations and honeypots, featuring an accuracy close to 100%.", "paper_title": "SSH Compromise Detection using NetFlow/IPFIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000343986300006"}
