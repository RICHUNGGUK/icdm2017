This has opened up an important area of research to deal with the issues involved in DVS system for efficient collection and transmission of large scale video streams from the cameras at the guarded sites, to the end users in possibly constrained network conditions. In this paper, we propose a framework based on content-based video classification and scalable compression scheme to provide a robust bandwidth efficient video transmission for DVS. The scheme builds on a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based Color-Set Partitioning for Hierarchical Trees (CSPIHT) coding to obtain a scalable bitstream. Wavelet domain segmentation and compression assists in development of a DVS architecture. The architecture includes a novel module for dynamic allocation of Network bandwidth based on the current available resources and constraints. Different frame constituents are optimally coded based on their relative significance, perceptual quality, and available estimate of network bandwidth. Experimental result over different video sequences and simulations for Network conditions demonstrate the efficient performance of the approach.", "paper_title": "Efficient compression and network adaptive video coding for distributed video surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189100009"}
