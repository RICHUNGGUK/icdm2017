In this paper, we propose a multiscale and multidirection TMF model for nonstationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image multiclass segmentation in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain, named as NSCT-TMF model. NSCT-TMF model is capable of capturing the contextual information of image content in the spatial and scale spaces effectively by the construction of multiscale energy functions. And the derived multiscale and multidirection likelihoods of NSCT-TMF model can capture the dependencies of NSCT coefficients across scale and directions. In this way, the proposed model is able to achieve multiscale information fusion in terms of image configuration and features in underlying labeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that due to the effective propagation of the contextual information, NSCT-TMF model turns out to be more robust against speckle noise and improves the performance of nonstationary SAR image segmentation.
