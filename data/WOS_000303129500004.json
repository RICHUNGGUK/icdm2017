However, exhaustive search for the global optimum is NP-hard. Iterative procedure such as k-means can be used to seek one of the local minima. Unfortunately, it is easily trapped into degenerate local minima when the prototypes of clusters are ill-initialized. In this paper, we restate the optimization problem of kernel-based clustering in an online learning framework, whereby a conscience mechanism is easily integrated to tackle the ill-initialization problem and faster convergence rate is achieved. Thus, we propose a novel approach termed conscience online learning (COLL). For each randomly taken data point, our method selects the winning prototype based on the conscience mechanism to bias the ill-initialized prototype to avoid degenerate local minima and efficiently updates the winner by the online learning rule. Therefore, it can more efficiently obtain smaller distortion error than k-means with the same initialization. The rationale of the proposed COLL method is experimentally analyzed. Then, we apply the COLL method to the applications of digit clustering and video clustering. The experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement over existing kernel-based clustering methods.", "paper_title": "Conscience online learning: an efficient approach for robust kernel-based clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000303129500004"}
