Distinct construction operations must be identified and associated with construction activities, so that they can be related to construction plans. Earlier research has indicated that construction equipment can be monitored conveniently and that individual equipment operations can be isolated and characterized. In this work, an approach has been developed for unique association of isolated equipment operations with planned construction activities. The approach is based oil comparison of the values of various characteristics, calculated for each equipment operation, against preset filters of characteristic values for all expected basic construction activities. The composition of the set of characteristics is different for each data stream monitored and is dependent on the nature of the construction activities. The method has the distinct advantage of ensuring the uniqueness of each filter within the collection of filters when the system is calibrated at the start of any project, rather than during online data processing. In this way, rapid and accurate interpretation of monitored data can be guaranteed. The method was tested using data collected during construction of a high-rise office tower.", "paper_title": "Interpretation of automatically monitored lifting equipment data for project control", "paper_id": "WOS:000235525800005"}
