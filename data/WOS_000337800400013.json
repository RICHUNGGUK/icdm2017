Devising a theoretical analysis of the micro-architecture model for the power/performance on CMPs is still a challenge. This paper addresses this problem by (1) introducing an analytical model for measuring the power and performance of a processor quantitatively, (2) analyzing the effects of resource division on power consumption and performance when executing a given benchmark, and (3) predicting the optimum number of cores to run the benchmark on. Our proposed analytically derived results show that in order to achieve power/performance gains, the optimum number of cores must be between 8 and 16.", "paper_title": "An analytical study of resource division and its impact on power and performance of multi-core processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000337800400013"}
