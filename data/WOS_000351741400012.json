The reversed nested Miller compensation technique is used to stabilize the proposed OTA, allowing the slew rate enhancement to be achieved by using class AB input and output stages. A flipped-voltage follower cell in the first stage in combination with a switched-capacitor level shifter in the last stage are utilized to implement the class AB operation. Circuit level simulation results are provided using HSPICE and a 90 nm CMOS technology which show 306 % enhancement in the large-signal FoM with approximately the same power dissipation compared to the class A OTA. The achieved settling time with 0.02 % accuracy for the proposed class AB and conventional class A OTAs are 7.5 and 15.3 ns, respectively.", "paper_title": "A three-stage class AB operational amplifier with enhanced slew rate for switched-capacitor circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400012"}
