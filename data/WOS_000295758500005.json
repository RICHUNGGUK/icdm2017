Out-of-band monitoring, i.e., deploying dedicated monitors and transmitting monitoring traffic using a separate channel, does not require instrumenting sensor nodes, and hence is flexible (can be added on top of any application) and energy conserving (not consuming resources of the sensor nodes). In this paper, we study fault-tolerant out-of-band monitoring for wireless sensor networks. Our goal is to place a minimum number of monitors in a sensor network so that all sensor nodes are monitored by k distinct monitors, and each monitor serves no more than w sensor nodes. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. For small-scale network, we formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, and obtain the optimal solution. For large-scale network, the ILP is not applicable, and we propose two algorithms to solve it. The first one is a In(kn) approximation algorithm, where n is the number of sensor nodes. The second is a simple heuristic scheme that has much shorter running time. We evaluate our algorithms using extensive simulation. In small-scale networks, the latter two algorithms provide results close to the optimal solution from the ILP for relatively dense networks. In large-scale networks, the performance of these two algorithms are similar, and for relatively dense networks, the number of monitors required by both algorithms is close to a lower bound.
