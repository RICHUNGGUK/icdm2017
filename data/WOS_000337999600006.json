The goal of this project is to build a model in which all the involved processes can be simulated with the consideration of all the parameters and constraints. The simulation model is used as a tool for the comparison of present manual setup and future automated setup for the production management of bobbin distribution in yarn rewinding process in terms of delays and costs. Since, the manual operation involves defaults, improper time management, errors and with the growing competitiveness globally, the companies in Europe need to automate as much as possible their production lines. The expected impacts are to increase the productivity and profitability, to have the possibility to customize the production, to develop production tools, implementation of the lean manufacturing tools.
