EFLoM is developed to handle the issue of local mobility management. To enable MN to move across networks within one domain, EFLoM employs three network entities: Local Anchor Router (LAR), Wireless Access Gateway (WAG) and Mobile Node (MN). With the help of the three network entities, EFLoM can reduce the handover delay for MN. Moreover, EFLoM uses an IP header swapping mechanism to avoid the traffic overhead and improve the network's throughput. To evaluate the performance of EFLoM, several experiments are carried out comparing EFLoM with Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) (Soliman et al., 2008) [1] and Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) (Gundavelli et al., 2008; Kempf, 2007a, 2007b; Vogt and Kempf, 2007) [2-5] - both of which are common local mobility management protocols - in terms of handover delay, throughput and signaling cost. Analysis and simulation results show good performance for EFLoM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
