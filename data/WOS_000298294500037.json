In this paper, we develop a gradual type system for class-based object-oriented languages with generics. We introduce a special type to denote dynamically typed parts of a program; unlike dynamic types introduced to C(#) 4.0, however, our type system allows for more seamless integration of dynamically and statically typed code. We formalize a gradual type system for Featherweight GJ with a semantics given by a translation that inserts explicit run-time checks. The type system guarantees that statically typed parts of a program do not go wrong, even if it includes dynamically typed parts. We also describe a basic implementation scheme for Java and report preliminary performance evaluation.", "paper_title": "Gradual Typing for Generics", "paper_id": "WOS:000298294500037"}
