In our experiments, the visual stimulus was a virtual ball falling at 9.8 m/s(2) for any tactile stimulus. Tactile stimuli were shifted by -60, 0 and +60 ms, relative to the visual stimulus. Results showed that the subjects were not aware of the timing shifts, but still changed the timing of their tactile responses. This adaptation was also found to cause a shift in the subjects' judgment of visuotactile simultaneity by approximately 60 ms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
