Therefore, even for small instances with large demands, it is difficult to compute FFD/BFD solutions. We present pattern-based methods that overcome the main problems of conventional heuristics in cutting stock problems by representing the solution in a much more compact format Using our pattern-based heuristics, FFD/BFD solutions for extremely large cutting stock instances, with billions of items, can be found in a very short amount of time.
