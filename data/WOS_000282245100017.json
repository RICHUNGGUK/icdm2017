Our design includes a link controller, modem, RF transceiver, Sub-Band Codec (SBC), Expanded Instruction Set Computer (ESIC) processor, and peripherals. To decrease power consumption of the proposed SOC, we reduce data transfer using a dual-port memory, including a power management unit, and a clock gated approach. We also address some of issues and benefits of reusable and unified environment on a centralized data structure and SOC verification platform. This includes flexibility in meeting the final requirements using technology-independent tools wherever possible in various processes and for projects. The other aims of this work are to minimize design efforts by avoiding the same work done twice by different people and to reuse the similar environment and platform for different projects. This chip occupies a die size of 30 mm(2) in 0.18 mu m CMOS, and the worst-case current of the total chip is 54 mA.", "paper_title": "A Low Power SOC Architecture for the V2.0+EDR Bluetooth Using a Unified Verification Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245100017"}
