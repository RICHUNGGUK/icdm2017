To achieve this goal a new working expression for hyper-hardness is developed and analyzed. It transpired from this analysis that hyper-hardness, just like hardness, can measure the reactivity or the stability of electron systems. Interestingly, positive values of hyper-hardness point to quite stable species such as noble gases and molecules. On the other hand, radicals almost always display large negative values of hyper-hardness.", "paper_title": "Is hyper-hardness more chemically relevant than expected?", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600025"}
