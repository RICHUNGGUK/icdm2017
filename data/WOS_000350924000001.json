The IT2 fuzzy system and the IT2 state-feedback controller share different membership functions. Firstly, considering the mismatched membership functions, the IT2 fuzzy model and the 112 state-feedback sampled-data controller are constructed. Secondly, based on Lyapunov stability theory, an IT2 state-feedback sampled-data controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. The actuator failure is considered in the control systems. The resulting closed-loop system is reliable since the designed controller can guarantee the asymptotic stability and H-infinity performance when the actuator experiences failure. The existence condition of the IT2 fuzzy Hoc, sampled-data controller can be expressed by solving a convex optimization problem. An inverted pendulum model is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new design techniques.
