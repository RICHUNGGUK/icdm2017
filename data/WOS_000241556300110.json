In a freehand US imaging system, US probe calibration is typically required to construct a 3D image of the patient's anatomy from a set of 2D US images. Most of the current calibration techniques concern primarily with the precision and accuracy. However, for computer-assisted surgeries that may require a calibration task inside the operating room (OR), many other important aspects have to be considered besides accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel system for automated calibration that is optimized for the OR usage with real-time feedback and control of the calibration accuracy. We have also designed a novel N-wire phantom, with greatly reduced complexity to facilitate mass production without compromising the accuracy and robustness.", "paper_title": "Automated 3D freehand ultrasound calibration with real-time accuracy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300110"}
