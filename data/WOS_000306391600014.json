However, network on chips have emerged as a promising technology to tackle the on-chip communication constraints. Likewise, the reliability issues have become the salient problem, since regarding to the inaccessible failures of on-chip elements, there must be some levels of embedded fault tolerance techniques. In this paper, an innovated technique is revealed providing fault tolerance in the on-chip networks over single and multiple permanent switch failures. The experimental results achieved by the system simulation in SystemC TLM environment are validated with the mathematical analysis modeled for system reliability that we extend in this paper, which demonstrate the extensive reliability enhancement of this paradigm. Along with the system improvement, silicon area overhead is calculated utilizing VHDL low level simulation and Orion synthesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
