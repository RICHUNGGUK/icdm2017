Using this technology, the authors demonstrate low-loss silicon waveguides (2.34 db/cm), comparable to conventional SOI channel waveguides. The ease and flexibility of this fabrication method simplify integration of electronics and photonics and make it a possible alternative to SOI-based technology for implementation of silicon-photonic devices and systems.", "paper_title": "MONOLITHIC SILICON WAVEGUIDES IN STANDARD SILICON", "paper_id": "WOS:000315007400006"}
