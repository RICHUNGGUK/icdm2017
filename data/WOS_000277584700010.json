It was an open problem, explicitly mentioned in several papers, whether any of these problems is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the clique-width, that is, solvable in time g(k) . n(O(1)) on n-vertex graphs of clique-width k, where g is some function of k only. Our results imply that the running time O(n(f(k))) of many clique-width-based algorithms is essentially the best we can hope for (up to a widely believed assumption from parameterized complexity, namely FPT not equal W[1]).", "paper_title": "INTRACTABILITY OF CLIQUE-WIDTH PARAMETERIZATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584700010"}
