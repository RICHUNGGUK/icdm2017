The oriented chromatic number of G is the minimum order of an oriented graph H such that G has a homomorphism to H. The oriented chromatic index of G is the minimum order of an oriented graph H such that the line-digraph of G has a homomorphism to H. In this paper, we determine for every k >= 3 the oriented chromatic number and the oriented chromatic index of the class of oriented outerplanar graphs with girth at least k. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
