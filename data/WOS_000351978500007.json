The model includes nine parameters in need of calibration. A master-slave swarms, shuffling evolution algorithm based on self-adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimization (MSSE-SDPSO) is proposed to derive model parameters. In comparison with SCE-UA, PSO, MSSE-PSO and MSSE-SPSO algorithms, MSSE-SDPSO has faster convergence and more stable performance. The model is used to simulate discharge in the Luanhe River basin, a semiarid region. Compared with the SimHyd and SMAR models, HIMS model has the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) and smallest relative errors (RE) of volumetric fitness for the periods of calibration and verification. In addition, the studies indicate that the HIMS model with all-gauge data improves runoff prediction compared with single-gauge data. A distributed HIMS model performs better than a lumped one. Finally, the Morris method is used to analyze model parameters sensitivity for the objective functions NSE and RE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
