We show that this new sequence is balanced if p = q. For an arbitrary odd prime p and an arbitrary power q of an odd prime with gcd(p,q-1) = 1 we determine the exact values of its (periodic) autocorrelation function and deduce an upper bound on its aperiodic autocorrelation function showing that it is small compared to its period.", "paper_title": "Autocorrelation of Legendre-Sidelnikov Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000275999500020"}
