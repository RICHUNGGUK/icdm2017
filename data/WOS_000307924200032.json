Different data layers of geological, geophysical and geochemical themes are integrated to evaluate the Now Chun porphyry-Cu deposit, located in the Kerman province of Iran, and to prepare a prospectivity map for mineral exploration. The SVM method, a data-driven approach to pattern recognition, had a correct-classification rate of 52.38% for twenty-one boreholes divided into five classes. The results of the study indicated the capability of SVM as a supervised learning algorithm tool for the predictive mapping of mineral prospects. Multi-classification of the prospect for detailed study could increase the resolution of the prospectivity map and decrease the drilling risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
