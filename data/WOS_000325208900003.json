The identification scheme is based on the Haar wavelet kernel and possesses a simple and compact form. The convergence of the algorithm is established and the asymptotic rate of convergence (independent of the input density smoothness) is shown for piecewise-Lipschitz nonlinearities. The numerical stability of the algorithm is verified. Simulation experiments for a small and moderate number of input-output data are presented and discussed to illustrate the applicability of the routine.", "paper_title": "A SIMPLE SCHEME FOR SEMI-RECURSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF HAMMERSTEIN SYSTEM NONLINEARITY BY HAARWAVELETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325208900003"}
