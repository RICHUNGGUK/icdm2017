We determine the threshold condition for creating solitons with such initial conditions in these integrable, discrete versions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the case of one-, two-, three- and four-site barriers. We find that for square barriers in the scalar case, it is impossible to generate a soliton with a single-site excitation, while only one soliton can be produced from it two-site and three-site square barrier. Finally. in the four-site case, there appear to be two thresholds. one leading to a soliton and a second one to a breathing soliton. We illustrate the differences of the vector case from the scalar one for initial conditions with disjoint Support between the components, and also discuss the case of non-square barriers. The analytical findings are corroborated by numerical simulations in all the presented cases. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
