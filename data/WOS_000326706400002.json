The bidomain model considers current flowing along (longitudinal) and across (transverse) sheets of cardiac fibres, as well as between these sheets (normal), in both the extracellular and intracellular domains, which leads to six conductivity values. To match experimental studies, such a method must be able to determine these six conductivity values, not just the four where it is assumed that the transverse and normal conductivities are equal. This study presents a mathematical model, solution technique, multi-electrode array and two-pass inversion method, which can be used to retrieve all six conductivities from measurements of electrical potential made on the array. Simulated measurements of potential, to which noise is added, are used to demonstrate the ability of the method to retrieve the conductivity values. It is found that not only is it possible to accurately retrieve all six conductivity values, as well as a value for fibre rotation angle, but that the accuracy of such retrievals is comparable to the accuracy found in a previous study when only four conductivities (and fibre rotation) were retrieved.", "paper_title": "A multi-electrode array and inversion technique for retrieving six conductivities from heart potential measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000326706400002"}
