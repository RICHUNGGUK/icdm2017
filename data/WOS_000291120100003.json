Three fully coupled governing equations considering force equilibrium, pore water transport and chemical transport are presented and solved using the transient finite element method. The proposed approach is verified via consideration of chemo-osmotic consolidation of a compacted clay landfill liner and then applied to investigation of a hypothetical case with a local leachate leak in the compacted clay liner. An assessment of the impact of the two-dimensional nature of the system is made. The consolidation process is found to be dominated by osmotic consolidation in the early stages and subsequently by chemical consolidation. It is found that the surface settlement and the leachate concentration in the compacted clay liner may be highly overestimated by a one-dimensional analysis. Moreover, the peak negative excess pore pressure predicted by the two-dimensional solution remains in a shallow region under the leak while in the one-dimensional solution it moves progressively downwards.
