Mathematical models are derived via left and right trapezoidal membership functions for each input, singleton or triangular membership functions for output, algebraic product triangular norm, different combinations of triangular co-norms and inference methods, and center of sums (COS) defuzzification method. Properties of these structures are studied to examine their suitability for control application. For the structure which is suitable for control, bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability proof is presented. An approach to design fuzzy PID controllers is given. Finally, some numerical examples along with their simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the simplest fuzzy PID controllers.", "paper_title": "The simplest fuzzy PID controllers: mathematical models and stability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237857600011"}
