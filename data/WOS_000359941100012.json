A mutative scale chaos optimization algorithm is employed in this study to locate the noncircular critical slip surface with Spencer's method being employed to compute the factor of safety. Four examples from the literature-one homogeneous slope and three layered slopes-are employed to identify the efficiency and accuracy of this approach. Results indicate that the algorithm is flexible and that although it does not generally provide the minimum FS, it provides results that are close to the minimum, an improvement over other solutions proposed in the literature and with small relative errors with respect to other minimum factor of safety (FS) values reported in the literature.
