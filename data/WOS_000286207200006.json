Several methods for BSS using the statistical properties of original sources have been proposed, for a famous one, such as non-Gaussianity, which leads to independent component analysis (ICA). This paper proposes a blind source separation method based on a novel statistical property: the quadratic form innovation of original sources, which includes linear predictability and energy (square) predictability as special cases. A gradient learning algorithm is presented by minimizing a loss function of the quadratic form innovation. Also, we give the stability analysis of the proposed BSS algorithm. Simulations verify the efficient implementation of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Blind Source Separation Using Quadratic form Innovation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286207200006"}
