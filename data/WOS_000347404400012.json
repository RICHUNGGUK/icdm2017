The configurations of multiple bodies and offshore structures are different from those of a single ship. In particular, the topological structure of the free surfaces becomes complicated due to the multiple floating bodies, resulting in multiple classifications for the free surfaces based on their genus. The multi-body configuration consists of two floating bodies placed in two configurations, i.e., side by side and tandem, which would generate two holes in the free surface. For the offshore structure case, multiple holes are generated in the free-surface domain due to the legs of the offshore structure. In this work, strategies for generating body and free-surface panels are provided, and the results are analyzed. A software prototype that implements the proposed methods is developed to provide efficient panel generation for multiple bodies and offshore structures. Examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can be successfully used for seakeeping analysis of multiple bodies and offshore structures.", "paper_title": "Panel generation framework for seakeeping analysis of multiple bodies and offshore structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000347404400012"}
