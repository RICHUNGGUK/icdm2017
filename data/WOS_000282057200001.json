The algorithm is designed as a wrapper around a Random Forest classification algorithm. It iteratively removes the features which are proved by a statistical test to be less relevant than random probes. The Boruta package provides a convenient interface to the algorithm. The short description of the algorithm and examples of its application are presented.", "paper_title": "Feature Selection with the Boruta Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000282057200001"}
