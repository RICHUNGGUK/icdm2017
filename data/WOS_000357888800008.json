To reach an acceptable level of security, Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computer and Human Apart or simply CAPTCHA as a security preserving tool has been tailored for situations that need to prevent bots from doing a specific action; for example, signing up and downloading. Simultaneously, it should be also designed in such a way to allow humans to perform the same action. Despite its advantageous applications, there are several important issues such as security, usability, and accessibility that make its use controversial. In this paper, attempts were made to do a comprehensive review on various aspects and state-of-the-art of CAPTCHA in general and its alternatives in particular to help researchers easily focus on specific issues for the sake of proposing new solutions and ideas. Regarding the advancement in CAPTCHA development, new classifications were proposed to categorize different variations of CAPTCHAs and their problems and then compare them. Moreover, different types of CAPTCHAs' alternatives were classified and evaluated by introducing several proposed measures. This evaluation could come in handy for future studies that aim to develop new techniques for overcoming current deficiencies.
