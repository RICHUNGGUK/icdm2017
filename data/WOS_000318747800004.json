We explore several recently developed action representation and information retrieval techniques in a human action retrieval system. These techniques include various means of local feature extraction; soft-assignment clustering; Bag-of-Words, vocabulary guided and spatio-temporal pyramid matches for action representation; SVMs and ABRS-SVMs for relevance feedback. Successful application of relevance feedback in particular will result in far more practical systems. We evaluate the performance of several combinations of the above techniques in three realistic action datasets: UCF Sports, UCF YouTube and HOHA2. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
