The proposed method deals with the joint use of spectral and spatial information provided in hyperspectral images. Additive morphological decomposition (AMD) based on morphological operators is proposed. AMD defines a scale-space decomposition for multivariate images without any loss of information. AMD is modeled as a tensor structure and tensor principal components analysis is compared as dimensional reduction algorithm versus classic approach. Experimental comparison shows that the proposed algorithm can provide better performance for the pixel classification of hyperspectral image than many other well-known techniques.
