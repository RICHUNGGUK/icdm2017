While monitoring the stream environment, sensors are attached to the stream side to collect the sensed data and transmit the data back to the sink. The stream environment can be scaled in several similar environments. This type of geographic limitation not only exists in a stream environment but also on streets, roads, and trails. This study presents an effective node-selection scheme to enhance the efficiency of saving power and coverage of solar-powered WSNs in a stream environment. Analysis of the sensor deployment in the stream environment permits sensors to be classified into different segments, and then allows the selection of active nodes for building inter-stream connections, inter-segment connections, and intra-segment connections. Based on these connections, the number of active nodes and transmitted packets is minimized. Simulation results show that this scheme can significantly increase the energy efficiency and maintain the monitoring area in solar-powered WSNs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
