Nature of problem: The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) is used for the evaluation of prediction methods in various disciplines like meteorology, geophysics, complex system physics, medicine etc. The estimation of the significance of a binary prediction method, however, remains a cumbersome task and is usually done by repeating the calculations by Monte Carlo. The FORTRAN code provided here simplifies this problem by evaluating the significance of binary predictions for a family of ellipses which are based on confidence ellipses and cover the whole ROC space. Solution method: Using the statistics of random binary predictions for a given value of the predictor threshold s(t), one can construct the corresponding confidence ellipses. The envelope of these corresponding confidence ellipses is estimated when st varies from 0 to 1. This way a new family of ellipses is obtained, named k-ellipses, which covers the whole ROC plane and leads to a well defined Area Under the Curve (AUC). For the latter quantity, Mason and Graham [1] have shown that it follows the Mann-Whitney U-statistics [2] which can be applied [3] for the estimation of the statistical significance of each k-ellipse. As the transformation is invertible, any point on the ROC plane corresponds to a unique value of k, thus to a unique p-value to obtain this point by chance. The present FORTRAN code provides this p-value field on the ROC plane as well as the k-ellipses corresponding to the (p =)10%, 5% and 1% significance levels using as input the number of the positive (P) and negative (Q) cases to be predicted. Unusual features: In some machines, the compiler directive -O2 or -O3 should be used to avoid NaN's in some points of the p-field along the diagonal.
