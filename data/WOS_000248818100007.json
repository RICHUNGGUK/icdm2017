It is shown that no equalizer estimator is available in the statistical decision problem under consideration. It is pointed out that the problem can be solved by determining the Bayes estimator with respect to a least favorable distribution having finite support. In this situation, the optimal estimator and the least favorable distribution can be determined only by using numerical methods. Some properties of the minimax estimators and the corresponding least favorable prior distributions are provided depending on the parameters of the loss function. The properties presented are exploited in computing the minimax estimators and the least favorable distributions. The results obtained can be applied to determine minimax estimators of a cumulative distribution function and minimax estimators of a survival function.", "paper_title": "Minimax estimation of a probability of success under LINEX loss", "paper_id": "WOS:000248818100007"}
