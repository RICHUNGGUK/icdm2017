It is designed to efficiently find similar regions between two sequences that have biological significance. However, because the size of genomic databases is growing rapidly, the computation time of BLAST, when performing a complete genomic database search, is continuously increasing. Thus, there is a clear need to accelerate this process. In this paper, we present a new approach for genomic sequence database scanning utilizing reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware. In order to derive an efficient structure for BLASTN, we propose a reconfigurable architecture to accelerate the computation of the word-matching stage. The experimental results show that the FPGA implementation achieves a speedup around one order of magnitude compared to the NCBI BLASTN software running on a general purpose computer.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Accelerator for the Word-Matching Stage of BLASTN", "paper_id": "WOS:000316801700006"}
