In this paper, we propose the efficient dynamics models for the real-time simulation of soft fabrics interacting with water, including multi-soaking effect and underwater dynamics. The multi-soaking effect of soft fabrics is modeled based on the physics processes. Further, we develop the optimized mass-spring model that supports the large flow forces interacting with the fabrics underwater. The fabric spring forces are linearly derived and integrated with GPU-CUDA acceleration, feasible for real-time VR applications with large set of fabric particles.
