These samples arise as a perturbation of regular samples. The starting point is the generalized regular sampling theory which allows any function in a shift-invariant space to be recovered from the samples at{rn}(n epsilon Z) of s filtered versions L(1)f, L(2)f,..., L(s)f of f, where the number of channels s is greater or equal than the sampling period r. These regular samples can be expressed as the frame coefficients of a function related to f in L-2( 0, 1) with respect to certain frame for L-2( 0, 1). The irregular samples are also obtained as a perturbation of the aforesaid frame. As a natural consequence, the irregular sampling results arise from the theory of perturbation of frames. The paper concludes by putting the theory to work in some spline examples where Kadec-type results are obtained.", "paper_title": "Generalized irregular sampling in shift-invariant spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008400001"}
