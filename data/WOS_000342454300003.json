Since the Green IT is one of the key issues of the science, we suggested the power saving scheme by extending the information and the event service of the MIH framework to reduce the number of full scanning. We proposed the criteria to select the update MT to quantify the power consumption alongside various network scanning methods. Since the frequent and multiple network scanning incurred by small mobile terminals (MT) is considerable, the scanning avoidance is essential for the framework we suggest. The MIH Information Service (MIIS) provides many usable factors and features for the scanning avoidance. However, because of the absence of the criteria to select the update node, these values are not actually usable. Therefore, we suggest an Energy Efficient Function, which tests the validity of MIIS values and makes a decision on whether to avoid the scanning or not.", "paper_title": "A power-efficient vertical handover with MIH-based network scanning through consistency check", "paper_id": "WOS:000342454300003"}
