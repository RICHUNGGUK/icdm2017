However, certain deficiencies prevent these programs from reaching their goals. Smart meters as a mechanism could help the electric system to reach the highest demand-side management goals which are inaccessible through today's methods. On the other hand, realization of smart meters in a system would be very costly. In this situation, identifying the most influential buses to implement the infrastructures of a smart grid is of highest importance. In this paper, after a short overview of demand response programs and problems facing them, a smart meter is introduced as a solution to these problems. As a test grid, the IEEE 57-bus network has been chosen to compare the results of the execution of a normal time of use program and real-time pricing program available in a smart grid. In order to execute the mentioned programs in this system, 10 buses have been selected as the most influential buses using a generation shift factor method. The execution of time of use and real-time pricing programs on the selected buses have been simulated using a demand response model. Finally, the time of use program and the real-time pricing program in a smart grid environment have been compared with respect to load shape modification, load factor, price curve, and 'Expected Power Not Supplied'.", "paper_title": "Real-time pricing program in a smart grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000318281000006"}
