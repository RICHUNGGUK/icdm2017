This study introduces a new methodology for quantifying the reliability of all-ceramic crowns based on the stress strength interference theory and finite element models. The variables selected for the reliability analysis include the magnitude of the occlusal contact area, the occlusal load and the residual thermal stress. The calculated reliabilities of crowns under different loading conditions showed that too small occlusal contact areas or too great a difference of the thermal coefficient between veneer and core layer led to high failure possibilities. There results were consistent with many previous reports. Therefore, the methodology is shown to be a valuable method for analyzing the reliabilities of the restorations in the complicated oral environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
