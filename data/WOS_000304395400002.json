A unique feature of the framework is that it provides mechanisms to allow agents to negotiate so as to improve an initial cluster configuration. The framework encourages a two phase approach to clustering. During the first phase clustering agents bid for records in the input data and form an initial cluster configuration. In the second phase (the negotiation phase) agents pass individual records to each other so as to improve the initial configuration. The communication framework and its operation is fully described in terms of the performatives used and from an algorithmic perspective. The reported evaluation was conducted using benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that the supported agent negotiation produces enhanced clustering results.", "paper_title": "A framework for Multi-Agent Based Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000304395400002"}
