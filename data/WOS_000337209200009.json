Thus, the new theory can take into account the viscoelastic effect of the solid skeleton. After the establishment of appropriate boundary and initial conditions, a time-domain series solution for the transient response of a fluid-saturated single-layer poroviscoelastic medium is obtained by using the finite Fourier transform and the corresponding analytical inverse transform. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the exact solution and to investigate the influence of the viscosity coefficient, permeability coefficient, and load frequency on the transient response of a fluid-saturated single-layer poroviscoelastic medium.
