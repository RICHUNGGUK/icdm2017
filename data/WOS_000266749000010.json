Define two sets N(1)(e vertical bar G) and N(2)(e vertical bar G) as N(1)(e vertical bar G)={x is an element of V(G)vertical bar d(x,u)<d(x,v)} and N(2)(e vertical bar G)={x is an element of V(G)vertical bar d(x,y)<d(x,u)}. The number of elements of N(1)(e vertical bar G) and N(2)(e vertical bar G) are denoted by n(1)(e vertical bar G) and n(2)(e vertical bar G) respectively. The Szeged index of the graph G is defined as Sz(G) = Sigma(c is an element of E(G))n(1)(e vertical bar G)n(2)(e vertical bar G).
