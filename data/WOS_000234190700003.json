In other cases, rebar suppliers accept hard copies of blueprints and return CAD files featuring different design layers and elements. Under this arrangement, communication between project participants is fragmented and depends solely on the direct input of the participants in a specific task. This paper proposes a business-to-business (13213) e-Work system to improve the approval process for rebar estimation data. This system is composed of extensible markup language-based databases that support essential tasks of the approval process such as design and revision of structural drawings, bidding, shop drawing preparation, revision, and correction, and rebar delivery. The performance of the proposed system is compared with existing industry practices based on data obtained from structural designers, contractors, and rebar suppliers.", "paper_title": "Implementing a B2B e-Work system to the approval process of rebar design and estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234190700003"}
