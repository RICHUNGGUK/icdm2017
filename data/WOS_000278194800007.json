The influences of the initial Bell state of the atoms, the intensity of field, the coupling strength of interaction between atoms and the initial degree of the entanglement between the two-mode fields on the atomic entropy and on negativity are discussed by using numerical calculations. It turns out that the two atoms can keep their initial maximal entangled state while the two-atom and the two-mode field keep their initial disentangled state if the two atoms are initially in vertical bar beta(11)>. Therefore, for the initial atomic state vertical bar beta(00)> or vertical bar beta(01)>, the increasing of the field intensity can be a help to prepare the atom-field entanglement, and for vertical bar beta(10)>, it is beneficial for the atom-atom entanglement. Meanwhile, for the initial atomic state vertical bar beta(10)> and vertical bar beta(01)>, strong coupling strength of interaction between atoms is beneficial for the atom-atom entanglement, but for vertical bar beta(00)>, it can be helpful for the atom-field entanglement.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT IN THE SYSTEM OF ATOMS IN BELL STATE INTERACTING WITH THE TWO-MODE ODD-EVEN ENTANGLED COHERENT FIELD", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194800007"}
