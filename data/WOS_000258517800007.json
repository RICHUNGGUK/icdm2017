One of the most important problems of fault-tolerance issues lies in the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem. The primary issue surrounding BA is that fault-free processors must obtain common agreement even in cases where faults persist. In this field, the fault diagnosis protocol has been proposed so that each fault free processor detects/locates a common set of faulty processors. However, in this study, the incremental agreement is invoked to make each processor able to agreement upon executing the fault diagnosis protocol using minimal rounds of message exchange in the presence of dual failure characteristics of processors.
