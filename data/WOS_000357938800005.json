Both dynamic state and output feedback control laws are designed for achieving the property of output regulation. Sufficient conditions for the existence of these control laws are provided in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Simulation results are given to support the efficiency of the proposed distributed output regulation approach.", "paper_title": "Distributed output regulation for linear multi-agent systems with communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000357938800005"}
