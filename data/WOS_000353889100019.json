Recently, wireless charging technology has significantly advanced in terms of efficiency and functionality. This article first presents an overview and fundamentals of wireless charging. We then provide the review of standards, that is, Qi and the Alliance for Wireless Power, and highlight their communication protocols. Next, we propose a novel concept of wireless charger networking that allows chargers to be connected to facilitate information collection and control. We demonstrate the application of the wireless charger network in user-charger assignment, which clearly shows the benefit in terms of reduced costs for users to identify the best chargers to replenish energy for their mobile devices.", "paper_title": "WIRELESS CHARGER NETWORKING FOR MOBILE DEVICES: FUNDAMENTALS, STANDARDS, AND APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353889100019"}
