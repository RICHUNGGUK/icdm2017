We determine the values of control parameters, such as the sampling rate and window length, to minimize the false positive ratio, while keeping the false negative ratio sufficiently low and making the on-line processing possible. Under mild assumptions, we formulate this problem as a nonlinear program and provide its numerically feasible global optimal solution. We then conduct sampling experiments with public trace data and discuss the fundamental characteristics of the sliding window scheme with random packet sampling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
