In the industry, there are various display designs. Some of them may have positive impacts on customers while some of them may not. The selection of design parameters such as location of displays (behind steering wheel or on the center console), colors (for background and symbols/lettering), types (digital or analog), and shapes (circle, semicircle, or quadrangle) diversify display designs in the industry. In this paper, a design evaluation model (DEM) has been proposed to the relevant literature. The design characteristics of display and priorities of design parameters of displays are put forward by using the proposed model. DEM is an integrated method including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy Choquet integral. The fuzzy analytic hierarch process (AHP) is utilized to define the priorities of design parameters of displays by using subjective assessment of customers while fuzzy Choquet integral is used to determine design characteristics of displays by using linguistic evaluations of design team.", "paper_title": "Design evaluation model for display designs of automobiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600037"}
