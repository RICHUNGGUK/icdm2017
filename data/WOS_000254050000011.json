Very recently, Wang, Tang and Li proposed a new ID-based restrictive partially blind signature (ID-RPBS) and gave the security proof. In this paper, we present a cryptanalysis of the scheme and show that the signature scheme does not satisfy the property of unforgeability as claimed. More precisely, a user can forge a valid message-signature pair (ID, msg, info', sigma') instead of the original one (ID, msg, info, a), where info is the original common agreed information and info' not equal info. Therefore, it will be much dangerous if Wang-Tang-Li's ID-RPBS scheme is applied to the off-line electronic cash system. For example, a bank is supposed to issue an electronic coin (or bill) of $100 to a user, while the user can change the denomination of the coin (bill) to any value, say $100 000 000, at his will.", "paper_title": "Forgeability of Wang-Tang-Li's ID-based restrictive partially blind signature scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000254050000011"}
