The relationship among the time-varying delay, its upper bound, and their difference is taken into account. As a result, an improved linear-matrix-inequality-based delay-dependent exponential stability criterion is obtained without ignoring any terms in the derivative of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability analysis for neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183100031"}
