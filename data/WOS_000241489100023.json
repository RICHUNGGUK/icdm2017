Among the tools, motion estimation using smaller block sizes leads to higher correlation between the motion vectors of neighboring blocks. This characteristic of H.264/AVC is useful for motion vector recovery to conceal a lost macroblock. In this paper, we propose a motion vector recovery method based on optical flow in H.264/AVC video coding. We first determine the optical flow region to alleviate the complexity, and choose an initial value of flow velocity using neighboring motion vectors of a lost macroblock. The proposed method recovers the motion vectors of 4x4 blocks included in a lost macroblock using the weighted average of obtained flow velocities. Simulation results show that our proposed method gives higher objective and subjective visual qualities than conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "Temporal error concealment based on optical flow in the H.264/AVC standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100023"}
