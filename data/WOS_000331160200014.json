The work presented here develops three new ways to enhance the performance of a smart TV. The first is to design a body control system that recognizes and interprets human gestures as machine commands to control the TV. The second is to create a new social tag-based method to recommend the most suitable multimedia contents for users. Finally, a context-aware platform is implemented to consider different environmental situations to make the best recommendations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
