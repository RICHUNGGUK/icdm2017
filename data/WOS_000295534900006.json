By investigating the details of ADHOC protocol, we have discovered several unsolved problems that might lead to network failure. In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the success probability for contending nodes and prove that an adaptive frame length is quite necessary. We propose Adaptive-ADHOC (A-ADHOC) MAC protocol, which implements a robust mechanism supporting the adaptive frame length. Evaluation result shows that A-ADHOC can maintain a high contending success probability and obtain about 50% reduction of response time over original ADHOC protocol, while providing important enhancement on network scalability and robustness.", "paper_title": "A-ADHOC: An Adaptive Real-time Distributed MAC Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295534900006"}
