Monitoring network technology can provide protection for the safety and stability of power grid operation, but sensor nodes of the monitoring network will fall to failure due to environmental interference. According to the performance degradation problem caused by nodes failure in PV monitoring network, particle swarm optimization (PSO) of natural selection based on random weight is proposed in this paper to optimize monitoring performance. This method can restore the monitoring network by arousing redundant nodes. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Coverage Restoration Method for Wireless Sensor Networks of Distributed PV System", "paper_id": "WOS:000351385000001"}
