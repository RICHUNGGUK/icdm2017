We also show that invalid singular (hyper) elliptic curves can be used in mounting invalid-curve attacks on (hyper) elliptic curve cryptosystems, and make quantitative estimates of the practicality of these attacks. We thereby show that proper key validation is necessary even in cryptosystems based on hyperelliptic curves. As a byproduct, we enumerate the isomorphism classes of genus g hyperelliptic curves over a finite field by a new counting argument that is simpler than the previous methods.", "paper_title": "INVALID-CURVE ATTACKS ON (HYPER)ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOSYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000280383000001"}
