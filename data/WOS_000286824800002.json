We discover a correlation between the two variables; namely, multiple OA availability of an article has a positive impact on its citation count. The statistical analysis reveals that for every increase in the availability of OA articles, citation numbers increase by 2.348.", "paper_title": "Multiple open access availability and citation impact", "paper_id": "WOS:000286824800002"}
