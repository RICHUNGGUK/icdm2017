In some cases the law is so strict that even police forces are not allowed to gather and catalogue evidence for future reference. This paper presents an innovative solution to this problem. The authors present tools for cataloguing high- and low-level metadata of the evidence material. Furthermore, a tool for fast and accurate search for such evidence in suspects' file systems is proposed.", "paper_title": "INACT-INDECT Advanced Image Cataloguing Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000329243600007"}
