In frequency-reuse model, the users attached to Macro base station are usually viewed as primary users, and those attached to Pico base station should be regarded as cognitive radio (CR) users. As both the primary users and the CR users communicate in parallel frequency bands, the performance of the system is limited by the mutual inter-carrier interference (ICI). In order to control ICI and maximize the achievable transmission rate of the CR users, an effective power allocation scheme is proposed to maximize the transmission rate of the CR users under a given interference threshold prescribed by the primary users. By transforming this suboptimal solution into an innovative matrix expression, the algorithm is easier to perform in practice. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a large performance gain in Pico cell capacity over the non-cooperative and equal power allocation schemes.", "paper_title": "Power allocation for OFDM-based cognitive heterogeneous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400010"}
