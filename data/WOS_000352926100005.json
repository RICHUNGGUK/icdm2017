Deduplication is a key mechanism to decrease the operating costs cloud providers face, due to the reduction of replicated data storage. Nonetheless, deduplication must deal with several security threats such as honest-but-curious servers or malicious users who may try to take ownership of files they are not entitled to. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art solutions present weaknesses such as not coping with honest-but-curious servers, deployment problems, or lacking a sound security analysis. In this paper we present a novel Proof of Ownership scheme that uses convergent encryption and requires neither trusted third parties nor complex key management. The experimental evaluation highlights the efficiency and feasibility of our proposal that is proven to be secure under the random oracle model in the bounded leakage setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
