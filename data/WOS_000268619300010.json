The problem formulation of the proposed ALOF is based on decomposing grid voltage signal into inner product of two vectors, namely, the vector of trigonometric functions and the vector of coefficients, corresponding to the input vector and the weight vector of the closed-loop adaptation algorithm by using least-mean-square (LMS) optimization algorithm. The coefficient of the fundamental component of the grid voltage is used as input signal for the PLL and the phase angles of the trigonometric functions are obtained from the output of the PLL recursively. The mathematical derivation of the weights updating law and the stability analysis of the ALOF-PLL are presented. Besides, the parameter selection for optimal performance is also discussed in terms of continuous domain (s-domain) analysis, discrete domain (z-domain) analysis and time domain simulations. The proposed ALOF-PLL shows the characteristic of band-pass filter at fundamental frequency and a notch filter at the harmonic frequencies. Finally, a detailed comparison with the existing single-phase and three-phase grid synchronization methods is also presented, and the proposed ALOF-PLL is found to have overwhelming advantages over the existing grid synchronization methods in terms of tracking accuracy, dynamic response and immunity to grid voltage disturbances, such as voltage sag/swell, phase-angle jump, harmonics, unbalance, random noises and frequency jump, etc. The validity and effectiveness of the ALOF-PLL is substantially confirmed by the extensive simulation results obtained from Matiab/Simulink.
