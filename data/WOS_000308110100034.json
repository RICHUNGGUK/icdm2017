Applications need more computational power and power costs are increasing. This paper studies the benefits in power consumption that come from the use of power-saving modern processors that can adjust their operating frequency depending on the workload, in a real-time 2-level grid system. We propose resource scheduling policies based on energy consumption criteria. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance of these policies at the grid level and at the local level. Our experimental results show around 30% savings in processors' power consumption while maintaining performance at satisfactory levels.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of a real-time grid system using power-saving capable processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110100034"}
