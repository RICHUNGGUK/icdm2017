In this paper, by introducing partial adjoint pairs, a new structure is presented, named partial residuated lattices, which can be regarded as a version of residuated lattices in the case of partial operations, and their basic properties are investigated. The relations between partial residuated lattices and certain quantum structures are considered. We show that lattice effect algebras and D-lattices both are partial residuated lattices. Conversely, under certain conditions partial residuated lattices are both lattice effect algebras and D-lattices. Finally, dropping the assumption on commutativity, some similar results are obtained.", "paper_title": "Partial residuated structures and quantum structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000258059700008"}
