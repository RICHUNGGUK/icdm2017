Such a problem is known to be polynomially time solvable for uniform length data items, while it is computationally intractable for non-uniform length data items. In this paper, two new heuristics are proposed which exploit a novel characterization of optimal solutions for the special case of two channels and data items of uniform lengths. Sub-optimal solutions for the most general case of an arbitrary number of channels and data items of non-uniform lengths are provided. The first heuristic, called Greedy+, combines the novel characterization with the known greedy approach, while the second heuristic, called Dlinear, combines the same characterization with the dynamic programming technique. Such heuristics have been tested on benchmarks whose popularities are characterized by Zipf distributions, as well as on a wider set of benchmarks. The experimental tests reveal that Dlinear finds optimal solutions almost always, requiring good running times. However, Greedy+ is faster and scales well when changes occur on the input parameters, but provides solutions which are close to the optimum.", "paper_title": "Efficient heuristics for data broadcasting on multiple channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000253484000007"}
