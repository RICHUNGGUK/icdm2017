In such designs, the power-delivery system could be affected by input noise to the point that it becomes unstable. Simultaneous switching noise (SSN) is a major factor that interferes with power integrity. Although decoupling capacitors cannot effectively alleviate the problem of SSN, they have been generally used in the HP Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis model for reducing SSN. The differential I/O buffer information specification (D-IBIS) model uses equivalent circuits to describe the behavior of an integrated circuit. In this study, we propose a novel method for effectively reducing SSN evaluated by an enhanced D-IBIS model with decoupling capacitors and a high-frequency low-impendence circuit. We show that this new method reduces noise by about 40-64% compared to traditional design methodologies.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR REDUCING SIMULTANEOUS SWITCHING NOISE EVALUATED BY A DIFFERENTIAL-IBIS STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400009"}
