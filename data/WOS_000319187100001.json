The key to effectively utilizing SPMs on multicore systems is the data placement algorithm. In this paper, two polynomial time algorithms, regional data placement for multicore (RDPM) and regional data placement for multicore with duplication (RDPM-DUP), have been proposed to generate near-optimal data placement with minimum total cost. There is only one copy for each data in RDPM, while RDPM-DUP allows data duplication. Experimental results show that the proposed RDPM algorithm alone can reduce the time cost of memory accesses by 32.68% on average compared with existing algorithms. With data duplication, the RDPM-DUP algorithm further reduces the time cost by 40.87%. In terms of energy consumption, the proposed RDPM algorithm with exclusive copy can reduce the total cost by 33.47% on average. When RDPM-DUP is applied, the improvement increases up to 38.15% on average.", "paper_title": "Data Placement and Duplication for Embedded Multicore Systems With Scratch Pad Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000319187100001"}
