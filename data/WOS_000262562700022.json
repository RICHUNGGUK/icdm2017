The proposed network structure, named Evolving Logic Networks for Real-valued inputs (ELN-R), is a data structure for storing and using the knowledge. A distinctive feature of ELN-R is that the previously learned knowledge stored in ELN-R can be used as a kind of building block in constructing new knowledge. Using this feature, the proposed learning algorithm can enhance the stability and plasticity at the same time, and as a result, the fast incremental learning can be realized. The performance of the proposed scheme is shown by a theoretical analysis and an experimental study on two benchmark problems.", "paper_title": "Evolving Logic Networks With Real-Valued Inputs for Fast Incremental Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562700022"}
