The lack of statistical techniques for in-depth analysis of these responses has been, for years, the appearance of an important barrier. At present, this barrier is being overcome thanks to new statistical techniques. In this way, the information from fuzzy rating method-based responses can be suitably explored and exploited. This paper aims to formally endorse some of the main statistical benefits of using free-response format fuzzy rating scale-based questionnaires instead of using the closed-response format involving fuzzy linguistic representations.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Rating Scale-Based Questionnaires and Their Statistical Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000349418100010"}
