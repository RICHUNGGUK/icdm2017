By factorizing the generator polynomial into several minimal polynomials and utilizing linear feedback shift registers based on minimal polynomials, our reconfigurable design cannot only support multiple error correcting capabilities at a few extra cost, but also merge the encoder and syndrome calculator for efficiently reducing hardware complexity. After being implemented in CMOS 65-nm technology, the test chip supporting t = 1-24 bits can achieve 1.33-Gb/s measured throughput with 73k gate-count while another design supporting t = 60-84 bits can provide 1.60-Gb/s synthesized throughput with 168.6k gate-count.", "paper_title": "An MPCN-Based BCH Codec Architecture With Arbitrary Error Correcting Capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000356879200005"}
