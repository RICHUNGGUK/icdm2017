More than 5500 papers were published on different aspects of XML. With so many publications, it is hard for someone to decide where to start. Hence, this paper presents some of the research topics on XML, namely: XML on relational databases, query processing, views, data matching, and schema evolution. It then summarizes some (some!) of the most relevant or traditional papers on those subjects.", "paper_title": "XML: Some Papers in a Haystack", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362100003"}
