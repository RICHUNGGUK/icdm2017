The 2D-NSBL can be regarded as an extension of the 2D-NSL, because a two-channel 2D-NSBL is completely equivalent to a 2D-NSL. We apply the 2D-NSBL to M-channel (M = 2(n), n is an element of N) perfect reconstruction filter banks (PRFBs). The 2D-NSBL-based PRFBs outperform 1D-SBL-based PRFBs at lossy-to-lossless coding, whose image quality is scalable from lossless data to high compressed lossy data, because their rounding errors are reduced by merging many rounding operations.", "paper_title": "2D Non-Separable Block-Lifting Structure and Its Application to M-Channel Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks for Lossy-to-Lossless Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000362008200009"}
