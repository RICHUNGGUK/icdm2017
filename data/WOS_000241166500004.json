Two models are considered: the general SPIH problem and the SPIH problem with a single pair of required vertices. For the first problem, we show that it is strongly NP-hard. For the second problem, we show that even if the network is a chain network, it is still NP-hard.", "paper_title": "The shortest path improvement problems under Hamming distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241166500004"}
