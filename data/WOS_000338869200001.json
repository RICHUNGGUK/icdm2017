The traditional localization methods achieve high location accuracy using received signal strength (RSS) in line of sight (LOS) environment. But the localization accuracy degrades significantly in nonline of sight (NLOS) environment. So the localization in NLOS environment is one of the most challenging for wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose an RSS based localization algorithm in NLOS environment. A NLOS identification algorithm is firstly proposed. This algorithm does not need the parameters of the NLOS in prior. Then we correct the NLOS measurements by subtracting the mean of NLOS errors. Finally, the Kalman filter is employed to mitigate the process noise. In simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher localization accuracy compared with other methods.", "paper_title": "RSS Localization Algorithm Based on Nonline of Sight Identification for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000338869200001"}
