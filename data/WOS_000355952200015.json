These are logics with models based on 'dynamic I spaces', which are finite sequences of Kripke I frames with a common domain, I being any of the normal modal systems K, K4, T, B, S4, KTB, KB4, S5. This article presents the second part of the study on L(T, I), where we focus on decidability issues.", "paper_title": "Logics for some dynamic spaces-II", "paper_id": "WOS:000355952200015"}
