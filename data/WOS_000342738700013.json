By using an interesting decomposing approach, we investigate the intrinsic structure for the set of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences with fixed complexity measures. For k <= 4, we construct the complete set of error vectors that give the k-error linear complexity. As auxiliary results we obtain the counting functions of the k-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences for k <= 4, as well as the expectations of the k-error linear complexity of a random sequence for k <= 3. Moreover, we study the 2(t)-error linear complexity of the set of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences with some fixed linear complexity L, where t < n - 1 and the Hamming weight of the binary representation of 2(n) - L is t. Also, we extend some results to 2(n)-periodic sequences over F-p. Finally, we discuss some potential applications.", "paper_title": "Decomposing Approach for Error Vectors of k-Error Linear Complexity of Certain Periodic Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700013"}
