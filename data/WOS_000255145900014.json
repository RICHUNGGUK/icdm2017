Particular attention is given to the multivariate ordinal probit regression model, in which the correlation between ordered categorical responses on the same unit at different times (or locations) is modeled with a latent variable that has a multivariate normal distribution. An algorithm for maximum likelihood analysis of this model is proposed and the analysis is demonstrated on an example. Simulations clarify the extent to which maximum likelihood estimators can be more efficient than generalized estimating equations (GEE) estimators of regression coefficients and the extent to which likelihood ratio tests can be more accurate than tests based on standard errors and approximate normality of GEE estimators.
