We present a new approach to adapt linear programming to solve cost time trade off problems. The proposed approach uses two different modeling flowshop scheduling into a leveled project management network. The first model minimizes makespan subject to budget limitation and the second model minimizes total cost to determine optimum makespan over production planning horizon.", "paper_title": "Cost-time trade off models application to crashing flow shop scheduling problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300058"}
