The hybrid nature of these systems - distributed memory across nodes and shared memory with non-uniform memory access within each node - poses a challenge to application developers. In this paper, we study a hybrid approach to programming such systems - a combination of two traditional programming models, MPI and OpenMP. We present the performance of standard benchmarks from the multi-zone NAS Parallel Benchmarks and two full applications using this approach on several multi-core based systems including an SGI Altix 4700, an IBM p575+ and an SGI Altix ICE 8200EX. We also present new data locality extensions to OpenMP to better match the hierarchical memory structure of multi-core architectures.
