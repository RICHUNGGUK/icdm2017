Recently, based on the supervised tensor learning (STL) framework, a linear support higher-order tensor machine (SHTM) has been proposed. Considering that there are much redundancy information in the tensor data and the model parameter largely affects the performance of SHTM, in this study, we present a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection and parameter optimization algorithm for the linear SHTM. The proposed algorithm can remove the redundancy information in tensor data and obtain a better generalized accuracy by searching for the optimal model parameter and feature subset simultaneously. A set of experiments is conducted on nine second-order face recognition datasets and three third-order gait recognition datasets to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The statistic test shows that compared with the original linear SHTM, the proposed algorithm can provide a significant performance gain in terms of generalized accuracy for tensor classification.
