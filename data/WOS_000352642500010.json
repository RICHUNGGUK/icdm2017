Via simulation study we compared ALRs to marginal models estimated via GEE and subject-specific models estimated via GLMMs, with a focus on estimation of the correlation structure in three-level data sets (e.g. students in classes in schools). Data set size and structure, and amount of correlation in the data sets were varied. For simple correlation structures, ALRs performed well. For three-level correlation structures, all approaches, but especially ALRs, had difficulty assigning the correlation to the correct level, though sample sizes used were small. In addition, ALRs and GEEs had trouble attaching correct inference to the mean effects, though this improved as overall sample size improved. ALRs are a valuable addition to the data analyst's toolkit, though care should be taken when modelling data with three-level structures.", "paper_title": "Comparing alternating logistic regressions to other approaches to modelling correlated binary data", "paper_id": "WOS:000352642500010"}
