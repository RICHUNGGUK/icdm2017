The proposed scheme controls the locations of nodes in a MANET in a dynamic way. A theoretical upper bound on the probability of partitioning is derived in the scheme. An implementation of DisAS using normal distribution, which is referred to as Normally DisAS (N-DisAS), is also discussed as a case study in this paper. Extensive simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of N-DisAS in protecting MANETs from partitioning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
