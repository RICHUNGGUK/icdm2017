In addition, it is a difficult task because available information for decision-making at this stage is imprecise and subjective. This necessitates the need for fuzzy decision models for selecting the best conceptual design among a set of alternatives. Although ordinary fuzzy sets cover uncertainties of linguistic words to some extent, it is recommended to use interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) to capture potential uncertainties of words. This paper presents a new concept selection methodology that extends the fuzzy information axiom (RA) approach to incorporate IT2FS5. The proposed methodology is called interval-type-2 fuzzy information axiom (IT2-FIA). IT2-FIA method is also enriched by using ordered weighted geometric aggregation operator to include the decision maker's attitude during the aggregation process. A case study is given to demonstrate the potential of the methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
