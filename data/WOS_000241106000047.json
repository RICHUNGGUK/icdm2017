Simulation shows that embedding often loses relevance under improper parameters configures. But current embedding residual criterions of neighborhood parameters selection are not independent to neighborhood parameters. Therefore it cannot work universally. To improve the availability of nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms in the field of self-adaptive machine learning, it is necessary to find some transcendent criterions to achieve unsupervised parameters selection. This paper begins with a discussion of optimal embedding principles and proposes a statistics based on spatial mutual information and normalized dependency index spectrum to determine reasonable parameters configuration. The simulation supports our proposal effectively.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing isometric embedding based on statistical criterions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000047"}
