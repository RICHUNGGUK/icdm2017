Currently, all the ECC and DSP functions are implemented in a central SSD controller. However, the use of more powerful ECC and DSP makes such design practice subject to significant speed performance degradation and complicated controller implementation. An EZ-NAND (Error Zero NAND) flash memory design strategy is emerging in the industry, which moves all the ECC and DSP functions to each memory chip. Although EZ-NAND flash can simplify controller design and achieve high system speed performance, its high silicon cost may not be affordable for large-capacity SSDs in computing systems. We propose a quasi-EZ-NAND design strategy that hierarchically distributes ECC and DSP functions on both NAND flash memory chips and the central SSD controller. Compared with EZ-NAND design concept, it can maintain almost the same speed performance while reducing silicon cost overhead. Assuming the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and postcompensation DSP technique, trace-based simulations show that SSDs using quasi-EZ-NAND flash can realize almost the same speed as SSDs using EZ-NAND flash, and both can reduce the average SSD response time by over 90 percent compared with conventional design practice. Silicon design at 65 nm node shows that quasi-EZ-NAND can reduce the silicon cost overhead by up to 44 percent compared with EZ-NAND.", "paper_title": "Using Quasi-EZ-NAND Flash Memory to Build Large-Capacity Solid-State Drives in Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317010700017"}
