The delay-dependent robust stability criterion is derived in terms of the fuzzy Lyapunov method to guarantee the stability of time-delay T-S fuzzy systems subjected to disturbances. Based on the delay-dependent condition and parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme, the controller design problem is transformed into solving linear matrix inequalities (LMI).", "paper_title": "A novel delay-dependent criterion for time-delay T-S fuzzy system using fuzzy Lyapunov method", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008500008"}
