Business companies have integrated them with cloud computing technology and have provided mobile cloud in order to improve using mobile devices and overcome the energy consumption of mobile devices. Therefore, energy efficiency is a fundamental factor for mobile devices and cloud computing has the potential to save energy and power of mobile devices. In mobile cloud computing, computations and storages of mobile devices applications are transferred to cloud data centers and mobile devices are used merely as user interface to access services. The cloud computing will help to reduce energy consumption of mobile devices. In this paper, a new approach is given to reduce energy consumption of based on Learning Automata in mobile cloud computing. Simulation results show that our proposed approach significantly saves energy consumption through determining the appropriate location for application.", "paper_title": "An Energy-efficient Approach based on Learning Automata in Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968700006"}
