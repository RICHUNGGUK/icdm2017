This approach, based on fully automated vehicles, might improve the efficiency of road travel in terms of space and energy used, and in terms of set-vice provided as well. For such automated operation, trajectory planning methods that produce smooth trajectories, with low level associated accelerations and jerk for providing human comfort, are required. This paper addresses this problem proposing a new approach that consists of introducing a velocity planning stage in the trajectory planner. Moreover, this paper presents the design and simulation evaluation of trajectory-tracking and path-following controllers for autonomous vehicles based on sliding mode control. A new design of sliding surface is proposed, such that lateral and angular errors are internally coupled with each other (in cartesian space) in a sliding surface leading to convergence of both variables.", "paper_title": "Trajectory planning and sliding-mode control based trajectory-tracking for cybercars", "paper_id": "WOS:000245025100004"}
