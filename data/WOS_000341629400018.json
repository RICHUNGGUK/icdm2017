Major recent advancements in THz Band technologies are helping to finally close the so called THz Gap and bring practical THz Band communication networks one step closer. This paper surveys the state of the art in THz Band device technologies, and highlights the challenges and potential solutions from the communication and networking perspective as well as in terms of experimental testbeds. Ultimately, a roadmap is defined for the development of THz Band systems as the new frontier in wireless communications.", "paper_title": "TERANETS: ULTRA-BROADBAND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS IN THE TERAHERTZ BAND", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629400018"}
