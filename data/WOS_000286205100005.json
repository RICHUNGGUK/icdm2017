In this paper, we have analyzed current status of supporting tools for small CSE groups to utilize cloud computing. Although cloud computing is perceived as an interesting model, we have identified several issues that prevent a wide adoption of cloud computing from small CSE research groups. We also present recommendations for addressing these issues in order to attract small CSE groups to utilize cloud computing.", "paper_title": "Cloud computing for small research groups in computational science and engineering: current status and outlook", "paper_id": "WOS:000286205100005"}
