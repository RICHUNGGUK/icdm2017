The SVMV algorithm is based on support vector machine (SVM) and self-organizing mapping (SOM). High dimensional data and binary classification results can be visualized in a low dimensional space. Compared with other traditional visualization algorithms like SOM and Sammon's mapping algorithm, the SVMV algorithm can deliver better visualization on classification results. Experimental results corroborate the effectiveness and usefulness of SVMV.", "paper_title": "SVMV - A novel algorithm for the visualization of SVM classification results", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000142"}
