In this paper, a gait-generation algorithm for a mobile robot that can travel from the ground to a wall and climb vertical surfaces is proposed. The algorithm was inspired by a gecko lizard. Our gait planning was based on inverse kinematics using the Jacobian of the whole body, where the redundancy was solved by defining an object function for the gecko posture to avoid collisions with the surface. The optimal scalar factor for these two objects was obtained by defining a superior object function to minimize the angular acceleration of joints. The algorithm was verified through simulation of the gecko model travelling on given task paths and avoiding abnormal joint movements and collisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
