Such codes are generalizations of quasi-cyclic codes and can be viewed as linear codes over the group ring . Using the Discrete Fourier Transform, can be decomposed as a direct product of finite fields. This decomposition leads us to a structural characterization of quasi-abelian codes and their duals. Necessary and sufficient conditions for such codes to be self-dual are given together with the enumeration based on -cyclotomic classes of . In particular, when is an elementary -group, we characterize the -cyclotomic classes of and give an explicit formula for the number of self-dual -quasi abelian codes. Analogous to 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes, we investigate the structural characterization and enumeration of 1-generator quasi-abelian codes. We show that the class of binary self-dual (strictly) quasi-abelian codes is asymptotically good. Finally, we present four strictly quasi-abelian codes and ten codes obtained by puncturing and shortening of these codes, whose minimum distances are better than the lower bound in Grassl's online table.", "paper_title": "Quasi-abelian codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000349762000001"}
