This work presents a cruise control system which is able to manage the pedals of a vehicle at low speeds. In this context, small changes in the vehicle or road conditions can occur unpredictably. To solve this problem, a method is proposed to allow the on-line evolution of a zero-order TSK fuzzy controller to adapt its behaviour to uncertain road or vehicle dynamics. Starting from a very simple or even empty configuration, the consequents of the rules are adapted in real time, while the membership functions used to codify the input variables are modified after a certain period of time. Extensive experimentation in both simulated and real vehicles showed the method to be both fast and precise, even when compared with a human driver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
