One-sample Bayes methods for non-informative priors are provided for all of these models and attractive frequentist properties for corresponding Bayes inference on the model parameters are confirmed. Taken together with earlier work, the broad efficacy of non-informative Bayes inference for symmetric distributions on 3-D rotations is conclusively demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
