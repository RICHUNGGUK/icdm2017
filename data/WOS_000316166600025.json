Measured results show that the anti-interference competence of improved zero-IF RF receiver is enhanced greatly by employing two tunable filter arrays. Design/methodology/approach - The anti-interference reconfigurable zero-IF RF receiver is based on fully differential I/Q demodulation structure and employs two same tunable filter arrays to meet the requirement on adjacent channel suppression imposed by systems coexisting. The performance requirement of each filter in tunable filter arrays is computed and derived according to the needs of anti-interference. Findings - The anti-interference competence of zero-IF RF receiver could be enhanced greatly by employing two tunable filter arrays. Originality/value - The paper provides a method to design zero-IF RF receivers with anti-interference competence used in dynamic spectrum resource sharing systems.", "paper_title": "Anti-interference improvement of reconfigurable zero-IF RF receiver based on tunable filter array computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000316166600025"}
