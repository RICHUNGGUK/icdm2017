The approach can construct a base surface model from four ordinary or composite boundary curves and support incremental surface updating from interior characteristic curves, some of which may not be on the final surface. The base surface is first constructed as a regular Coons surface and upon receiving an interior curve sketch, it is updated. With this progressive modelling scheme, a final surface with multiple sub-surfaces can be obtained from a set of unorganised curves and transferred to commercial surface modelling software for detailed modification. The approach has been tested with examples based on 3D motion sketches; it is capable of dealing with unorganised design curves for surface modelling in conceptual design. Its limitations have been discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Progressive surface modelling scheme from unorganised curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000241273300006"}
