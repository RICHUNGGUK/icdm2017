The growth of the computer system and network makes the organizations and personal users to depend on the information that circulate in these systems more and more. This makes us be aware of that protecting the data and resources from leak, insuring the reliability of data and information, and protecting the system from suffering the hit from network are very important. Submit a cryptography that is affirmative by people to reach the demand on the safety of SET system. The algorithm submitted is public, and everyone can use and to verify its safety, using Elliptic Curve Cryptography to execute the key exchange and encryption decryption, and making sure its performance of SET is better while the safety of SET is same as before, and the overload of compute and transmission is yet lower.", "paper_title": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography on SET for E-Commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000309691900014"}
