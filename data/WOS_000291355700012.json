In this brief, we propose an improved version, named twin bounded support vector machines (TBSVM), based on TWSVM. The significant advantage of our TBSVM over TWSVM is that the structural risk minimization principle is implemented by introducing the regularization term. This embodies the marrow of statistical learning theory, so this modification can improve the performance of classification. In addition, the successive overrelaxation technique is used to solve the optimization problems to speed up the training procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in both computation time and classification accuracy, and therefore confirm the above conclusion further.", "paper_title": "Improvements on Twin Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000291355700012"}
