To that end, we analyze three generalization cases ( a integral, is not an element of, and alpha) and present different scenarios of a simultaneous generalization on both objects and attributes. We also discuss the cardinality of the generalized pattern set against the number of simple patterns produced from the initial data set.", "paper_title": "Generalized pattern extraction from concept lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000342438500009"}
