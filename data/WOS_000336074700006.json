The purpose of the job evaluation is eliminating the pay inequalities by developing a pay structure based on values of the jobs. The job evaluation problem may be treated as a managerial decision-making problem under multiple criteria. In this study, an integrated fuzzy approach is developed for job evaluation problem which aims to establish a base for an ideal compensation system. In the proposed approach initially, the relative importance weights of the job factors are determined and subsequently, job compensation groups are maintained by a fuzzy inference system integrated with importance weights of the factors. A sample case study has been considered and ten different jobs are classified into four different job compensation groups according to the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Inference System for Multiple Criteria Job Evaluation Using Fuzzy AHP", "paper_id": "WOS:000336074700006"}
