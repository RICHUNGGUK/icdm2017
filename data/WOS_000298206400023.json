By using the properties of spectral radius of nonnegative matrix, two new integral inequalities are established. Based on the integral inequalities, some new sufficient conditions for the existence of quasi-invariant and attracting sets of the non-autonomous neural networks with delays are obtained. The framework of the quasi-invariant and attracting sets is also given. The results extend and improve the earlier publications. One example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our conclusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
