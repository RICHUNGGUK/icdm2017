Firstly, an improved HS based multi-layer embedding process for rhombus prediction is employed by introducing a control parameter to explore the correlation of prediction errors. A rate-distortion model for HS embedding is then developed for optimal side information selection, which is especially suitable for low payload reversible data hiding when only a single layer embedding is required. Finally, a modified location map is constructed to facilitate the compression of location map and further increase the embedding capacity. Compared with similar schemes, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in the terms of embedding capacity and stego-image quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
