In order to improve their interoperability, enterprises need to know witch level of maturity they have achieved. This article proposes a complete maturity model composed by a methodology and a reference set of parameters to measure interoperability potential. In order to clarify the proposal, an example of application in a real case is described.", "paper_title": "Maturity Model for Interoperability Potential Measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000322163500004"}
