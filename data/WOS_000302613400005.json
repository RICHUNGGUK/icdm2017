Variables are interpolated into the cell face with two different schemes and, the schemes are compared in terms of computational cost and accuracy. The bed source terms are computed using two different assumptions. The effect of these assumptions on numerical simulations is then investigated. Solutions of transport equations on different types of unstructured triangular grids are compared and, an appropriate choice of grid is suggested.
