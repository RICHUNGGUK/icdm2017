By employing the method of variation parameter, applying inequality technique and introducing a lot of real parameters, we present some sufficient conditions ensuring the boundedness and globally exponential stability of the solutions for nonautonomous cellular neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms. The results obtained extend and improve the earlier publications. Finally, three examples with their numerical simulations are provided to show the correctness of our analysis. (C) 2008 IMACS.
