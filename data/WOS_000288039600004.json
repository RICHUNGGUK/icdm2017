However, association rules discovered are normally large in number, some of which are not considered as interesting or significant for the application at hand. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to ascertain the discovered rules, and provide a precise statistical approach supporting this framework. The proposed strategy combines data mining and statistical measurement techniques, including redundancy analysis, sampling and multivariate statistical analysis, to discard the non- significant rules. Moreover, we consider real world datasets which are characterized by the uniform and non-uniform data/items distribution with a mixture of measurement levels throughout the data/items. The proposed unified framework is applied on these datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in discarding many of the redundant or non-significant rules, while still preserving the high accuracy of the rule set as a whole.
