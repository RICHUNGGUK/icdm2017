The user simply sketches a set of source curves in the input image, and also some target curves that the source curves should be deformed to. Then the moving least squares (MLS) deformation technique [SMW06] is adapted to produce realistic deformations while satisfying the curves' positional constraints. We also propose a scheme to reduce image fold-overs in MLS deformations. Our system has a very intuitive user interface, generates physically plausible deformations, and can be easily implemented on the GPU for real-time performance.", "paper_title": "Sketching MLS Image Deformations On the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000010"}
