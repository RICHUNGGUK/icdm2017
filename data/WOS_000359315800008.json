Unfortunately, it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we shall explore the implementation of a general multi-agent simulation system on a system with multiple GPUs acting as accelerators. In particular, we have ported the popular Java multi-agent simulation framework MASON to a nVidia CUDA-based multi-GPU setting. We evaluated our implementation over different numbers and types of nVidia GPUs. For our evaluation, we ported three models in the original version of MASON. On the well-known Boids model, we achieved a speedup of 187x. Using a fictional model, we showed that speedup of up to 468x is possible. In the paper, we shall also describe the detailed internals of our system, and the various issues we encountered and how they were solved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
