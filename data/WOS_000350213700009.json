Tweets are now an important source of trend-setting and marketing along with their conventional use for information exchange. Recently, Saudi Arabia changed its working days so that weekends are Friday and Saturday instead of Thursday and Friday. To identify the impact of such a change on the usage of social networks, five detailed experiments are conducted. Time-stamped data for selected individuals are retrieved from Twitter and analyzed accordingly to observe usage behavior. Moreover, the results of these experiments are compared with results obtained last year, before the weekend was changed.", "paper_title": "Does a Change in Weekend Days Have an Impact on Social Networking Activity?", "paper_id": "WOS:000350213700009"}
