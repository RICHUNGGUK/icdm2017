These techniques are of great importance in the analysis and optimization of transportation networks, as well as their re-organization to improve users' mobility. In this paper we focus on the reconfiguration of one-way roads in a city after the occurrence of a major problem (e.g. a long-term road cut) in order to provide alternative routes that guarantee the mobility of citizens. In this manuscript a novel definition of this problem is formulated, for whose efficient resolution a novel two-objective approach based on the harmony search (HS) algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness of this proposal is tested in several synthetic instances, along with a real scenario in a city near Madrid, Spain. Extensive simulation results have been analyzed to verify that our proposal obtains excellent results in all the considered scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
