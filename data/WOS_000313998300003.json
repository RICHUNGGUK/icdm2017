EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task, presented to 12 participants with a random mix of 15% oddball targets and 85% frequent non-target letters over 265 trials. Wavelet coherence of individual trials was shown to distinguish frequent and oddball trials. Averaged wavelet coherence showed significant differences: oddball targets showed higher delta-theta activity whereas frequent background stimuli showed higher gamma activity. Increased gamma coherence appeared to be related to expectation of the targets with our analysis showing an R-2 of 0.935 for the relationship between averaged sections of gamma coherence and the number of intervening (frequent) trials since the last oddball.
