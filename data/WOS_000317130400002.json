In this note it is observed that a construction of Levin of a normal number having small discrepancy gives a construction of a binary sequence E-N with N(E-N) = O((log N)(2)), thus disproving the conjecture above.", "paper_title": "Normal Numbers and the Normality Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000317130400002"}
