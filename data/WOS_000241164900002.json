Progression of labor was associated with a significant increase in linear frequency domain indices whereas nonlinear indices were significantly decreased. Moderate-to-severe fetal acidemia was associated with a significant decrease in nonlinear indices. The best discrimination between moderate-to-severe acidemic fetuses and the remaining cases was obtained combining II and ApEn(2,0.15), with a specificity of 71% and a sensitivity of 80%. These findings support the hypothesis of increased autonomic nervous system activity in the final minutes of labor and of decreased central nervous system activity, both in the final minutes of labor and in moderate-to-severe acidemic fetuses.", "paper_title": "Linear and nonlinear fetal heart rate analysis of normal and acidemic fetuses in the minutes preceding delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241164900002"}
