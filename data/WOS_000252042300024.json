These methods couple a continuum model with molecular dynamics through the exchange of boundary conditions in the continuum-particle overlapping region. Different coupling schemes, including velocity-velocity, flux-velocity, velocity-flux and flux-flux, are studied. It is found that the velocity-velocity and flux-velocity schemes are stable. The flux-flux scheme is weakly unstable. The stability of the velocity-flux scheme depends on the parameter T-c which is the length of the time interval between successive exchange of boundary conditions. It is stable when T-c is small and unstable when T-c is large. For steady-state problems, the flux-velocity scheme converges faster than the other coupling schemes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
