There are three main results in this paper. First, we characterize the sum capacity of the deterministic X channel under a symmetric setting. Second, we characterize the GDOF of the Gaussian X channel under a similar symmetric model. Third. we extend the sum capacity characterization previously obtained for the Gaussian interference channel in the noisy interference regime to the Gaussian X channel. Specifically, we show that the Gaussian X channel has the same sum capacity as the underlying Gaussian interference channel in this regime.", "paper_title": "Interference Alignment and the Generalized Degrees of Freedom of the X Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600009"}
