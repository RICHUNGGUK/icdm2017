We show that, thanks to the temporally localised basis vectors that result, phase information is easily exploited to determine the clusters, using an unsupervised clustering method. Experimental results show that good performance is obtained with the proposed approach, even for short basis vectors.", "paper_title": "Sparse coding for convolutive blind audio source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300017"}
