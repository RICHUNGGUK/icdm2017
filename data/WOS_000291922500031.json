That is, it is assumed that the absolute difference between the sent and received symbols is bounded above by a certain value. In this paper, we propose systematic codes for asymmetric limited magnitude channels that are able to correct a single error. We also show how this construction can be slightly modified to design codes that can correct a single symmetric error of limited magnitude. The designed codes achieve higher code rates than single error correcting codes previously given in the literature.", "paper_title": "Systematic, Single Limited Magnitude Error Correcting Codes for Flash Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500031"}
