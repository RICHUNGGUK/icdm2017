To match the displacement fields at the two scales, an approximation of the micro-displacement field is assumed that depends on the first and second gradients of the macro-displacement through micro-fluctuation displacement functions obtained by the finite element solution of cell problems derived by the classical asymptotic homogenization. The resulting equations of motion of the equivalent continuum at the macro-scale result to be not local in space, thus a dispersive wave propagation is obtained from the model. The simplifying hypotheses assumed in the multi-scale kinematics limit the validity of the model to the first dispersive branch in the frequency spectrum corresponding to the lowest modes. Although the homogenization procedure is developed to study the macro-scale wave propagation in rock masses with bounded domain, the reliability of the proposed method has been evaluated in the examples by considering unbounded rock masses and by comparing the dispersion curves provided by the rigorous process of Floquet Bloch with those obtained by the method presented. The accuracy of the method is analyzed for compressional and shear waves propagating in the intact-layered rocks along the orthotropic axes. Therefore, the influence of crack density in the layered rock mass has been analyzed. Vertical cracks have been considered, periodically located in the stiffer layer, and two different crack densities have been analyzed, which are differentiated in the crack spacing. A good agreement is obtained in case of compressional waves travelling along the layering direction and in case of both shear and compressional waves normal to the layering. The comparison between two crack systems with different spacing has shown this aspect to have a remarkable effect on waves travelling along the direction of layering, and limited in the case of waves propagating normal to the layers. The equivalent continuous model obtained through the dynamic homogenization technique here presented may be applied to the computational analysis of non-stationary wave propagation in rock masses of finite size, also consisting of sub-domains with different macro-mechanical characteristics. This avoids the use of computational models represented at the scale of the heterogeneities, which may be too burdensome or even unfeasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
