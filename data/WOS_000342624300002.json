It has been shown that to determine whether a graph has such a partition is an NP-complete problem for general graphs, and is polynomial time solvable for several classes of graphs. In this paper, we investigate graphs that admit a unique such partition and call them uniquely monopolar-partitionable graphs. By employing a tree trimming technique, we obtain a characterization of uniquely monopolar-partitionable block graphs. Our characterization implies a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether a block graph is uniquely monopolar-partitionable.", "paper_title": "Uniquely monopolar-partitionable block graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342624300002"}
