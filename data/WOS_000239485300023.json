This paper reviews the multicast routing problem, analyzes the multi-constraints, especially the importance of network layer load balance. Then a modified SOFM approach is proposed to build a multicast tree according to cost, application layer load balance and network layer load balance. Numerical simulations show that compared with existent routing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improved the performance on all the three metrics.", "paper_title": "A neural network based application layer multicast routing protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300023"}
