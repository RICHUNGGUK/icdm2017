The aim of the L(h, 1, 1)-labeling problem is to minimize A, denoted by lambda(h,1,1) and called span of the L(h, 1, 1)-labeling. As outerplanar graphs have bounded treewidth, the L(1, 1, l)-labeling problem on outerplanar graphs can be exactly solved in O(n(3)), but the multiplicative factor depends on the maximum degree A and is too big to be of practical use. In this paper we give a linear time approximation algorithm for computing the more general L (h, 1, 1)-labeling for outerplanar graphs that is within additive constants of the optimum values.", "paper_title": "L(h,1,1)-labeling of outerplanar graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239484100021"}
