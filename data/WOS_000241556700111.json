We present a Stable 3D Mass-Spring Model for lymph node segmentation in CT datasets. Our model for the first time represents concurrently the characteristic gray value range, directed contour information as well as shape knowledge, which leads to a much more robust and efficient segmentation process. Our model design and segmentation accuracy are both evaluated with lymph nodes from clinical CT neck datasets.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of neck lymph nodes in CT datasets with stable 3D mass-spring models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700111"}
