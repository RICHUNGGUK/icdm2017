A 4 X 4 ATSA array is designed to scan two-dimensionally across the entire X-band. The phase shifters for 2D scanning consist of two sets of multiline phase shifters controlled by the PET for scanning in both planes. The 2D phased array has an antenna gain greater than 8 dBi, including all losses due to the phase shifters and transitions, and shows a wide beam-scanning capability greater than 30 degrees in both the E-plane and the H-plane.
