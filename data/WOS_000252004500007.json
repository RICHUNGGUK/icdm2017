We study some aspects of these dynamics by using a CA like model of packet switching networks (PSNs). The model is an abstraction of the Network Layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Reference Model of data networks of the packet switching type. The Network Layer is responsible for routing packets across the network from their sources to their destinations and for control of congestion. Using the PSN model we explore how network connection topology and routing algorithms affect the spatio-temporal packet traffic dynamics. We present selected simulation results and analyze them.", "paper_title": "Complex dynamics of CA like model of data networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252004500007"}
