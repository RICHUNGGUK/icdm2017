This work shows how to provide different levels of delay-based differentiation and provides a model to characterise the proportional differentiation achieved, which is further validated with extensive simulations. Furthermore, we show that the delay variance of our algorithm is smaller with respect to conventional IPACT, with the subsequent jitter reduction for high-priority traffic, and we further present a mechanism to limit the maximum delay experienced by high-priority traffic.", "paper_title": "Analysis and simulation of a delay-based service differentiation algorithm for IPACT-based PONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000310325700007"}
