This explains the origin of the 4-phase Golay seed pairs of length 5 and 13. The construction cannot produce new 4-phase Golay sequence pairs, because there are no Barker sequences of odd length greater than 13. A partial converse to the construction is given, under the assumption of additional structure on the 4-phase Golay sequence pair of length s a parts per thousand 5 (mod 8).", "paper_title": "Quaternary Golay sequence pairs II: odd length", "paper_id": "WOS:000288452200010"}
