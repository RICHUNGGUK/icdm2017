By utilizing the survey data obtained in Jabodetabek metropolitan region of Indonesia in 2002, the study results numerically confirm that the iteratively computational calibrations to the K-factors for the newly urbanized areas of a developing city by employing the EM algorithm in the feedback process can truly improve the validity of the proposed feedback model's application to effectively predict the urban transport developments of developing cities in the future.", "paper_title": "Improved feedback modeling of transport in enlarging urban areas of developing countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000292503700009"}
