In order to simultaneously handle chip and package performances, co-design of chip and package is a widely adopted solution, particularly because the finger/pad locations significantly affect IR-drop of the core and the package routing. In this paper, we develop chip-package co-design techniques to determine the locations of the fingers/pads for package routability and signal integrity concerns in IC designs, this method can be used in the 2-D and stacking IC design. Our finger/pad assignment is a two-step method: we first solve the wire congestion problem in package routing, and then try to minimize the IR-drop violation and the length of the bonding wires under a compact IR-drop model. The experimental results are encouraging. Compared with the randomly optimized method, on average, our approaches reduce the maximum package density by 42% and 68% for both technologies, IR-drop by 10.61% and 4.58%; and the bonding wires is reduced by 15.66% if we use stacking chips.
