In spite of the amount of information and decision support systems available, mental disorders are still difficult to diagnose due to their intrinsic lack of formal boundaries. This paper presents PsyDis, a tool aimed to support the decision-making process in mental disorder diagnosis. PsyDis combines ontologies and logical inference mechanisms to offer decision support in the field of psychological clinical diagnosis. The system has been evaluated by means of two different studies. Results show notable accuracy of the system in terms of precision, recall and f measures. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
