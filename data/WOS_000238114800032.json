We propose a new design for WDM optical interconnect that has several advantages over existing designs. First, wavelength conversion occurs between two predefined wavelengths. This not only eliminates the need for expensive wide-range wavelength converters, but also ensures high scalability as the conversion range is independent of the number of the wavelengths in the system. Second, the new design requires a smaller number of switching elements compared to most of the recent best interconnect designs.", "paper_title": "Designing scalable WDM optical interconnects using predefined wavelength conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800032"}
