In the field of medical image processing, some of the current interests are the automatic diagnosis of liver, spleen, and kidney pathologies, and the 3D volume rendering of these abdominal organs. Their automatic segmentation is the first and fundamental step in all these studies, but it is still an open problem. Methods: In this paper we propose a fully automatic, gray-level based segmentation framework based on a multiplanar fast marching method. The proposed segmentation scheme is general, and employs only established and not critical anatomical knowledge. For this reason, it can be easily adapted to segment different abdominal organs, by overcoming problems due to the high inter- and intra-patient gray-level, and shape variabilities; the extracted volumes are then combined to produce the final results. Results: The system has been evaluated by computing the symmetric volume overlap (SVO) between the automatically segmented (liver and spleen) volumes and the volumes manually traced by radiological experts. The test dataset is composed of 60 images, where 40 images belong to a private dataset, and 20 images to a public one. Liver segmentation has achieved an average SVO., 94, which is comparable to the mean intra- and inter-personal variation (96). Spleen segmentation achieves similar, promising results (SVO congruent to 93). The comparison of these results with those achieved by active contour models (SVO 90), and topology adaptive snakes (SVO 92) proves the efficacy of our system. Conclusions: The described segmentation method is a general framework that can be adapted to segment different abdominal organs, achieving promising segmentation results. It has to be noted that its performance could be further improved by incorporating shape based rules. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
