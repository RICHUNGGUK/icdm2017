Rational polynomial is used to approximate the performance curve of on-chip inductor via vector fitting. This procedure will generate highly accurate model with proper poles location and frequency-independent SPICE-compatible equivalent circuit, which can be used in simulator to obtain time-domain waveform.", "paper_title": "Rational modeling of on-chip inductor by vector fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000282224500009"}
