We develop a new multicriteria-ranking algorithm which determines multiple forwarders for each hop by ranking neighbor nodes. To rank the nodes, we compute the fitness value using features for each node such as the received signal strength, nodal delay, and hop distance. We determine the time of sending among forwarders using the waiting time assignment algorithm. In the experimental section, we show that our method outperforms conventional data delivery protocols in terms of data delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "A Fast and Reliable Hybrid Data Delivery Protocol for Large-Scale Heterogeneous Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301421100001"}
