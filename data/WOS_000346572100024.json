As technology has progressed and available storage capacity in modern computers increased, the amount of data available to be processed has also increased substantially, resulting in much slower induction and classification times. Many parallel implementations of DTC algorithms have already addressed the issues of reliability and accuracy in the induction process. In the classification process, larger amounts of data require proportionately more execution time, thus hindering the performance of legacy systems. We have devised a pipelined architecture for the implementation of axis parallel binary DTC that dramatically improves the execution time of the algorithm while consuming minimal resources in terms of area. Scalability is achieved when connected to a high-speed communication unit capable of performing data transfers at a rate similar to that of the DTC engine. We propose a hardware accelerated solution composed of parallel processing nodes capable of independently processing data from a streaming source. Each engine processes the data in a pipelined fashion to use resources more efficiently and increase the achievable throughput. The results show that this system is 3.5 times faster than the existing hardware implementation of classification.", "paper_title": "Pipelined Decision Tree Classification Accelerator Implementation in FPGA (DT-CAIF)", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100024"}
