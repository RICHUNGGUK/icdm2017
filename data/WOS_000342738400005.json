Recently, researchers have already proposed the overshooting effect models for an inverter. However, the accurate overshooting effect model for multiple-input gates is seldom presented and the existing technology to reduce a multiple-input gate to an inverter is not useful when modeling the overshooting effect for multiple-input gates. Therefore, modeling the overshooting effect for multiple-input gates is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a formula-based model is presented for the overshooting time of 2-input NOR gate. Then, more complicated methods are given to calculate the overshooting time of 3-input NOR gate and other multiple-input gates. The proposed model is verified to have a good agreement, within 3.4% error margin, compared with SPICE simulation results using CMOS 32 nm PTM model.", "paper_title": "An Effective Model of the Overshooting Effect for Multiple-Input Gates in Nanometer Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738400005"}
