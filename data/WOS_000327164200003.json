However, it is difficult to use high precision arithmetic in ordinary computing environments without any special hardware or libraries. Hence, we designed the quadruple precision arithmetic environment QuPAT on Scilab to satisfy the following requirements: (i) to enable programs to be written simply using quadruple precision arithmetic; (ii) to enable the use of both double and quadruple precision arithmetic at the same time; (iii) to be independent of any hardware and operating systems. To confirm the effectiveness of QuPAT, we applied the GCR method for ill-conditioned matrices and focused on the scalar parameters alpha and beta in GCR, partially using DD arithmetic. We found that the use of DD arithmetic only for beta leads to almost the same results as when DD arithmetic is used for all computations. We conclude that QuPAT is an excellent interactive tool for using double precision and DD arithmetic at the same time. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
