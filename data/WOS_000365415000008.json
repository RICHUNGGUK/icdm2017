The e-loyalty model proposed in this study is based on DeLone and McLean's IS Success Model. E-loyalty is explained using three independent factors (information quality, system quality, and service quality), and two mediating factors (trust and customer satisfaction). The proposed model was tested with Thai and Taiwanese samples using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) data analysis. The study yielded different results when Thai and Taiwanese samples were tested using SEM multi-group moderation data analysis. This study incorporated the concepts of national identity (NATID) and Hofstede's five cultural dimensions to better explain cultural differences between the two countries and how culture can affect the e-commerce environment.", "paper_title": "E-commerce web site loyalty: A cross cultural comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000365415000008"}
