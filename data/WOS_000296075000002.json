As an example we present artificial morphogenesis, which uses computational processes analogous to those in embryological development in order to assemble complex physical structures. We discuss the requirements for a formalism or programming language for embodied computation oriented toward artificial morphogenesis and present a preliminary design for such a formalism. Use of the formalism is illustrated by several embodied computation problems of increasing complexity.", "paper_title": "Artificial Morphogenesis as an Example of Embodied Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296075000002"}
