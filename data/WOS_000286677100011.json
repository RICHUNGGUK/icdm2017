They are based on topologies, such as LMST and RNG, that can approximate minimum spanning tree and can be efficiently computed using only position or distance information of one-hop neighbors. The actual routing tree is constructed over these topologies. We also consider different parent selection strategies while constructing a routing tree. We compare each topology and parent selection strategy and conclude that the best among them is the shortest path strategy over LMST structure. Our solution also involves route maintenance procedures that will be executed when a sensor node fails or a new node is added to the network. The proposed solution is also adapted to consider the remaining power levels of nodes in order to increase the network lifetime. Our simulation results show that by using our power-aware localized approach, we can almost have the same performance of a centralized solution in terms of network lifetime, and close to 90 percent of an upper bound derived here.", "paper_title": "Computing Localized Power-Efficient Data Aggregation Trees for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286677100011"}
