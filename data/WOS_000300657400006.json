This problem presents some specific restrictions that make it very particular and complex because of the large time requirements needed to consider multiple criteria (which enlarge the solution search space) and the long computation time models required in each evaluation. In this work, a specific multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to obtain more compact fuzzy logic controllers as a way of finding the best combination of rules, thus improving the system performance to better solve the HVAC system control problem. This method combines lateral tuning of the linguistic variables with rule selection. To this end, two objectives have been considered, maximizing the performance of the system and minimizing the number of rules obtained. This algorithm is based on the well-known SPEA2 but uses different mechanisms for guiding the search towards the desired Pareto zone. Moreover, the method implements some advanced concepts such as incest prevention, that help to improve the exploration/exploitation trade-off and consequently its convergence ability. The proposed method is compared to the most representative mono-objective steady-state genetic algorithms previously applied to the HVAC system control problem, and to generational and steady-state versions of the most interesting multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (never applied to this problem) showing that the solutions obtained by this new approach dominate those obtained by these methods. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared with the rest of the analyzed methods, obtaining more accurate fuzzy logic controllers with simpler models.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for an effective tuning of fuzzy logic controllers in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300657400006"}
