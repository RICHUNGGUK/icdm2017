However, several natural matroid problems, such as 3-matroid intersection, are NP-hard. Here we investigate these problems from the parameterized complexity point of view: instead of the trivial O(n(k)) time brute force algorithm for finding a k-element solution, we try to give algorithms with uniformly polynomial (i.e., f (k) (.) noO((1))) running time. The main result is that if the ground set of a represented matroid is partitioned into blocks of size P, then we can determine in f (k, l) (.) n(O(1)) randomized time whether there is an independent set that is the union of k blocks. As consequence, algorithms with similar running time are obtained for other problems such as finding a k-set in the intersection of l matroids, or finding k terminals in a network such that each of them can be connected simultaneously to the source by f disjoint paths.", "paper_title": "A parameterized view on matroid optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500057"}
