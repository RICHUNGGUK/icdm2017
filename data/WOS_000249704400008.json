Earlier version in STOC'89], is one of the most useful measures of Boolean functions. In this paper we investigate the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions (functions invariant under some transitive group action). We prove a Omega(N-1/3) lower bound for the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions. We also construct a weakly symmetric function which has block sensitivity O(N-3/7). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
