The simplest molecule (C(3)N(3)O(3)H(3)) is the most aromatic item out of the entire set, but some of the others also display aromatic character. The structure of all the rings is analyzed considering their molecular orbitals as well as studying the inductive effect.", "paper_title": "Aromaticity in cyanuric acid", "paper_id": "WOS:000291041800009"}
