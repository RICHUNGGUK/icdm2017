As technology improves sampling frequency, these stochastic datasets become increasingly large with faster dynamic events. More efficient algorithms are needed to accurately locate the unique states in each time trace. NoRSE adapts and optimizes a previously published noise reduction algorithm and uses a custom peak flagging routine to rapidly identify unique event states. The algorithm is explained using experimental data from our lab and its fitting accuracy and efficiency are then shown with a generalized model of stochastic datasets. The algorithm is compared to another recently published state finding algorithm and is found to be 27 times faster and more accurate over 55% of the generalized experimental space. NoRSE is written as an M-file for Matlab.", "paper_title": "NoRSE: noise reduction and state evaluator for high-frequency single event traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000299414200026"}
