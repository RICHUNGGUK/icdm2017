In addition, we develop a new method, called orthogonal cell code (OCC) scheme, to assist CS-CDMA for nullifying the ICI from contiguous cells. In system operation, each of the conventional cells is divided into an outer cell and an inner cell, and a mobile station (MS) should access to the CS-CDMA when it is in the outer cell and access to OFDM when it is in the inner cell. This study investigates the spectrum efficiency of using CS-CDMA and makes a comparison with that of long term evolution (LTE) in the following cases; (1) under an assumption of perfect channel state information and (2) based on channel estimates at a MS station. The results show the great advantage of utilizing the proposed system.", "paper_title": "A Combination of CS-CDMA and OFDM for Enhanced LTE on Downlink Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000316038800002"}
