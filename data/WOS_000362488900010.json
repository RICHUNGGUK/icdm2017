The histograms of sparse coefficients of all patches in an object are pooled together according to their spatial distribution. A particle filter methodology is used as the location model to predict candidates for object verification during tracking. Since color is an important visual clue to distinguish objects from background, we calculate the color similarity between objects in the previous frames and the candidates in current frame, which is adopted as color attention to tune the local sparse representation-based appearance similarity measurement between the object template and candidates. The color similarity can be calculated efficiently with hash coded color names, which helps the tracker find more reliable objects during tracking. We use a flexible local sparse coding of the object to evaluate the degeneration degree of the appearance model, based on which we build a model updating mechanism to alleviate drifting caused by temporal varying multi-factors. Experiments on 76 challenging benchmark color sequences and the evaluation under the object tracking benchmark protocol demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tracker over the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.", "paper_title": "Visual Tracking Based on the Adaptive Color Attention Tuned Sparse Generative Object Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000362488900010"}
