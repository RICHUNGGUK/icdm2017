The basis for the analysis is a recently developed integrated procedure for modelling the entire spray forming process. This model includes the atomisation stage taking thermal coupling into consideration and the deposition of the droplets at the surface of the billet taking geometrical aspects such as shading into account. The coupling between these two models is accomplished by ensuring that the total droplet size distribution of the spray is the summation of \"local\" droplet size distributions along the r-axis of the spray cone. The criterion for a successful process has been a predefined process window characterised by a desired solid fraction range at a certain distance from the atomizer. Inside this process window, the gas and melt flows have been varied and their influence on the solid fraction at the surface of the billet has been analysed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
