Their approach automates some stages of the annotation process, by using a combination of resources and services: a cross-domain knowledge base like DBpedia, two domain ontologies like GeoNames and the WGS84 vocabulary, and suggestion and synonym services. The authors' approach has been successfully evaluated with a set of geospatial RESTful services obtained from Programmable Web.com, where geospatial services account for a third of the total amount of services available in this registry.", "paper_title": "Adding Semantic Annotations into (Geospatial) RESTful Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000312931500003"}
