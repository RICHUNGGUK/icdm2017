In image forgery, region duplication is a simple and widely used method. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to detect image region duplication using the spin image which is an intensity-based and rotation invariant descriptor. The method can detect region duplication exactly and is robust to geometric transformations. Furthermore, it is superior to the popular SIFT-based detection method when the copied patch is from smooth background. The experiments have proved the method's effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Detection of Image Region Duplication Using Spin Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000321468100019"}
