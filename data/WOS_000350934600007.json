For this, deterministic air quality models are often used. However, its simulation usually needs high computational requirements due to complex chemical reactions involved. In this paper, a neural network-based metamodel approach is used in conjunction with a deterministic model and some measured data to approximate the non-linear ozone concentration relationship. For this, algorithms for performance enhancement of a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are developed. The proposed method is then applied to estimate the spatial distribution of ozone concentrations in the Sydney basin. The experimental comparison between the proposed RBFNN algorithm and the conventional RBFNN algorithm demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in estimating the spatial distribution of ozone level.
