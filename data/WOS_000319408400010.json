Here we describe an alternative use for appearance models, namely for producing facial composite images (sometimes referred to as E-FIT or PhotoFIT images). This application poses an interesting real-world optimization problem because the target face exists in the mind of the witness and not in a tangible form such as a digital image. To solve this problem we employ an interactive evolutionary algorithm that allows the witness to evolve a likeness to the target face. A system based on our approach, called EFIT-V, is used frequently by three quarters of UK police constabularies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
