This work presents a novel FLR extension, namely agglomerative similarity measure FLR, or asmFLR for short, for clustering based on a similarity measure function, the latter (function) may also be based on a metric. We demonstrate application in a metric space emerging from a weighted graph towards partitioning it. The asmFLR compares favorably with four alternative graph-clustering algorithms from the literature in a series of computational experiments on artificial data. In addition, our work introduces a novel index for the quality of clustering, which (index) compares favorably with two popular indices from the literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
