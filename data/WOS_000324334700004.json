A new module, shoe cloth, is created to allow a quick change of shoe appearance. Consumers can specify various design attributes in each module, including color, texture, embroidery, and shape. A prototype design system is implemented using augmented reality and sensing technologies based on the framework. This system consists of novel functions that support customization, design evaluation, and pattern development. The user can virtually put a customized shoe model on his/her foot in a video stream. The proposed framework not only facilitates evaluating products that are highly interactive with users, but also helps engage them in the design process. This work realizes the concept of human-centric design for mass customization.", "paper_title": "Augmented reality-based design customization of footwear for children", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334700004"}
