The proposed approach applies the histogram thresholding technique to obtain all possible uniform regions in the color image. Then, the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is utilized to improve the compactness of the clusters forming these uniform regions. Experimental results have demonstrated that the low complexity of the proposed HTFCM approach could obtain better cluster quality and segmentation results than other segmentation approaches that employing ant colony algorithm.
