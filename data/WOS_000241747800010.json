Making best use of the DSRC multichannel architecture, we propose a cluster-based multichannel communications scheme, which integrates the clustering with contention-free/contention-based MAC protocols. In our proposed scheme, the elected cluster-head (CH) vehicle functions as the coordinator (like WLAN's basestation) to collect/deliver the real-time safety messages within its own cluster and forward the consolidated safety messages to the neighboring CHs. Also, the CH vehicle controls channel-assignments for cluster-member vehicles transmitting/recieving the non-real-time traffics, which makes the wireless channels more efficiently utilized for the non-real-time data transmissions. Our scheme uses the contention-free MAC (TDMA/Broadcast) within a cluster and the IEEE 802.11 MAC among CH vehicles such that the real-time delivery of safety messages can be guaranteed. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the throughputs of vehicle data communications while guaranteeing the real-time delivery of safety messages.", "paper_title": "Cluster-based multi-channel communications protocols in vehicle ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241747800010"}
