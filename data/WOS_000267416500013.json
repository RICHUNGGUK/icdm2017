Design/methodology/approach - Quantity analysis, including regression analysis, analysis of variance and test of hypotheses were employed. Findings - To complete the description, classification, certification and confirmation of risk mode. Research limitations/implications - To describe and control the risk with the model to provide basis when building support system in today's society. Practical implications - To build support system in today's society. Originality/value - The method adopted in the paper includes the analysis of models and analysis of variance technology in multivariate statistics. The methods of analysis and approaches revealed in this paper could be broadly applied into all kinds of researches for such organization issue.", "paper_title": "A study on the randomness of economics' system risk", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500013"}
