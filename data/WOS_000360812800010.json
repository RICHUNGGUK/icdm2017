The work presented in this paper deals with the estimation of traffic state variables (density and speed), using the so called Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Observer (STSM). Several numerical simulations, using simulated and real data, show the relevance of the proposed approach. In addition, a comparative study with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is carried-out. The comparison indices concern convergence and stability, dynamic performance and robustness. The design of the two observers is achieved using a nonlinear second order traffic flow model in the same highway traffic and geometric conditions.", "paper_title": "Comparative Study of a Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Observer and an Extended Kalman Filter for a Freeway Traffic System", "paper_id": "WOS:000360812800010"}
