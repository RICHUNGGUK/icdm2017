Contrary to past beliefs, the relevance of this properly to object oriented systems is brought out. In support of the new argument, counterexamples to earlier claims are formulated and two new metrics highlighting a notion of complexity that is capturable through Property 9 are also presented.", "paper_title": "Applicability of Weyuker's Property 9 to object oriented metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000236848300005"}
