We essentially use a pointer technique together with tiering. We prove T(k) subset of NC(k) subset of T(k+1), for k >= 2. Special attention is put on the description of T(2) and T(3) and on the proof of T(2) subset of NC(2) subset of T(3). Such a hierarchy yields a characterization of NC.", "paper_title": "Towards an implicit characterization of NC(k)", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300014"}
