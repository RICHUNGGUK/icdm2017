With the generalized model, numerical simulations of cyclic and monotonic undrained triaxial tests were conducted to reproduce the phenomenon of continuous, orderly and rapid changes in anisotropy during liquefaction. The simulated results demonstrated that when sand enters the liquefaction stage, the yield surface in the stress space rotates quickly, causing continuous and rapid changes in anisotropy. Through comparison of the simulated and experimental results, the generalized constitutive model was shown to be able to capture the fundamental behaviors of sand demonstrated by the experimental data, and the rotational hardening rule adopted in the generalized model was proven suitable for describing the continuous, orderly and rapid changes in anisotropy that occur during liquefaction.
