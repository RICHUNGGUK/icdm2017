By taking advantage of MIMO-OFDM and special design for the TDD frame, peak data rate of 100 Mbps can be achieved. The system is required to support service in both indoor and outdoor environments, and guarantee high data rate communication even with mobility up to 250 kmph. Detail theoretical analysis was carried out to give the principle of designing frame structure for the system under different environments. In order to reduce the influence of Doppler Effect, adaptive frame structure is proposed for the uplink. By special design on the frame for different environments, the channel information can be tracked accurately with low overhead, which ensures the system performance. Through simulation based on the platform of Future Technologies for Universal Radio Enviroment (FuTURE) project, bit error rate (BER) can achieve lower than 10(-6) when E(b)/N(0) is 3 dB for various mobility case in both indoor and outdoor environments, which satisfies the requirement of FuTURE project. By employing it into B3G-TDD uplink, robustness to Doppler Effect is strengthened greatly.
