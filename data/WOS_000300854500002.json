Some important properties of the proposed system and its solution are then discussed. Taking the concentration of 1,3-PD at the terminal time as the cost functional, we establish an optimal control model involving the controlled nonlinear dynamical system and subject to continuous state inequality constraints. The existence of the optimal control is also proved. A computational approach is constructed on the basis of constraint transcription and smoothing approximation techniques. Numerical results show that, by employing the optimal control strategy, the concentration of 1,3-PD at the terminal time can be increased considerably.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear dynamical systems of fed-batch fermentation and their optimal control", "paper_id": "WOS:000300854500002"}
