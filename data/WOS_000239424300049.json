By exploiting the semantic relationships that characterize learning resources and learner profile, the proposed semantic-based thematic approach supports both semantic querying and conceptual navigation of learning resources pertaining to specific topics. A system has been developed and deployed within an academic setting, enabling learners to organize, search, and share the learning resources in a flexible and personalized manner.", "paper_title": "Semantic-based thematic search for personalized e-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300049"}
