There is a highly dynamic flow of information in a situation where most of the relevant data is heterogeneous, cannot be predicted and loaded previously. Even though many efforts have been made in data integration research, choosing the appropriate approach to an unknown (in advance) semantic level of information is still an open issue. The traditional relational data integration methods are not suitable to support complex environments due to the rigidity of their schema. As an alternative, Graph Data models can handle structural heterogeneity complemented by semantic representations like Linked Open Data on the Web. Based on these alternatives, this research proposes aDApTA, an adaptive approach to information integration and its associated architecture. An application example in a real scenario is presented. In this scenario, the logistics of relief goods are managed by a dynamic and multi-perspective view. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
