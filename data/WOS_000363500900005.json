This is partly because Android and its task scheduler, the completely fair scheduler (CFS), may incur perceptibly long response time to user-interactive tasks. Particularly, the Android framework cannot systemically favor user-interactive tasks over other background tasks since it does not distinguish between them. Furthermore, user-interactive tasks can suffer from high dispatch latency due to the non-preemptive nature of CFS. To address these problems, this paper presents framework-assisted task characterization and virtual time-based CFS. The former is a cross-layer resource control mechanism between the Android framework and the underlying Linux kernel. It identifies user-interactive tasks at the framework-level, by using the notion of a user-interactive task chain. It then enables the kernel scheduler to selectively promote the priorities of worker tasks appearing in the task chain to reduce the preemption latency. The latter is a cross-layer refinement of CFS in terms of interactivity. It allows a task to be preempted at every predefined period. It also adjusts the virtual runtimes of the identified user-interactive tasks to ensure that they are always scheduled prior to the other tasks in the run-queue when they wake up. As a result, the dispatch latency of a user-interactive task is reduced to a small value. We have implemented our approach into Android 4.1.2 running with Linux kernel 3.0.31. Experimental results show that the response time of a user interaction is reduced by up to 77.35% while incurring only negligible overhead.
