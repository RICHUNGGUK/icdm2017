Many existing feature selection methods eliminate redundancy by measuring pairwise inter-correlation of features, whereas the complementariness of features and higher inter-correlation among more than two features are ignored. In this study, a modification item concerning feature complementariness is introduced in the evaluation criterion of features. Additionally, in order to identify the interference effect of already-selected False Positives (FPs), the redundancy-complementariness dispersion is also taken into account to adjust the measurement of pairwise inter-correlation of features. To illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method, classification experiments are applied with four frequently used classifiers on ten datasets. Classification results verify the superiority of proposed method compared with seven representative feature selection methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
