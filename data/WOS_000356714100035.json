Due to the introduction of the valve-point effect in the ELD objective function, the optimization task requires tools appropriate for a nonconvex optimization landscape. In this respect, we employ the CE approach, which constructs a random sequence of solutions probabilistically converging to a near-optimal solution and, thus, facilitating the exploration capability. Additionally, to fine-tune the solution in promising basins of attraction, the SQP algorithm is invoked, which performs a local search. Despite its reliance on a global heuristic scheme, CE-SQP is vested with fast convergence capability, which may entail its use for online power dispatch. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches have been demonstrated with four standard test systems that are widely reported in the ELD literature.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid With Cross-Entropy Method and Sequential Quadratic Programming to Solve Economic Load Dispatch Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100035"}
