The proposed approach is based on the clustering of the observations around the directions given by the columns of the mixing matrix that occurs typically for sparse inputs. Exploiting this fact, the RSC algorithm proceeds by parameterizing the mixing matrix using hyperspherical coordinates, randomly selecting candidate basis vectors (i.e. clustering directions) from the observations, and accepting or rejecting them according to a binary hypothesis test based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion. The RSC algorithm is not tailored to any specific distribution for the sources, can deal with an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs (thus solving the difficult under-determined problem), and is applicable to both instantaneous and convolutive mixtures. Extensive simulations for synthetic and real data with different number of inputs and outputs, data size, sparsity factors of the inputs and signal to noise ratios confirm the good performance of the proposed approach under moderate/high signal to noise ratios.
