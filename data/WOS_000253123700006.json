The set of fuzzy variables is a linear space with the classic operations of addition and multiplication by numbers. Its subspace formed by fuzzy variables with finite p(th) absolute moments is showed to be a complete para-normed space. The concept of para-normed space is novel, and is an extension of normes space. It is seen that most properties of normed spaces hold in para-normed spaces. Also some useful inequalities in para-normed spaces are obtained.", "paper_title": "On para-normed space with fuzzy variables based on expected valued operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000253123700006"}
