This proposed method is based on concepts of the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions for solving multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems in a fuzzy environment. The performance rating values and weights of criteria are linguistic variables expressed as triangular interval-valued fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, we appraise the performance of alternatives against both subjective and objective criteria with multi-judges for decision-making problems. Finally, for the purpose of proving the validity of the proposed method a numerical example is presented for a robot selection problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
