A numerical technique for solving the proposed two-compartment model (2CM) is developed and validated against some newly derived analytical solutions. Moreover, the inverse technique for extracting the rate constant of one-compartment model (1CM) is extended to 2CM. A correlation of aggregation rate constant of 2CM with the rate constant of conventional 1CM under some restrictions is investigated and it is found that the 1CM cannot be used, in general, to predict results of 2CM. Furthermore, it is observed that the existence of two zones in SFBG is responsible to certain extent for time dependent behaviour of aggregation rate constant. Finally, influence of compartment sizes and particles residence times on particle size distribution is investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
