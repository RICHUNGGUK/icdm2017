In NEC, systems need to be integrated in context, to assist in human activity and provide dependable inter-operation. In this paper, we present our research work in the NECTISE project with a focus on the modelling and simulation of service-oriented architecture (SOA) for delivering dependable and sustainable military capability. The simulation results indicate that the proposed architectural model can provide a high-level of reliability and sustainability in the provision of capability in a dynamic environment. Moreover, a NEC demonstration system for regional surveillance is introduced in this paper to illustrate the use of SOA to achieve NEC. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
