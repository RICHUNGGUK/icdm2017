OLSR optimizes the flooding of link state information through the network using multipoint relays (MPRs). Only nodes selected as MPRs are responsible for forwarding control traffic. Many research papers aim to optimize the selection of MPRs with a specific purpose in mind: e.g., to minimize their number, to keep paths with high Quality of Service or to maximize the network lifetime (the time until the first node runs Out Of energy). In such analyzes often the effects of the network Structure on the M PR selection are not taken into account. In this paper we show that the Structure of the network call have a large impact oil the MPR selection. In highly regular structures (Such as grids) there is even no variation in the MPR sets that result from various MPR selection mechanisms. Furthermore, we study the influence of the network structure oil the network lifetime problem in a setting where at regular intervals messages are broadcasted using MPRs. We introduce the 'maximum forcedness ratio', as a key parameter of the network to describe how much variation there is in the lifetime results of various MPR selection heuristics. Although We focus our attention to OLSR, a widely implemented protocol, oil a more abstract level Our results describe the Structure of connected sets dominating the 2-hop neighborhood of a node.
