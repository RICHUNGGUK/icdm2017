Detailed descriptions of the issues around it are hard to find and formal descriptions together with correctness proofs are non-existing. In this paper, we discuss a one-pass type reconstruction for objects in the logical framework LF, describe formally the type reconstruction process using the framework of contextual modal types, and prove correctness of type reconstruction. Since type reconstruction will find most general types and may leave free variables, we in addition describe abstraction which will return a closed object where all free variables are bound at the outside. We also implemented our algorithms as part of the Beluga language, and the performance of our type reconstruction algorithm is comparable to type reconstruction in existing systems such as the logical framework Twelf.", "paper_title": "An insider's look at LF type reconstruction: everything you (n)ever wanted to know", "paper_id": "WOS:000311928200001"}
