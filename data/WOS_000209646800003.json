It has been operational since November 2012 and delivers approximately 50 predictions each day for countries of Latin America. EMBERS is built on a streaming, scalable, loosely coupled, shared-nothing architecture using ZeroMQ as its messaging backbone and JSON as its wire data format. It is deployed on Amazon Web Services using an entirely automated deployment process. We describe the architecture of the system, some of the design tradeoffs encountered during development, and specifics of the machine learning models underlying EMBERS. We also present a detailed prospective evaluation of EMBERS in forecasting significant societal events in the past 2 years.", "paper_title": "FORECASTING SIGNIFICANT SOCIETAL EVENTS USING THE EMBERS STREAMING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000209646800003"}
