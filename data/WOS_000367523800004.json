This article presents a proposal to automatically manage these reports. We consider not only the users' public behavior, but also private messages between users. The automatic approach is based, in both cases, on the reporters' reputation along with other metrics intrinsic to social networks. Promising results from adopting the proposed reporting methods on Frisber, a geolocalized social network in production, are presented as well as some experiments based on real data extracted from Frisber.", "paper_title": "Chasing Offensive Conduct in Social Networks: A Reputation-Based Practical Approach for Frisber", "paper_id": "WOS:000367523800004"}
