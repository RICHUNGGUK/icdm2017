Each vertex i is assigned a type x(i) with x(1),...,x(n) being independent identically distributed as a nonnegative random variable X. We assume that EX3 < infinity. Given types of all vertices, an edge exists between vertices i and j independent of anything else and with probability min{1, x(i)x(j)/n (1 + a/n(1/3))}. We study the critical phase, which is known to take place when EX2 = 1. We prove that normalized by n(-2/3) the asymptotic joint distributions of component sizes of the graph equals the joint distribution of the excursions of a reflecting Brownian motion with diffusion coefficient root EXEX3 and drift a - EX3/EX s. In particular, we conclude that the size of the largest connected component is of order n(2/3). (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
