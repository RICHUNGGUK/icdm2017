Comparing with the previous protocols, in the proposed protocol, no classical message has been exchanged during the decoding of the secret messages, so the present scheme has not only overcome the drawback \"information leakage\" or \"classical correlation\" but also it possesses the characters of security and maximum efficiency. The other highlight of our protocol is that, in this method one party is able to first read the message received from the other party before sending another message back in reply.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT PROTOCOL FOR QUANTUM SECURE DIALOGUE WITH AUTHENTICATION BY USING SINGLE PHOTONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700010"}
