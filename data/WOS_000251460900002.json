On the one hand, we describe a basic strategy language for Maude and show its application to CCS, the ambient calculus, and the parallel functional language Eden. On the other hand, we show how the concept of stuttering simulation can be used inside Maude to show that a stack machine correctly implements the operational semantics of a simple functional language.
