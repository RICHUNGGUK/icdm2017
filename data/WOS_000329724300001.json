Data aggregation is an essential technique to reduce the communication overhead and energy consumption. Since many applications require data privacy, we need to take security into consideration. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient, secure, highly accurate, and scalable scheme for data aggregation (EESSDA). The main idea of EESSDA is that secure data aggregation is achieved by establishing secure channel and slicing technology. The EESSDA scheme does not need encryption and decryption operations during the data aggregation, which saves energy and obtain high accuracy of aggregation results. Meanwhile, in EESSDA scheme, the advanced deployment of shared information between nodes is not required, making the networks with good scalability. Our analysis and simulations show that EESSDA is of lower communication overhead, more efficiency and accuracy, and better privacy preservation and scalability than existing schemes.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient and Scalable Secure Data Aggregation for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329724300001"}
