The measurement process is performed by collecting data at discrete time instants from several outputs. An observation plan is proposed based on a scalar measure of the Fisher information matrix as the design criterion quantifying the accuracy of parameter estimators. A numerical procedure is proposed to determine approximations of optimum designs in the case of correlated measurement errors. The approach is illustrated with an example of the multi-output system of equations describing a chemical kinetic reaction. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
