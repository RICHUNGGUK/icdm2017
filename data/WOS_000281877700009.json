The tunnel, excavated in a stiff clay, is 14 m wide with 6 m to 21 m of overburden thickness. The constitutive model was calibrated using laboratory data (oedometric and triaxial tests) and the parameters were optimised using monitoring data from an exploratory drift. Based on the optimised data set, the future tunnel was simulated. After the tunnel excavation, it could be concluded that the model predicted correctly surface settlements, surface horizontal displacements, and the distribution of vertical displacements with depth. It overpredicted horizontal displacements in the vicinity of the tunnel. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
