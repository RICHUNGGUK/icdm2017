On account of the new interference scenario in our scheme, a more accurate model of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is deduced and analyzed instead of using the conventional equation. As demonstrated by our system-level simulations, the capacity is significantly improved by reusing the same radio resource among different P2P transmitters within a single cellular cell ill the spatial domain. Furthermore, we employ critical values of SINR target observed from simulation results to indicate whether the P2P-enabled system is resource-restricted or interference-restricted for a certain application scenario. By means of a hexagon-padding plan, the relation between co-channel reuse distance and sin-le-hop distance is also pointed out to help to apply our scheme to a real implementation.
