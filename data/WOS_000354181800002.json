We consider relay network applying decode-and-forward protocol. The channels between nodes adopt the IEEE 802.15.4a norms. The bit error rate performance is analyzed considering the effect of interference. Our results show significant improvement due to the diversity gain provided by the relay nodes. However, the performance is limited when multiple access interference (MAI) is present. To combat the MAI effect and further improve the detection reliability, we propose to use antenna selection at the relay. The relay receiver is assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas, and only the best antenna is selected. This is shown to improve the performance in the presence of MAI and improve the diversity gain.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of multiple-input multiple-output relay networks based impulse radio ultra-wideband", "paper_id": "WOS:000354181800002"}
