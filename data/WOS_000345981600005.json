Motivated by the ideal of dependent aggregation, in this paper, we develop some dependent hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators: the dependent hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (DHFOWA) operator and the dependent hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (DHFOWG) operator, in which the associated weights only depend on the aggregated hesitant fuzzy arguments and can relieve the influence of unfair hesitant fuzzy arguments on the aggregated results by assigning low weights to those \"false\" and \"biased\" ones and then apply them to develop some approaches for multiple attribute group decision making with hesitant fuzzy information. Finally, an illustrative example for supplier selection is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "An approach to multiple attribute decision making problems based on hesitant fuzzy set", "paper_id": "WOS:000345981600005"}
