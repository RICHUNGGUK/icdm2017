The algorithm proposed in this paper generates n ISTs for an n-dimensional crossed cube (CQ(n)). This algorithm takes time O (N log N) and can be parallelized to run in time O (log N), where N = 2(n) is the number of the nodes in CQ(n). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm which can parallelly construct the ISTs in crossed cubes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
