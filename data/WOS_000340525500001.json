In this paper, we report the development of a practical monocular vision system for measurement of the relative error between the drill tool center point (TCP) and the reference hole. First, the principle of relative error measurement with the vision system is explained, followed by a detailed discussion on the hardware components, software components, and system integration. The elliptical contour extraction algorithm is presented for accurate and robust reference hole detection. System calibration is of key importance to the measurement accuracy of a vision system. A new method is proposed for the simultaneous calibration of camera internal parameters and hand-eye relationship with a dedicated calibration board. Extensive measurement experiments have been performed on a robotic drilling system. Experimental results show that the measurement accuracy of the developed vision system is higher than 0.15 mm, which meets the requirement of robotic drilling for aircraft structures.", "paper_title": "Development of a monocular vision system for robotic drilling", "paper_id": "WOS:000340525500001"}
