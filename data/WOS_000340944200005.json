One of their interesting applications is to automatically detect missing tags in a large storage space, which may have to be performed frequently to catch any missing event such as theft in time. Because RFID systems typically work under low-rate channels, past research has focused on reducing execution time of a detection protocol to prevent excessively long protocol execution from interfering normal inventory operations. However, when active tags are used for a large spatial coverage, energy efficiency becomes critical in prolonging the lifetime of these battery-powered tags. Furthermore, much of the existing literature assumes that the channel between a reader and tags is reliable, which is not always true in reality because of noise/interference in the environment. Given these concerns, this paper makes three contributions. First, we propose a novel protocol design that considers both energy efficiency and time efficiency. It achieves multifold reduction in both energy cost and execution time when compared to the best existing work. Second, we reveal a fundamental energy-time tradeoff in missing-tag detection, which can be flexibly controlled through a couple of system parameters in order to achieve desirable performance. Third, we extend our protocol design to consider channel error under two different models. We find that energy/time cost will be higher in unreliable channel conditions, but the energy-time tradeoff relation persists.", "paper_title": "Missing-Tag Detection and Energy-Time Tradeoff in Large-Scale RFID Systems With Unreliable Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000340944200005"}
