In order to identify the co-channel signals from different Ground Stations (GSs), the N-Shift Zero Correlation Zone (NS-ZCZ) sequences are employed for pilot sequences. The ideal correlation property of the proposed pilot sequence in ZCZ can maintain the signal with less co-channel interference. The simulation confirms that the more co-channel GSs are employed, the higher navigation accuracy can be achieved.", "paper_title": "N-Shift ZCZ Pilot Sequence Design for High Accuracy Navigation Based on Broadband Air-to-Ground Communication System", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414700010"}
