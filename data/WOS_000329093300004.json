(This is a special case of so-called restricted assignment, where the set of eligible machines can be arbitrary for each job.) This is the first improvement of the approximation ratio 2 of Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos (Math. Program. 46:259-271, 1990), to a smaller constant for any special case with unbounded number of machines and unbounded processing times. We conclude by showing integrality gaps of several relaxations of related problems.", "paper_title": "Graph Balancing: A Special Case of Scheduling Unrelated Parallel Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000329093300004"}
