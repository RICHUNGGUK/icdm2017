Although scalability has been widely discussed, especially for pure parallel computer systems, it conveniently focuses on improving performance when increasing the number of computing processors. In fact, the term \"scalable\" is so much abused that it has become a marketing tool for computer vendors independent of the system's technical qualifications. Since the primary objective of scalability analysis is to determine how well a system can work on larger problems with an increase in its size, we introduce here a generic definition of scalability. For illustrative purposes only, we apply this definition to PC clusters, a rather difficult subject due to their long communication latencies. Since scalability does not solely depend on the system architecture but also on the application programs and their actual management by the run-time environment, for the sake of illustration, we evaluate scalability for programs developed under the super-programming model (SPM) (Jin and Ziavras in IEEE Trans.
