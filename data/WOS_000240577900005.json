A skeleton in the MALLBA library implements an optimization method in one of the three families of generic optimization techniques offered: exact, heuristic and hybrid. Moreover, for each of those methods, MALLBA provides three different implementations: sequential, parallel for Local Area Networks, and parallel for Wide Area Networks. This paper introduces the architecture of the MALLBA library, details some of the implemented skeletons, and offers computational results for some classical optimization problems to show the viability of our library. Among other conclusions, we claim that the design used to develop the optimization techniques included in the library is generic and efficient at the same time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
