The optimal estimate of the Markov chain and the parameters of the price model are given in terms of discrete-time recursive filters. We provide an application on a set of high frequency gold price data for the period 1973-2006 and analyse the h-step ahead price predictions against the Diebold-Kilian metric. Within the modelling framework where the mean and volatility are switching regimes, our findings suggest that a two-state hidden Markov model is sufficient to describe the dynamics of the data and the gold price is predictable up to a certain extent in the short term but almost impossible to predict in the long term. The proposed model is also bench-marked with ARCH and GARCH models with respect to price predictability and forecasting errors.
