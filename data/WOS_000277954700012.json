In CBSS development, it is common to identify software modules first. Once they are determined, we need to select appropriate software components for each software module. However, very few research works so far have addressed the theoretical aspect especially in the optimization of software component selection for CBSS development. Previous studies of CBSS development seldom considered the influence of software components on coupling and cohesion of software modules. In this paper, the formulation of an optimization model of software components selection for CBSS development is described. The model has two objectives: maximizing the functional performance of the CBSS and maximizing the cohesion and minimizing the coupling of software modules. A genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to solve the optimization model for determining the optimal selection of software components for CBSS development. An example of developing a financial system for small- and medium-size enterprises is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
