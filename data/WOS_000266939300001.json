Rodl and Rucinski studied this problem for the random graph G,,, in the symmetric case when k is fixed and F(1) = ... = F(k) = F. They proved that such a coloring exists asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) provided that p <= bn(-beta) for some constants b = b(F,k) and beta = beta(F). This result is essentially best possible because for p >= Bn(-beta), where B = B(F, k) is a large constant, such an edge-coloring does not exist. Kohayakawa and Kreuter conjectured a threshold function n(-beta(F1,..., Fk)) for arbitrary F(1), ..., F(k). In this article we address the case when F(1),..., F(k) are cliques of different sizes and propose an algorithm that a.a.s. finds a valid k-edge-coloring of G(n,p) with p <= bn(-beta) for some constant b = b(F(1),..., F(k)), where beta = beta(F(1),..., F(k)) as conjectured. With a few exceptions, this algorithm also works in the general symmetric case. We also show that there exists a constant B = B(F,,..., Fk) such that for p >= Bn(-beta) the random graph G(n,p) a.a.s. does not have a valid k-edge-coloring provided the so-called KLR-conjecture holds.
