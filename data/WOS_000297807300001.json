For 1-D signals and fixed ISI, this detection problem is well-known to be solved using the Viterbi algorithm in time complexity that is linear in the sequence length. It is shown here that, in contrast, the 2-D MLSD problem is NP hard. Specifically, a decision formulation of the problem is shown to be NP complete for a particular 2-D ISI cascaded with either of two memoryless channels: one involving errors and erasures and the other corresponding to additive white Gaussian noise. The proof for the latter case is obtained through a reduction from a still NP complete restricted version of the former. These results are applied to proving the NP completeness of multiuser detection under a Toeplitz constraint-a problem known to be equivalent to a variant of 1-D MLSD with growing ISI. This proves a conjecture posed by Verdu in 1989.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection Is NP Hard", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300001"}
