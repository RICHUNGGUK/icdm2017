It has been proved that MIN WCF (p) is NP-hard for any p >= 4 (lmielinska et al. (1993) [10]) but (2-1/n)-approximable (Goemans and Williamson (1995) [9]). While MIN WCF(2) is polynomial-time solvable, already the unweighted version of MIN WCF(3) is NP-hard even on planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3. We prove here that for any p >= 4. the unweighted version is NP-hard, even for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3: moreover, the unweighted version for any p >= 3 has no ptas for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3. The latter theorem is the first-ever APX-hardness result on this problem. On the other hand, we show that MIN WCF (p) is polynomial-time solvable on graphs with bounded treewidth, and for any p bounded by O(log n/log log n) it has a ptas on planar graphs.
