Based on the IEEE 802.11n standard, frame aggregation is considered one of the major factors to improve the system performance of WLANs from the medium access control (MAC) perspective. In order to fulfill the requirements of high throughput performance, feasible design of automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanisms becomes important for providing reliable data transmission. In this paper, two MAC-defined ARQ protocols are proposed to consider the effect from frame aggregation for the enhancement of network throughput. An aggregated selective repeat ARQ (ASR-ARQ) scheme is proposed which incorporates the selective repeat ARQ scheme with the consideration of frame aggregation. On the other hand, for worse channel quality, the aggregated hybrid ARQ (AH-ARQ) mechanism is proposed to further enhance the throughput performance by adopting the Reed-Solomon (RS) block code as forward error correction (FEC) scheme. Novel analytical models for both the ASR-ARQ and AH-ARQ protocols are established with the consideration of interfering wireless stations. Simulations are conducted to validate and compare the proposed ARQ mechanisms based on the service time distribution and system throughput. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed AH-ARQ protocol can outperform the other schemes under worse channel condition; while the ASR-ARQ scheme is superior to the other mechanisms under better channel condition.", "paper_title": "Novel Design and Analysis of Aggregated ARQ Protocols for IEEE 802.11n Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314018300013"}
