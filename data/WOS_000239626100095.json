Therefore, we add USN (Ubiquitous Sensor Network) technology, which recognizes and manages an appliance's state-information (temperature, humidity, pollution and so on) by connecting RFID tags, and propose the Smart Multi-Agent Middleware architecture for intelligently managing the RFID-based ubiquitous computing environment. We also present the proposed architecture's execution procedure for controlling ubiquitous appliances.", "paper_title": "Research on Smart Multi-Agent Middleware for RFID-based ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100095"}
