The model is viewed as a system of systems with 10 degrees of freedom. The analysis is developed by using the classical method of Lagrange equations and is developed in view of the qualitative and computational analysis. The model is then supposed to act as a general paradigm for specific applications generally related to safety and comfort analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
