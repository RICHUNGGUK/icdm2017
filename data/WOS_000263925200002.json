The neural controller is designed to track pitch rate command signal generated using the reference model. A helicopter having a soft inplane four-bladed hingeless main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor with conventional mechanical controls is used for the simulation studies. For the simulation study, a linearized helicopter model at different straight and level flight conditions is considered. A neural network with a linear filter architecture trained using backpropagation through time is used to approximate the control law. The controller network parameters are adapted using updated rules Lyapunov synthesis. The off-line trained (for finite time interval) network provides the necessary stability and tracking performance. The on-line learning is used to adapt the network under varying flight conditions. The on-line learning ability is demonstrated through parameter uncertainties. The performance of the proposed direct adaptive neural controller (DANC) is compared with feedback error learning neural controller (FENC). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
