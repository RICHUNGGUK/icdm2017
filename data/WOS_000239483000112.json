The predictive model of chaotic time series is established with the discrete Volterra neural networks and the steps of the learning algorithm with discrete Volterra neural networks are expressed. The predictive model and the learning algorithm are more effective and reliable than the adaptive higher-order nonlinear FIR filter. The Experimental and simulating results show the discrete Volterra neural networks can be successfully used to predict chaotic time series.", "paper_title": "Prediction for chaotic time series based on discrete Volterra neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000112"}
