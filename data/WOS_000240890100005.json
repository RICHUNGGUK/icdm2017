These states, when geometrically represented on the Bloch sphere, give a new trajectory. We further consider some Hadamard \"type\" operations and find ensembles of states for which such transformations hold. The unequal superposition of a qubit and its orthogonal complement is also investigated.", "paper_title": "Hadamard type operations for qubits", "paper_id": "WOS:000240890100005"}
