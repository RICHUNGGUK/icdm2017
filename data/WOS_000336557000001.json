Then, we apply this new mask to image edge detection and can obtain the better edge information image. In order to get continuous and thin edges, we synthesize a new gradient and adopt the non-maxima suppression method For a comparison, we consider the edge map yielded by the sobel operator and canny operator. By contrast, we discover that the edge image obtained by NIFD operator is better than those of sobel and canny operators, and specially for a noisy image, NIFD operator has the best anti-noise ability.", "paper_title": "Edge Detection Based on the Newton Interpolation's Fractional Differentiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336557000001"}
