To satisfy speed and accuracy requirements, some modifications have been applied on differential difference amplifier (DDA) CMFB circuit. The proposed method is applied to a folded cascode op-amp with power supply of 3.3 V. In order to verify the proposed circuit, simulations are done in 0.35 mu m standard CMOS technology. In the worst condition when the output common-mode (CM) voltage is initialized to VCC or GND, only 1.1 ns is required to set the output CM voltage on the desired level. Also in a wide range of input CM voltage variations, the deviation of the output CM voltage from reference voltage is less than 6 mV, so simulation results confirm the expected accuracy and speed while simultaneously the proposed CMFB circuit preserves other characteristics of DDA CMFB circuit such as unity gain frequency, 3-dB bandwidth, phase margin and linearity.", "paper_title": "A FAST AND LOW SETTLING ERROR CONTINUOUS-TIME COMMON-MODE FEEDBACK CIRCUIT BASED ON DIFFERENTIAL DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER", "paper_id": "WOS:000336150600009"}
