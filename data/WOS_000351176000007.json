Virtual machine placement is the key in the server consolidation technology. In the past few years, many approaches to the virtual machine placement have been proposed. However, existing virtual machine placement approaches consider the energy consumption by physical machines only, but do not consider the energy consumption in communication network, in a data center. However, the energy consumption in the communication network in a data center is not trivial, and therefore should be considered in the virtual machine placement. In our preliminary research, we have proposed a genetic algorithm for a new virtual machine placement problem that considers the energy consumption in both physical machines and the communication network in a data center. Aiming at improving the performance and efficiency of the genetic algorithm, this paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm for the energy-efficient virtual machine placement problem. Experimental results show that the hybrid genetic algorithm significantly outperforms the original genetic algorithm, and that the hybrid genetic algorithm is scalable.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Energy-Efficient Virtual Machine Placement Problem in Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000351176000007"}
