In this article, we propose a robust tracking method that is capable of extracting a rodent from a frame under uncontrolled normal laboratory conditions. The method consists of two steps. First, a sliding window combines three features to coarsely track the animal. Then, it uses the edglets of the rodent to adjust the tracked region to the animal's boundary. The method achieves an average tracking error that is smaller than a representative state-of-the-art method.", "paper_title": "Catching a Rat by Its Edglets", "paper_id": "WOS:000314717800021"}
