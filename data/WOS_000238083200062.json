An important issue in GIR, as for all IR, is relevance. In this paper we argue that spatial relevance should be considered independently from thematic relevance, and propose an initial scheme. A pilot study to assess this relevance scheme is presented, with initial results suggesting that users can distinguish between these two relevance dimensions, and that furthermore they have different properties. We suggest that spatial relevance requires greater assessor effort and more localised geographic knowledge than judging thematic relevance.", "paper_title": "Judging the spatial relevance of documents for GIR", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200062"}
