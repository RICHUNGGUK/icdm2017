The system provides the animator with an intuitive user interface and produces compelling results even when presented with a very small set of examples. In addition it is able to generalize well by extrapolating far beyond the examples.", "paper_title": "Context-aware skeletal shape deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500007"}
