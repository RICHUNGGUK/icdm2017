By using the SOM (self-organized map)-like model, Egocentric SOM (ESOM), VisCog can merge the other peers' knowledge artifacts (e.g., documents) under a focal peer's knowledge structure and visually present the cognitive knowledge map of the P2P network. The experimental results from evaluating VisCog performance show that VisCog can retain an individual peer's knowledge structure while articulating with those of other peers to build its cognitive knowledge map.
