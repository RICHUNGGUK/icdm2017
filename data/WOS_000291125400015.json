At first, we show the existence and the uniqueness of a viscosity solution to this problem. Then we propose a numerical scheme for solving the nonlinear level set equation on unstructured triangulations adapted to the data sample. We show the consistency of this scheme. In addition, we show how to compute nodewise first and second order derivatives. Some application examples of curve or surface construction are provided to illustrate the potential and to demonstrate the accuracy of this method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
