The majority of the research in the field and the development of EMO algorithms is primarily focussed on converging to a Pareto optimal approximation close to or along the true Pareto front of synthetic test problems. However, when EMO is applied to real-world optimisation problems there is often a decision maker who is only interested in a portion of the Pareto front (the Region of Interest) which is defined by their expressed preferences for the problem objectives. In this paper a novel preference articulation operator for EMO algorithms is introduced (named the Weighted Z-score Preference Articulation Operator) with the flexibility of being incorporated a priori, a posteriori or progressively, and as either a primary or auxiliary fitness operator. The Weighted Z-score Preference Articulation Operator is incorporated into an implementation of the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (named WZ-MOEA/D) and benchmarked against MOEA/D-DRA on a number of hi-objective and five-objective test problems with test cases containing preference information. After promising results are obtained when comparing WZ-MOEA/D to MOEA/D-DRA in the presence of decision maker preferences, WZ-MOEA/D is successfully applied to a real-world optimisation problem to optimise a classifier for concealed weapon detection, producing better results than previously published classifier implementations.
