Carefully designed and managed priority services are essential for quality-demanding traffic, especially in large-scale IP-based environments where aggregation of flows is extensive and a variety of traffic types co-exist. Although individual mechanisms have been widely investigated, not much related work exists on integrated approaches to QoS provisioning that are also feasible to implement. This work presents a thorough approach to the design, dimensioning and provisioning of a high-priority service for high-quality-demanding traffic over an IP network. Our approach employs efficient scheduling and a dynamic admission control scheme while demonstrating an outstanding performance in terms of the quality offered to QoS-demanding traffic. A novel feature is also introduced: while other existing schemes only focus on provisioning of service rate guarantees, ours achieves in addition differentiation of the end-to-end delay perceived by IP flows.
