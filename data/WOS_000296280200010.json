A two-dimensional representation of the virtual models is embedded in a printed image. We apply computer vision techniques to interpret the printed image and extract the virtual models, which are then overlaid on the printed image. The main advantages of our approach are: (1) the image of the embedded virtual models and their behaviors are understandable to a human without using an AR system and (2) no database or network communication is required to retrieve the models. To demonstrate the technology and test its usability, we implemented several applications and performed a user evaluation. We discuss how the proposed technique can be used for the development of applications in different domains such as education, advertisement, and gaming.", "paper_title": "In-Place Augmented Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000296280200010"}
