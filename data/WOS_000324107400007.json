Specifically, for systems where there are features that cannot be modeled by a domain expert within the human computer interaction. In such cases, statistical models are applied instead of stereotype user models. The time consumption of these models is high, and when a requisite of bounded response time is added most common solution involves summarizing knowledge. Summarization involves deleting knowledge from the knowledge base and probably losing accuracy in the medium-term. This proposal provides all the advantages of statistical user models and avoids knowledge loss by using an R-Tree structure and various search spaces (universes of users) of diverse granularity for solving inferences with enhanced success rates. Along with the formalization and evaluation of the approach, main advantages will be discussed, and a perspective for its future evolution is provided. In addition, this paper provides a framework to evaluate statistical user models and to enable performance comparison among different statistical user models.", "paper_title": "Statistical user model supported by R-Tree structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000324107400007"}
