Previously a data compression scheme for neural activity was introduced based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). In this paper we propose a dynamic learning rule for improved training of the SOM on signals with sparse events which allows for more representative prototype vectors to be found, and consequently better signal reconstruction. This work was developed with BMI applications in mind and therefore our examples are geared towards this type of signals. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms conventional vector quantization methods for spike reconstruction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
