In the Wavelet Transform technique the coefficients below a certain threshold are removed. We propose a new type of global threshold to improve the wavelet compression technique. The aim is to maintain the retained energy and to increase the compression ratio with respect to other global thresholds commonly used. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
