We show that our technique is statistically consistent under standard stochastic assumptions, that is, it returns the correct tree given sufficiently many unlinked loci. We also show that it can tolerate moderate estimation errors.", "paper_title": "Incomplete Lineage Sorting: Consistent Phylogeny Estimation from Multiple Loci", "paper_id": "WOS:000274063600015"}
