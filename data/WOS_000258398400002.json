For such a system, we show that a control of the ground state entanglement can be achieved by acting on the impurity field. To demonstrate this possibility, we evaluate exactly the nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor concurrence in the presence of the impurity. It turns out that either an enhancement or a quenching of entanglement between selected spin pairs can be obtained by acting on the intensity of the impurity. For specific values of the magnetic field a spatial modulation of concurrence along the chain is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Entanglement modulation in a spin chain by a local impurity", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400002"}
