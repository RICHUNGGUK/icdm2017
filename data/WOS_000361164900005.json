However, it is known that the LASSO selects too many noisy variables. In this paper, we propose a new estimator, the moderately clipped LASSO (MCL), that deletes noisy variables successively without sacrificing prediction accuracy much. Various numerical studies are done to illustrate superiority of the MCL over other competitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
