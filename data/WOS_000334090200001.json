We study in this context the L-BFGS-B method, or the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with boundaries, which is a sophisticated yet efficient optimization method widely used in computer graphics as well as general scientific computation. By analyzing and resolving the inherent dependencies of some of its search steps, we propose an efficient GPO-based parallel implementation of L-BFGS-B on the GPO. We justify our design decisions and demonstrate significant speed-up by our parallel implementation in solving the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) problem as well as some typical computing problems.
