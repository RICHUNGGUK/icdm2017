However, it was soon appreciated that repeated chronic stimulations necessary for lasting rehabilitation could have its drawbacks. Namely, the eventual degradation of tissue and electrodes, issues of biocompatibility and immune responses to foreign objects. However, new innovative methods are emerging which can improve the quality and duration of neural stimulations. Here, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) using solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a novel delivery system can prove to be a viable alternative to electrode based stimulations for exploring network dynamics or when used in therapeutic rehabilitation.
