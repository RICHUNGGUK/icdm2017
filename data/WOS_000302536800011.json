The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model approach is adapted in this study with the consideration of the sprung and the unsprung mass variation, the actuator delay and fault, and other suspension performances. By the utilization of the parallel-distributed compensation scheme, a reliable fuzzy H-infinity performance analysis criterion is derived for the proposed T-S fuzzy model. Then, a reliable fuzzy H-infinity controller is designed such that the resulting T-S fuzzy system is reliable in the sense that it is asymptotically stable and has the prescribed H-infinity performance under given constraints. The existence condition of the reliable fuzzy H-infinity controller is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) Finally, a quarter-vehicle suspension model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Reliable Fuzzy Control for Active Suspension Systems With Actuator Delay and Fault", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800011"}
