It is demonstrated that the various common analytical equations for calculating the bearing component of pull-out resistance give a wide range of calculated values, up to about 200% disparity. The disparity will increase further if the issue of whether to use the peak or critical state friction angle is brought in. Furthermore, these equations suggest that the bearing resistance factor, N-q, is only a function of soil friction angle which is not consistent with some design guidelines. In this investigation, a series of large scale laboratory pull-out tests under different test pressures were conducted. The test results unambiguously confirmed that the Nq factor is a function of test pressure. A modified equation for calculating N-q is also proposed. To have more in-depth understanding of the pull-out behaviour, the tests were modelled numerically. The input parameters for the numerical analysis were obtained from laboratory triaxial tests. The analysis results were compared with the experimental results. Good agreement between experimental and numerical results was achieved if the strain-softening behaviour from peak strength to critical state condition was captured by the soil model used.
