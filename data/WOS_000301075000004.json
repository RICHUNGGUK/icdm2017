The research was on integrating an electrode cell with both electrochemical and bioluminescent detection using a single VLSI chip. The authors have investigated the signal conditioning system that can work with any kind of amperometric and bioluminescent sensor. During this research the authors focused on the analog front-end unit. The work includes investigating the electronic model for simulation for an electrochemical cell and conceiving a fully integrated 8X8 electrochemical sensor array. The authors are focusing on signal conditioning system and its functionality. The main concern for the authors was to maintain the complexity and the number of electronic devices as low as possible.", "paper_title": "Universal Signal Conditioning System for Amperometric Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000301075000004"}
