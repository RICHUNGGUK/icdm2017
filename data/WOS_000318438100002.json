By the artificial compressibility method, momentum and continuity equations are coupled. Considering Reynolds averaged NavierStokes equations, the SpalartAllmaras turbulence model, which has accurate results in two-dimensional problems, is used to calculate Reynolds stresses. For convective fluxes a Roe-like scheme is proposed for the steady Reynolds averaged NavierStokes equations. Also, Jameson averaging method was implemented. In comparison, the proposed characteristics-based upwind incompressible turbulent Roe-like scheme, demonstrated very accurate results, high stability, and fast convergence. The fifth-order RungeKutta scheme is used for time discretization. The local time stepping and implicit residual smoothing were applied as the convergence acceleration techniques. Suitable boundary conditions have been implemented considering flow behavior. The problem has been studied at high Reynolds numbers for cross flow around the horizontal circular cylinder and NACA0012 hydrofoil. Results were compared with those of others and a good agreement has been observed.
