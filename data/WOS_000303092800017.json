However, the random walks defined on elliptic curve points equivalence class {P) used by Pollard rho will always get trapped in fruitless cycles. We propose an efficient alternative approach to resolve fruitless cycles. Besides the theoretical analysis, we also examine the performance of the new algorithm in experiments with elliptic curve groups. The experiment results show that we can achieve the speedup by a factor extremely close to root 2 using the new algorithm with the negation map, which is the best performance reported in the literature.
