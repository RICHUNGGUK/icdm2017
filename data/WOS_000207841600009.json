In this paper, we present a golf swing training system which incorporates wearable motion sensors to obtain inertial information and provide feedback on the quality of movements. The sensors are placed on a golf club and athlete's body at positions which capture the unique movements of a golf swing. We introduce a quantitative model which takes into consideration signal processing techniques on the collected data and quantifies the correctness of the performed actions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on data obtained from four subjects and discuss ongoing research.", "paper_title": "Wearable coach for sport training: A quantitative model to evaluate wrist-rotation in golf", "paper_id": "WOS:000207841600009"}
