Based on the symmetry, symplecticity. and exponentially fitted conditions, new explicit modified RKN integrators with FSAL property are obtained. The new integrators integrate exactly differential systems whose solutions can be expressed as linear combinations of functions from the set {exp(+/- i omega t)}, omega>0, i(2) = -1, or equivalently from the set {cos(omega t), sin(omega t)}. The phase properties of the new integrators are examined and their periodicity regions are obtained. Numerical experiments are accompanied to show the high efficiency and competence of the new SSEFRKN methods compared with some highly efficient nonsymmetric symplecti EFRKN methods in the literature.
