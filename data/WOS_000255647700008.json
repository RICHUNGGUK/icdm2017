This paper proposes a high speed design of Montgomery multiplier. Firstly, a modified scalable high-radix Montgomery algorithm is proposed to reduce critical path. Secondly, a high-radix clock-saving dataflow is proposed to support high-radix operation and one clock cycle delay in dataflow. Finally, a hardware-reused architecture is proposed to reduce the hardware cost and a parallel radix-16 design of data path is proposed to accelerate the speed. By using HHNEC 0.25 mu m standard cell library, the implementation results show that the total cost of Montgomery multiplier is 130 KGates, the clock frequency is 180 MHz and the throughput of 1024-bit RSA encryption is 352 kbps. This design is suitable to be used in high speed RSA or ECC encryption/decryption. As a scalable design, it supports any key-length encryption/decryption up to the size of OD-chip memory.", "paper_title": "A high-speed design of Montgomery multiplier", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700008"}
