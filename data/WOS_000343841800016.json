Such a monolithic notion is, in our opinion, too limitative. In this paper, we advocate the use of the neighborhood of a node beyond one hop to help design more efficient communication solutions. We provide a formal definition of kappa-vicinity and associated measures, namely kappa-contact and kappa-intercontact. These measures allow better understanding the proximity between nodes as they are not restrained solely to the direct contact situation. We observe unexpected behaviors in kappa-contact distributions and point out their dependency on node density. We also observe that a significant share of pairs of nodes spend a non-negligible amount of time in each other's vicinity without coming into direct contact We show then that using a small kappa (between 2 and 4) is enough to capture a significant amount of communication possibilities that are neglected by existing approaches. Finally, we provide a rule of thumb to derive the population in the kappa-vicinity by observing only the direct contacts of a node. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
