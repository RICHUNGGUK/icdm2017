This algorithm can be used to deal with various linear inverse problems (LIPs), including image deconvolution and reconstruction. This algorithm is a new version of the famous two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) algorithm. First, we use the split Bregman Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, based on a sparse dictionary, to decompose the image into cartoon and texture parts, which are represented by wavelet and contourlet, respectively. Second, we use an adaptive method to estimate the regularization parameter and the shrinkage threshold. Finally, we use a linear search method to find a step length and a fast method to accelerate convergence. Results show that our method can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio improvement (ISNR) for image restoration and high convergence speed.", "paper_title": "Adaptive contourlet-wavelet iterative shrinkage/thresholding for remote sensing image restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000340525500006"}
