New tools are necessary to model and analyze the highly complex N cycles emerging from human-mediated ecosystems. We developed a new software. NCNA, to provide three functions: a) rigorous reconstruction of quasi-empirical models (QEMs), b) computer-aided interface for data collection and automatic sensitivity analysis, and c) automatic generation, visualization and network environ analysis (NEA) of N cycling networks.
