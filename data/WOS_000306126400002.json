Given a target image of a fluid scene, an alpha matte is required to extract the fluid region. Our method needs to adjust a user-specified video example for producing the fluid motion suitable for the extracted fluid region. Employing the fluid video database, the flow field of the target image is obtained by warping the optical flow of a video frame that has a visually similar scene to the target image according to their scene correspondences, which assigns fluid orientation and speed automatically. Results show that our method is successful in preserving large fluid features in the synthesized animations. In comparison to existing approaches, it is both possible and useful to utilize our method to create flow animations with higher quality.", "paper_title": "Preserving global features of fluid animation from a single image using video examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000306126400002"}
