The volume displacement of the rib cage is related to changes in its circumference using an empirical equation presented by Agostoni et al. (1965, J Appl Physiol, 20: 1179-1186). A systematic study is carried out to quantify the role of costal cartilage, sternocostal joint calcification and muscle weakness on the volume displacement of the rib cage. The results provide insight into some of the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the respiratory system.", "paper_title": "Computational model of rib movement and its application in studying the effects of age-related thoracic cage calcification on respiratory system", "paper_id": "WOS:000276628100010"}
