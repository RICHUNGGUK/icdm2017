This paper develops a substructuring method for computing the first, second and high order eigensensitivity. The local area of a structure is treated as an independent substructure to be analyzed. The eigensensitivity of global structure with respect to a design parameter is calculated from the eigensensitivity of a particular substructure that contains the design parameter, thus allowing a significant reduction in computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the substructuring method is proved by a frame structure and a highway bridge. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
