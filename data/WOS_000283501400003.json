The buffer amplifier is composed of a pair of push-pull output transistors with two feedback loops consisting of a pair of complementary error amplifiers and a pair of complementary common-source amplifiers. The buffer draws little current while static but has a large driving capability while transient. A mutual bias scheme is also proposed to reduce the power consumption and the die area for LCD applications. An experimental prototype buffer amplifier implemented in a 0.35 mu m CMOS technology demonstrates that the settling time is 1.5 mu s for a voltage swing of 0.1 similar to (VDD-0.1) V under a 600 pF capacitance load. Quiescent current of 4 mu A is measured. The area of this buffer is 32 x 109 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A COMPACT HIGH-SPEED LOW-POWER RAIL-TO-RAIL BUFFER AMPLIFIER FOR STEP-PULSE SIGNALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400003"}
