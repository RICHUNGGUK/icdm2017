In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian regression method via non-linear dimensionality reduction. The method incorporates prior information on the underlying structure of original input features to preserve input-output patterns on reduced features, and to provide distributions of predicted values. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted simulations on benchmark and real-world data. Results showed that the method not only better predicts a distribution of forecast estimates compared with other methods, but also more robust and consistent performance on prediction.
