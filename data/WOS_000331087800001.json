This paper specifically addresses the use of spatio-temporal relations for detecting spatio-temporally relevant contexts to the user. The main contribution of this work is that the proposed model is sensitive to the velocity and direction of the user and applies customized Multi Interval Algebra (MIA) with Voronoi Continuous Range Query (VCRQ) to introduce spatio-temporally relevant contexts according to their arrangement in space. In this implementation the Spatio-Temporal Relevancy Model for Context-Aware Systems (STRMCAS) helps the tourist to find his/her preferred areas that are spatio-temporally relevant. The experimental results in a scenario of tourist navigation are evaluated with respect to the accuracy of the model, performance time and satisfaction of users in 30 iterations of the algorithm. The evaluation process demonstrated the efficiency of the model in real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Modelling spatio-temporal relevancy in urban context-aware pervasive systems using voronoi continuous range query and multi-interval algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000331087800001"}
