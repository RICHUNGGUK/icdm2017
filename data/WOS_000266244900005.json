In this article, based on a data augmentation scheme using the Gibbs sampler, we propose a Bayesian procedure to estimate the multidimensional three-parameter logistic model. With the introduction of the two latent variables, the full conditional distributions are tractable, and consequently the Gibbs sampling is easy to implement. Finally, the technique is illustrated by using simulated and real data, respectively.", "paper_title": "Bayesian estimation in the multidimensional three-parameter logistic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000266244900005"}
