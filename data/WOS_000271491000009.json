In this paper, we provide a formal decision software tool to extract the dominant features enabling tool wear prediction. This decision tool is based on a formal mathematical approach that selects dominant features using the singular value decomposition of real-time measurements from the sensors of an industrial cutting tool. Selection of dominant features is important, as retaining only essential features allows reduced signal processing or even reduction in the number of required sensors, which cuts costs. It is shown that the proposed method of dominant feature selection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the least-squares estimation error. The identified dominant features are used with the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to identify parameters in forecasting the time series of cutting tool wear. Experimental results on an industrial high-speed milling machine show the effectiveness in predicting the tool wear using only the dominant features.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Tool Wear Using Dominant Feature Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000271491000009"}
