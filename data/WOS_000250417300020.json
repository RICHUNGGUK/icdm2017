Vialette, On the computational complexity of 2-interval pattern matching, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 312 (2-3) (2004) 223-249] for establishing a general representation for macroscopic describers of RNA secondary structures. In this context, we have a 2-interval for each legal local fold in a given RNA sequence, and a constrained pattern made of disjoint 2-intervals represents a putative RNA secondary structure. We focus here on the problem of extracting a constrained pattern in a set of 2-intervals. More precisely, given a set of 2-intervals D and a model R describing if two disjoint 2-intervals in a solution can be in precedence order (<), be allowed to nest ((sic)) and/or be allowed to cross ((sic)), we consider the problem of finding a maximum cardinality subset D' subset of D of disjoint 2-intervals such that any two 2-intervals in D' agree with R. The different combinations of restrictions on model R alter the computational complexity of the problem, and need to be examined separately. In this paper, we improve the time complexity of [S. Vialette, On the computational complexity of 2-interval pattern matching, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 312 (2-3) (2004) 223-249] for model R = {(sic)} by giving an optimal O(n log n) time algorithm, where n is the cardinality of the 2-interval set D. We also give a graph-like relaxation for model R = {(sic), (sic)} that is solvable in O(n(2) root n) time. Finally, we prove that the considered problem is NP-complete for model R = {<, } even for same-length intervals, and give a fixed-parameter tractability result based on the crossing structure of D.
