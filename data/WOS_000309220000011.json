DPP&PP makes use of a new proposed pollution symbol selection and pollution (PSSP) scheme based on a new obfuscation idea to pollute existing symbols. Analyses of DPP&PP show that it not only requires low overhead on computation and communication, but also provides high security on resisting brute-force attacks.", "paper_title": "A Secure Network Coding-based Data Gathering Model and Its Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000011"}
