The proposed technology overcomes the defects of the general CSD method by reducing system power and area substantially without additional logic. The theoretical basis and a design method are explained in detail in this paper. Our design technology was used to optimize a radio-frequency module. FPGA test results show that logic utilization is reduced by 25%, the total number of registers used is reduced by 23.02%, and the total block memory bits utilization is reduced by 20%. These results show that the proposed low-power design is an effective method.", "paper_title": "Low-power design and application based on CSD optimization for a fixed coefficient multiplier", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709100019"}
