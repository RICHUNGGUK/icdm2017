Our procedure exploits the network structure of the problem and includes strategies that produce a computationally efficient and agile search. Among several mechanisms, our search includes path relinking as the basis for combining solutions to generate new ones. The profile minimization problem (PMP) is NP-Hard and has relevant applications in numerical analysis techniques that rely on manipulating large sparse matrices. The problem was proposed in the early 1970s but the state-of-the-art does not include a method that could be considered powerful by today's computing standards. Extensive computational experiments show that we have accomplished our goal of pushing the envelope and establishing a new standard in the solution of the PMP. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
