In particular, we employ them to formalize the control theory of the supervisor. By separating the reasoning in the supervisor and the action implementation in the controller, the overall system architecture becomes modular, and therefore easily changeable and modifiable.", "paper_title": "A logic-based approach to model supervisory control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800060"}
