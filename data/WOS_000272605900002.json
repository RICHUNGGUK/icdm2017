Failures can result from ambiguous sensor readings and environments with similar appearances. In this paper, we describe a robust place recognition algorithm that fuses a number of uncertain local matches into a high-confidence global match. We describe the theoretical basis of the approach and present extensive experimental results from a variety of sensor modalities and environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
