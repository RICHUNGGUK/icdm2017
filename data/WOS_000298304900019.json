Thus, the guidance has significant impact on the traffic control. However, detailed performance study of available guidances is missing. Most existing approaches do not show how they affect intra-domain traffic control in detail while mostly focusing on inter-domain traffic control. In this paper, we try to understand how the guidances affect the intra and inter-domain traffic control for better guidance improving the traffic control. Through simulations, we reveal the following. The performance-based guidance reflecting the networking status shows attractive results in distributing the traffic over intra-domain links and in reducing the cross-domain traffic and the charging volume of inter-domain link compared to the distance-based guidance enforcing simple localization. However, the performance-based guidance shows one limitation that can cause unstable traffic control. To overcome the identified limitation, we propose peer-assisted measurement and traffic estimation approach. Then, we verify our approach through simulations.", "paper_title": "Understanding of Network Operator-Friendly P2P Traffic Control Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900019"}
