Here, the required sampling rate and resolution of digital-to-analog/analog-to-digital (DA/AD) converter are only 5 GS/s and 8 bits to accomplish the 40 Gb/s OFDM downstream rate. Moreover, to reduce the power fading and fiber chromatic dispersion issues, a 0.7 chirp parameter Mach-Zehnder modulator is used for the four-band OFDM modulation scheme. Downstream negative power penalty of 0.37 dB can be obtained at the bit error rate of after 20 km standard single mode fiber transmission without dispersion compensation.", "paper_title": "Demonstration of using multi-band 16-QAM OFDM modulation with direct-detection in 10 GHz bandwidth for 37.3-Gb/s PON", "paper_id": "WOS:000330384500004"}
