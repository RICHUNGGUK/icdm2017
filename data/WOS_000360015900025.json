It is interesting to note that many cyclic codes in the family are optimal and have only a few non-zero weights. Besides using similar ideas, we carry out some subtle manipulation of certain exponential sums.", "paper_title": "Optimal Cyclic Codes With Generalized Niho-Type Zeros and the Weight Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900025"}
