Using this framework, we provide an alternative derivation for the closed-form expression of the asymptotic performance loss of MDPSK w.r.t. MPSK in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The same performance loss is also shown to be true for the lognormal fading channels.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic SER Performance Comparison of MPSK and MDPSK in Wireless Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600005"}
