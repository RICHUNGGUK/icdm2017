In order to provide IC industry a well-integrated design environment, this research proposes an integrated information platform which combines the project management (PM) module, the design knowledge (e.g., SIP) management module and the collaborative working environment for the IC industry. With the project management module, the R&D team leaders can better monitor, coordinate and control design tasks among partners and their schedules to shorten the time to market. Moreover, a,knowledge exchange environment, supported by the design knowledge management module, enriches the design chain productivity and efficiency. Finally, the integration of collaborative working space is the propeller to enable collaborative design. With the unique platform that integrates collaborative project and SIP knowledge management, IC companies gain competitive advantages when working as a virtual design team. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
