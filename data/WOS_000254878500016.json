The main problem with discovering such type of relevant biological information is 'selection'. The ability to distinguish between a true correlation (e.g. between different types of biological processes) and random chance that this correlation is statistically significant is crucial for any bio-medical research, literature mining being no exception. This problem is especially visible when searching for information which has not been studied and described in many publications. Therefore, a novel bio-linguistic statistical method is required, capable of selecting true correlations, even when they are low-frequency associations. In this article, we present such statistical approach based on Z-score and implemented in a web-based application 'e-LiSe'.", "paper_title": "e-LiSe - an online tool for finding needles in the '(Medline) haystack'", "paper_id": "WOS:000254878500016"}
