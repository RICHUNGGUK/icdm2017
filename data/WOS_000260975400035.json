Our labeling strategy lowers the upper bound on the bandwidth of the continuous Hamming graph, [0, 1](3), from .5 to .4497. A lower bound of .4439 on bw ([0, 1](3)) follows from known isoperimetric inequalities and a related dynamic program is conjectured to raise that lower bound to 4/9 = .4444.... In particular, showing the power of our method, we prove that the bandwidth of K-6 x K-6 x K-6 is exactly 101. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
