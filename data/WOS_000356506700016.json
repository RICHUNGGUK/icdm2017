To handle the effect of nonsmooth asymmetric saturation nonlinearity, a Gaussian error function-based continuous differentiable asymmetric saturation model is employed such that the backstepping technique can be used in the control design. The explosion of complexity in traditional backstepping design is avoided using dynamic surface control. Using radial basis function NN, adaptive control is developed to guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of origin by appropriately choosing design constants. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated in the simulation study.", "paper_title": "Adaptive NN Control of a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Asymmetric Saturation Actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700016"}
