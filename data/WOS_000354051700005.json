It is important that these benchmarks reflect modern large-scale systems that make use of heterogeneous resources; however, most current FPGA benchmarks are both small and simple. In this artile, we present Titan, a hybrid CAD flow that addresses these issues. The flow uses Altera's Quartus II FPGA CAD software to perform HDL synthesis and a conversion tool to translate the result into the academic Berkeley Logic Interchange Format (BLIF). Using this flow, we created the Titan23 benchmark set, which consists of 23 large (90K-1.8M block) benchmark circuits covering a wide range of application domains. Using the Titan23 benchmarks and an enhanced model of Altera's Stratix IV architecture, including a detailed timing model, we compare the performance and quality of VPR and Quartus II targeting the same architecture. We found that VPR is at least 2.8xslower, uses 6.2x more memory, 2.2x more wire, and produces critical paths 1.5x slower compared to Quartus II. Finally, we identified that VPR's focus on achieving a dense packing and an inability to take apart clusters is responsible for a large portion of the wire length and critical path delay gap.", "paper_title": "Timing-Driven Titan: Enabling Large Benchmarks and Exploring the Gap between Academic and Commercial CAD", "paper_id": "WOS:000354051700005"}
