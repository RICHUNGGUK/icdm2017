The input buffer of each access node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, and the service time distribution of each individual head-of-line packet is derived from the Markov chain of the underlying scheduling algorithm. From the queueing model, we derive the characteristic equation of network throughput and obtain the stable throughput and bounded delay regions with respect to the retransmission factor. Our results show that the stable throughput region of the exponential backoff scheme exists even for an infinite population. Moreover, we find that the bounded delay region of exponential backoff is only a sub-set of its stable throughput region due to the large variance of the service time of input packets caused by the capture effect. All analytical results presented in this paper are verified by simulations.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of Markov modulated 1-persistent CSMA/CA protocols with exponential backoff scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683600003"}
