In this paper, we investigate the use of clustering techniques to identify interesting traffic patterns from network traffic data in an efficient manner. We develop a framework to deal with mixed type attributes including numerical, categorical, and hierarchical attributes for a one-pass hierarchical clustering algorithm. We demonstrate the improved accuracy and efficiency of our approach in comparison to previous work on clustering network traffic.", "paper_title": "An efficient clustering scheme to exploit hierarchical data in network traffic analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000254976900003"}
