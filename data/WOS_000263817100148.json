Five datasets are simulated with entropy measurement using the method of SUD. Self-Organizing map (SOM) is used to investigate the similarities among different segments. which proved to be a useful approach in cross-examining the COA structure, The obtained results show that they are promising from both computation and accounting perspectives.
