The Minimum CDS problem has been studied extensively in mutihop wireless networks with uniform communication ranges. However, in practice, the nodes may have different communication ranges either because of the heterogeneity of the nodes, or due to interference mitigation, or due to a chosen range assignment for energy conservation. In this paper, we present a greedy approximation algorithm for computing a Minimum CDS in multihop wireless networks with disparate communications ranges and prove that its approximation ratio is better than the best one known in the literature. Our analysis utilizes a tighter relation between the independence number and the connected domination number.", "paper_title": "Minimum CDS in Multihop Wireless Networks with Disparate Communication Ranges", "paper_id": "WOS:000319407200008"}
