The aim of FACETS is to provide decision makers cognitive decision support in ill-structured decision situations. The design and development of FACETS includes novel concepts, models, algorithms and system architecture, such as ontology and experience representation, situation awareness parsing, data warehouse query construction and guided situation presentation. The experiments showed that FACETS is able to play a significant role in supporting ill-structured decision making through developing and enriching situation awareness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
