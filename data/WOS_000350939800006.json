This notion is a refinement of the usual abelian equivalence. A 2-binomial square is a word uv where u and v are 2-binomially equivalent. In this paper, considering pure morphic words, we prove that 2-binomial squares (resp. cubes) are avoidable over a 3-letter (resp. 2-letter) alphabet. The sizes of the alphabets are optimal.
