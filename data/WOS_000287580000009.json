The existing and decentralized load balance algorithms designed for the heterogeneous, structured P2P networks either explicitly construct auxiliary networks to manipulate global information or implicitly demand the P2P substrates organized in a hierarchical fashion. Without relying on any auxiliary networks and independent of the geometry of the P2P substrates, we present, in this paper, a novel load balancing algorithm that is unique in that each participating peer is based on the partial knowledge of the system to estimate the probability distributions of the capacities of peers and the loads of virtual servers, resulting in imperfect knowledge of the system state. With the imperfect system state, peers can compute their expected loads and reallocate their loads in parallel. Through extensive simulations, we compare our proposal to prior load balancing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Load Balance with Imperfect Information in Structured Peer-to-Peer Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287580000009"}
