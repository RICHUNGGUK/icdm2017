More precisely, we propose a system where each neuron of [8] (some which make use of extended rules) is replaced by a sub-system without modifying the global output. Hence, we can claim that the study of the neuronal dreaming process is more \"realistic\" in our setting.", "paper_title": "Dreams and spiking neural P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277059200007"}
