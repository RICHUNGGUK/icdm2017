However, clustering remains a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature: it is well known that off-the-shelf clustering methods may discover different patterns in a given set of data, mainly because every clustering algorithm has its own bias resulting from the optimization of different criteria. This bias becomes even more important as in almost all real-world applications, data is inherently high-dimensional and multiple clustering solutions might be available for the same data collection. In this respect, the problems of projective clustering and clustering ensembles have been recently defined to deal with the high dimensionality and multiple clusterings issues, respectively. Nevertheless, despite such two issues can often be encountered together, existing approaches to the two problems have been developed independently of each other. In our earlier work Gullo et al. (Proceedings of the international conference on data mining (ICDM), 2009a) we introduced a novel clustering problem, called projective clustering ensembles (PCE): given a set (ensemble) of projective clustering solutions, the goal is to derive a projective consensus clustering, i.e., a projective clustering that complies with the information on object-to-cluster and the feature-to-cluster assignments given in the ensemble. In this paper, we enhance our previous study and provide theoretical and experimental insights into the PCE problem. PCE is formalized as an optimization problem and is designed to satisfy desirable requirements on independence from the specific clustering ensemble algorithm, ability to handle hard as well as soft data clustering, and different feature weightings. Two PCE formulations are defined: a two-objective optimization problem, in which the two objective functions respectively account for the object- and feature-based representations of the solutions in the ensemble, and a single-objective optimization problem, in which the object- and feature-based representations are embedded into a single function to measure the distance error between the projective consensus clustering and the projective ensemble. The significance of the proposed methods for solving the PCE problem has been shown through an extensive experimental evaluation based on several datasets and comparatively with projective clustering and clustering ensemble baselines.", "paper_title": "Projective clustering ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000313963000002"}
