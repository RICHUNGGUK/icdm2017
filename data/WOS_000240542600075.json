To model various contexts, we design Ontology which supports to share context knowledge, detect and resolve inconsistency of the knowledge. In addition, we classify context-aware services into three layers - Session, Task, Subtask - to make sure definition of service conflict problems and to solve the problems easily. With our context model and the classification of service conflicts, our system supports autonomic tasks including recognizing and learning user's formal/informal activity pattern, and resolving conflicts between services in different situations of users invisibly.", "paper_title": "A context-aware multi-agent service system for assistive home applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600075"}
