To reduce these losses and minimize control costs, new methods to detect pests and/or pest damage must be investigated in order to optimize control measures. One such method evaluated in this study was to detect the chemicals released by pests or pest-damaged products. A portable device was developed to draw volatiles from pests or pest-damaged products over carbon black-polymer composite sensors and measure the change in resistance for each sensor. The device successfully sampled pest and plant volatiles and these volatiles were detected using carbon black-polymer composite sensors. These results indicated an electronic nose is a feasible approach to detect pests and/or pest damage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
