To this end, sample images with noise and with RST distortion are employed in the evolutionary optimization of the TT, which is termed evolutionary TT with noise (ETTN). Experimental studies on a fish image database and the Columbia COIL-20 image database show that the ETTN optimized on a few low-resolution images from the fish database can extract robust and RST invariant features from the standard images in the fish database as well as in the COIL-20 database. These results demonstrate that the proposed ETTN is very promising in that it is computationally efficient, invariant to RST deformation, robust to noise, and generalizable.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Multiobjective Image Feature Extraction in the Presence of Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000360019000005"}
