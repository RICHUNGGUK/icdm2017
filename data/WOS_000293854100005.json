This formulation allows to extend numerous results on phase transition for sciences other than physics of magnetism. We apply it to the problem of norm breaking. Two strategies: to cooperate or to defect, form an analogy to two spin orientations. An example is a crowd at an exit, where to defect means to push others, and to cooperate is to move slowly together.", "paper_title": "NORM BREAKING IN CROWD - ATHERMAL PHASE TRANSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000293854100005"}
