We establish the Newton-Kantorovich-type convergence theorem for the method by using majorizing functions. We obtain an existence-uniqueness theorem and an error estimate. In comparison with the results obtained in Chen et al., we can provide a larger convergence radius. Finally, some numerical applications is presented to demonstrate our approach.", "paper_title": "Semilocal convergence theorem by using majorizing functions for Harmonic mean Newton's method in Banach spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603000004"}
