The proposed model and hypotheses were partially supported in Taiwan's and Thailand's data. Information quality affected both user satisfaction and attitude toward the web site and was the dimension common across both countries. Ashop moderated the effects of system quality on user satisfaction in Taiwan, but moderated information quality in the Thailand. National identity moderated the effect of system quality on both user satisfaction and attitude toward the site in the Thai data. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
