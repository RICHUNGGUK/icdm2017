The demand for a more systematic and efficient planning has become increasingly more important, one of the keys to achieving a high standard in healthcare. In this paper, a Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) is used to study the healthcare facilities of one of the districts in Malaysia. We address the limited capacity of the facilities and the problem is formulated as Capacitated MCLP (CMCLP). We propose a new solution approach based on genetic algorithm to examine the percentage of coverage of the existing facilities within the allowable distance specified/targeted by Malaysian government. The algorithm was shown to generate good results when compared to results obtained using CPLEX version 12.2 on a medium size problem consisting of 179 nodes network. The algorithm was extended to solve larger network consisting of 809 nodes where CPLEX failed to produce non-trivial solutions. We show that the proposed solution approach produces significant results in determining good locations for the facility such that the population coverage is maximized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
