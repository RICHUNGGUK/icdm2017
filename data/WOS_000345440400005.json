Our discussion provides economic interpretations of different concepts of the theory of fuzzy measures. In particular, we analyze the meaning of extensions of capacities based on n-dimensional copulas. The latter describes stochastic dependence for random vectors of interest in the problem. We also trace the connections between the case of {0, 1}-valued capacities and the analysis of \"coherent\" reliability systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
