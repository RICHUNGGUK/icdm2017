The result is obtained through a syntactic translation, without using any cut-elimination procedure. Additionally, we show Skolem theorem and inversion/focusing results. Thanks to the expressiveness of deduction modulo, all these results also apply to the cases of higher-order resolution, Peano's arithmetic and Gentzen's LK.", "paper_title": "Resolution is Cut-Free", "paper_id": "WOS:000274435600003"}
