The uniform stability (uniformly asymptotic stability and quasi-exponential stability) criteria are established for linear discrete impulsive system and a class of nonlinear discrete impulsive systems, respectively. These stability criteria are expressed in terms of fairly simple algebraic conditions so that they are easy to be tested. Moreover, by using the stability criteria, a discrete impulsive synchronization scheme is designed to synchronize two discrete chaotic systems. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate results obtained by us.", "paper_title": "Uniform stability of discrete impulsive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253193400008"}
