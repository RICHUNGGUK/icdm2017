Supported by empirical data collected from a Flash memory device, we propose a class of codes that exploits the asymmetric nature of the error patterns in a Flash device using tensor product operations. We call these codes graded bit-error-correcting codes. As demonstrated on the data collected from a Flash chip, these codes significantly delay the onset of errors and therefore have the potential to prolong the lifetime of the memory device.", "paper_title": "Graded Bit-Error-Correcting Codes With Applications to Flash Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900024"}
