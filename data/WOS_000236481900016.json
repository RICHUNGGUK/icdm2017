The original version is played on a row of pins (\"kayles\"). We investigate variants of the game played on graphs. We solve a previously stated open problem in proving that determining the value of a game position needs only polynomial time in a star of bounded degree, and therefore finding the winning move - if one exists - can be done in linear time based on the data calculated before.", "paper_title": "Kayles on the way to the stars", "paper_id": "WOS:000236481900016"}
