Currently, there are no methods to measure and quantify in vivo airway compliance in humans. In order to develop a method, we generated a curve-fitting algorithm that combines airway diameter measurements by high resolution computed tomography with pressure-volume curves obtained by the esophageal balloon technique. Our method allows the description of diameter-pressure curves for airways of varying size, presented as a 3D surface, from which specific airway compliance can be determined at any transpulmonary pressure. Applying this method to data from two healthy subjects, we found that small airways are more compliant than large airways and specific airway compliance was greatest at low transpulmonary pressures. In conclusion, our 3D surface is a useful tool to measure and quantify in vivo specific airway compliance in humans.", "paper_title": "A method to determine in vivo, specific airway compliance, in humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000276771800010"}
