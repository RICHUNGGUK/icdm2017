This paper extends the debate on the limited diversity in the research methods of MIS researchers to include the global research community. The argument of methodological exclusiveness on a global scale is argued to be the result of educational influence on faculty in each region. Leading universities throughout three major regions of the world were evaluated to show the educational influence of faculty causing the expansion of methodological exclusion on a global scale. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing the issues discussed to further facilitate collaboration among researchers internationally.
