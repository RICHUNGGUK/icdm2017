Given the minor subspace of the covariance matrix of the data measured at a uniform linear array of sensors, the proposed methods provide estimates of the Directions-of-Arrival (DOA) distribution of multiple narrowband signals, i.e., the number of DOA in an arbitrarily specified range, without using any numerical search for each direction of arrival. The proposed methods can serve as powerful mathematical tools to extract global information in the high-resolution DOA estimation problems.", "paper_title": "High-resolution estimation of the directions-of-arrival distribution by algebraic phase unwrapping algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000286665800012"}
