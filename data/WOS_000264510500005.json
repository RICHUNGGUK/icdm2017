In the present study, an energy management system for a hybrid electric vehicle is developed. Because the plant under consideration is nonlinear, multi-domain, time-varying, has multiple uncertainties and, in addition, the designed control strategy must be able to obey the driver's commands and achieve the par-internship for a new generation of vehicle regulations, the fuzzy logic approach is chosen. A feed-forward hybrid vehicle simulation model is used to demonstrate the validity and the convenience of the current approach and its results have been compared with the other parallel hybrid electric vehicle control strategies. Simulation results show considerable improvement in the efficiency of the internal combustion engine and, consequently, fuel consumption and acceleration performances.", "paper_title": "Feed-forward modelling and fuzzy logic based control strategy for powertrain efficiency improvement in a parallel hybrid electric vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000264510500005"}
