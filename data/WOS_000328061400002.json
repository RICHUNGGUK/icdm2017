The effects of CMN spikes on motoneuronal excitability are traditionally characterized by visualizing postspike effects (PSEs) in spike-triggered averages (SpTA; Fetz, Cheney, & German, 1976; Fetz & Cheney, 1980; McKiernan, Marcario, Karrer, & Cheney, 1998) of electromyography (EMG) data. Poliakov and Schieber (1998) suggested a formal test, the multiple-fragment analysis (MFA), to automatically detect PSEs. However, MFA's performance was not statistically validated, and it is unclear under what conditions it is valid. This paper's contributions are a power study that validates the MFA; an alternative test, the single-snippet analysis (SSA), which has the same functionality as MFA but is easier to calculate and has better power in small samples; a simple bootstrap simulation to estimate SpTA baselines with simulation bands that help visualize potential PSEs; and a bootstrap adjustment to the MFA and SSA to correct for nonlinear SpTA baselines.", "paper_title": "Single-Snippet Analysis for Detection of Postspike Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000328061400002"}
