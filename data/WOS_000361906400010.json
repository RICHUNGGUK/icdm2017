The fuzzy model can also supplement rainfall data when the station is nearby. The accuracy of rainfall data in the EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources) decision support tool is affected by the sparse meteorological data contained in BASINS. This study also assessed the improvement in stream flow prediction with the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model contained within BASINS, using the hourly precipitation estimates for the Feitsui reservoir watershed. This study demonstrates that using a fuzzy model to supplement rainfall data has the potential to improve stream flow predictions, thus aiding water quality assessment in the nonpoint water quality assessment decision tool.
