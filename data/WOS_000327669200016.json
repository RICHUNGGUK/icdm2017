It consists of a 384 x 288 pixel array and column-level A/D conversion circuits. The proposed system has high resolution because of the odd-even Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) structure, containing correlated switches design, multi-Vth amplifier design and high speed high resolution comparator design including latch-stage. Designed and simulated in 0.35-mu m CMOS process, this high performance ROIC achieves 81.24 dB SNR at 8.64 KS/s consuming 98 mW under 5V voltage supply, resulting in an ENOB of 13.2-bit.", "paper_title": "A LOW POWER HIGH RESOLUTION ROIC DESIGN WITH 14-BIT COLUMN-LEVEL ADC FOR 384 x 288 IRFPA", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200016"}
