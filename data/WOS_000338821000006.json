Drawing on the information processing view of the firm, this study attempts to address this gap by examining the process of operational agility development. A process model of developing information processing capability for operational agility is proposed. As the model suggests, operational agility is achieved through a two-step process - the construction of IT-enabled information processing network and the implementation of organizational control - to enhance the right information processing capability. We further identify three types of information processing capability - information sensitivity, information synergy and information fluidity - that enable operational agility. Furthermore, a five-step practical guide for developing information processing capability for operational agility is provided for practitioners. This is achieved by conducting a case study of Haier, one of the largest household appliance manufacturers in China. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential contributions and directions for future research.", "paper_title": "Developing information processing capability for operational agility: implications from a Chinese manufacturer", "paper_id": "WOS:000338821000006"}
