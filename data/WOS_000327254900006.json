Approximate and theoretical expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are derived. Numerical results show that optimizing the receiver can provide a significant capacity improvement of up to 2.2bits/s/GHz and a bit error rate performance gain of up to 2dB in effective signal-to-noise ratio.
