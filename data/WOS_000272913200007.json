We show that this problem belongs to NP-complete class. We define a subset of sensors meeting QoS requirements as a coverage pattern, and if the full set of coverage patterns is given, we can mathematically formulate the problem. Directly solving this formulation however is difficult since number of coverage patterns may be exponential to number of sensors and targets. Hence, it column generation (CG)-based approach is proposed to decompose the original formulation into two subproblems and solve them iteratively. Here a column corresponds to a feasible coverage pattern, and the idea is to find a column with steepest ascent in lifetime, based oil which we iteratively search for the maximum lifetime solution. An initial feasible set of patterns is generated through a novel random selection algorithm (RSA), in order to launch our approach. Experimental data demonstrate that the proposed CG-based approach is an efficient solution, even in a harsh environment. Simulation results also reveal the impact of different network parameters on network lifetime, giving certain guidance on designing and maintaining such surveillance sensor networks.
