Further reduction of the acknowledgment frequency can be motivated in the same way. However, reducing the dependency on frequent acknowledgments in TCP is difficult because acknowledgments support reliable delivery; loss recovery; clock out new segments, and serve as input when determining an appropriate sending rate. Our results show that in scenarios where there are no obvious advantages of reducing the acknowledgment frequency, performance can be maintained although fewer acknowledgments are sent. Hence; there is a potential for reducing the acknowledgment frequency more than is done through delayed acknowledgments today. Advancements in TCP loss recovery is one of the key reasons that the dependence on frequent acknowledgments has decreased. We propose and evaluate an end-to-end solution, where four acknowledgments per send window are sent. The sender compensates for the reduced acknowledgment frequency using a form of Appropriate Byte Counting. The proposal also includes a modification of fast loss recovery to avoid frequent timeouts.", "paper_title": "Reducing the TCP acknowledgment frequency", "paper_id": "WOS:000248454600003"}
