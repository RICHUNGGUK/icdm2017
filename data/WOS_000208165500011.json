Accurate and fast diagnosis results make gene expression profiling produced from microarray widely used by a large range of researchers. Much research work highlights the importance of gene selection and gains good results. However, the minimum sets of genes derived from different methods are seldom overlapping and often inconsistent even for the same set of data, partially because of the complexity of cancer disease. In this paper, cancer classification was attempted in an alternative way of the whole gene expression profile for all samples instead of partial gene sets. Here, the three common sets of data were tested by NIPALS-KPLS method for acute leukemia, prostate cancer and lung cancer respectively. Compared to other conventional methods, the results showed wide improvement in classification accuracy. This paper indicates that sample profile of gene expression may be explored as a better indicator for cancer classification, which deserves further investigation.", "paper_title": "CANCER CLASSIFICATION FROM THE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES BY DISCRIMINANT KERNEL-PLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208165500011"}
