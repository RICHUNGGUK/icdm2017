Although authors provide a list of about five to ten keywords in scientific publications that are used to map them to respective domains, due to exponential growth of non-scientific documents either on the World Wide Web or in textual databases, an automatic mechanism is sought to identify keyphrases embedded within them. In this paper, we propose the design of a light-weight machine learning approach to identify feasible keyphrases in text documents. The proposed method mines various lexical and semantic features from texts to learn a classification model. The efficacy of the proposed system is established through experimentation on datasets from three different domains.", "paper_title": "A SUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH FOR AUTOMATIC KEYPHRASE EXTRACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500005"}
