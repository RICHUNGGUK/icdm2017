Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed an anisotropy model in order to model laminated wound cores. The anisotropy model was integrated to the 2D and 3D FE method. A comparison between 2D and 3D FE techniques was carried out. FE techniques were validated by experimental analysis. Findings - In the case of no-load operation of wound core transformers both 2D and 3D FE techniques yield the same results. Computed and experimental local flux density distribution and no-load loss agree within 2 per cent to 6 per cent. Originality/value - The originality of the paper consists in the development of an anisotropy model specifically formulated for laminated wound cores, and in the effective representation of electrical steels using a composite single-valued function. By using the aforementioned techniques, the FE computational cost is minimised and the 3D FE analysis of wound cores is rendered practical.", "paper_title": "Advanced computational tools for wound core distribution transformer no-load analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700021"}
