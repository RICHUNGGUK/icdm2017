However, it suffers from having results that are difficult to interpret. A weighted fuzzy cluster loading model can solve this problem by finding the estimates of fuzzy cluster loadings which can show the relationship between the obtained fuzzy clusters and given variables. In this model, the spatial heteroscedastic structure of the data is captured by using the classification structure obtained by the fuzzy clustering. The structure is unknown and complicated, so it is necessary to offer a truly comprehensive and highly flexible model to identify the structure. Therefore, we define the general class of the weighted fuzzy cluster loading models so as to accommodate the variety of different structures of the data. Numerical examples show a high capability to capture the latent structure by extending an ordinal weighted fuzzy cluster loading model to the general class of the models.", "paper_title": "General class of weighted fuzzy cluster loading models", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800002"}
