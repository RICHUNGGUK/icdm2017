In this paper, a novel AQM scheme called CHOKeR is designed to protect TCP flows effectively. We adopt a method from CHOKeW to draw multiple packets randomly from the output buffer. CHOKeR enhances the drawing factor by using a multistep increase and single-step decrease (MISD) mechanism. In order to explain the features of CHOKeR, an analytical model is used, followed by extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of CHOKeR. The analytical model and simulation results demonstrate that CHOKeR achieves proportional bandwidth allocation between different priority levels, fairness guarantee among equal priority flows, and protection of TCP against high-speed unresponsive flows when network congestion occurs.", "paper_title": "CHOKeR: A Novel AQM Algorithm With Proportional Bandwidth Allocation and TCP Protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600062"}
