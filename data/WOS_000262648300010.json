The multi-rate control loop involves up-sampling, down-sampling, and systems considered at different timescales. The challenge is then, to present complete frequency domain model of the loop. This paper presents the frequency domain model of the loop which is suitable for analysis and design of controllers. The approach is illustrated through a numerical example.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF DIGITAL MULTI-RATE CONTROLLER USING FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648300010"}
