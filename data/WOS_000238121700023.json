This paper deals with two computational problems associated to finding decompositions which are optimal in an appropriate sense. In graph-theoretic language, the problems can be recast in terms of maximal sign-consistent subgraphs. The theoretical results include polynomial-time approximation algorithms as well as constant-ratio inapproximability results. One of the algorithms, which has a worst-case guarantee of 87.9% from optimality, is based on the semidefinite programming relaxation approach of Goemans-Williamson [14]. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a Drosophila segmentation network [7] and an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor pathway model [25], and it was found to perform close to optimally.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic and complexity results for decompositions of biological networks into monotone subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238121700023"}
