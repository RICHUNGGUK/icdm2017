This self-timed link is designed using high-speed serialization/deserializtion and pulse dual-rail encoding techniques. The link also employs wave-pipelined differential pulse current-mode signaling to maintain the high speed data intake from the serializer. The energy efficiency of the proposed semi-serial link, which consists of bit-serial links in parallel, mainly comes from the sharing of the novel serializer's control circuit among the bit-serial links. In addition, the integration of pulse signaling with wave-pipelining, the use of a new low-complexity data validity detection technique, and the avoidance of data decoding logic also contribute to the power reduction. Furthermore, the formulated pulse dual-rail encoding provides an opportunity to implement pulse signaling at no cost. The ability to detect data validity at bit level allows acknowledgment per word without losing the delay-insensitivity of the transmission. The proposed semi-serial link is analyzed and compared with bit-serial and fully bit-parallel links for 64-bit data and communication distances of 1 to 8 mm. The semi-serial link which consists of eight bit-serial links provides 72.72 Gbps throughput with 286 fJ/bit energy dissipation for 8 mm transmission. It dissipates the lowest energy per bit compared to fully bit-parallel links while achieving the same throughput. The links are designed and simulated in Cadence Analog Spectre using 65-nm technology from STMicroelectronics.", "paper_title": "Semi-Serial On-Chip Link Implementation for Energy Efficiency and High Throughput", "paper_id": "WOS:000307443700010"}
