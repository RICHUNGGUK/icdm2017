The present paper is divided into two parts. The first one is devoted to characterize the maximality of a consistent theory in the formal deductive system L* (which is a logic system equivalent to the nilpotent minimum logic). It is proved that each maximal consistent theory in this logic must be the deductive closure of a collection of simple compound formulas. Hence, it follows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all maximal consistent theories and the set of evaluations a assigning to each propositional variable pits truth degree e (p) is an element of {0, 1/2, 1}. The Satisfiability Theorem and Compactness Theorem of L* are obtained. The second part is to investigate the topological structure of the set of all maximal consistent theories over L*, and the results show that this topological space is a Cantor space.
