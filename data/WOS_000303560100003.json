Although computational analysis cannot replace physical testing, it offers repeatability and consistency at a much lower cost and shorter time, making it an excellent complement to experiments. Previous numerical models have been limited by several factors: the validity of the models is usually only considered for a single TKR design, friction models are typically overly simplified and the determination of simulation parameters is often inadequate, or tedious and expensive. The objective of this study is to develop, calibrate and validate a TKR kinematics simulation considering multiple TKR geometries, an accurate friction model and simulation parameters determined using a systematic optimisation method. The calibrated model was able to predict TKR kinematics for different TKR geometries, and is ideal for screening new implant designs, reducing the number of experiments required at the design stage.", "paper_title": "The development, calibration and validation of a numerical total knee replacement kinematics simulator considering laxity and unconstrained flexion motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000303560100003"}
