We observe that the time-integration step is severely restricted by a strong nonlinearity in the response of stretching modes to transversal impact, the degree of this nonlinearity varying greatly with the shape of the rod. Building on these observations, we propose a collision response algorithm that adapts its degree of nonlinearity. We illustrate the advantages of the resulting algorithm by analyzing simulations involving elastic rod assemblies of varying density and scale, with up to 1.7 million individual contacts per time", "paper_title": "Adaptive Nonlinearity for Collisions in Complex Rod Assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100090"}
