Design/methodology/approach - A new radial spreading approach considering outside normal direction, which is based on geometric mapping method and triangle elements, is developed to resolve blank development in sheet metal forming. Findings - Through practical applications, the effectiveness and usefulness of the approach presented are evaluated, and the development result is more reasonable, meanwhile, the obtained blank shape should be a better initial values in the application of one-step analysis for fast deep drawing simulation. Originality/value - This paper offers a more reasonable spreading method for sheet metal parts.", "paper_title": "An efficient spreading method for sheet metal parts based on outside normal", "paper_id": "WOS:000259510600005"}
