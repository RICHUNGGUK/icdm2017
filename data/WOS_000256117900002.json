Each agent has a hierarchical representation of its trading commodity attributes by a tree structure of fuzzy attributes. Using this structure, the similarity between the trees of each pair of buyer and seller is computed using a new ordered fuzzy similarity algorithm. Then, using the concept of Stackelberg equilibrium in a leader-follower game, matchmaking is performed among the sellers and buyers. The fuzzy similarities of each agent with others in its personal viewpoint have been used as its payoffs in a bimatrix game. Through a case study for bilateral contracts of energy, the capabilities of the proposed agent-based system are illustrated.", "paper_title": "A new agent matching scheme using an ordered fuzzy similarity measure and game theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000256117900002"}
