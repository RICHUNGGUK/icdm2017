The control gains for kinematic control (KC) are trained by evolutionary programming (EP). The proposed AFSMDC not only eliminates the chattering phenomenon in sliding-mode control, but also copes with the system uncertainties and external disturbances. Additionally, the convergence of trajectory-tracking errors is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Computer simulations are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed complete control law. Finally, real-time experiments are done in the test field to demonstrate the feasibility of real WMR maneuvers. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
