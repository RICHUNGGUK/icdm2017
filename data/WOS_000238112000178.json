To simplify the deconvolution procedure, we further study the demixing filter and modify the cascade structure of demixing filter. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage algorithm for blind deconvolution. In first stage, we present a permutable cascade structure which constructed by a causal filter and an anti-causal scalar filter. Then, we develop SOS-based algorithm for causal filter and derive a natural gradient algorithm for anti-causal scalar filter. At second stage, we apply an instantaneous ICA algorithm to eliminate the residual instantaneous mixtures. Computer simulations show the validity and effectiveness of this approach.", "paper_title": "Multichannel blind deconvolution using a novel filter decomposition method", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000178"}
