ReachUL is the class of problems decided by nondeterministic log-space machines which on every input have at most one computation path from the start configuration to any other configuration. ReachFewL, a natural generalization of ReachUL, is the class of problems decided by nondeterministic log-space machines which on every input have at most polynomially many computation paths from the start configuration to any other configuration. We show that ReachFewL = ReachUL.", "paper_title": "REACHFEWL = REACHUL", "paper_id": "WOS:000331631700003"}
