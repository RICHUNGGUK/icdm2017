Motivated by these findings, we propose a two-layer PSO with intelligent division of labor (TLPSO-IDL) that aims to improve the search capabilities of PSO through the evolution memory swarm. The evolution in TLPSO-IDL is performed sequentially on both the current swarm and the memory swarm. A new learning mechanism is proposed in the former to enhance the swarm's exploration capability, whilst an intelligent division of labor (IDL) module is developed in the latter to adaptively divide the swarm into the exploration and exploitation sections. The proposed TLPSO-IDOL algorithm is thoroughly compared with nine well-establish PSO variants on 16 unimodal and multimodal benchmark problems with or without rotation property. Simulation results indicate that the searching capabilities and the convergence speed of TLPSO-IDL are superior to the state-of-art PSO variants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
