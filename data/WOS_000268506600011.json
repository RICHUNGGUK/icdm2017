Therefore, optimizing the performance of constant multiplication improves the overall performance of these applications. It is well-known that shifting can replace a constant multiplication if the constant is a power of two. In this paper, we extend this idea in such a way that by employing more than two barrel shifters, we can design highly efficient constant multipliers, We have found that by using two or three shifters, we can generate a large set of constants. Using these constants, we can execute a typical set of FIR or DCT applications with few errors. Furthermore, with variable precision support, we can carry Out a fairly large class of DSP applications with high computational efficiency. Compared to conventional multipliers, we can achieve power savings of up to 56% with negligible computational errors.", "paper_title": "Low Power MAC Design with Variable Precision Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506600011"}
