An array antenna at a base station has been thoroughly investigated to increase the uplink capacity. The performance of the uplink is not only limited by the correlation between the antenna elements, which strongly depends on the spatial aspects of the channel, as well as the interference front the terminals. Numerical results through computer simulation show that the proposed scheme improves bit error rate performance because of interference suppression by MMSE combining and diversity reception by TSS at the same time.", "paper_title": "Interference Suppression in OFDM-Antenna Array with Time Shifted Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700042"}
