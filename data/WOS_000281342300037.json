A set of phone-specific features are extracted based on a forced alignment of the test pronunciation provided by a speech recognition system. These features are then applied to the traditional classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive boosting (Adaboost) for detecting the place of prominence.", "paper_title": "Study of Prominence Detection Based on Various Phone-Specific Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300037"}
