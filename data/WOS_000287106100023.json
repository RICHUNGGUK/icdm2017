Based on the Lyapunov function method, time-varying delay feedback control technique and the efficient modified Halanay inequality for stochastic differential equations, several sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the exponential synchronization in mean square between two identical chaotic delayed neural networks with stochastic and impulsive perturbations. These conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can easily be checked by utilizing the numerically efficient Matlab LMI toolbox. Comparing with the existing works that consider single perturbation (stochastic or impulsive one), the proposed method can provide a more general framework for the synchronization of multi-perturbation chaotic systems, which is favorable for practical application in secure communication. Finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
