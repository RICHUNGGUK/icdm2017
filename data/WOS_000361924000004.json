This paper presents a novel automated thread-level synthetic benchmark generation framework with characterization and generation components. The resulting thread-level synthetic benchmarks are fast, portable, human-readable, and they accurately mimic the micro-architecture dependent and independent characteristics of each thread in original application. We demonstrate that we can generate multi-threaded synthetic benchmarks for real-life PARSEC and Rodinia benchmarks, while being faster (on average 147 x) and smaller (on average 11x) than originals. The obtained results show that synthetic benchmarks not only accurately preserve thread-level micro-architecture dependent and independent characteristics but also parallel programming patterns, which are high-quality solutions to frequently occurring problems in parallel programming.
