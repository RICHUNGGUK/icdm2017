We show that Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is strongly violated when there is strong entanglement in the system. It also appears that Bell inequality is violated in the region where there is weak entanglement and well-preserved where there is strong entanglement in the system. We thus note that there are states which are entangled but do not violate Bell inequality. We also show that this system can be used to prepare states that exhibit EPR correlations.", "paper_title": "Violation of classical inequalities and EPR correlations in a two-mode three-level atomic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000259047800005"}
