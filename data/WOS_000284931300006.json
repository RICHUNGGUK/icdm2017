It comprises a family of logics that capture different intuitions, among them ambiguity propagation versus ambiguity blocking, and the adoption or rejection of team defeat. This article provides a compact presentation of the defeasible logic variants, and derives an inclusion theorem which shows that different notions of provability in defeasible logic form a chain of levels of proof.", "paper_title": "An Inclusion Theorem for Defeasible Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284931300006"}
