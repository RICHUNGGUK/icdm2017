The analysis of such multivariate bioimages requires sophisticated analytical methods that extract a molecular signature of various types of cells and assist in analyzing interaction behaviors of functional protein complexes. Previous studies were mainly focused on pixel-level analysis which essentially ignore cellular structures as units which can be crucial when analyzing cancerous cells. In this paper, we present a framework in order to overcome these limitations by incorporating cell-level analysis. We use this framework to identify cell phenotypes based on their high-dimensional co-expression profiles contained within the images generated by the robotically controlled TIS microscope installed at Warwick. The proposed paradigm employs a refined cell segmentation algorithm followed by a locality preserving nonlinear embedding algorithm which is shown to produce significantly better cell classification and phenotype distribution results as compared to its linear counterpart.
