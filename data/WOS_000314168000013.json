The key idea is to make use of not only the current and previous measurements, but also previous inputs for the reconstruction of the state variables. Using this idea, sliding mode controllers are designed for systems with constant or time-varying network delay. The approach is not only more practical but also easy to implement. To illustrate this, the design technique is applied to an inverted pendulum system.", "paper_title": "Output feedback sliding mode control under networked environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000314168000013"}
