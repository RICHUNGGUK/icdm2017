This method first eliminates extra hair and scales using edge detection; afterward, it deduces a color image into an intensity image and approximately segments the image by intensity thresholding. Some morphological operations are used to focus on an image area where a melanoma boundary potentially exists and then used to localize the boundary in that area. The distributions of texture and a new feature known as AIBQ features in the next step provide a good discrimination of skin lesions to feature extraction. Finally, we rely on quantitative image analysis to measure a series of candidate attributes hoped to contain enough information to differentiate malignant from benign melanomas. The selected features are applied to a support vector machine to classify the melanomas as malignant or benign. By our approach, we obtained 95 % correct classification of malignant or benign melanoma on real melanoma images.", "paper_title": "A computer-aided diagnosis system for malignant melanomas", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800025"}
