A 32-bit Kogge-Stone adder whose performance was controlled by body-biasing was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the adaptive control can compensate process, supply voltage, and temperature variations and improve the energy efficiency of subthreshold circuits by up to 46% compared to worst-case design and operation with guardbanding. We also discuss how to determine design parameters, such as the inserted location and the buffer delay of the canary FF, supposing two approaches: configuration in the design phase and post-silicon tuning.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Performance Compensation With In-Situ Timing Error Predictive Sensors for Subthreshold Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000012"}
