In this paper, an assembly information model is built by using polychromatic sets and the mathematic forms of these models are given. The model is described by locating relation equations which express the constrained relationship of locating and displacement interference equations which express the constrained relationship of possible displacement. At first, the assembly information model is used to model the assembly information of autobody; then according to locating relation equations and displacement interference equations, all feasible assembly sequences can be derived. Finally, a case study illustrates the application of the proposed assembly information model. The proposed assembly information model and sequences generation approach is successfully demonstrated by autobody assembly planning, and could facilitate assembly sequence optimisation under a robust and reliable situation.", "paper_title": "Assembly information modelling and sequences generation algorithm of autobody", "paper_id": "WOS:000274020700004"}
