This opens the possibility to detect Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in artificial atoms. Low-fequency noise (often 1/f) is one of the main sources of decoherence in these systems, and we study its erect on the transfer efficiency. We propose a way to analyze low frequency fluctuations in terms of fictitious correlated fluctuations of external parameters. We discuss a specific implementation, namely the Quantronium setup of a Cooper-pair box, showing that optimizing the trade-off between efficient coupling and protection against noise may allow us to observe coherent population transfer in this nanodevice.", "paper_title": "EFFECT OF LOW-FREQUENCY NOISE ON ADIABATIC PASSAGE IN A SUPERCONDUCTING NANOCIRCUIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800002"}
