Current socket libraries do not efficiently support high-speed cluster interconnects and impose substantial communication overhead. JFS overcomes these performance constraints by: (1) enabling high-speed communication on cluster networks Such as Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI). Myrinet and Gigabit Ethernet; (2) avoiding the need of primitive data type array serialization; (3) reducing buffering and unnecessary copies; and (4) reimplementing the protocol for boosting shared memory (intra-node) communication. Its interoperability and user and application transparency allow for immediate applicability on a wide range of parallel and distributed target applications. A performance evaluation conducted on a dual-core cluster has shown experimental evidence of throughput increase on SCI, Myrinet, Gigabit Ethernet and shared memory communication. It has also been analyzed the impact of this improvement on the overall application performance of representative parallel codes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
