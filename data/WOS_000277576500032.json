Two approaches have been suggested in that respect. The first one is representing guidelines in a structured document format like X M L, and the other is creating a clinical execution process of a specific disease. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid method for generating a personalized clinical process for a patient based on clinical knowledge by applying CPG (clinical practice guideline). An information system architecture supporting patient centered and context aware clinical decision making is presented in this paper. Also, we suggest a mechanism in which the decision support module analyzes the medical status of a patient and creates a personalized clinical process using the medical knowledge.", "paper_title": "A CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM BASED ON MEDICAL ONTOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500032"}
