The transmit diversity gain is achieved by STBC and cooperative technology. Maximum ratio combining (MRC) and maximum likelihood detection (MLD) are applied in the destination node. Two typical relay protocols, generation relay and non-generation relay with two cooperative implementation schemes are studied in this paper. Our attention is paid to the realization and signal processing algorithms of different STBC coded cooperative systems. System bit error probabilities of these cooperative systems are provided in the simulation. Compared with the conventional noncooperative system and Alamouti STBC scheme, the STBC coded cooperative system obtains two inherent benefits, achieving the spatial diversity offered by the relay channel and also the ability to exert the characteristics of STBC into the relay system.
