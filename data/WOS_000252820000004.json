We propose in this paper a scheme for estimating JND (just-noticeable difference) with explicit formulation for image pixels, by summing the effects of the visual thresholds in sub-bands. The factors being considered include spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF), luminance adaptation, and adaptive inter- and intra-band contrast masking. The proposed scheme demonstrates favorable results in noise shaping and perceptual visual distortion gauge for different images, in comparison with the relevant existing JND estimators.
