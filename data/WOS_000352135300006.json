In this paper, a method of target detection is proposed, which attempts to extract information from the data being transmitted around the wireless sensor network (WSN) to identify targets that might be within the local, foliage obscured scene. The selected bispectra algorithm is applied to extract the feature vector, as well as radial-basis function (RBF) neural network is used to realise the obstacle classification. According to the experiment results, this method is able to identify the existence and the different distances of the obstacles measured in outdoor foliage scene with a good recognition rate.", "paper_title": "A method of obstacle identification in ultra wideband wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352135300006"}
