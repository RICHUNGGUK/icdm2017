The main building blocks used by our algorithm are: field multiplication, field squaring and field square root operators. It achieves its best performance when using a special class of irreducible trinomials, namely, P(x) = x(m) + x(k) + 1, with m and k odd numbers and when implemented in hardware platforms. Under these conditions, our experimental results show that our parallel version of the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm yields a speedup of about 30% when compared with the standard version of it. Implemented in a Virtex 3200E FPGA device, our design is able to compute multiplicative inversion over GF(2(193)) after 20 clock cycles in about 0.94 mu S.", "paper_title": "Parallel Itoh-Tsujii multiplicative inversion algorithm for a special class of trinomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000249299100002"}
