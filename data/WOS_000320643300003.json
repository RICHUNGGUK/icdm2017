Compared with the entropy measure provided by Szmidt and Kacprzyk, the new entropy formula in this paper can measure both fuzziness and intuitionism for intuitionistic fuzzy sets. According to the relationship between entropy and similarity measure, we construct a new similarity measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then we present two methods, based on entropy and similarity measure, to determine weights of experts for multi-attribute group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information.", "paper_title": "New Entropy, Similarity Measure of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets and their Applications in Group Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000320643300003"}
