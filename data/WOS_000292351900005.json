As preliminary step of optimisation, we developed a manufacturing simulation program to predict the fibre volume fraction and fibre orientation. And coupled with this simulation program and a structural analysis program, a genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented to optimise the precharge conditions. The penalty function method and the repair algorithm are modified for handling constraints. The repair algorithm is applied to a symmetric structure and an arbitrary shape structure to find optimal precharge conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
