Valuation-based system (VBS) is an unifying theoretical framework generalizing some of the well known and frequently used uncertainty calculi. This generalization enables us to not only highlight the most important theoretical properties necessary for efficient inference (analogous to Bayesian inference in the framework of Bayesian network), but also to design efficient computational procedures. Some of the specific calculi covered by VBS are probability theory, a version of possibility theory where combination is the product t-norm, Spohn's epistemic belief theory, and D-S belief function theory. In this paper, we describe compositional models in the general framework of VBS using the semantics of no-double counting, which is central to the VBS framework. Also, we show that conditioning can be expressed using the composition operator. We define a special case of compositional models called decomposable models, again in the VBS framework, and demonstrate that for the class of decomposable compositional models, conditioning can be done using local computation. As all results are obtained for the VBS framework, they hold in all calculi that fit in the VBS framework. For the D-S theory of belief functions, the compositional model defined here differs from the one studied by Jirousek, Vejnarova, and Daniel. The latter model can also be described in the VBS framework, but with a combination operator that is different from Dempster's rule of combination. For the version of possibility theory in which combination is the product t-norm, the compositional model defined here reduces to the one studied by Vejnarova. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
