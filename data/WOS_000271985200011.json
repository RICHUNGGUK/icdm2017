The way these resources are shared in terms of CPU cycles, storage capacity, software licenses etc., is normally dictated by the availability of these resources outside the local administration context. The Semantic Grid is the extension of Grid computing with Semantic Web-based technologies. The Semantic Grid represents grid management data in a machine-understandable format, and reasoning can handle complicated situations in virtual organization management. This paper presents the extension of the collaborative awareness model (CAM) to manage virtual organizations in Semantic Grid environments. CAM applies some theoretical principles of awareness models to promote resource interaction and management, as well as task delivery. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
