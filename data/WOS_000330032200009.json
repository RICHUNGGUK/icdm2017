J. Pure Appl. Math. 24:332-338, 1890) for maps containing empires formed by exactly r > 1 countries each. We prove that the problem can be solved in polynomial time using s colours on maps whose underlying adjacency graph has no induced subgraph of average degree larger than s/r. However, if sa parts per thousand yen3, the problem is NP-hard even if the graph is a for forests of paths of arbitrary lengths (for any ra parts per thousand yen2, provided ). Furthermore we obtain a complete characterization of the problem's complexity for the case when the input graph is a tree, whereas our result for arbitrary planar graphs fall just short of a similar dichotomy. Specifically, we prove that the empire colouring problem is NP-hard for trees, for any ra parts per thousand yen2, if 3a parts per thousand currency signsa parts per thousand currency sign2r-1 (and polynomial time solvable otherwise). For arbitrary planar graphs we prove NP-hardness if s < 7 for r=2, and s < 6r-3, for ra parts per thousand yen3. The result for planar graphs also proves the NP-hardness of colouring with less than 7 colours graphs of thickness two and less than 6r-3 colours graphs of thickness r >= 3.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of the Empire Colouring Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000330032200009"}
