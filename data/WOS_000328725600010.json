This work describes the implementation of a supervision strategy to be applied in thermal fluids transfer systems used on solar parabolic through based power plants for which massive neural networks based functional approximation techniques associated to recursive rule based techniques on the basis of parity equations has been applied. Experimental results carried out on a test rig show that diagnosis applied to the thermal fluid transfer problems can be carried out under acceptable determinism and reliability.
