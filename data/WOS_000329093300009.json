This heuristic achieves amazingly good results on \"real world\" Euclidean instances both with respect to running time and approximation ratio. There are numerous experimental studies on the performance of 2-Opt. However, the theoretical knowledge about this heuristic is still very limited. Not even its worst case running time on 2-dimensional Euclidean instances was known so far. We clarify this issue by presenting, for every , a family of L (p) instances on which 2-Opt can take an exponential number of steps. Previous probabilistic analyses were restricted to instances in which n points are placed uniformly at random in the unit square [0,1](2), where it was shown that the expected number of steps is bounded by for Euclidean instances. We consider a more advanced model of probabilistic instances in which the points can be placed independently according to general distributions on [0,1] (d) , for an arbitrary da parts per thousand yen2. In particular, we allow different distributions for different points. We study the expected number of local improvements in terms of the number n of points and the maximal density I center dot of the probability distributions. We show an upper bound on the expected length of any 2-Opt improvement path of . When starting with an initial tour computed by an insertion heuristic, the upper bound on the expected number of steps improves even to . If the distances are measured according to the Manhattan metric, then the expected number of steps is bounded by . In addition, we prove an upper bound of on the expected approximation factor with respect to all L (p) metrics. Let us remark that our probabilistic analysis covers as special cases the uniform input model with I center dot=1 and a smoothed analysis with Gaussian perturbations of standard deviation sigma with I center dot similar to 1/sigma (d) .", "paper_title": "Worst Case and Probabilistic Analysis of the 2-Opt Algorithm for the TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000329093300009"}
