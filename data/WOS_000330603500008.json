In this article, we have constructed some new traveling wave solutions of the nonlinear evolution equation, namely, the (3+1)-dimensional Jimbo-Miwa equation via the improved (G'/G)-expansion method. In this method, the general solution of the second order linear ordinary differential equation involving constants coefficients together with A(xi) = Sigma(m)(j = - m) p(j) (G'/G)(j) is employed, where p(j) (j = 0,+/-1,+/-2, ...,+/-m) are constants. Further, it is worth stating that the obtained solutions become in special functional forms for the particular values of the arbitrary constants. In addition, it is noteworthy declaring that, some of our solutions are in good agreement with already published results. Moreover, some of the solutions are described in the figures with the aid of commercial software Maple.", "paper_title": "Some New Solutions of the (3+1)-Dimensional Jimbo-Miwa Equation via the Improved (G '/G)-Expansion Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603500008"}
