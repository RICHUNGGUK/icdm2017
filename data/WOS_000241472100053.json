This paper investigates the systematic capacities of a sentence-processing Echo State Network. The network is trained on sentences in which particular nouns occur only as subjects and others only as objects. It is then tested on novel sentences in which these roles are reversed. Results show that the network displays so-called strong systematicity.", "paper_title": "Strong systematicity in sentence processing by an echo state network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100053"}
