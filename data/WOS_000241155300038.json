In contrast, the NPU (Network Processing Unit) architectures have evolved significantly in terms of functionality.. The memory hierarchy of a typical network router features a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) which provides very fast constant-time lookups over large amounts of data and facilitates a wide range of novel high-speed networking solutions such as Packet Classification, Intrusion Detection and Pattern Matching. While these networking applications span an entirely different domain than the database applications, they share a common operation of searching for a particular data entry among huge amounts of data. In this paper, we investigate how CAM-based technology can help in addressing the existing memory hierarchy bottlenecks in database operations. We present several high-speed CAM-based solutions for computationally intensive database operations. In particular, we discuss an efficient linear-time complexity CAM-based sorting algorithm and apply it to develop a fast solution for complex join operations widely used in database applications.", "paper_title": "Fast computation of database operations using content-addressable memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300038"}
