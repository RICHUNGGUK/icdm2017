On the other hand, there is no general rule for the behavior of quantum capacity for antidegradable quantum channels. We introduce the set of partially degradable (PD) quantum channels to answer the question of additivity of quantum capacity for a well-separable subset of antidegradable channels. A quantum channel is PD if the channel output can be used to simulate the degraded environment state. The PD channels could exist both in the degradable, antidegradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of the complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity of an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that better quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison with standard (non-PD) channels. Our results indicate that the partial degradability property can be exploited and yet still hold many benefits for quantum communications.", "paper_title": "The Structure and Quantum Capacity of a Partially Degradable Quantum Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800025"}
