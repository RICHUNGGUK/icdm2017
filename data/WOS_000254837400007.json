An example is given in which the minimal involutive basis of a particular monomial ideal for the \"Janet antipode\" <-division is neither an involutive Janet basis nor a minimal basis for a Janet-like division for any of n! orderings of variables. This example disproves the hypothesis that the minimal involutive basis for continuous and constructive divisions always coincides with the Janet basis for some ordering of variables.", "paper_title": "Involutive divisions and monomial orderings: Part II", "paper_id": "WOS:000254837400007"}
