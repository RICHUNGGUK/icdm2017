The effect of parasitic capacitances of the MOS transistor has been reduced using the mentioned approach. The process of zero-pole cancellation to extend the BW of the amplifier has been explained. To demonstrate the feasibility of the technique the transimpedance amplifier has been simulated in a well-known CMOS technology (i.e., 90nm STMicroelectronics). It achieves 3 dB bandwidths of more than 46 GHz in the presence of 50 fF photodiode capacitance and 5 fF loading capacitance while only dissipating 4.06mW.", "paper_title": "DOUBLE ZERO-POLE CANCELLATION FOR BANDWIDTH EXTENSION OF TRANSIMPEDANCE AMPLIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071900007"}
