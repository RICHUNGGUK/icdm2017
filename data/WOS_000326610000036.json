This procedure transforms an incumbent solution into a guiding solution in a minimal number of relocate moves. In each step of the path relinking procedure, one customer is removed from the solution and re-inserted in another position. The path relinking procedure is integrated in a GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) and VND (variable neighborhood descent) framework and thoroughly tested. This analysis shows that the path relinking procedure is not able to improve the performance of a simple GRASP VND metaheuristic, but some interesting conclusions can nonetheless be drawn. A second contribution of this paper is an analysis of the computational results based on sound statistical techniques. Such an analysis can be useful for the field of metaheuristics, where computational results are generally analyzed in an ad hoc way and often with dubious statistical validity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
