To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate that our proposed adder is significantly faster than the popular Brent-Kung adder With some area overhead. On the adder hand, the proposed adder also shows marginally faster performance than the fast Kogge-Stone adder with significant area savings.", "paper_title": "A novel hybrid parallel-prefix adder architecture with efficient timing-area characteristic", "paper_id": "WOS:000253473100012"}
