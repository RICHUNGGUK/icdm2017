The technique uses a subject-specific affine motion model that is quickly constructed from a short pre-procedure MRI scan. We test a dynamic MRI sequence that acquires a small number of high resolution slices, rather than a single low resolution volume. Additionally, we use prior knowledge of the nature of cardiac respiratory motion by constraining the model to use only the dominant modes of motion. During the procedure the motion of the diaphragm is tracked in X-ray fluoroscopy images, allowing the roadmap to be updated using the motion model. X-ray image acquisition is cardiac gated. Validation is performed on four volunteer datasets and three patient datasets. The accuracy of the model in 3D was within 5 mm in 97.6% of volunteer validations. For the patients, 2D accuracy was improved from 5 to 13 mm before applying the model to 2-4 mm afterwards. For the dynamic MRI sequence comparison, the highest errors were found when using the low resolution volume sequence with an unconstrained model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
