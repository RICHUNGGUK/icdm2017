We model RADAR as a binary classification problem with imbalanced data, which classifies each dependency parsing arc as correct or incorrect. A logistic regression classifier with appropriate features is trained to recognize reliable dependency arcs (correct with high precision). Experimental results show that the classification method can outperform a probabilistic baseline method, which is calculated by the original graph-based dependency parser. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
