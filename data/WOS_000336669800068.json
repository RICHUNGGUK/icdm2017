A complex system has a large number of design variables and decision-making requires real-time data collected from machines, processes, and business environments. Enterprise systems (ESs) are used to support data acquisition, communication, and all decision-making activities. Therefore, information technology (IT) infrastructure for data acquisition and sharing affects the performance of an ES greatly. Our objective is to investigate the impact of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) on ESs in modern manufacturing. To achieve this objective, the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms is discussed to identify the requirements of decision support systems in dynamic and distributed environments; recent advances in IT are overviewed and associated with next-generation manufacturing paradigms; and the relation of IT infrastructure and ESs is explored to identify the technological gaps in adopting IoT as an IT infrastructure of ESs. The future research directions in this area are discussed.", "paper_title": "Internet of Things for Enterprise Systems of Modern Manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800068"}
