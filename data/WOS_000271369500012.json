The vibration characteristics of marine risers are re-examined in this paper using the method of differential transformation, which is relatively new technique capable of dealing with eigenvalue problems rather efficiently. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of marine risers are examined for various boundary conditions, and solutions are compared with numerical and experimental results published in the literature where available.
