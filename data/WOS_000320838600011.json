Based on VCP, this paper proposes the VCP-BE protocol that can provide more accurate network state information by estimating available bandwidth for sender with an adaptive bandwidth estimator. The estimator can dynamically adjust its parameters (e.g., observing interval) to achieve different accuracy and responsiveness to adapt to the network state indicated by two ECN bits, without no more modification in IP header than VCP. Furthermore, when the network load is high, VCP-BE calculates the ratio of current throughput to the available bandwidth to judge if network is close to the overload state. With these fine-grained network state estimation, VCP-BE can adjust the congestion window more precisely than VCP, thus greatly improves its convergence speed of achieving high bandwidth utilization and fairness. Simulation results show that VCP-BE also outperforms MLCP, which uses seven bits for explicit feedback while VCP-BE only uses two ECN bits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
