The logic complements the approach to generalizing Levesque's All I Know system made by Halpern and Lakemeyer. A novel feature of our approach is that the logic is defined entirely at the object level with no reference to meta-concepts in the definition of the axiom system. We show that the logic of Halpern and Lakemeyer can be encoded in our system in the form of a particular logical space.", "paper_title": "Logical spaces in multi-agent Only knowing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800005"}
