We have proposed a system that gathers multiple sensing information by using the orthogonal narrowband signal; the system is called the orthogonal frequency-based sensing information gathering (OF-SIG) method. By using this method, sensing information from multiple secondary nodes can be gathered from the surrounding secondary nodes simultaneously by using the orthogonal narrowband signals. The advantage of this method is that the interference from each node is small because a narrowband tone signal is transmitted from each node. Therefore, if appropriate power and transmission control are applied at the surrounding nodes, the sensing information can be gathered in the same spectrum as the primary system. To avoid interference with the primary receiver, we propose a cooperative sensing with distributed pre-detection for gathering sensing information in each node by limiting sensing node power. In the proposed method, the number of sensing information transmitting nodes depends on the pre-detection ability of the individual sensing at each node. Then the secondary node can increase the transmit power by improving the sensing detection ability, and the secondary node can gather the sensing information from the surrounding secondary nodes which are located more far by redesign the transmit power of the secondary nodes. Here, we design the secondary transmit power based on OF-SIG while considering the aggregated interference from multiple sensing nodes and individual sensing ability. Finally we confirm the performance of the cooperative sensing of the proposed method through computer simulation.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Sensing with Distributed Pre-Detection for Gathering Sensing Information on Shared Primary Spectrum", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900026"}
