Instead of using parallel computing facilities or public computing systems to speed up the computation, we propose to implement parallel evolutionary computation models on networked personal computers (PCs) that are locally available and manageable. To realize the parallelism, a multi-agent system is presented in which mobile agents play the major roles to carry the code and move from machine to machine to complete the computation dynamically. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use our multi-agent system to solve two types of time-consuming applications. Different kinds of experiments were conducted to assess the developed system, and the preliminary results show its promise and efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
