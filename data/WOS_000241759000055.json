Therefore automated oracle is needed to automatically generate the expected outputs for these test cases and compare the actual outputs with them. An attempt has been made in this paper to use neural networks as automated test oracle. The oracle generates the approximate output that is close to expected output. The actual output from the application under test is then compared with the approximate output to validate the correctness. By the method, oracle can be automated. It is of potential application in software testing.", "paper_title": "Neural networks based automated test oracle for software testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000055"}
