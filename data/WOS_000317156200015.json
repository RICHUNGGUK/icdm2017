Recently, some attempts have been made to study the output regulation problem of this system subject to a neutrally stable exosystem. The existing approaches have made use of the approximate solution of the regulator equations' based on polynomial method or neural network method. However, since the regulator equations of the system are governed by ten nonlinear partial differential and algebraic equations, it is quite tedious to obtain the approximate solution of the regulator equations. In this paper, a scheme based on neural network approximation of the feedforward function without solving the regulator equations approximately will be adopted. Since the dimension of the feedforward function is only equal to two, this new scheme is much simpler than the existing approaches. Moreover, when all the states are available, our design offers certain robustness to plant parameter variations and leads to good tracking performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
