From an operational standpoint, Cyclops provides ISPs a view of how their connectivity is perceived from the outside, enabling a comparison between their observed connectivity and their intended connectivity. ISPs can use the tool to detect and diagnose BGP misconfigurations, route leakages or hijacks based on false AS path. From a research standpoint, Cyclops is able to provide a quick snapshot of the AS-level connectivity of each network, and provides mechanisms to infer the root cause of BGP (de)peerings, which is an important input to the study of AS-level topology models and inter-domain routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Cyclops: The AS-level Connectivity Observatory", "paper_id": "WOS:000263599100003"}
