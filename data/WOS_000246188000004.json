We show, for example, that each fuzzy set determines a preorder and an Alexandrov topology, and that similar correspondences hold also for the other direction. Further, a category for preorder-based fuzzy sets is defined, and it is shown that its equivalent subcategory of representatives is isomorphic to the categories of preordered sets and Alexandrov spaces. Moreover, joins, meets and complements for the objects in this category of representatives are determined. This suggests how to define for fuzzy subsets of a certain universe the lattice operations in a canonical way. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
