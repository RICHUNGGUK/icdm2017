Thanks to the fine-grained fabrics, the architecture can accommodate a state machine, which is indispensable for exploiting C-based behavioral synthesis to trade latency with resource usage through multi-step processing using dynamic reconfiguration. In implementing the architecture, the strategy of dynamic reconfiguration, the assignment of configuration storage and the number of implementable states are key factors that determine the achievable trade-off between used silicon area and latency. We thus split the configuration bits into two classes; state-wise configuration bits and state-invariant configuration bits for minimizing area overhead of configuration bit storage. Through a case study, we experimentally explore the appropriate number of implementable states. A proof-of-concept VLSI chip was fabricated in 65 nm process. Measurement results show that applications on the chip can be working in a harsh radiation environment. Irradiation tests also show the correlation between the number of sensitive bits and the mean time to failure. Furthermore, the temporal error rate of an example application due to soft errors in the datapath was measured and demonstrated for reliability-aware mapping.", "paper_title": "Reliability-Configurable Mixed-Grained Reconfigurable Array Supporting C-Based Design and Its Irradiation Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100030"}
