Firstly some operational laws and possibility degree of interval 2-tuple linguistic variables are introduced. Then, we develop a dependent interval 2-tuple weighted averaging (DITWA) operator and a dependent interval 2-tuple weighted geometric (DITWG) operator, in which the associated weights only depend on the aggregated interval 2-tuple arguments and can relieve the influence of unfair arguments on the aggregated results by assigning low weights to them. Based on the DITWA and the DITWG operators, some approaches for multiple attribute group decision making with interval 2-tuple linguistic information are proposed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Dependent Interval 2-Tuple Linguistic Aggregation Operators and Their Application to Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000343675600004"}
