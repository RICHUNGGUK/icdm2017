We take advantage of the fact that these boundaries can often be represented by linear ones connected by a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, thus influencing the placement of the separators. The resulting classifier allows for a voting scheme that averages over the classification results of neighboring hyperplanes. Our algorithm is computationally efficient both in terms of training and classification. Further, we present a model selection method to estimate the topology of the classification boundary. We demonstrate the algorithm's usefulness on several artificial and real-world data sets and compare it to the state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Decision manifolds - A supervised learning algorithm based on self-organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000259499900002"}
