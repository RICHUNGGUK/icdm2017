This technique is computationally efficient, and hence, can possibly be implemented online. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing an ascent phase guidance scheme for a ballistic missile propelled by solid motors. A comparison study with a conventional gradient method shows that the MPSP solution is quite close to the optimal solution.", "paper_title": "MODEL PREDICTIVE STATIC PROGRAMMING: A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT TECHNIQUE FOR SUBOPTIMAL CONTROL DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500015"}
