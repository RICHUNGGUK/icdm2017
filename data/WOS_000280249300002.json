In this paper, we focus on the localization and pose estimation of known industrial objects from 3D measurements delivered by a scanning sensor. Since local information extracted from these measurements is unreliable due to noise, spatially unstructured measurements and missing detections, we present a novel objective function for robust registration without using correspondence information, based on the likelihood of model points. Furthermore, by extending Runge-Kutta-type integration directly to the group of Euclidean transformation, we infer object pose by computing the gradient flow directly on the related manifold. Comparison of our approach to existing state of the art methods shows that our method is more robust against poor initializations while having comparable run-time performance.", "paper_title": "Robust 3D object registration without explicit correspondence using geometric integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000280249300002"}
