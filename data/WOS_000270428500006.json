The impact of washout filter aided mean field feedback on population synchronization process is investigated. By blocking the Hopf bifurcation of the mean field, the controller desynchronizes the ensemble. The technique is generally demand-controlled. It is robust and can be easily implemented practically. We suggest it for effective deep brain stimulation in neurological diseases characterized by pathological synchronization.", "paper_title": "Washout filter aided mean field feedback desynchronization in an ensemble of globally coupled neural oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000270428500006"}
