In this paper, we propose an automatic registration two range images method and a cycle based automatic global registration algorithm for rapidly and automatically registering all range images and constructing a realistic 3D model. Besides, to meet the requirement of huge data transmission over Internet, we present a 3D mesh encoding/decoding method for encoding geometry, topology and attribute data with high compression ratio and supporting progressive transmission. The research results have already been applied successfully in digital museum.", "paper_title": "A method of 3D modeling and codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000266094200003"}
