Three mathematical models based on system of Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow are presented and numerical results of the models in the channel are compared. The unsteadiness of the flow is caused by a prescribed periodic motion of a part of the channel wall with large amplitudes, nearly closing the channel during oscillations. The numerical solution is implemented using the finite volume method and the predictor-corrector MacCormack scheme with Jameson artificial viscosity using a grid of quadrilateral cells. The unsteady grid of quadrilateral cells is considered in the form of conservation laws using Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The numerical results, acquired from a developed program, are presented for inlet velocity (u) over cap (infinity) = 4.12 ms(-1) and Reynolds number Re-infinity = 4 x 10(3) and the wall motion frequency 100 Hz.", "paper_title": "Flows in convergent channel: comparison of numerical results of different mathematical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100033"}
