Radio resources can be either time slots or subchannels. The APC assigns subchannels to the APs using a dynamic subchannel allocation scheme. The developed framework evaluates the dynamic subchannel allocation scheme for a downlink multicellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system. In the considered system, each AP and the associated Mobile Terminals (MTs) are not operating on a frequency channel with fixed bandwidth, rather the channel bandwidth for each AP is dynamically adapted according to the traffic load. The subchannels assignment procedure is based on quality estimations due to the interference measurements and the current traffic load. The traffic load estimation is realized with the measurement of the utilization of the assigned radio resources. The reuse partitioning for the radio resources is done by estimating mutual Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) of the APs. The developed dynamic subchannel allocation ensures Quality of Service (QoS), better traffic adaptability, and higher spectrum efficiency with less computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A framework for development and evaluation of a dynamic subchannel allocation scheme in an OFDMA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000262990200005"}
