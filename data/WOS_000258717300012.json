In SDR devices, all of the signal processing is implemented in the digital domain, mainly on DSP blocks or by DSP software. By simply downloading a new program, a SDR device is able to interoperate with different wireless protocols, incorporate new services, and upgrade to new standards. Therefore, massively parallel signal processing at higher frequencies are needed to implement a realistic SDR. Thus, FPGAs have been used extensively for implementing essential functions in SDR architectures at lower frequencies. In this paper, we explore the design of a digital FM receiver using the approach of an All-Digital Phase Locked-Loop (ADPLL). The circuit is designed in VHDL, then synthesized and simulated using LeonardoSpectrum Level 3 and ModelSim SE 6, respectively. It operates at a frequency up to 150 MHz and occupies the area of roughly 15 K logic gates.", "paper_title": "Design of a digital FM demodulator based on a 2nd-order all-digital phase-locked loop", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717300012"}
