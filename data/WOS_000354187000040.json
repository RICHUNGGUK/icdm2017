Such mechanical construction makes precise speed control more difficult because of the oscillation tendency of state variables caused by a long shaft. The goal of the presented application was the replacement of a classical speed controller by an on-line trained neurocontroller, based on only one feedback from easily measurable driving motor speed. The proposed controller is based on the feedforwad neural network. Internal coefficients of neural model - weights - are adapted on-line according to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. One of the problematic issues in such implementation is selection of a learning factor of the weight adaptation algorithm. In the proposed solution, a fuzzy model was implemented for calculation of this learning coefficient. The proposed solution was compared to the classical one with a PI speed controller. The designed control structure was tested in simulations and verified in experiments, using dSPACE1103 card. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
