We consider a variant of this problem, with a Ramsey flavor. Now, each random edge that arrives in a sequence of rounds must be colored with one of r colors. The goal can be either to create a giant component in every color class, or alternatively, to avoid it in every color. One can analyze the offline or online setting for this problem. In this paper, we consider all these variants and provide nontrivial upper and lower bounds; in certain cases (like online avoidance) the obtained bounds are asymptotically tight.
