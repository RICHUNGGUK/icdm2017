First, we describe a generic set of Riemannian metrics of the feature space of orientation preference that obeys properties of the shift-twist, translation, and reflection symmetries. Second, these metrics are embedded in a modified Swift-Hohenberg model. As a result we get a pattern formation process that resembles the pattern formation process in the visual cortex. We focus on the final stable patterns that are regular and periodic. In a third step we analyze the influences on pattern formation using weakly nonlinear theory and mode analysis. We compare the results of the present approach with earlier models.", "paper_title": "Symmetries, non-Euclidean metrics, and patterns in a Swift-Hohenberg model of the visual cortex", "paper_id": "WOS:000257395100005"}
