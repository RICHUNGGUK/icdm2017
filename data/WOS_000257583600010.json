Ideally, such compensation methods are based on accurate knowledge of the position-dependent point spread functions (PSFs) specifying the response of the detectors to a point source at every position in the instrument. This paper describes a method for model-based generation of complete PSF lookup tables from a limited number of point-source measurements for stationary SPECT systems and its application to a submillimeter resolution stationary small-animal SPECT system containing 75 pinholes (U-SPECT-I). The method is based on the generalization over the entire object to be reconstructed, of a small number of properties of point-source responses which are obtained at a limited number of measurement positions. The full shape of measured point-source responses can almost be preserved in newly created PSF tables. We show that these PSFs can be used to obtain high-resolution SPECT reconstructions: the reconstructed resolutions judged by rod visibility in a micro-Derenzo phantom are 0.45 mm with 0.6-mm pinholes and below 0.35 mm with 0.3-mm pinholes. In addition, we show that different approximations, such as truncating the PSF kernel, with significant reduction of reconstruction time, can still lead to acceptable reconstructions.", "paper_title": "System calibration and statistical image reconstruction for ultra-high resolution stationary pinhole SPECT", "paper_id": "WOS:000257583600010"}
