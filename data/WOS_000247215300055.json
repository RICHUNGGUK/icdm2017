We present a simple conceptual model where a bistable excitable system can exhibit the two states. We then show that a neuronal network model can display the desired characteristics, given that synaptic dynamics-facilitation and saturation-are included. The model behaviour and its dependence on key parameters are illustrated. We discuss the relevance of our model to the lamprey locomotor system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
