However, as most algorithms are not optimized for long-term prediction, it may be hard to achieve good prediction results. In this paper, we investigate Gaussian linear regression filters for parameter estimation in state-space models and we propose new long-term prediction strategies. Experiments using the EM-algorithm for training of nonlinear state-space models show that significant improvements are possible with no additional computational cost.", "paper_title": "Long-term prediction of time series using state-space models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200019"}
