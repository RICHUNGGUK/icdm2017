In particular, we study the formation of RD spot and stripe patterns in S-Nets for which no coordinate frame exists; i.e., the nets have only topological connectivity determined by the inter-node broadcast range. We further demonstrate how macro-features of the RD patterns can be used for Bayesian model accuracy assessment of the difference between a uniform grid layout of the nodes versus an irregular grid due to error in node placement.", "paper_title": "Model Accuracy Assessment in Reaction-Diffusion Pattern Formation in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336108200004"}
