The host is responsible for the positional data updates of the entities and the image generator is responsible for the rendering process. In such systems, the sense of presence is decreased by model flickering. This study presents a method by which the host can minimize model flickering in the image-generator output. The method is based on preexisting algorithms, such as visibility culling and level of detail management of 3D models. The flickering is minimized for the visually important entities at the expense of increasing the flickering of the entities that are out of the user's focus using a new perception-based approach. It is shown through user studies that the new proposed approach increases the participants' sense of presence.", "paper_title": "Increasing the Sense of Presence in a Simulation Environment Using Image Generators Based on Visual Attention", "paper_id": "WOS:000287346400006"}
