These systems have been designed for specialty crops such as citrus and blueberry. Systems include those for fruit recognition for yield mapping as well as those for disease detection systems using ground and aerial-based platforms. Other systems discussed are used in soil phosphorus detection using near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy, debris detection generated from citrus mechanical harvesting, detection of citrus fruit dropped on the ground due to disease, citrus leaf nitrogen detection, silage yield mapping, soil nutrients and grain insect detection using NIR spectroscopy. A summary of past efforts is presented in this paper, applications of these different sensing systems are discussed, and future directions are described. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
