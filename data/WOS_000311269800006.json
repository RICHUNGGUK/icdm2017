The model is solved by the authors' own software and the results are verified experimentally. Design/methodology/approach - The mathematical model of the problem given by two partial differential equations describing the distribution of the magnetic and temperature fields in the system is solved by a fully adaptive higher-order finite element method in the hard-coupled formulation. All material nonlinearities are taken into account. Findings - The method of solution realized by the code is reliable and works faster in comparison with the existing low-order finite element codes. Research limitations/implications - The method works for 2D arrangements with an extremely high accuracy. Its limitations consist mainly in problems of determining the coefficients of convection and radiation for temperature field in the system (respecting both temperature and revolutions). Practical implications - The methodology can successfully be used for design of devices for induction heating of cylindrical nonmagnetic bodies by rotation and anticipation of their operation parameters. Originality/value - The paper presents a fully adaptive higher-order finite element and its utilization for a hard-coupled numerical solution of the problem of induction heating.", "paper_title": "Hard-coupled nonlinear model of induction heating of nonmagnetic cylindrical billets in rotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311269800006"}
