These aspects are examined with reference to sales and marketing division managers in a sample of 100 commercial saffron corporations in the Khorasan province. The findings support the ideas that website content has an effect on e-marketing and e-trust and that e-trust plays a mediating role in the relationship between e-trust and e-marketing effectiveness.
