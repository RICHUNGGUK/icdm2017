Findings - A small periodic signal in noise can be detected by Duffing oscillator via a transition from chaotic motion to periodic motion Research limitations/implications - The paper shows how to calculate the amplitude/phase in low signal-to-noise ratios Practical implications - The Duffing system is sensitive to the weak periodic signal and has definite immunity to noise, so it is easy to construct a system composed of many oscillators that could process complex signals, even though the environmental noise is intense Originality/value - This paper presents a nonlinear method for detecting and extracting the weak signal.", "paper_title": "Weak signal detection method based on Duffing oscillator", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500002"}
