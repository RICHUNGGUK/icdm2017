Thermal cracking mechanisms are proposed, as supported by our previous experimental results (Xing et al. in Ind Eng Chem Res 47: 10034-10040, 2008). Using DFT calculations, the potential energy profiles of the possible thermal cracking pathways for all of the diradicals obtained from homolytic C-C bond cleavage of JP-10 were derived and are presented here. The products of the different thermal cracking pathways are in good agreement with our previous experimental observations.", "paper_title": "A DFT study on the thermal cracking of JP-10", "paper_id": "WOS:000328205700021"}
