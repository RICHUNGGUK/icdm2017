The proposed system employs the novel anisotropic oriented flux detection scheme which helps distinguish the discs from the neighboring structures with similar intensity, recognize ambiguous disc boundaries, and handle the shape and intensity variation of the discs. Based on minimal user interaction, the proposed system begins with vertebral body tracking to infer the information regarding the positions and orientations of the target intervertebral discs. The information is employed in a set of image descriptors, which jointly constitute an energy functional describing the desired disc segmentation result. The energy functional is minimized by a level set based active contour model to perform disc segmentation. The proposed segmentation system is evaluated using a database consisting of 455 intervertebral discs extracted from 69 middle sagittal slices. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of delivering accurate results for intervertebral disc segmentation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
