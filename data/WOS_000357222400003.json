In a classic paper, Rivest and Vuillemin [11] show that any non-constant monotone property P : {0, 1}((n/2)) -> {0, 1} of n-vertex graphs has D(P) = Omega (n(2)). We extend their result to 3-uniform hypergraphs. In particular, we show that any non-constant monotone property P : {0, 1}((n/3)) -> {0, 1} of n-vertex 3-uniform hypergraphs has D (P) = Omega (n(3)). Our proof combines the combinatorial approach of Rivest and Vuillemin with the topological approach of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant [6]. Interestingly, our proof makes use of Vinogradov's Theorem (weak Goldbach Conjecture), inspired by its recent use by Babai et al. [1] in the context of the topological approach. Our work leaves the generalization to k-uniform hypergraphs as an intriguing open question. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
