In this paper, we approach the issue by formalizing the incremental processing of information structure in Japanese sentences by Minimal Recursion Semantics and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. The long-standing problem of asymmetry between the subject and object in terms of the quantification by a non-adjacent FQ is resolved by a self-contradictory CONTEXT specification which is obtained by expanding the MRS formalism using the information packaging theory.", "paper_title": "Processing of information structure and floating quantifiers in Japanese", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900012"}
