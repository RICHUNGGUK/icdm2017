It is proved that there exists a neural network with n neurons, and an analytic, strictly increasing, sigmoidal activation function such that the deviation of a Sobolev class W(2r)(2) (S(d)) from the class of neural networks Phi(phi)(n), behaves asymptotically as n(-2r/d-1). Namely, we prove that the essential rate of approximation by spherical neural networks is n(-2r/d-1). Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
