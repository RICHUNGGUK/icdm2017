To analyze the performance of composite service, processes specified in OWL-S give way to tell whether the process meets the performance requirements and to choose the process with higher efficiency from those with similar function. In this paper, we propose a stochastic Petri net-based approach for performance analysis of OWL-S processes, which employs non-Markovian stochastic Petri nets as the intermediate representation. The main innovation of this research includes a translation from OWL-S to non-Markovian stochastic Petri nets and a performance (using expected-process-normal-completion-time as the metric) analysis method. We also validate the correctness of the approach in the case study by showing 90% CI obtained from experimental results that cover corresponding theoretical prediction values.
