On the other hand, Takagi showed a variant of RSA such that the decryption algorithm is faster than the standard RSA, where N = p(r)q while ed = 1 mod (p - 1)(q-1). In this paper, we show that a deterministic polynomial time equivalence also holds in this variant. The coefficient matrix T to which LLL algorithm is applied is no longer lower triangular, and hence we develop a new technique to overcome this problem.", "paper_title": "Deterministic polynomial time equivalence between factoring and key-recovery attack on Takagi's RSA", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300013"}
