First, the proposed method constructs training samples based on the variation rates of the training data set and then uses the training samples to construct fuzzy rules by making use of the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, where each fuzzy rule corresponds to a given cluster. Then, we determine the weight of each fuzzy rule with respect to the input observations and use such weights to determine the predicted output, based on the multiple fuzzy rules interpolation scheme. We apply the proposed method to the temperature prediction problem and the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) data. The experimental results show that the proposed method produces better forecasting results than several existing methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
