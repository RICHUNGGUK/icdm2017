However, plants in soilless culture often appear to be nutrient deficient. Therefore the intellective diagnostic system of plants disease of nutrients deficiency is important. In this paper, a novel idea based on computer vision is presented. Color and texture features of leaves are extracted by some methods such as percent intensity histogram, percent differential histogram, Fourier transform, and wavelet packet. Moreover, Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used to select features to get the best information for diagnosing the disease. Experiments showed that the accuracy of this diagnostic system is above 82.5% and it can diagnose disease about 6-10 days before experts could determine. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
