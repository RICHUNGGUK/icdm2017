An ontology consists of a set of concepts and their relationships in a domain of interests. The system analyzes an ontology provided by a user so that the user can search and browse Wikipedia [1], DBpedia [4], Pub Med [5], and the Web by utilizing the information in the ontology. In particular, terms defined in the ontology are mapped to Wikipedia pages and the navigation history of a user is saved so that it can serve as a personalized ontology. In addition, users can create and edit ontologies using the proposed system. We show that the proposed system can be used in an educational environment.", "paper_title": "Accessing Information Sources using Ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000289028900016"}
