That results in a simplified registration model. In this paper a feature-dependant finite mixture model (FDMM) is proposed. In particular, an improved descriptor is introduced to describe the local feature of a point. Consequently, a priori density function is formulated for the mixture weights. The unknown parameters of FDMM are computed by maximizing a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Moreover, a bidirectional expectation-maximization (EM) process is introduced to update both point sets in contrast to traditional methods. The performance of our method is demonstrated and validated with carefully designed synthetic data and real data, showing that the proposed method can improve the robustness and accuracy as compared to the traditional registration techniques.
