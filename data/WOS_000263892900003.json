Two groups of \"non-heuristic''algorithms for general VIs, namely projection-type algorithms and ascent direction algorithms, were examined. In particular,a new ascent direction method is introduced and implemented with aheuristic line search procedure. The performance of these algorithms are compared on simple instances of the morning commute problem. The implications of numerical results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
