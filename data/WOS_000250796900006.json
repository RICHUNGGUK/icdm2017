The course enforces soft skills, such as code inspection and team working, sharpens implementation skills and creates a bridge between introductory, language-specific instruction and senior-year full-blown programming projects that are usually large but not attending to soft skills. Quite as importantly, it has also delivered a working research tool. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
