In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data.
