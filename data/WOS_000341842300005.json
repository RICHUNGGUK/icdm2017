We conducted a controlled experiment that focused on discovering which XML Schema development tool type enables better efficiency and also engenders a friendlier environment for developers while developing XML Schemas. The experiment was conducted with 240 participants and divided into two practical parts (visually developing an XML Schema and manually using a mark-up language intelligent textual editor). After the experiment, the participants' opinions were gathered via a web survey. In the survey, a technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as the basis for constructing the measurement items in order to answer the following questions: (1) which tool type is preferred and perceived as better, and (2) which variables influence the user's perceptions and decisions. In this study, we searched for an optimal way of building XML Schemas. The general tendency of most participants was towards a visual tool, suggesting that visual support is perceived as more useful, and can create better results with less effort.", "paper_title": "Investigation of Developer's Perceptions in XML Schema Development Using Textual and Visual Tool Types", "paper_id": "WOS:000341842300005"}
