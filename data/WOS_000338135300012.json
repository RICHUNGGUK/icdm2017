Countermeasures against these attacks should be considered during cryptosystem design. This paper presents a novel low-cost error detection and recovery scheme (LOEDAR) to counter fault attacks. The proposed architecture retains the efficiency of the Montgomery ladder algorithm and shows strong resistance to both environmental-induced faults as well as attacker-introduced faults. Moreover, the proposed LOEDAR scheme is compatible with most existing countermeasures against various power analysis attacks including differential power analysis and its variants, which makes it extendable to a comprehensive countermeasure against both fault attacks and power analysis attacks.", "paper_title": "Error Detection and Recovery for ECC: A New Approach Against Side-Channel Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135300012"}
