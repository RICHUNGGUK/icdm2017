One important aspect of the method is that no calibration parameters are needed for adjustment. By analyzing 3D image warping, the perceived depth is expressed as a function of three adjustable parameters: virtual view number, scale factor and depth value of zero parallax setting (ZPS) plane. Adjusting these three parameters according to the proposed parameter modification algorithm when performing 3D image warping can effectively change the perceived depth of stereo pairs generated in DIBR system. As the depth adjustment is performed in simple 3D image warping equations, the proposed method is facilitative for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed depth adjustment method provides an improvement in visual comfort of stereo pairs as well as generating comfortable stereoscopic images with different perceived depths that people desire.", "paper_title": "Visual Fatigue Reduction Based on Depth Adjustment for DIBR System", "paper_id": "WOS:000303934100013"}
