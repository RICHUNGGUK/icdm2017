Hierarchical fuzzy logic controllers ( HFLC) have been introduced to reduce the number of rules to a linear function of system variables. However, the use of hierarchical fuzzy logic controllers raises new issues in the automatic design of controllers, namely the coordination of outputs of sub- controllers at lower levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, a method is described for the automatic design of an HFLC using an evolutionary algorithm called differential evolution ( DE). The aim in this paper is to develop a sufficiently versatile method that can be applied to the design of any HFLC architecture. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by developing a two- stage HFLC for controlling a cart - pole with four state variables. The merits of the method are automatic generation of the HFLC and simplicity as the number of parameters used for encoding the problem are greatly reduced as compared to conventional methods.
