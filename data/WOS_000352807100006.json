These models are based on the evolution of the electric potential in a cell embedded in a conducting medium. The main feature lies in the transmission of the voltage potential across the cell membrane: the jump of the potential is proportional to the normal flux thanks to the well-known Kirchoff law. An adapted scheme is thus necessary to accurately simulate the voltage potential in the whole cell, notably at the membrane separating the cell from the outer medium. We present a second-order finite differences scheme in the spirit of the method introduced by Cisternino and Weynans for elliptic problems with immersed interfaces. This is a Cartesian grid method based on the accurate discretization of the fluxes at the interface, through the use of additional interface unknowns. The main novelty of our present work lies in the fact that the jump of the potential is proportional to the flux, and therefore is not explicitlyknown. The original use of interface unknowns makes it possible to discretize the transmission conditions with enough accuracy to obtain a second-order spatial convergence. We prove the second-order spatial convergence in the stationary linear one-dimensional case, and the first-order temporal convergence for the dynamical non-linear model in one dimension. We then perform numerical experiments in two dimensions that corroborate these results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
