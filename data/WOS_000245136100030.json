This study presents an early application example employing a Pipeline Pilot-based screening platform for automatic large-scale virtual activity profiling. An extensive set of HIV protease inhibitor pharmacophore models was used to screen a selection of active and inactive compounds. Furthermore, we aimed to address the usually critically eyed point, whether it is possible in a parallel screening system to differentiate between similar molecules/molecules acting on closely related proteins, and therefore we incorporated a collection of other protease inhibitors including aspartic protease inhibitors. The results of the screening experiments show a clear trend toward most extensive retrieval of known active ligands, followed by the general protease inhibitors and lowest recovery of inactive compounds.", "paper_title": "Parallel screening and activity profiling with HIV protease inhibitor pharmacophore models", "paper_id": "WOS:000245136100030"}
