In this paper, we further study these two mechanisms and propose a novel learning algorithm called Cooperative and Penalized Competitive Learning (CPCL), which implements the cooperation and penalization mechanisms simultaneously in a single competitive learning process. The integration of these two different kinds of competition mechanisms enables the CPCL to locate the cluster centers more quickly and be insensitive to the number of seed points and their initial positions. Additionally, to handle nonlinearly separable clusters, we further introduce the proposed competition mechanism into kernel clustering framework. Correspondingly, a new kernel-based competitive learning algorithm which can conduct nonlinear partition without knowing the true cluster number is presented. The promising experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
