The novel OSC adjusts its duty cycle according to the operation mode of the charge pump, thus improves the charge-pump efficiency and dynamic performance. The control of variable duty cycle is implemented in digital logic hence it provides robust noise immunity and instantaneous response. The OSC and the charge-pump have been implemented in a 0.6-mu m 40-V CMOS process. Experimental results show that the peak efficiency is 92.7% at 200-mA load, the recovery time is less than 25 mu s and load transient is 15mV under 500-mA load variation. The system is able to work under a wide range of input voltage (V-IN) in all modes with low EMI.", "paper_title": "A Stable Mode-Selectable Oscillator with Variable Duty Cycle and High-Efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000360413600005"}
