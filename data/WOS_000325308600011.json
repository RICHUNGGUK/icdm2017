The interval validity semantics states that the query answer must be calculated considering contributions of at least all processes that remained in the distributed system for the whole query duration. Satisfying this semantics in systems experiencing unbounded churn is impossible due to the lack of connectivity and path stability between processes. This paper presents a novel architecture, namely Virtual Tree, for building and maintaining a structured overlay network with guaranteed connectivity and path stability in settings characterized by bounded churn rate. The architecture includes a simple query answering algorithm that provides interval valid answers. The overlay network generated by the Virtual Tree architecture is a tree-shaped topology with virtual nodes constituted by clusters of processes and virtual links constituted by multiple communication links connecting processes located in adjacent virtual nodes. We formally prove a bound on the churn rate for interval valid queries in a distributed system where communication latencies are bounded by a constant unknown by processes. Finally, we carry out an extensive experimental evaluation that shows the degree of robustness of the overlay network generated by the virtual tree architecture under different churn rates.
