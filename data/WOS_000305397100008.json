Our construction can be viewed as the first noncommunicative variant of the well-known DHIES cryptosystem. Under the assumptions of the intractability of the CSP-based hash DiffieHellman problem and the CSP-based oracle DiffieHellman problem, our scheme is provably secure against both chosen-plaintext attacks and secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks. Our proofs are constructed in the standard model. We also discuss the possibility of implementing our proposal using braid groups.
