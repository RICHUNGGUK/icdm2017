This study examined a total of I I mathematics CAI studies, which met the study selection criterion, for students with LD at the elementary and secondary levels and analyzed them in terms of their comparability and effect sizes. Overall, this study found that those CAI studies did not show conclusive effectiveness with relatively large effect sizes. The methodological problems in the CAI studies limit an accurate validation of the CAI's effectiveness. Implications for future mathematics CAI studies were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
