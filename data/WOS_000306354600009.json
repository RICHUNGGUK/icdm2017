The relationship among finite automata with membership values in lattices (l-VFAs), lattice-valued regular grammars (l-RGs) and lattice-valued deterministic regular grammars (l-DRGs) is investigated. It is demonstrated that, based on each semantic way, l-VFAs and l-RGs are equivalent in the sense that they accept or generate the same classes of fuzzy languages. Furthermore, it is proved that l-VFAs, l-valued deterministic finite automata, l-RGs and l-DRGs are equivalent based on depth-first way. For any l-RG, the language based on breadth-first way coincides with the language based on depth-first way if and only if the truth-valued domain l is a distributive lattice.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy grammar theory based on lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000306354600009"}
