To remove the burden of multi-access network management from users and operators, cognitive network management mechanisms may be used for obtaining the required automation over several networking functions like access selection and routing. In this paper, we introduce a novel control and signaling architecture employing cognitive mechanisms in optimizing video stream delivery over multi-access networks. We also present a prototype implementation of the proposed system encompassing open source components and supporting Scalable Video Coding (SVC). The initial results obtained from an experimental evaluation show how our solution may be used for optimizing video stream delivery in multi-access networks according to a user or operator defined policy.", "paper_title": "Integrating Adaptive Video Streaming Service with Multi-access Network Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000306175200006"}
