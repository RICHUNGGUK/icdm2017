Using a graph-based approach to model the problem, we show that the minimum expected distortion of the 2DSQ is a convex function of the number of codecells in the side quantizers. This property allows the problem,to be solved by Lagrangian minimization for which the optimal Lagrangian multiplier exists. Given a trial multiplier, we exploit a monotonicity of the objective function, and develop a simple and fast dynamic programming technique to solve the parameterized problem. To further improve the algorithm efficiency, we propose an RD-guided search strategy to find the optimal Lagrangian multiplier. In our experiments on distributions of interest for signal compression applications the proposed algorithm improves the speed of the fastest algorithm so far, by a factor of O (K/log K), where K is the number of codecells in each side quantizer. We also assess the impact on the optimality of the convex codecell constraint. Using a published performance analysis of 2DSQ at high rates, we show that asymptotically this constraint does not preclude optimality for L-2 distortion measure, when channels have a higher than 0.12 loss rate.", "paper_title": "Lagrangian optimization of two-description scalar quantizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800011"}
