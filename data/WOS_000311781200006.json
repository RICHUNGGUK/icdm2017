Under social, knowledge and learning perspectives, we discuss some issues for a regional agrifood breeding environment that supports configurations of many different AAFNs as well as manages knowledge flows within a local community in an agrifood regional area. Moreover, we present challenges, constraints, and organisational solutions for AAFNs, based on a case study we conducted in the District of High Quality Productions in Sibari, (Calabria, Italy).", "paper_title": "Alternative agrifood networks in a regional area: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000311781200006"}
