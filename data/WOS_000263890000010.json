For a canonical Hamiltonian system, we propose a new symplectic and self-adjoint B-series method which is also linearization-preserving. In a similar fashion, we show that it is possible to construct a self-adjoint and linearization-preserving B-series method for an arbitrary system of ODEs. Some numerical experiments on Hamiltonian ODEs are presented to test the behaviour of both proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Linearization-preserving self-adjoint and symplectic integrators", "paper_id": "WOS:000263890000010"}
