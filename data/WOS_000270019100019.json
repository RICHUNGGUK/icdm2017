The Merrifield-Simmons index of a graph is defined as the total number of the independent vertex sets, including the empty vertex set, of the graph. Let U(n, Delta) be the set of connected unicyclic graphs of order n with maximum degree Delta. We consider the Hosoya indices and the Merrifield-Simmons indices of graphs from U(n, Delta). In this paper, we characterize the graphs in U(n, Delta) with the maximal Hosoya index and the minimal Merrifield-Simmons index, respectively, and determine the corresponding indices.", "paper_title": "Some extremal unicyclic graphs with respect to Hosoya index and Merrifield-Simmons index", "paper_id": "WOS:000270019100019"}
