Possible binding poses were generated by flexible molecular docking. GRID molecular interaction fields of the binding site, ligand-protein hydrogen bonding interactions and conformational energy penalties were used to select the most likely binding mode. The selected binding poses were subjected to a 3D-QSAR analysis using previously published activity data. The resulting model (2 LVs, R(2) = 0.89, q(2) = 0.61) predicted the activities of the compounds in the test set with a standard deviation on error of prediction of 0.17. The proposed binding mode was validated by interpretation of the PLS-coefficient regions from the 3D-QSAR analysis in terms of interactions between the receptor and the modulators.
