To regain load balanceamong all disks including old and new, RAID-6 scaling requires moving certain data blocks onto newly added disks. Existing approaches to RAID-6 scaling, restricted by preserving a round-robin data distribution, require migrating all the data, which results in an expensive cost for RAID-6 scaling. In this paper, we propose RS6-a new approach to acceleratingRDPRAID-6 scaling by reducing disk I/Os and XOR operations. First, RS6 minimizes the number of data blocks to be moved while maintaining a uniform data distribution across all data disks. Second, RS6 piggybacks parity updates during data migration to reduce the cost of maintaining consistent parities. Third, RS6 selects parameters of data migration so as to reduce disk I/Os for parity updates. Our mathematical analysis indicates that RS6 provides uniform data distribution, minimal data migration, and fast data addressing. We also conducted extensive simulation experiments to quantitatively characterize the properties of RS6. The results show that, compared with existing \"moving-everything\" Round-Robin approaches, RS6 reduces the number of blocks to be moved by 60.0%-88.9%, and saves the migration time by 40.27%-69.88%.", "paper_title": "Accelerate RDP RAID-6 Scaling by Reducing Disk I/Os and XOR Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100005"}
