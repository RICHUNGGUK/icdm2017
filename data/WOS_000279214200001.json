Three challenges are derived from these requirements, the need for passive filter banks or tunable passive filters, a very highly linear RF front-end and a high performance analog-to-digital converter. Each of these challenges is analyzed regarding possible solutions in the context of state-of-the art technology.", "paper_title": "The blocker challenge when implementing software defined radio receiver RF frontends", "paper_id": "WOS:000279214200001"}
