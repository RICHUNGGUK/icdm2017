For this purpose, a numerical algorithm is presented, and two examples are solved by applying this algorithm. Moreover, a theorem is proved to show the convergence of the algorithm and obtain an upper bound for the distance between the exact and the numerical solutions.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of fuzzy Fredholm integral equations by the Lagrange interpolation based on the extension principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000297128000010"}
