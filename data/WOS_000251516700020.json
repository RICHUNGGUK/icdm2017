This type of control is extracted and abstracted from a paper ([2]) with very solid linguistic motivations. The goal of this paper is to complete the picture of path-controlled grammars started in [12] with some mathematical properties which are missing from the aforementioned work: closure and decidability properties, including a polynomial recognition algorithm.", "paper_title": "Decision problems on path-controlled grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516700020"}
