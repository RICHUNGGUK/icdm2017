The bottom plate is a stretching sheet and the top one is a solid porous plate. Heat transfer in an electrically conducting fluid bounded by two parallel plates is also studied in the presence of viscous dissipation. Design/methodology/approach - Differential Transformation Method (DTM) is used to obtain a complete analytic solution for the velocity and temperature fields and the effects of different governing parameters on these fields are discussed through the graphs. Findings - The obtained results showed that by adding a magnetic field to this system, transverse velocity component reduces between the two plates. Also as the Prandtl number increases, in presence of viscous dissipation, the temperature between the two plates enhances while an opposite behavior is observed when the viscous dissipation is negligible. Originality/value - The equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy are reduced to a non-linear ordinary differential equations system. Differential Transformation Method is utilized to approximate the solution for velocity and temperature profiles.", "paper_title": "Investigation of heat and mass transfer of rotating MHD viscous flow between a stretching sheet and a porous surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000318130200003"}
