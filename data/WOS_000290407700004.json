However, the effects of personality traits have seldom been examined. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of five personality traits of extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, conscientiousness, and neuroticism on user adoption of mobile commerce. Partial least squares was employed to conduct data analysis. The results show that extraversion has a strong effect on trust, whereas neuroticism has significantly negative effects on trust and perceived usefulness, both of which determine user intention to adopt mobile commerce.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Personality Traits on User Acceptance of Mobile Commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000290407700004"}
