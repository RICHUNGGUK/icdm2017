Using open publication databases, we identify the experts in the community, and analyse their publication pattern, and then use this as a guideline for evaluating scientific outputs of other groups of researchers publishing in the same domain. To illustrate the practicality of our method, we analyse the scientific output of Korean researchers in the security subject domain from 2004 to 2009, and comparing this groups' output with that of well-known researchers. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that there is a persistent gap between these two research groups' publications impact over this period, although the absolute number of journal publications greatly increased over recent years.
