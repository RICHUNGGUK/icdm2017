Random variations of Delta H-0 +/-sigma(Delta H) and Delta S-0 +/-sigma(Delta S) completely destroy statistical correlation. This means that in properly designed experiments the experimental errors cannot be the origin of the observed correlations between Delta H-0 and Delta S-0. This has been proven by numerical experiments on reaction series exhibiting compensation effect. When analysing experimental data of unknown precision the Exner-Linert method can be advantageously used to distinguish the 'statistical' compensation effect.", "paper_title": "Do Experimental Errors Really Cause Isoequilibrium and Isokinetic Relationships?", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000002"}
