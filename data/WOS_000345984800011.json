The linear prediction algorithm is one of the most significant techniques to overcome NBI and enhance the performance of UMTS systems. In this paper, a modified linear prediction algorithm is proposed for NBI suppression in a conditionally stationary environment. This modification improves the error energy estimation in the auto-regression model of the linear prediction. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is evaluated, and its robustness is verified using Kullback-Leibler metrics for conditionally stationary NBI signals. Computer simulations are carried out, and the obtained results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and its compliance with UMTS protocols.
