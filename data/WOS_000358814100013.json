The LM system integrates of digital multimedia exhibition content, remote-controlled toy cars, and toy models of the buildings to motivate the students and engage them to learn as if they were touring a Lilliputian museum. With the help of the LM system, students are able to enjoy touring experiences from within the classroom without having to physically walk through them. In the current study, the theme of \"world-famous buildings\" was selected as the learning topic to illustrate how the LM system can be used to assist students' learning. The potential of the LM system was evaluated. The participants were 30 fifth-grade elementary-school students. Questionnaires, interviews and video records were utilized to study the students' acceptance of using the LM system and to assess students' attitude towards learning about world-famous buildings. The findings show that the students responded very positively to learning using this multimedia learning system.", "paper_title": "Development of a Lilliput Multimedia System to Enhance Students' Learning Motivation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358814100013"}
