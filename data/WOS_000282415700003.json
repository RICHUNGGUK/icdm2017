The incompressible flow equations are solved using a stabilized finite element method. No turbulence model is used. The variation of the bubble length and its location, with the angle of attack (alpha), is studied in detail. An abrupt increase in the lift coefficient is observed at alpha similar to 4.5 degrees. It is found to be related to a sudden decrease in the separation bubble length at the trailing edge of the airfoil. Significant differences are observed in the results from the 2D and 3D computations. Stall is observed in 3D simulations, but is found to be absent in 2D. The laminar bubble, which fails to reattach in 3D for alpha > 14 degrees, continues to reattach for alpha as large as 20 degrees in the 2D computations. Reynolds stress calculations in both 2D and 3D indicate the extent to which the outer flow is affected by the presence of bubble. It is found that the Reynolds stress components (u'v') over bar and (u'w') over bar are of comparable order of magnitude indicating that spanwise fluctuations are significant. The effect of the time window used to compute the time-averaged aerodynamic coefficients is studied. The time-averaged and root mean square (rms) value of the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated for both 2D and 3D computations and compared with the previously published experimental results. The 3D computations show good agreement with the earlier data. The variation of the rms value of the aerodynamic coefficients with angle of attack shows certain peaks. The cause of their appearance is investigated. The effect of Reynolds number is studied. The increase in Re at alpha = 10 degrees is found to reduce the bubble length and cause it to move closer to the leading edge.
