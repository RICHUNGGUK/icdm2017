However, when it comes to complex physical problems, especially the ones involving irregular geometries, the time step size of an explicit RK scheme is limited by the smallest grid size in the computational domain, demanding a high computational cost for obtaining time accurate numerical solutions in CAA. For computational efficiency, high-order RK method with nonuniform time step sizes on nonuniform meshes is developed in this paper. In order to ensure correct communication of solutions on the interfaces of grids with different time step sizes, the values at intermediate-stages of the Runge-Kutta time integration on the elements neighboring such interfaces are coupled with minimal dissipation and dispersion errors. Based upon the general form of an explicit p-stage RK scheme, a linear coupling procedure is proposed, with details on the coefficient matrices and execution steps at common time-levels and intermediate time-levels. Applications of the coupling procedures to Runge-Kutta schemes frequently used in simulation of fluid flow and acoustics are given, including the third-order TVD scheme, and low-storage low dissipation and low dispersion (LDDRK) schemes. In addition, an analysis on the stability of coupling procedures on a nonuniform grid is carried out. For validation, numerical experiments on one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems are presented to illustrate the stability and accuracy of proposed nonuniform time-step RKDG scheme, as well as the computational benefits it brings. Application to a one-dimensional nonlinear problem is also investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
