This means that the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the processing time of the jobs already processed, but also on its scheduled position. In our model, the group setup times are general linear functions of their starting times and the jobs in the same group have general position-dependent learning effects and time-dependent deterioration. The objective of scheduling problems is to minimise the makespan and the sum of completion times, respectively. We show that the problems remain solvable in polynomial time under the proposed model.", "paper_title": "One-machine scheduling problems with deteriorating jobs and position-dependent learning effects under group technology considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000347547700015"}
