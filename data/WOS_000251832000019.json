A second Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction resulted in the formation of 2-ethynylfuro[2,3-b]pyrazines, which were coupled with D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose using a microwave-assisted Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen [2+3] dipolar cycloaddition reaction, to generate a small library of new nucleoside analogues.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of furo[2,3-b]pyrazine nucleoside analogues with 1,2,3-triazole linkage", "paper_id": "WOS:000251832000019"}
