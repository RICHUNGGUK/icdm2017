The time-delay pattern is quite general and including fast time-varying delays. The activation functions are monotone nondecreasing with known lower and upper bounds. A linear estimator of Luenberger-type is developed and by properly constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional coupled with the integral inequality, the global exponential stability conditions of the error system are derived. The unknown gain matrix is determined by solving a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality. The developed results are shown to be less conservative than previously published ones in the literature, which is illustrated by a representative numerical example. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
