In this paper, the general coordinated sleeping algorithm is combined with fast collision resolution MAC algorithm to achieve high energy efficiency and high performance at the same time. By observing that the sporadic traffic characteristic of WSNs and the operational characteristic of the station in packet transmission in perfectly scheduled algorithm, we propose the fast collision resolution MAC with coordinated sleeping algorithm. Through the various simulation studies, the proposed algorithm shows significant performance improvements in wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Fast collision resolution MAC with coordinated sleeping for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100049"}
