Traditionally, communication performance tests have focused on the RF performance of the tested devices, e.g., smart phones, pads, laptops, and so on. In particular, the focus has shifted from conducted (i.e., cabled) measurements to more realistic over-the-air (OTA) characterization of the RF performance of these devices in transmit or receive mode. For example, the receiver performance of 2G and 3G wireless devices can be measured in terms of the total isotropic sensitivity (TIS) that depends on the antenna and the receiver parts of a wireless device. These measurements can be performed in a reverberation chamber setup. However, standard TIS measurements can be time-consuming and do not reflect the actual performance gains of multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems operating over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing channels, such as those encountered in 4G long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Therefore, in order to meet both time and cost efficiency requirements, we propose here a new method to determine the TIS, as well as the diversity performance, of an LTE device based on throughput measurements. The proposed method shows that the TIS of an LTE device is characterized much faster directly from OTA throughput measurements than from standard TIS measurements and with excellent accuracy.", "paper_title": "Interpreting the Total Isotropic Sensitivity and Diversity Gain of LTE-Enabled Wireless Devices From Over-the-Air Throughput Measurements in Reverberation Chambers", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200010"}
