These registration problems, often involving comparison of the two images only within a region of interest (ROI), are difficult to solve. Most intensity-based registration methods perform local optimization of their cost function and often miss the global optimum when the initial misregistration is large. The registration of multimodal images makes the problem even more difficult since it limits the choice of available cost functions. We have developed an efficient method, capable of multimodal rigid-body registration within an ROI, that performs an exhaustive search over all integer translations, and a local search over rotations. The method uses the fast Fourier transform to efficiently compute the sum of squared differences cost function for all possible integer pixel shifts, and for each shift models the relationship between the intensities of the two images using linear regression. Test cases involving medical imaging, remote sensing and forensic science applications show that the method consistently brings the two images into close registration so that a local optimization method should have no trouble fine-tuning the solution.", "paper_title": "Efficient least squares multimodal registration with a globally exhaustive alignment search", "paper_id": "WOS:000249613900011"}
