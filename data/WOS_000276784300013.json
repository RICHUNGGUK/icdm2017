For example, the initial value problem of the Burgers' equation is one of the most popular benchmarks in testing various numerical methods But in all the numerical tests the initial data have to be assumed that they are either periodic or having a compact support, so that periodic boundary conditions at the periodic boundaries or two constant boundary conditions at two far apart spatial artificial boundaries can be used in practical computations In this paper for the initial value problem with any initial data we propose exact boundary conditions at two spatial artificial boundaries, which contain a finite computational domain, by using the Lax's exact formulas for the convex conservation laws. The well-posedness of the initial-boundary problem is discussed and the finite difference schemes applied to the artificial boundary problems are described Numerical tests with the proposed artificial boundary conditions are carried out by using the Lax-Friedrichs monotone difference schemes (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Exact boundary conditions for the initial value problem of convex conservation laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000276784300013"}
