The flow is engendered under the application of a constant pressure gradient. The concept of homotopy analysis method is utilized for the series solution of the governing problem. Numerical solution has been also carried out. In addition, both analytic and numerical solutions are compared. The variations of embedded parameters into the solution are predicted through the graphical representations.
