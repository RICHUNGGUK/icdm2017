The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy hyperbolic model is employed to represent the nonlinear system. The non-fragile controller is designed by parallel distributed compensation (PDC) method, and some sufficient conditions are formulated via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the system is asymptotically stable and the cost function satisfies an upper bound in the presence of the additive controller perturbations. The above approach is also extended to the non-fragile GCC of T-S fuzzy hyperbolic system with parameter uncertainties, and the robust non-fragile GCC scheme is obtained. The main advantage of the non-fragile GCC based on the T-S fuzzy hyperbolic model is that it can achieve small control amplitude via 'soft' constraint approach. Finally, a numerical example and the Van de Vusse example are given to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Non-fragile guaranteed cost control for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy hyperbolic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353513200005"}
