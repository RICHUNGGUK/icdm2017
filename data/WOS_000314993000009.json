One technology that can contribute towards achieving safe and economic production from such areas is computer-aided process engineering. The use of such technology is outlined for two (of many) instances: Managed pressure drilling (MPD) for deep-offshore applications and natural gas production from shales. A broader picture of the importance of computer-aided process engineering for energy is briefly touched upon.
