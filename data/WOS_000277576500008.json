We show under non-singularity assumption that the numbers of sign variations in the leading and constant, terms of the Sturm sequence initiated by forward polynomials are the same as that of sign variations in the constant, and leading terms,respectively, of the Sturm sequence initiated by backward polynomials. A simpler version of the result as the initial polynomials are of degree 3 and 2 is alternatively derived via matrix determinant calculation. Other numerical examples are also provided to illustrate our work.", "paper_title": "ON THE SIGN VARIATIONS OF A CLASS OF STURM CHAINS INITIATED BY FORWARD AND BACKWARD POLYNOMIALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500008"}
