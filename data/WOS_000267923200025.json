In CRT, it has to compute a modular arithmetic with a large number to adjust the final result, which is a time-consuming operation. On the contrary, Aryabhata Remainder Theorem (ART) distributes this time-consuming operation into several modular arithmetic with smaller numbers in each iteration. Thus, ART is more suitable than CRT for the parallel processing. In this paper, we propose a parallel conversion algorithm based upon ART for RNS. Unlike the time complexities of the previous researches are O(n), ours is just O(log(2)n), where n is the number of the moduli in RNS. Therefore, our algorithm is more efficient than the previous ones.", "paper_title": "A PARALLEL CONVERSION ALGORITHM BASED UPON ARYABHATA REMAINDER THEOREM FOR RESIDUE NUMBER SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200025"}
