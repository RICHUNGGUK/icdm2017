We introduce the problem of determining the optimal number and locations for a set of jamming devices in order to neutralize a wireless communication network. This problem is known as the WIRELESS NETWORK JAMMING PROBLEM. We develop several mathematical programming formulations based on covering the communication nodes and limiting the connectivity index of the nodes. Two case studies are presented comparing the formulations with the addition of various percentile constraints. Finally, directions of further research are addressed.", "paper_title": "The wireless network jamming problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000249792000008"}
