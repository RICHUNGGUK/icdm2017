We consider heterogeneous networks consisting of WiFi access points (APs) and long term evolution (LTE) femtocells. We propose a design framework based on multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (MOBBO). We apply the MOBBO algorithm to network planning design cases in a real office environment. To validate this approach we compare results with other multi-objective algorithms like the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and the generalized differential evolution (GDE3) algorithm. The results of the proposed method indicate the advantages and applicability of the multi-objective approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
