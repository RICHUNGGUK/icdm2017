In this paper, we consider adaptive fuzzy control for a class of nonlinear systems with nonstrict-feedback structure by using fuzzy logic systems. A variable separation approach is developed to overcome the difficulty from the nonstrict-feedback structure. Furthermore, based on fuzzy approximation and backstepping techniques, a state feedback adaptive fuzzy tracking controller is proposed, which guarantees that all of the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, while the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation studies are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Control of a Class of Nonlinear Systems by Fuzzy Approximation Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000311853200002"}
