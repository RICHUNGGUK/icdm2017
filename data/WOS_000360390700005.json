By now, we know that green communications and energy efficiency are important for the future sustainable 5G networks. Power control can improve both spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. In this paper, a distributed power control method is investigated for LTE uplink, which is based on the formulation and analysis of a defined cooperative game theoretic power control framework. A novel utility function is designed with the energy efficiency into consideration. Furthermore, the location-aware weighted bargaining game theory is formulated with a denoted balancing factor. Finally, simulation results show that the presented algorithm is with a fast convergence rate. Meanwhile, it can ensure the SINR of all users with reducing power consumption, therefore, improve energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Cooperative game-theoretic power control with a balancing factor in large-scale LTE networks: an energy efficiency perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000360390700005"}
