In particular, selection diversity (SD) technique is considered and the adoption of this technique results in a coverage extension evaluated in the paper. We first derive a tight parametric exponential approximation for the instantaneous bit error probability (BEP) in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN); then, from this expression, we derive the mean block error probability (BLEP) in Ricean fading channel by adopting a simple SD scheme. The analysis is then extended to the evaluation of the mean packet error probability (PEP) and the coverage probability (P-cov). In particular, the impact of the diversity order on the BLEP, PEP, and P-cov is shown.
