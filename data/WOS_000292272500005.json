Meanwhile, with the growth of service types, different types of service should be set in different priority levels and pursuit individual QoS requirements. Thus, a new lightpath provisioning policy in support of hierarchical multi-target QoS is proposed, which is self-adaptive to different services, able to support priority, and designed with a dynamic blocking recovery mechanism.", "paper_title": "Inter-domain lightpath provisioning policy in support of hierarchical multi-target QoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292272500005"}
