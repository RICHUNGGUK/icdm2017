Various techniques have been studied for the construction of such oligonucleotide libraries, ranging from algorithmic constructions via stochastic local search to theoretical constructions via coding theory. A new stochastic local search method is introduced, which yields improvements for more than one third of the benchmark lower bounds of Gaborit and King (2005) for n-mer oligonucleotide libraries when n <= 14. Several optimal libraries are also found by computing maximum cliques on certain graphs.", "paper_title": "Improved lower bounds for constant GC-content DNA codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000252256900027"}
