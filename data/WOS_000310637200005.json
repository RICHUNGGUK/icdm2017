Most computational approaches are based on the similarity between sequences to infer gene function. However, the availability of several fully sequenced genomes has enabled alternative approaches, such as phylogenetic profiles. Phylogenetic profiles are vectors which indicate the presence or absence of a gene in other genomes. The main concept of phylogenetic profiles is that proteins participating in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion. In this paper, a multi-level clustering algorithm of phylogenetic profiles is presented, which aims to detect inter-and intra-genome gene clusters.", "paper_title": "MULTI-LEVEL CLUSTERING OF PHYLOGENETIC PROFILES", "paper_id": "WOS:000310637200005"}
