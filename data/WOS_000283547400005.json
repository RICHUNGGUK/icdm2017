The uncertainties in state matrices are mismatched and norm-bounded, while the exogenous disturbances are assumed to be bounded with an unknown bound, which is estimated by a simple and effective adaptive approach. Both state-and static-output-feedback sliding-mode-control problems are considered. In terms of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs), both sliding surfaces and sliding-mode controllers can be easily obtained via a convex optimization technique. Finally, two simulation examples and a real experiment are utilized to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the design procedures proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust Adaptive Sliding-Mode Control for Fuzzy Systems With Mismatched Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000283547400005"}
