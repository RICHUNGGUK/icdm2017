The signed distance function and orthotropic crack tip enrichment functions are adopted for extrinsically enriching the conventional isogeometric analysis approximation for representation of strong discontinuity and reproducing the stress singular field around a crack tip, respectively. Moreover, by applying the T-spline basis functions, XIGA is further developed to make the local refinement feasible. For increasing the integration accuracy, the 'sub-triangle' and 'almost polar' techniques are adopted for the cut and crack tip elements, respectively. The interaction integral technique developed by Kim and Paulino (2003) is applied for computing the mixed mode stress intensity factors (SIFs). Finally, the proposed approach is applied for analysis of some cracked orthotropic problems and the mixed mode SIFs are compared with those of other methods available in the literature.
