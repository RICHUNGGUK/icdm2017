This algorithm is especially efficient in the case that multiplication is much more time-consuming than addition. A comparison analysis shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms a known algorithm when one multiplication is more time-consuming than five additions. When combined with any known radix-2 type-III GDHT algorithm, the new algorithm also applies to length-2(q)3(P) sequences.", "paper_title": "A novel radix-3/9 algorithm for type-III generalized discrete Hartley transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000240112800010"}
