While it is generally believed that BP improves various aspects of organizational performance, there has been a lack of empirical evidence. The results of this study showed that BPO significantly influences organizational innovation performance and identified the underlying mechanism for the effect. Interestingly, it is found that a process view is not sufficient to enhance organizational innovation performance. Cross-functional integration may also need to be carefully managed for innovation. These findings improve the current understanding of BPO and offer managerial suggestions for enhancing innovation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
