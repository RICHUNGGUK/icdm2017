The most fundamental challenge is to explore the large volumes of data and extract useful knowledge for future actions through data mining and data science methodologies. Nevertheless these not tackle the issues in data quality clearly, leaving out relevant activities. We proposed a conceptual framework for data quality in knowledge discovery tasks based on CRISP-DM, SEMMA and Data Science, considering the issues of ESE Taxonomy.", "paper_title": "A Conceptual Framework for Data Quality in Knowledge Discovery Tasks (FDQ-KDT): A Proposal", "paper_id": "WOS:000366404400005"}
