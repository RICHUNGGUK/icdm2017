We used a corpus of chats downloaded from http://www.perverted-justice.com and two negative datasets of different nature: cybersex logs available online, and the NPS chat corpus. The classification results show that the NPS data and the pedophiles' conversations can be accurately discriminated from each other with character n-grams, while in the more complicated case of cybersex logs there is need for high-level features to reach good accuracy levels. In this latter setting our results show that features that model behaviour and emotion significantly outperform the low-level ones, and achieve a 97% accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
