Firstly, with a test on thirteen well-known benchmark functions, the proposed algorithm has significant improvement over several other PSO variants for global numerical optimization. The proposed approach is then applied to data clustering. The experimental results on fourteen benchmark data sets including artificial and real-world data sets show that the proposed method outperforms than other comparative clustering algorithms in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.", "paper_title": "An improved approach of particle swarm optimization and application in data clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000361555000007"}
