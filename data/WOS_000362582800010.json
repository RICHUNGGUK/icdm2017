For a high-order considered system, our attention is focused on the construction of a reduced-order model, which not only approximates the original system well with a Hankel-norm performance but translates it into a lower dimensional fuzzy switched system as well. By using the average dwell time approach and the piecewise Lyapunov function technique, a sufficient condition is first proposed to guarantee the mean-square exponential stability with a Hankel-norm error performance for the error system. The model approximation is then converted into a convex optimization problem by using a linearization procedure. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.", "paper_title": "Model Approximation for Fuzzy Switched Systems With Stochastic Perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800010"}
