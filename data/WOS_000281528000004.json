Binary LCZ sequences for the construction should have period N equivalent to 3 mod 4, L vertical bar N, and the balance property. The proposed method corresponds to a quaternary extension of the extended construction of binary LCZ sequence sets proposed by Kim, Jang, No, and Chung [1].", "paper_title": "New Construction of Quaternary Low Correlation Zone Sequence Sets from Binary Low Correlation Zone Sequence Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000281528000004"}
