The model provides an accelerated-time simulation using ideas and techniques from both cellular automata and neural network models. It has been implemented in a package using a Computer Algebra System (CAS) for the development of algorithms and a JAVA environment to display the simulated results graphically. The graphic interface shows the actual state of the cars in the system and provides visual information about the current situation of the traffic on the motorway. Therefore, this graphical approach can be used to help in the process of designing the traffic control system since the effects of making any change can be seen immediately. As an example of using GRAM, some simulations have been generated in a stretch of motorway where two different designs (with and without an accelerating lane) have been considered. As a result, it is possible to analyse the results of including an accelerating lane on the number of traffic jams on the motorway. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
