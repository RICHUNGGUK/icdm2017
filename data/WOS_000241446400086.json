To date, multiple approaches that use Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques have been proposed for designing useful Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) for certain non-cryptographic applications. However, none of the proposals have been secure nor efficient enough to be of interest for the much more demanding crypto world. In this work, we present a general scheme, which uses Genetic Programming (GP), for the automatic design of crypto-quality PRNGs by evolving highly nonlinear and extremely efficient functions. A new PRNG named Lamar and obtained using this scheme is proposed, whose C code and preliminary security analysis are provided.", "paper_title": "Lamar: A new pseudorandom number generator evolved by means of genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400086"}
