The focus of this research is describing and identifying feature images. We aim to improve the traditional pattern match methods including the gray scale designs, adaptive pattern matrix, and adaptive feature weight pattern to reduce the system function errors and to enable more efficient and quicker pattern searches and matches for full-size images.
