We have performed, for the first time, a targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulation of the opening of full-length KcsA at pH 4 and pH 7, with a special interest for the cytoplasmic domain. Association energy calculations show a stabilization at pH 7 confirming that the protonation of some amino-acids at pH 4 in this domain plays a role in the opening process. A careful analysis of the pH dependent charges borne by residues in the cytoplasmic domain and their interactions confirms some literature experimental data and permits to give further insight into the role played by some of them in the opening process.", "paper_title": "Targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) of the full-length KcsA potassium channel: on the role of the cytoplasmic domain in the opening process", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600018"}
