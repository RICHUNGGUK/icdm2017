Specifically, we provide both analytical and experimental evidence that when the visibility range of each node (i.e. device) is limited to a vanishing function of n, the total number of nodes in the system, full connectivity can still be achieved with high probability by letting each node connect only to a 'small' number of visible neighbors. Our results extend previous studies, where connectivity properties were analyzed only for the case of a constant visibility range, and provide evidence that Bluetooth can indeed be used for establishing large ad hoc networks.
