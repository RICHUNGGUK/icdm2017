Integrity of the log files and that of the logging process need to be ensured at all times. In addition, as log files often contain sensitive information, confidentiality and privacy of log records are equally important. However, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves substantial capital expenses that many organizations may find overwhelming. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a viable cost saving measure. In this paper, we identify the challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service and propose a framework for doing the same.", "paper_title": "Secure Logging As a Service-Delegating Log Management to the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000318170300014"}
