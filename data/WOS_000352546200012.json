Indeed, teamwork is an important piece on the learning process, but understanding their mechanisms and predicting the results achieved is far from being solved by traditional classifiers. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting teamwork results, and propose a recommender system that suggests new teams, in the context of a given curricular unit. Any student, who is looking for a team, may use the system; in particular, he may ask for the best team to join, either considering all available colleagues or just the set of his previous teammates. Our system makes use of social network analysis and classification methods as the algorithmic core of the decision-making process. System evaluation is presented through a set of experimental results, which report the performance of social network analysis and classification algorithms over real datasets.", "paper_title": "Predicting teamwork results from social network analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000352546200012"}
