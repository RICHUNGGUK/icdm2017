Given the high level of investment necessary to implement information systems, evaluation has become vital to ensure successful adoption and use. improved understanding of implementation difficulties/barriers and factors leading to them can serve as a platform for the development of strategies and education programs for users. Method: The study design was a two-stage data comparison analysis of a nursing information system focusing on computerized nursing care plan use. Data were collected from nurses by questionnaire during the first month (December 2004) and 1 year after system installation (December 2005). Results: While nurses gave the information technology a higher evaluation score at the second stage than at the early stage, the overall ratings were slightly negative at both stages. Age and pressure to use the system were critical factors at both stages, whereas computer skills and perceived time using the system were vital at the beginning stage of implementation. Issues of concern at both stages were system functionality, efficiency, usability, and user support. Conclusion: Implementation of an information system requires consideration of issues involving hardware and software, staff training, organizational policy, and workflow changes.
