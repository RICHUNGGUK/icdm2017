Identifying MWEs in free texts is a very challenging problem. This paper proposes a knowledge-free, unsupervised, and language-independent Multiword Expression Distance (MED). The new metric is derived from an accepted physical principle, measures the distance from an n-gram to its semantics, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on MWEs in two applications: question answering and named entity extraction.", "paper_title": "A New Multiword Expression Metric and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000286866900002"}
