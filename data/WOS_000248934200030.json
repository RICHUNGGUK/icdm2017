The companding technique is employed to increase the number of the expandable triplets. The capacity consumed by the location map recording the expanded positions is largely decreased. As a result, the hiding capacity is considerably increased. The experimental results reveal that high hiding capacity can be achieved at low embedding distortion.", "paper_title": "Lossless data hiding based on companding technique and difference expansion of triplets", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200030"}
