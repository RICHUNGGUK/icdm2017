The chaotic system, has three equilibrium points and more interestingly the equilibrium points have golden proportion values, which can generate single folded attractor. We developed an optimal control design, in order to stabilize the unstable equilibrium points of this system. Furthermore, we propose Lyapunov stability to control the Pehlivan-Uyaroglu system with unknown parameters by way of a feedback control approach and a single controller. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL, ADAPTIVE AND SINGLE STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL FOR A 3D CHAOTIC SYSTEM WITH GOLDEN PROPORTION EQUILIBRIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000345493300008"}
