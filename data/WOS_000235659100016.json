From the view of plant leaf morphology, domain-related visual features and semantic features of plant leaf are analyzed and extracted First. Then these features are translated into a hierarchy that is easily represented by XML. On such a basis, the leaf image retrieval system proposed in this paper provides two types of retrieval methods, which could give better precision and flexibility. Experiment results prove the effectiveness of selected features and performance superiority of the leaf image retrieval system.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction and XML representation of plant leaf for image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100016"}
