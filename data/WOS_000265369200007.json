A job is either rejected, in which case a certain penalty has to be paid, or accepted and then processed on the machine. The objective is to minimize the sum of the makespan of the accepted jobs and the total penalty of the rejected jobs. When the jobs have identical release dates, we present a polynomial-time algorithm. When the jobs have a constant number of release dates, we give a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm. For the general problem, we provide a 2-approximation algorithm and a polynomial-time approximation scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
