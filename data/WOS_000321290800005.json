In particular, achieving power-efficiency and multihop communication in WSN applications is a major issue. This paper continues on the investigation of a recently proposed Minimum-power Multiresolution Data Dissemination (MMDD) problem for WSNs (whose solution is considered here as a benchmark). We propose an ant-inspired solution to this problem. To the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made so far in this direction. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed solution by conducting a variety of experiments and have found our solution to be promising in terms of total energy consumption in data dissemination.", "paper_title": "An ant-swarm inspired dynamic multiresolution data dissemination protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800005"}
