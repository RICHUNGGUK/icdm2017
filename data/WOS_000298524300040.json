Much has been written about the impact of teachers' beliefs and attitudes to ICT as 'barriers' to ICT integration (Ertmer, Ottenbreit-Leftwich, & York, 2007; Higgins & Moseley, 2001; Loveless, 2003). This paper takes a closer look at the types of beliefs that influence ICT practices in classrooms and the alignment of these beliefs to current pedagogical reform in Australia. The paper draws on data collected through the initial phase of a research project that involved an Industry Collaborative of four Catholic primary schools (prep - grade 7). Data are drawn from teacher surveys, interviews and document analysis. The results present specific links between ICT beliefs that are informing teachers' practices. ICT beliefs and practices are aligned to reform agenda for digital pedagogies. The findings of this research inform teacher ICT practice and requirements for ICT professional development.
