When urban road congestion situation is particularly serious, such as Beijing's rush hour, the waiting time for the passengers is too long which affects the quality of the service. So we propose a distributed ride-sharing service based on dual Social Group Architecture (SGA). We divide the service into Drivers Social Group Architecture (DSGA) message and Vehicles Social Group Architecture (VSGA) message. Vehicles generate dual SGA messages to complete ride-sharing service. DSGA messages focus on the relation between drivers and passengers. We make a basic geometry matching by generating the DSGA messages. VSGA messages figure out the traffic conditions through a multilevel detection. After generating VSGA messages, the final matching strategy is processed. The low level detection is finished by the limited neighbors to decrease the network consume. Dual SGA messages shorten the waiting time for the passengers and avoid traffic jams. Analysis shows that our scheme enhances the ride-sharing service quality and robust.", "paper_title": "Social Group Architecture Based Distributed Ride-Sharing Service in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000333587300001"}
