Excitation forces are described by their spectral densities, the models of which are taken from the literature. In addition a simple spectral model is proposed to encompass both intra- and inter-pedestrian variability. Comparison is made to Monte Carlo simulations of random pedestrian events and a means of estimating extreme statistics of random walking is given. The method is shown to be accurate and efficient. Consequently, this work should find value in explaining differences between observed and modelled responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
