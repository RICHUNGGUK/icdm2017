This model of classification is primarily based on the Bayes rule and secondarily on the notion of intuitionistic or interval-valued fuzzy sets. A probability of misclassifications is derived for a classifier under the assumption that the features are class-conditionally statistically independent, and we have intuitionistic or interval-valued fuzzy information on object features instead of exact information. A probability of the intuitionistic or interval-valued fuzzy event is represented by the real number. Additionally, the received results are compared with the bound on the probability of error based on information energy. Numerical example concludes the work.", "paper_title": "Imprecise information in Bayes classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000303384000004"}
