Next generation networks must integrate several IP-based access technologies in a seamless way. In this article, we first describe the requirements of a mobility management scheme for multimedia real-time communication services; then, we report a survey of the mobility management schemes proposed in the recent literature to perform vertical handovers between heterogeneous networks. Based on this analysis, we propose an application-layer solution for mobility management that is based on the SIP protocol and satisfies the most important requirements for a proper implementation of vertical handovers. We also implemented our proposed solution, testing it in the field, and proving its overall feasibility and its interoperability with different terminals and SIP servers.", "paper_title": "SIP-based mobility management in next generation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033500012"}
