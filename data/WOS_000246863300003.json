In this paper, we show how more energy can be saved by changing the clock frequency of the memory as well as that of the microprocessor in a coordinated fashion. The contributions of this paper include: 1) consideration of both the energy and access time of the memory; 2) derivation of a mathematical formulation of a system-wide energy model as a function of the clock frequencies of the microprocessor and memory; 3) derivation of analytic solutions of system-wide energy-optimal clock-frequency pairs for the microprocessor and the memory, and, finally, 4) extension of the frequency-assignment technique to handle discrete voltages and frequencies. Cycle-accurate system-level energy simulation shows that the proposed scheme can save up to 50% more energy than previous DVS schemes. Our approach can also be applied to other synchronous peripheral devices.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware clock-frequency assignment in microprocessors and memory devices for dynamic voltage scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000246863300003"}
