The objective is to seek job-machine, job-batch, and batch-machine assignments such that makespan is minimized, while considering parallel batch, release time, and machine eligibility constraints. We first propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for this problem, then gives a heuristic approach for solving larger problems. In order to handle real world large-scale scheduling problems, we propose an efficient dispatching rule called BFIFO that assigns jobs or batches to machines based on first-in-first-out principle, and then give several reoptimization techniques using MIP and local search heuristics involving interchange, translocation and transposition among assigned jobs. Computational experiments indicate our proposed re-optimization techniques are efficient. In particular, our approaches can produce good solutions for scheduling up to 160 jobs on 40 machines at both stages within 10 min.", "paper_title": "Scheduling two-stage hybrid flow shops with parallel batch, release time, and machine eligibility constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600018"}
