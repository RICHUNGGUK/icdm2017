A dcpo (X, <=) will be endowed with several other structures: the Scott topology; an approach structure generated by a collection of weightable quasi metrics on X; and a collection W of weights corresponding to the quasi metrics. Understanding the interaction between these structures on X will eventually lead to some fixed-point theorems for the morphisms in the category of approach spaces, which are called contractions. Existing fixed-point theorems on both monotone and non-monotone maps are obtained as special cases.", "paper_title": "Fixed points of contractive maps on dcpo's", "paper_id": "WOS:000348597100003"}
