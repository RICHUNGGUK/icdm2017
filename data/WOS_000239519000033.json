However, bringing volunteers to the laboratory to test our prototypes is quite expensive and even impossible for certain users with specific interaction needs. Since the tests are performed using equipments different from those employed by the real user, the impact that the computer performance has on navigation is missed. In this paper we propose a remote testing approach, performing navigability testing in the user's home, employing special silent data-gathering software agents, which are able to measure the user accuracy when performing navigation tasks.", "paper_title": "Testing web navigation for all: An agent-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000033"}
