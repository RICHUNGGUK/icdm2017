However, most existing 3DTI systems only work with two sites due to the huge demand of resources and the lack of a simple yet powerful networking model to handle connectivity, scalability, and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. In this article, we explore the design space from the angle of multi-stream management to enable multi-party 3DTI communication. Multiple correlated 3D video streams are employed to provide a comprehensive representation of the physical scene in each 3DTI environment, and are rendered together to establish a common cyberspace among all participating 3DTI environments. The existence of multi-stream correlation provides the unique opportunity for new approaches in QoS provisioning. Previous work mostly concentrated on compression and adaptation techniques on the per-stream basis while ignoring the application layer semantics and the coordination required among streams. We propose an innovative and generalized ViewCast model to coordinate the multi-stream content dissemination over an overlay network. ViewCast leverages view semantics in 3D free-viewpoint video systems to fill the gap between high-level user interest and low-level stream management. In ViewCast, only the view information is specified by the user/application, while the underlying control dynamically performs stream differentiation, selection, coordination, and dissemination. We present the details of ViewCast and evaluate it through both simulation and 3DTI sessions among tele-immersive environments residing in different institutes across the Internet2. Our experimental results demonstrate the implementation feasibility and performance enhancement of ViewCast in supporting multi-party 3DTI collaboration.", "paper_title": "Enabling Multi-Party 3D Tele-Immersive Environments with ViewCast", "paper_id": "WOS:000276382700001"}
