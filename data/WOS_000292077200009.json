He conjectured that for any non-trivial graph properties on n vertices, the sensitivity complexity is at least n-1. He proved an left perpendicularn/4right perpendicular lower bound for sensitivity in his paper: Turan (1984) [11]. Wegener (1985) [12] proved this conjecture for all monotone graph properties. In this paper we improve Turan's lower bound to 6/17n (approximate to 0.35n). We hope that this will shed some light on the proof of Turan's conjecture. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
