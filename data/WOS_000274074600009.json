A very simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is analyzed that correctly solves this problem if and only if the domain of the closure operator is a strongly accessible set system. Strong accessibility is a strict relaxation of greedoids as well as of independence systems. This algorithm turns out to have delay O (vertical bar E vertical bar (T(F) + T(sigma) + vertical bar E vertical bar)) and space O (vertical bar E vertical bar + S(F) + S(sigma)), where T(F), S(F), T(sigma), and S(sigma) are the time and space complexities of checking membership in F and computing a, respectively. In contrast, we show that the problem becomes intractable for accessible set systems. We relate our results to the data mining problem of listing all support-closed patterns of a dataset and show that there is a corresponding closure operator for all datasets if and only if the set system satisfies a certain confluence property.
