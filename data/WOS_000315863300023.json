We want to estimate the annual corrective measures, which may be improvements or hunting, that must be implemented to achieve and maintain a study population around the carrying capacity of a certain area. Moreover, the model must be able to distinguish between different age-sex classes and lead the population to a desired distribution of individuals among these stage groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
