In contrast to traditional vector representation-based dimensionality reduction methods, LMLRTA can take any order of tensors as input. And unlike previous tensor dimensionality reduction methods, which can learn only the low-dimensional embeddings with a priori specified dimensionality, LMLRTA can automatically and jointly learn the dimensionality and the low-dimensional representations from data. Moreover, LMLRTA delivers low rank projection matrices, while it encourages data of the same class to be close and of different classes to be separated by a large margin of distance in the low-dimensional tensor space. LMLRTA can be optimized using an iterative fixed-point continuation algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution of the optimization problem. We evaluate LMLRTA on an object recognition application, where the data are represented as 2D tensors, and a face recognition application, where the data are represented as 3D tensors. Experimental results show the superiority of LMLRTA over state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Large Margin Low Rank Tensor Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000332459100006"}
