The search submodule returns routes between a source and product compound within seconds in the network of one or multiple organisms based on data from KEGG. The design submodule designs a route from an appointed compound in an interactive mode. The two complementary functions, Metabolic Route Search and Design, can be broadly used in biosynthesis, bio-pharmaceuticals and the other related fields.", "paper_title": "MRSD: a web server for Metabolic Route Search and Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000291062400022"}
