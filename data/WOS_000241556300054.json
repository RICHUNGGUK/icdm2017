With better registration our system can greatly improve the ablation catheter navigation system which is being used in many hospitals to guide left atrium endocardium ablation procedure.", "paper_title": "Virtual touch: An efficient registration method for catheter navigation in left atrium", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300054"}
