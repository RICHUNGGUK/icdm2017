By using the switched Lyapunov functional method and choosing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and, furthermore, utilising the linearisation technique, sufficient conditions on the existence of a desired filter are formulated as strict linear matrix inequalities. Neither model transformation nor the bounding technique for cross-terms is involved. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Design on H-infinity-filtering for discrete-time switched delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295464400005"}
