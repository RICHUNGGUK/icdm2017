As part of the numerical implementation or required modeling, explicit spatial filters are frequently employed. For instance, in LES spatial filters are employed in the formulation of various subgrid-scale (SGS) models such as the dynamic model or the variational multi-scale (VMS) Smagorinsky model; both in LES or DNS, spatial high-pass filters are often used to remove undesired grid-to-grid oscillations. Though these type of spatial filters adhere to local accuracy requirements, in practice, they often destroy global conservation properties in the presence of non-periodic boundaries conditions. This leads to the incorrect prediction of the flow properties near hard boundaries, such as walls. In the current work, we present globally conservative high-order accurate filters, which combine traditional filters at the internal points with one-sided conservative filters near the wall boundary. We test these filters to remove grid-to-grid oscillations both in a channel-flow case and in 2D cavity flow. We find that the use of a non-conservative filter leads to erroneous predictions of the skin friction in channel flows up to 30%. In the cavity-flow simulations, the use of non-conservative filters to remove grid-to-grid oscillations leads to important shifts in the Strouhal number of the dominant mode, and a change of the flow pattern inside the cavity. In all cases, the use of conservative high-order filter formulations to remove grid-to-grid oscillations lead to very satisfactory results. Finally, in our channel-flow test case, we also illustrate the importance of using conservative filters for the formulation of the VMS Smagorinsky model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
