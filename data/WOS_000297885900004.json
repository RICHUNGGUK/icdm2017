Generally speaking, discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy of induction algorithms, and the obtained rules are normally shorter and more understandable. In this paper, we present the Class-Attribute Coherence Maximization (CACM) algorithm and the Efficient-CACM algorithm. We have compared the performance of our algorithms with the most relevant discretization algorithm, Fast Class-Attribute Interdependence Maximization (Fast-CAIM) discertization algorithm (Kurgan and Cios, 2003). Empirical evaluation of our algorithms and Fast-CAIM on 12 well-known datasets shows that ours generate the superior discretization scheme, which can significantly improve the classification performance of C4.5 and RBF-SVM classifier. As to the execution time of discretization, ours also prove faster than Fast-CAIM algorithm, with the Efficient-CACM algorithm having the shortest execution time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
