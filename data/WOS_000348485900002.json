However, flash memory is prone to performance degradation due to the long latency in flash program operations and flash erasure operations. One common technique for hiding long program latency is to use a temporal buffer to hold write data. Although DRAM is often used to implement the buffer because of its high performance and low bit cost, it is volatile; thus, that the data may be lost on power failure in the storage system. As a solution to this issue, recent operating systems frequently issue flush commands to force storage devices to permanently move data from the buffer into the non-volatile area. However, the excessive use of flush commands may worsen the write performance of the storage systems. in this paper, we propose two data loss recovery techniques that require fewer write operations to flash memory. These techniques remove unnecessary flash writes by storing storage metadata along with user data simultaneously by utilizing the spare area associated with each data page. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
