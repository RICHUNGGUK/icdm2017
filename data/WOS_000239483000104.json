The least mean error (LSE) is used for training. This neural network channel estimator (NNCE) makes full use of the learning property of the neural network (NN). Once the NN was trained, it reflected the channel fading trait of the amplitude and the angle respectively. It was no need of any matrix computation and it can get any required accuracy. It has been validated that the estimator is available in the pilot-symbol-aided (PSA) OFDM system.", "paper_title": "Neural network channel estimation based on least mean error algorithm in the OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000104"}
