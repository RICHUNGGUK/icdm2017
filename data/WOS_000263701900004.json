This course has been developed as an enhancement of the face-to-face courses. The aim of this course is to create an online learning community which helps both teachers and students to have a virtual space where we can share knowledge through different kinds of supervised activities, chats and forums. As we will show in this paper, the students' response to this initiative has been very good: the online Physics course helps them to reinforce their abilities and knowledge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
