To address such limitations, we adopted a mixture modeling procedure to construct a probabilistic genetic interaction network and then implemented a Bayesian approach to identify densely interacting modules in the probabilistic network. Results: Mixture modeling has been demonstrated as an effective soft-threshold technique of EMAP measures. The Bayesian approach was applied to an EMAP dataset studying the early secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-seven modules were identified, and 14 of those were enriched by gold standard functional gene sets. We also conducted a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, hierarchical cluster and Markov clustering. The experimental results show that the Bayesian approach outperforms others in efficiently recovering biologically significant modules.
