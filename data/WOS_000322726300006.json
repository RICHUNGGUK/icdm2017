For the past several years, we have used OpenUH to conduct research in parallel programming models and their implementation, static and dynamic analysis of parallel applications, and compiler integration with external tools. In this paper, we describe the evolution of the OpenUH infrastructure and how we've used it to carry out our research and teaching efforts.", "paper_title": "Experiences Developing the OpenUH Compiler and Runtime Infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000322726300006"}
