The creation of such models is, however, cumbersome as multiple aspects of an organization need to be considered, making manual efforts time-consuming, and error prone. Thus, the EA approach would be significantly more promising if the data used when creating the models could be collected automatically-a topic not yet properly addressed by either academia or industry. This paper proposes network scanning for automatic data collection and uses an existing software tool for generating EA models (ArchiMate is employed as an example) based on the IT infrastructure of enterprises. While some manual effort is required to make the models fully useful to many practical scenarios (e.g., to detail the actual services provided by IT components), empirical results show that the methodology is accurate and (in its default state) require little effort to carry out.", "paper_title": "Automatic data collection for enterprise architecture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000335236300018"}
