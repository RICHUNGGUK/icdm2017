We refer to this task as conditional healthiness classification. For that purpose, we annotate a corpus extracted from forum entries of a food-related website. We identify different relation types that hold between food items and health conditions going beyond a binary distinction of suitability and unsuitability and devise various supervised classifiers using different types of features. We examine the impact of different task-specific resources, such as a healthiness lexicon that lists the healthiness status of a food item and a sentiment lexicon. Moreover, we also consider task-specific linguistic features that disambiguate a context in which mentions of a food item and a health condition co-occur and compare them with standard features using bag of words, part-of-speech information and syntactic parses. We also investigate in how far individual food items and health conditions correlate with specific relation types and try to harness this information for classification.", "paper_title": "Detecting conditional healthiness of food items from natural language text", "paper_id": "WOS:000364230000001"}
