In this paper, the issue of continuous field management has been faced under several points of views, from the design to the implementation stage. The resulting environment provides domain experts with a formal visual approach to conceptually depict mini-worlds of interest embedding spatial data. It is based on an extended version of the OpenGIS standard architecture, thus guaranteeing a natural integration with solutions derived by previous conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "An OpenGIS (R)-based approach to define continuous field data within a visual environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835200008"}
