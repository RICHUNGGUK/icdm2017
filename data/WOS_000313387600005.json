Design/methodology/approach - An expert workshop with academics, industry representatives and market analysts was organised to discuss and analyse the results of an online survey of techno-economic and socio-economic aspects concerning the evolution of mobile search. Findings - Despite clear positive signs, forecasted great expectations around mobile search are not yet supported by economic market evidence. Substantial development work for creating new applications ripe for the mass market is still needed, although there seems to be no fundamental technological barrier to that. Location-based services, augmented reality, real-time information search, and social network search and recommendations, have been identified as some of the key trends that may shape the future of mobile search. User demand for innovative mobile search-based applications is largely taken for granted, but experts lack a clear view on suitable business models that would allow for sustainable economic development. Originality/value - Innovating is not only inventing. Understanding what drives customers' willingness to use and to pay for a product or service is essential in order to design appropriate services and introduce these innovations to the market. There is a growing literature on mobile search-related technology, but the market context is largely unexplored.", "paper_title": "Factors required for mobile search going mainstream", "paper_id": "WOS:000313387600005"}
