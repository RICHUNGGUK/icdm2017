However, each of them has its limitations depending on different conditions such as data size and dimensionality. Hybrid computational intelligence has been introduced as a new paradigm to complement the weaknesses of one technique with the strengths of another or others. This paper presents a computational intelligence hybrid model to overcome some of the limitations of the standalone type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) model by using a least-square-fitting-based model selection algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the input data while selecting the best variables. This novel feature selection procedure resulted in the improvement of the performance of T2FLS whose complexity is usually increased and performance degraded with increased dimensionality of input data. The iterative least-square-fitting algorithm part of functional networks (FN) and T2FLS techniques were combined in a hybrid manner to predict the porosity and permeability of North American and Middle Eastern oil and gas reservoirs. Training and testing the T2FLS block of the hybrid model with the best and dimensionally reduced input variables caused the hybrid model to perform better with higher correlation coefficients, lower root mean square errors, and less execution times than the standalone T2FLS model. This work has demonstrated the promising capability of hybrid modelling and has given more insight into the possibility of more robust hybrid models with better functionality and capability indices.", "paper_title": "A least-square-driven functional networks type-2 fuzzy logic hybrid model for efficient petroleum reservoir properties prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100014"}
