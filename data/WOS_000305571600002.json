We present a new method to solve a difficult geometric operation that is raised by this model: the integer affine transformation of parametric Z-polytopes. The result of such a transformation is given by a worst-case exponential union of Z-polytopes. We also propose a polynomial algorithm (for fixed dimension), to count points in arbitrary unions of a fixed number of parametric Z-polytopes. We implemented these algorithms and compared them to other existing algorithms, for a set of applications to loop nest analysis and optimization.", "paper_title": "Integer Affine Transformations of Parametric Z-polytopes and Applications to Loop Nest Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305571600002"}
