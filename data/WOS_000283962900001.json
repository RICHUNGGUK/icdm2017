While simple visualization supports in graphical forms are helpful in finding characteristics in protocol analysis, similarity assessment of the protocol data of various designers and various design tasks and situations will also help to understand designers and design problem characteristics. In this paper, we propose similarity assessment methods of design behavior data as support tools for understanding and analysis of the nature of design ability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
