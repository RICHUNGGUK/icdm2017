Usually, as they are deployed to an open and unprotected region, they are vulnerable to various types of attacks. In this research, a mechanism of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) created in a Cluster-based Wireless Sensor Network (CWSN) is proposed. The proposed IDS is an Integrated Intrusion Detection System (IIDS). It can provide the system to resist intrusions, and process in real-time by analyzing the attacks. The IIDS includes three individual IDSs: Intelligent Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IHIDS), Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and misuse Intrusion Detection System. These are designed for the sink, cluster head and sensor node according to different capabilities and the probabilities of attacks these suffer from. The proposed IIDS consists of an anomaly and a misuse detection module. The goal is to raise the detection rate and lower the false positive rate through misuse detection and anomaly detection. Finally, a decision-making module is used to integrate the detected results and report the types of attacks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
