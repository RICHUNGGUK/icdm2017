The recently proposed reaction systems also investigate processes carried by biochemical reactions, but the resulting computational model is remarkably different. A key difference is that in reaction systems, biochemical reactions are modeled using a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach. In this paper, we introduce so-called set membrane systems, a variant of membrane systems with qualitative evolution rules inspired by reaction systems. We then relate set membrane systems to Petri nets which leads to a new class of Petri nets: set-nets with localities. This Petri net model provides a faithful match with the operational semantics of set membrane systems.", "paper_title": "Membrane Systems with Qualitative Evolution Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900017"}
