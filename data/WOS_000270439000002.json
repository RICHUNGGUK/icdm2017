This paper reports on our experiences while implementing the approach of Puget (CP2005, LNCS, vol. 3709, pp. 475-489. Springer, 2005). In particular, it proposes a modification to the approach to deal with general expressions, discusses the insights gained, and gives the results of an experimental evaluation of the accuracy and efficiency of the approach.", "paper_title": "On implementing symmetry detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000270439000002"}
