We show how to model summaries as complex networks and establish a possible correlation between summary quality and the measure known as dynamics of the network growth. It is a generic and language independent method that enables easy and fast comparative evaluation of summaries. We evaluate our approach using manually produced summaries and automatic summaries produced by three automatic text summarizers for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The results are in agreement with human intuition and showed to be statistically significant.", "paper_title": "Modeling and evaluating summaries using complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800001"}
