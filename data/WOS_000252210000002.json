It is an iterative process that consists of generating solutions from some probability distribution whose parameter values are updated in each iteration using information from the best solutions found in that iteration. The article applies the method to the problem of the optimization of signal settings on a signalized roundabout. The performance of any given set of timings is evaluated using the cell transmission model, a deterministic macroscopic traffic flow model that permits the modeling of the spatial extent of queues and the possibility of \"blocking back.\" The results from the investigations are encouraging, and show that the CEM has the potential to be a useful technique for tackling global optimization problems.", "paper_title": "The optimization of signal settings on a signalized roundabout using the cross-entropy method", "paper_id": "WOS:000252210000002"}
