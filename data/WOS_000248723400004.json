Today, electronic procurement (e-procurement) accounts for most of the volume and value of the business transactions conducted over the Internet. As of yet, however, little or no research has assessed the functional and non-functional requirements sought for the WWW-based systems used to support the procurement process. This paper, presents findings of a survey of 133 corporate buyers from about 130 companies on the use of readily available web-based systems for business-to-business transactions and the requirements perceived to be critical to the effective support of supply chain operations.", "paper_title": "Assessing critical functional and non-functional requirements for web-based procurement systems: a comprehensive survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000248723400004"}
