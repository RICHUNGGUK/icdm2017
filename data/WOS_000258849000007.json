The compounds are classified either active or inactive. The model was validated using a test set of 14 compounds. Two descriptors, Mor26v and Gap(HOMO, HOMO-I), were selected. The logistic regression resulted classification accuracy of 90.5% for the training set, 67% for the test set after Applicability Domain analysis was performed. The method of classification tree resulted classification accuracy of 95% for the training set, 86% for the test set. It was shown that the lowest energy conformation can be used to build a QSAR model through examination of the whole conformations that lie above the lowest energy conformation in the energy window of 13 kcal/mol. The selected descriptor Mor26v distinguishes differences in molecular chirality, while Gap(HOMO, HOMO-1) distinguishes differences in electronic structures.", "paper_title": "QSAR modeling of nucleosides against amastigotes of Leishmania donovani using logistic regression and classification tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000258849000007"}
