Recently, biomimetic approaches to underwater vehicle propulsion have illuminated the exciting possibilities for performance improvements made possible by emulating fish motion. In particular, a number of test vehicles indicate that the carangiform swimming mode employed by highly developed species of fish, such as the Bluefin tuna, offers both a more efficient propulsion mechanism than propellers, in addition to the ability to perform quick manoeuvring. This paper presents the design, construction and testing of a biomimetic tuna that employs shape memory alloy wires to affect shape induced propulsion. Issues related to a smart structures design approach for application in UUVs are presented, including swimming parameters for the vehicle operation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
