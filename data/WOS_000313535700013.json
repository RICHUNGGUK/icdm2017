The electrical impedance tomography (EIT) method makes it possible to obtain a distribution of wall dampness. The paper aims to give basic information about the measuring system, including prototype equipment. The setup was used to determine the dampness of test brick walls on a specially built laboratory test rig. The paper seeks to compare test results obtained by the non-destructive impedance tomography method with the results obtained by the conventional destructive dry-weight method. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a tomography approach to control humidity inside of the brick walls. In case of brick walls other nondestructive methods fields, for example, the ultrasonic tomography is useless. On the other hand the most popular dry-weight method is strictly forbidden for historical buildings. As a forward solver, functionally graded material boundary element method was used. Findings - The paper proves that diffuse tomography could provide reliable results with respect of humidity content inside the brick walls. This method could provide 3D humidity distribution inside of the brick walls. Research limitations/implications - It is expected that the technique's impact will be limited to site inspection of building following floods or to evaluate older damp buildings. Practical implications - The presented technique can eventually lead to much simpler, cheaper and more efficient evaluation of the moisture content in walls. This can revolutionize some procedures in civil engineering. Social implications - The application has commercial potential and could result in more cost-effective repair of old buildings,. which has an economic impact on society. Originality/value - The authors propose application of the diffuse tomography for nondestructive investigation of brick walls. According to the authors' best knowledge this is a novel approach.", "paper_title": "Identification of moisture content in brick walls by means of impedance tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000313535700013"}
