It puts forward the integration framework of information system according to synergic theory, which is based on the technology of Data Mining and Web Services. And it includes 2 parts: the inner synergic framework such as EIP, and the outer one such as E-Commerce platform. The whole framework enhances the efficiency of communication and information transfer in (an) enterprise. Meanwhile, it also ensures that enterprise will be value-added by means of improving the performance of information collection and transference in the sectors of supply chain.", "paper_title": "Aggregated framework of enterprise information system based on synergic theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300021"}
