While the use of overset grid eases the grid generation process, the non-trivial task of ensuring communication between overlapping grids needs careful attention. This need is effectively addressed by using a practically useful technique known as the implicit hole cutting (IHC) method. The method depends on a simple cell selection process based on the criterion of cell size, and all grid points including interior points and fringe points are treated indiscriminately in the computation of the flow field. This paper demonstrates the simplicity of the IHC method for the adjoint equation. Similar to the flow solver, the adjoint equations are solved on conventional point-matched and overlapped grids within a multi-block framework. Parallel computing with message passing interface is also used to improve the overall efficiency of the optimization process. The method is successfully demonstrated in several two- and a three-dimensional shape optimization cases for both external and internal flow problems.
