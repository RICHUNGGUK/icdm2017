By the new design, new classes of optimal LHZ FHS sets with large family size are obtained. It is shown that all the sequences in the proposed FHS sets are shift distinct. The proposed FHS sets are suitable for quasi-synchronous time/frequency hopping code division multiple access systems to eliminate multiple-access interference.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Optimal Low Hit Zone Frequency Hopping Sequences with New Parameters by Interleaving Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900005"}
