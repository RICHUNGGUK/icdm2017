One of its appealing properties is the low number of connections per processor, which can facilitate the VLSI design and fabrication. Other alluring features include symmetry and logarithmic diameter, which can derive easy and fast algorithms for communication. In this paper, a maximal number of node-disjoint paths are constructed between every two distinct nodes of the hierarchical hypercube network. Their maximal length is not greater than max{2(m+1) + 2m + 1,2(m+1) + m + 4}, where 2(m+1) is the diameter. The effectiveness of node-disjoint paths is further verified by experiments.
