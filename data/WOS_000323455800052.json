The weight distribution of cyclic codes has been an important topic of study for many years. It is in general hard to determine the weight distribution of linear codes. In this paper, a class of cyclic codes with any number of zeros is described and their weight distributions are determined.", "paper_title": "Weight Distribution of a Class of Cyclic Codes With Arbitrary Number of Zeros", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800052"}
