The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for the calibration of a 3-D laser scanner, mainly for robotic applications. The acquisition system consists of a laser emitter and a webcam with fixed relative positions. In addition, a cylindrical lens is provided with the laser housing so that it is capable to project a plane light. An optical filter was also used in order to segment the laser stripe from the rest of the scene. For the calibration procedure it was used a digital micrometer that move a target with known dimensions. The calibration method is based on the modeling of the geometrical relationship between the 3-D coordinates of the laser stripe on the target and its digital coordinates in the image plane. By this method it is possible to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the video system, the position of the image plane and the laser plane in a given frame, all in the same time.
