Belief ascription has been studied intensively in philosophy and cognitive science. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for belief ascription by simulation. An agent first acquires information about another agent's beliefs by communication. She then inputs the information into her own belief system to generate more beliefs, which she will ascribe to the other agent. In this way, the agent uses her own as a model of others. We present a modal belief logic, which contains private announcement operators for agents' communication, and simulative belief operators for beliefs ascribed to others. We give a complete axiomatic system for the logic. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Simulative belief logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000319246600005"}
