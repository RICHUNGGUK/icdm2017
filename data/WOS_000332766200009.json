The recent publication of several new, off-path DNS cache-poisoning and wide-scale man-in-the-middle attacks should motivate DNSSEC adoption. However, significant challenges and pitfalls have resulted in severely limited deployment, which is furthermore often incorrect (and hence vulnerable). The authors outline these problems and suggest directions for improvement and further research.", "paper_title": "Retrofitting Security into Network Protocols The Case of DNSSEC", "paper_id": "WOS:000332766200009"}
