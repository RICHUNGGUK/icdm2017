For NO-MA schemes, a metric is proposed to compute the angle(s) of rotation between the input constellations such that the CC capacity regions are maximally enlarged. Further, code pairs based on Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) are designed with PSK constellation pairs and PAM constellation pairs such that any rate pair within the CC capacity region can be approached. Such a NO-MA scheme which employs CC capacity approaching trellis codes is referred to as Trellis Coded Multiple Access (TCMA). Then, CC capacity regions of O-MA schemes such as Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) are also computed and it is shown that, unlike the Gaussian distributed continuous constellations case, the CC capacity regions with FDMA are strictly contained inside the CC capacity regions with TCMA. Hence, for finite constellations, a NO-MA scheme such as TCMA is better than FDMA and TDMA which makes NO-MA schemes worth pursuing in practice for two-user GMAC. Then, the idea of introducing rotations between the input constellations is used to construct Space-Time Block Code (STBC) pairs for two-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) fading MAC. The proposed STBCs are shown to have reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity and information-losslessness property. Finally, STBC pairs with reduced sphere decoding complexity are proposed for two-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) fading MAC.", "paper_title": "On Two-User Gaussian Multiple Access Channels With Finite Input Constellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200009"}
