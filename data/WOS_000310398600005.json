The equations for the time course of the amount of matter in the different compartments of the system have been derived without any restriction as regards the properties of the matrix of the corresponding set of linear differential equations or the multiplicities of its eigenvalues which circumvents some of the limitations of previous contributions. The equations obtained are general and can be applied to any engineering, chemical, biological, biochemical, pharmacological, physical and other systems that can be modelized as a linear compartmental system, irrespective of its complexity and/or structure.", "paper_title": "A Novel Procedure to Analyse the Kinetics of Multicompartmental Linear Systems.
