Up to now several designs using QCA technology have been proposed. However, we found not all of the designs function properly. Further, no general design guidelines have been proposed so far. A straightforward extension of a simple functional design pattern may fail. This makes designing a large scale circuits using QCA technology an extremely time-consuming process. In this paper we show several critical vulnerabilities in the structures of primitive QCA gates and QCA interconnects, and propose a disciplinary guideline to prevent any additional plausible but malfunctioning QCA designs.", "paper_title": "Quantum-dot cellular automata design guideline", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500014"}
