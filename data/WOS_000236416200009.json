The panoramic stereoscopic image provides a stereo sensation in a full 360 degrees view. These omni-directional stereoscopic images cannot be produced by two omni-directional cameras from two viewpoints, but they can be constructed by mosaicking together the omni-directional images from four different positions around the user's position. This paper addresses a new technique for producing high-resolution, omni-directional stereoscopic images from one omni-directional sensor that is attached to a high-resolution digital still camera. This technique requires fewer photos and less time for the mosaic processes than previous approaches. A new display system is implemented on CAVE to interact with the stereoscopic images.", "paper_title": "Omni-directional stereoscopic images from one omni-directional camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000236416200009"}
