In a continuing effort to create clear and integrated visualizations that facilitate the gathering of novel biological insights despite the overwhelming complexity of data, we present here the GrAph LANdscape VisualizaTion (GALANT), a Cytoscape plugin that builds functional landscapes onto biological networks. By using GALANT, it is possible to project any type of numerical data onto a network to create a smoothed data map resembling the network layout. As a Cytoscape plugin, GALANT is further improved by the functionalities of Cytoscape, the popular bioinformatics package for biological network visualization and data integration.", "paper_title": "GALANT: a Cytoscape plugin for visualizing data as functional landscapes projected onto biological networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324778500026"}
