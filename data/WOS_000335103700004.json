Sometimes, decision makers may not have an in-depth knowledge of the problem to be solved and provide incomplete preference relations. In this paper, we focus on group decision making (GDM) problems with heterogeneous incomplete uncertain preference relations, including uncertain multiplicative preference relations, uncertain fuzzy preference relations, uncertain linguistic preference relations and intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. To deal with such GDM problems, a decision analysis method is proposed. Based on the multiplicative consistency of uncertain preference relations, a bi-objective optimization model which aims to maximize both the group consensus and the individual consistency of each decision maker is established. By solving the optimization model, the priority weights of alternatives can be obtained. Finally, some illustrative examples are used to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
