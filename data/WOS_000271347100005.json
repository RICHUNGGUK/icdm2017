To improve the quality of web information retrieval, we propose a collaborative personalised search approach that makes an attempt to 'understand' and better satisfy the information needs for each and every searching user. We present a web information retrieval framework called Better Search and Sharing (BESS) that Captures user-system interactions, profiles them and induces personal interests that changes over time with an interest-change-driven profiling mechanism that is also extensively used for the co-evaluation of documents found valuable inside a specific search context by users with similar interests.", "paper_title": "Harnessing user contributions and dynamic profiling to better satisfy individual information search needs", "paper_id": "WOS:000271347100005"}
