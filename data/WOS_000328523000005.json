When most innovative designs are created collaboratively by a diverse team of researchers and technologists, patent knowledge management becomes time consuming with repeated efforts creating additional task conflicts. This research develops an intelligent recommendation methodology and system to enable timely and effective patent search prior, during, and after design collaboration to prevent potential infringement of existing intellectual property rights (IPR) and to secure new IPR for market advantage. The research develops an algorithm to dynamically search related patents in global patent databases. The system clusters users with similar patent search behaviors and, subsequently, infers new patent recommendations based on inter-cluster group member behaviors and characteristics. First, the methodology evaluates the filtered information obtained from collaborative patent searches. Second, the system clusters existing users and identifies users' neighbors based on the collaborative filtering algorithm. Using the clusters of users and their behaviors, the system recommends related patents. When collaborative design teams are planning R&D policies or searching patents and prior art claims to create new IP and prevent or settles IP legal disputes, the intelligent recommendation system identifies and recommends patents with greater efficiency and accuracy than previous systems and methods described in the literature.
