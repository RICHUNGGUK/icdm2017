Approximate closed-form solutions are derived for the systematic identification of micro-scale parameters from experimental observations. In the isotropic stress condition, the power relationship of the contact stiffness in the constant fabric condition manifests itself in the stress-level dependency of the clastic moduli. Numerical results relating to tile anisotropic stress condition indicate that a wide range of soil elasticity phenomena can be explained if one can account for the evolution of fabric anisotropy induced by the anisotropic stresses, together with tile nonlinearity of the contact stiffness. A simple equation of the stress ratio-fabric relationship is provided to capture the effect of the fabric evolution oil the elastic response. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
