Since it is a challenge to validate and optimise protective structures against blast loads using full-scale experimental tests, we have to turn our attention towards advanced numerical tools like the finite element method. Several different finite element techniques can be used to describe the response of structures due to blast loads. Some of these are: (1) a pure Lagrangian formulation, (2) an initial Eulerian simulation (to determine the load) followed by a Lagrangian simulation (for the structural response) and (3) a hybrid technique that combines the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to have a full coupling between the blast waves and the deformation of the structure. Ideally, all blast simulations should be carried out using the fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, but this may not be practical as the computational time increases considerably when going from a pure Lagrangian to a fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian simulation. A major goal in this study is to investigate if a pure Lagrangian formulation can be applied to determine the structural response in a specified blast load problem or if more advanced approaches such as the fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is required for reliable results. This is done by conducting numerical simulations of an unprotected 20 ft ISO container exposed to a blast load of 4000 kg TNT at 120 m standoff distance using the three different approaches presented above. To validate and discuss the results, the simulated response of the container is compared to available data from a full-scale blast test under such conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
