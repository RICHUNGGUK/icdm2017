The original anatomic data which encompasses morphological and geometrical knowledge was created from a whole-body set of 2 mm interval magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of a male volunteer and represented in stl format. The anatomic data was firstly discretized into spherical cells in equal size. Then the anisotropy of conduction velocity (CV) and conductivity were introduced into this model in definition of special conduction system. Nygren cell model was adopted to calculate the action potential (AP) waveform of each cell. Restitution of AP duration (APD) and it on CV were also introduced in this model. The pattern of activation propagation could be investigated on a perspective 3D scene after the excitation simulation. The isochronal map and the electrocardiograms (ECGs) were also produced. In this study. We used two experiments to verify this model as well as demonstrated its application in electrophysiological study: one was conducted under sinus rhythm, while in the other, two trains of boost pacings alternatively acted on the vena cava and the opening of the pulmonary vein. An identical excitation pattern described in previous studies was observed in first experiment. While in the second experiment, a foci triggered atrial fibrillation was seen on the epicardial surface. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
