The first is the integration of the Local Binary Pattern texture measure which extends the moving object detection work for light illumination changing. The second is the introduction of HSI color space measure which removes shadows for the background subtraction. The third contribution is a novel fuzzy way using the Choquet integral which improves detection accuracy. The experiment results using several dataset videos show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust moving object detection under complex background", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000018"}
