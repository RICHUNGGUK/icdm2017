The design approach consists of an evolutionary strategy based supervised training algorithm, newly developed by the authors, and the use of different biologically plausible neuronal models. A dynamic synapse (DS) based neuron model, a biologically more detailed model, and the spike response model (SRM) are investigated in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and to further our understanding of the computing capabilities of the nervous system. Unlike the conventional synapse, represented as a static entity with a fixed weight, employed in conventional and SRM-based neural networks, a DS is weightless and its strength changes upon the arrival of incoming input spikes. Therefore its efficacy depends on the temporal structure of the impinging spike trains. In the proposed approach, the training of the network free parameters is achieved using an evolutionary strategy where, instead of binary encoding, real values are used to encode the static and DS parameters which underlie the learning process. The results show that spiking neural networks based on both types of synapse are capable of learning non-linearly separable data by means of spatio-temporal encoding. Furthermore, a comparison of the obtained performance with classical neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) is presented.", "paper_title": "Advances in design and application of spiking neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241456100005"}
