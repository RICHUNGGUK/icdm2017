To make the whole pipeline robust and accurate, we mark the interested curves on the object to make them visually outstand from the background. Some specifically designed markers are distributed around the object as well. Followed by an automatic camera pose recovery and camera lens distortion correction step, a user-friendly semiautomatic method is put forward to extract the curves in the images. The curve correspondences in stereo image pairs are then optimally established and the 3D curve structures are recovered by using the stereo triangulation method. Experiments show that the method is applicable for reverse modeling of freeform objects with moderate accuracy requirements. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
