By efforts such as the Linking Open Data initiative, we finally find ourselves at the edge of a Web of Data becoming reality. Standards such as OWL 2, RIF and SPARQL 1.1 shall allow us to reason with and ask complex structured queries on this data, but still they do not play together smoothly and robustly enough to cope with huge amounts of noisy Web data. In this paper, we discuss open challenges relating to querying and reasoning with Web data and raise the question: can the burgeoning Web of Data ever catch up with the now ubiquitous HTML Web?", "paper_title": "Can we ever catch up with the Web?", "paper_id": "WOS:000209436300008"}
