Here, we introduce a novel 2D fingerprint design (property descriptor value range-derived fingerprint or PDR-FP) that involves activity-oriented selection of property descriptors and the transformation of descriptor value ranges into a binary format such that each fingerprint bit position represents a specific value interval. The design is tailored toward multiple-template similarity searching and permits training on specific activity classes. In search calculations on 15 compound classes of increasing structural diversity, the PDR fingerprint performed better than other state-of-the-art 2D fingerprints. Among the structurally diverse classes were six compound sets with peptide character, which represent a notoriously difficult chemotype for 2D similarity searching. In these cases, PDR-FP produced promising results, whereas other fingerprint methods mostly failed. PDR-FP is specifically designed for search calculations on structurally diverse compounds, and these calculations are not influenced by molecular size effects, which represent a general problem for similarity searching using bit string representations.", "paper_title": "Design and evaluation of a novel class-directed 2D fingerprint to search for structurally diverse active compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000242298100030"}
