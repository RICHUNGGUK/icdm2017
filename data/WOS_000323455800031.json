However, these issues as well as the solvability are less understood for networks with multiple multicast sessions. Recently, Wang and Shroff showed that the solvability of networks with two unit-rate multicast sessions (2-URMS) can be decided in polynomial time [4]. In this paper, we prove that for the 2-URMS networks: 1) the solvability can be determined with time O(vertical bar E vertical bar); 2) a solution can be constructed with time (vertical bar E vertical bar); 3) an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time; 4) the number of encoding links required to achieve a solution is upper-bounded by max {3, 2N-2}; and 5) the field size required to achieve a linear solution is upper-bounded by, max {2, left perpendicular root 2N - 7/4 + 1/2right perpendicular}, where vertical bar E vertical bar is the number of links and is the number of sinks of the underlying network. Both bounds are shown to be tight.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of Network Coding With Two Unit-Rate Multicast Sessions", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800031"}
