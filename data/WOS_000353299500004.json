This paper thus applies agency theory, the theory of planned behavior (TPB), perceived risk, and trust, to propose a research model for consumers' behavioral intention in using OIS. Empirical data was collected through a survey and analyzed using regression models. Results showed that constructs of perceived benefit, trust, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are related to behavioral intention to engage in OIS; consumer experience has a moderating role. Theoretically speaking, this study enriches and extends the original TPB by relating it to the emerging phenomenon of OIS behavior from the consumer's perspective. This study also offers important practical implications for OIS intermediaries and platforms that aim to better attract and serve existing and potential consumers.", "paper_title": "Investigation on the Factors Determining Consumers' Use of Online Intermediated Shopping (OIS): A Behavioral Intention Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000353299500004"}
