While the number of nodes of this AHNEP does not depend on the language, the other parameters of the network (rules, symbols, filters) depend on it. Since each AHNEP may be viewed as a problem solver as shown in [C. Martin-Vide, V. Mitrana, Networks of evolutionary processors: results and perspectives, in: Molecular Computational Models: Unconventional Approaches, Idea Group Publishing, Hershey, 2005, pp. 78-114], the later result may be interpreted as a method for solving every NP-problem in polynomial time by AHNEPs of constant size.
