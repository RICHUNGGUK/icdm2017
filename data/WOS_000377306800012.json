We show that due to the interference, the WIT system suffers from a loss of the degrees of freedom (DoF) proportional to the number of energy beams sent by the energy transmitter (ET), which, in general, needs to be larger than one to optimize the multiuser WET with user fairness consideration. To minimize the DoF loss in WIT, we further propose a new single-beam energy transmission scheme based on the principle of time sharing, where the ET transmits one of the optimal energy beams at each time. This new scheme achieves the same optimal performance for the WET system, and minimizes the impact of its interference to the WIT system.", "paper_title": "Multiuser MIMO Wireless Energy Transfer With Coexisting Opportunistic Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800012"}
