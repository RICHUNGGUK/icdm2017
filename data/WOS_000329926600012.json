Differentiating from existing results with common quadratic Lyapunov functions (CQLF) and leading to stability criteria restricted to finding a common matrix P, this work is based on the FQLF with multiple Pi and expects to attain some less conservative results. Furthermore, the proposed stability criteria will be directly formulated in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and they thus can readily be evaluated via current LMI solvers. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Relaxed stability issues for T-S fuzzy system: Based on a fuzzy quadratic Lyapunov function", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600012"}
