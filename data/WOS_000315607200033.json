Student-t component distributions are taken to capture the heavy tails typically encountered in such financial data. We design a mixture MT(m)-GARCH(p,q) volatility model for returns, and develop an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters. This includes formulation of proper temporal derivatives for the volatility parameters. The experiments with a low order MT(2)-GARCH(1,1) show that it yields results with improved statistical characteristics and economic performance compared to linear and nonlinear heavy-tail GARCH, as well as normal mixture GARCH. We demonstrate that our model leads to reliable Value-at-Risk performance in short and long trading positions across different confidence levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
