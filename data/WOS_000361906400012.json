Integrated watershed modeling is a suitable technique for this task, but it requires fully coupled investigation of radionuclide behavior in surface water, suspended sediment and subsurface aquifers. We developed a novel simulator for computing the spatiotemporal redistribution of fallout radionuclides in watersheds. The simulator was applied to an actual reservoir basin contaminated by fallout radionuclides from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011. As a result, the simulated Cs-137 concentration in bottom sediment showed a reasonably close match with the measurement data. The distribution coefficient of Cs-137 consistent with the latest measurement data was identified as being at least 400,000 L/kg, and it was estimated that more than 90% of the total Cs-137 distributed in the fallout remains in the catchment area.
