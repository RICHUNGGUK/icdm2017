Previous works have exploited epipolar tangents to locate frontier points on spheres for estimating the epipolar geometry. It is shown in this paper that other than the frontier points, two additional point features can be obtained by considering the bitangent envelopes of a pair of spheres. A simple method for locating the images of such point features and the sphere centers is presented. An algorithm for recovering the fundamental matrix in a plane plus parallax representation using these recovered image points and the epipolar tangents from three spheres is developed. A new formulation of the absolute dual quadric as a cone tangent to a dual sphere with the plane at infinity being its vertex is derived. This allows the recovery of the absolute dual quadric, which is used to upgrade the weak calibration to a full calibration. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and the high precision achieved by our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Stratified Approach for Camera Calibration Using Spheres", "paper_id": "WOS:000286387700001"}
