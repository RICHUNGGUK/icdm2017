However, we discover that there is serious vulnerability in terms of worm propagation in IPv6 and IPv4-IPv6 dual-stack networks. It is shown in this article that a new worm can collect the IPv6 addresses of all running hosts in a local subnet very quickly, leading to accelerated worm propagation. Similar to modeling the self-replicating behaviors of biological viruses, a Species-Patch model and a discrete-time simulator are developed to study how the dual-stack worm spreads in networks with various topologies. It is shown that the worm could propagate in the IPv6 and IPv4-IPv6 dual-stack networks much faster than in the current IPv4 Internet. Several effective defense strategies focusing on network deployment are proposed.", "paper_title": "A New Worm Exploiting IPv6 and IPv4-IPv6 Dual-Stack Networks: Experiment, Modeling, Simulation, and Defense", "paper_id": "WOS:000270548500004"}
