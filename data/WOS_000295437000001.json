It allows a group of robots to move as a unique entity performing the following functions: obstacle avoidance at group level, speed control and modification of the inter-robot distance. Its flocking controller is distributed among the robots, allowing them to move in the desired common direction and maintain a desired inter-robot distance. The framework is made up of different modules that modify the behavior of the group thus allowing different functions. They are based on consensus algorithms that allow the robots to agree on different parameters, taking into account which robot has more relevant information. New modules can be easily designed and incorporated into the framework in order to augment its capabilities. It can be easily implemented on any mobile robot capable of measuring the relative positions of neighboring robots and communicating with them. It has been successfully tested using 8 real robots and in simulation with up to 40 robots, demonstrating experimentally its scalability with an increasing number of robots. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
