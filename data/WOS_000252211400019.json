In this paper, we propose a FGPSO method based on GPU-acceleration, which maps a parallel PSO algorithm to texture-rendering on consumer-level graphics cards. The analytical results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the population size, speeds up its execution and provides ordinary users with a feasible FGPSO solution.", "paper_title": "An efficient fine-grained parallel particle swarm optimization method based on gpu-acceleration", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400019"}
