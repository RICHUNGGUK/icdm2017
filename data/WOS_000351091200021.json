Although virtual surgical planning has been utilized in preoperative decision making, current software designs require manual operation and a trial-and-error process to refine the reconstruction plan. We have developed volumetric fibular transfer simulation software that can quickly design a preoperative plan based on direct volume manipulation and quantitative comparison with the patient's original mandible. We propose three quantitative shape indicators-volume ratio, contour error, and maximum projection-for symmetrical lesions of the mandible, and have implemented a parallel computation algorithm for the semiautomatic placement of fibular segments. Using this virtual planning software, we conducted a retrospective study of the computed tomography data from nine patients. We found that combining direct volume manipulation with real-time local search of placement improved the applicability of the planning system to optimize mandibular reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Volumetric Fibular Transfer Planning With Shape-Based Indicators in Mandibular Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200021"}
