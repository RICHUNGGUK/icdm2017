Recent database replication protocols have been designed using SI replicas where transactions are firstly executed in a delegate replica and their updates (if any) are propagated to the rest of the replicas at commit time; i.e. they follow the Read One Write All (ROWA) approach. This paper provides a formalization that shows the correctness of abstract protocols which cover these replication proposals. These abstract protocols differ in the properties demanded for achieving a global SI level and those needed for its generalized SI (GSI) variant - allowing reads from old snapshots. Additionally, we propose two more relaxed properties that also ensure a global GS! level. Thus, some applications can further optimize their performance in a replicated system while obtaining GSI.
