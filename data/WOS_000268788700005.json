To discuss and explain the basic scientific problems in software trustworthiness and to establish theoretical foundations for software trustworthiness measurement, combining the ideas of dynamical system study, this paper studies evolutionary laws of software trustworthiness and the dynamical mechanism under the effect of various internal and external factors, and proposes dynamical models for software trustworthiness, thus, software trustworthiness can be considered as the statistical characteristics of behaviors of software systems in the dynamical and open environment. By analyzing two simple examples, the paper explains the relationship between the limit evolutionary behaviors of software trustworthiness attributes and dynamical system characteristics, and interprets the dynamical characteristics of software trustworthiness and their evolutionary complexity.", "paper_title": "Dynamical characteristics of software trustworthiness and their evolutionary complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000268788700005"}
