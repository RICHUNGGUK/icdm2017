P-splines are represented as mixed models to give a unified approach to the model estimation procedure. First, a model where the spatial variation is modelled by a two-dimensional P-spline at the centroids of the areas or regions is considered. In addition, individual area-effects are incorporated as random effects to account for individual variation among regions. Finally, the model is extended by considering a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure for the random effects, these are the so called \"Smooth-CAR\" models, with the aim of separating the large-scale geographical trend, and local spatial correlation. The methodology proposed is applied to the analysis of lip cancer incidence rates in Scotland. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
