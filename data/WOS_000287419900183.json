The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between ocean wave energy and meteorological variables such as wind speed, air temperature, and sea temperature. It was shown that fuzzy logic modeling of these variables provides the possible non-linear relationship between them and consequently the wave energy can be predicted including the possible uncertainties in the system behavior. Compared to traditional approaches, fuzzy logic is more efficient in linking the multiple inputs to a single output in a non-linear manner. Here Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type fuzzy inference system was employed to predict wave energy amount from meteorological variables in the absence of wave records. For the application of the proposed approach the offshore stations located in the Pacific Ocean were used. The results were compared with the classical wave energy equation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
