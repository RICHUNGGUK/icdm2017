Let C-n be the cycle and P-n(6,6) be the graph obtained from two copies of C-6 joined by a path of order n - 10. Let l(n) be the class of bicyclic graphs which have exact two edge-disjoint cycles satisfying that one is even, the other is odd. In [I. Gutman, D. Vidovie, Quest for molecular graphs with maximal energy: a computer experiment, J. Chem. Inf. Sci. 41(2001),1002-1005.], Gutman and Vidovie conjectured that the bicyclic graph with maximal energy is Pn(6,6), for n = 14 and n >= 16. Recently, Huo et al. proved that the assertion is true for bipartite bicyclic graphs. In the paper, we first show that for the graphs in l(n) the coefficients of characteristic polynomials have uniform sign. Besides, we extend the correctness of the assertion from bipartite bicyclic graphs to C-n.", "paper_title": "An Approach to the Problem of the Maximal Energy of Bicyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000312622900007"}
