Jager (2005) [11] proposes a type logical treatment of anaphora with syntactic duplication using limited contraction. Morrill and Valentin (2010) [24] apply (modal) displacement calculus to anaphora with lexical duplication and propose extension with a negation as failure in conjunction with additives to capture binding conditions. In this paper we present an account of anaphora developing characteristics and employing machinery from both of these proposals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
