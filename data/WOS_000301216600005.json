An algorithm is developed which generates the minimal complete set of Pareto-optimal solutions. This algorithm runs in polynomial time as long as the single objective problem considering only the cost function can be solved polynomially. A reoptimization procedure is used to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Applications are given. Computational results on randomly generated instances and planar grid graphs concerning the minimum cost spanning tree and the shortest path problem are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
