Compared to already available control schemes, the proposed controller is very simple to derive and implement; however, it is established on a strong mathematical approach based on the knowledge of the system model. The required converter voltage in each sampling period is directly calculated based on reference and measured values of reactive and active powers, system parameters, and the measured voltage of AC source. Then, the reference voltage is synthesized by a PWM block. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing precise power control with minimum distortion and harmonic noises (THDi), and at the same time, low distortion in active and reactive powers.", "paper_title": "A Simple and Efficient Control Strategy for Four-Switch Three-Phase Power Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000275458900009"}
