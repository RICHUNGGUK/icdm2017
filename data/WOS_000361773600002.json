It has been argued in the literature that the least-squares formulation is a unified method for the approximate solution of differential equations governing diverse areas in engineering and science. In particular, it has been argued that the least-squares method is suited for first-order differential operators. To investigate this, five numerical test problems have been constructed. The least-squares method showed rather poor numerical accuracy for the solution of a chemical process operated in a fixed packed bed reactor. The classical orthogonal collocation and tau formulations showed superior numerical accuracy to that of the least-squares method for this problem. For other test cases, i.e. first-order ordinary differential equation and finite-element solution of a one-dimensional advection equation with a sharp gradient in the solution, the least-squares method obtained better numerical results than the orthogonal collocation and tau methods. The least-squares method is not necessarily the better choice for advection dominated problems as a number of different problems favor the orthogonal collocation and/or tau methods. However, for the advective terms of some problems the least-squares method can be used to stabilize the Galerkin discretization. The choice of the better approximation method for an advection dominated problem is case dependent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
