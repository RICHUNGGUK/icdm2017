This problem was introduced by Canny to answer connectivity questions and solve motion planning problems. Given s polynomial equations with rational coefficients, of degree D in n variables, Canny's algorithm has a Monte Carlo cost of s(n) log(s)D(O(n2)) operations in Q; a deterministic version runs in time s(n) log(s)D(O(n4)). A subsequent improvement was due to Basu, Pollack, and Roy, with an algorithm of deterministic cost s(d+1)D(O(n2)) for the more general problem of computing roadmaps of a semi-algebraic set (d <= n is the dimension of an associated object). We give a probabilistic algorithm of complexity (nD)(O(n1.5)) for the problem of computing a roadmap of a closed and bounded hypersurface V of degree D in n variables, with a finite number of singular points. Even under these extra assumptions, no previous algorithm featured a cost better than D(O(n2)).", "paper_title": "A Baby Steps/Giant Steps Probabilistic Algorithm for Computing Roadmaps in Smooth Bounded Real Hypersurface", "paper_id": "WOS:000286464900008"}
