However, the existing technologies, which usually take a long time or require a high cost, cannot support a system and common solution. In this paper, we propose an application-customized common platform for wireless vehicular sensor networks. The common platform can provide us with a friendly web-based user interface, so as to make deploying or reprogramming a running field application in VeSANs become very convenient, simple, and efficient. According to the requirements of the common platform and the presented architecture model, we have implemented the common platform in both hardware and software. The in-field experiment and the test results show that the platform is available for the developing and deploying of WSNs for different applications.", "paper_title": "On Application-Customized Common Platform for Wireless Vehicular Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333588000001"}
