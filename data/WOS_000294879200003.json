As Cloud computing becomes emergent for the Anything as a Service (XaaS) paradigm, modern real-time services also become available through Cloud computing. In this work, we investigate power-aware provisioning of virtual machines for real-time services. Our approach is (i) to model a real-time service as a real-time virtual machine request; and (ii) to provision virtual machines in Cloud data centers using dynamic voltage frequency scaling schemes. We propose several schemes to reduce power consumption by hard real-time services and power-aware profitable provisioning of soft real-time services.
