The authors studied the cases of an infinite and a finite energy queue at the primary transmitter. However, the results of the finite case are incorrect. We show that under the proposed energy queue model (a decoupled M/D/1 queueing system with Bernoulli arrivals and the consumption of one energy packet per time slot), the energy queue capacity does not affect the stability region of the network.", "paper_title": "Comments on \"Optimal Utilization of a Cognitive Shared Channel with a Rechargeable Primary Source Node\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000358260700007"}
