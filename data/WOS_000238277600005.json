These quantities are: the sojourn times and waiting times of all the customers in the busy period, the busy period length and the number of customers served in a busy period. Since the evolution of the total workload process between two successive customer arrivals is deterministic, this work gives statistic of the complete evolution of the workload process within a busy period.", "paper_title": "A direct approach to sojourn times in a busy period of an M/M/1 queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000238277600005"}
