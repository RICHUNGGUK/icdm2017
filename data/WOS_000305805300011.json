Various visual sensor platforms have been developed with the aim of integrating visual data to wireless sensor applications. The objective of this article is to survey current visual sensor platforms according to in-network processing and compression/coding techniques together with their targeted applications. Characteristics of these platforms such as level of integration, data processing hardware, energy dissipation, radios and operating systems are also explored and discussed.", "paper_title": "A survey of visual sensor network platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300011"}
