In such applications, heat and power demands fluctuate on an hourly basis due to changing weather conditions, time-of-day factors and consumer requirements. Plant energy efficiency is highly dependent on ambient temperature and operating load since equipment efficiencies are nonlinear functions of these parameters. In operational planning strategies, nonlinear equipment characteristics are seldom taken into account, resulting in plants being operated at sub-par efficiencies. In order to operate plants at highest possible efficiencies, scheduling strategies which take into account nonlinear equipment characteristics need to be developed. For such strategies, a mixed 0-1 nonlinear programming formulation is proposed. The problem is nonconvex and hence global optimality conditions are unknown. Classical techniques like branch-and-bound may not produce integer feasible solutions, may cut off the global optima and have an exponential increase in CPU time for a linear increase in planning horizon size. As an alternative, a solution method through genetic algorithms is proposed in which genetic search is applied only on 0-1 variables and gradient search is applied on continuous variables. The proposed method is a nonlinear extension of the one originally developed by Sakawa et al. [Sakawa M, Kato K, Ushiro S. Operational planning of district heating and cooling plants through genetic algorithms for mixed 0-1 linear programming. Eur J Operat Res 2002;137(3):677-87]. Numerical experiments show the proposed genetic algorithm method is more consistent in finding integer feasible solutions, finds solutions with lower optimality gaps and has reasonable CPU time as compared to branch-and-bound. From an application perspective, the proposed scheduling strategy results in 5-11% increase in plant energy efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
