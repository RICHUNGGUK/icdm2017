We formulate the problem as a difference of convex functions problem. Using conjugate duality, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between their respective critical points and minima. We then apply a subgradient algorithm to approximate those critical points and obtain an efficient heuristic to verify non-copositivity of a matrix.", "paper_title": "Testing copositivity with the help of difference-of-convex optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000323736500003"}
