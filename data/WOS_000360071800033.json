It has been tested in different contexts, which span from home entertainment to surgical environments. Nonetheless, to promote its adoption to solve real-world problems, the Kinect should be evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy. Up to now, some filtering approaches have been proposed to enhance the precision and accuracy of the Kinect sensor, and preliminary studies have shown promising results. In this work, we discuss the results of a study in which we have compared the most commonly used filtering approaches for Kinect depth data, in both static and dynamic contexts, by using novel metrics. The experimental results show that each approach can be profitably used to enhance the precision and/or accuracy of Kinect depth data in a specific context, whereas the temporal filtering approach is able to reduce noise in different experimental conditions.", "paper_title": "Comparative evaluation of methods for filtering Kinect depth data", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071800033"}
