The general self-calibration methods (modulus constraint, Kruppa equations) are known to fail with this camera motion. In this paper we give two novel linear constraints on the coordinates of the plane at infinity in a projective reconstruction for any camera motion. In the planar case, we show that the two constraints are equivalent and easy to compute, giving us a linear version of the quartic modulus constraint. Using this fact, we present a new linear method to solve the self-calibration problem with planar motion of the camera from three or more images.", "paper_title": "A new linear method for camera self-calibration with planar motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000243465400007"}
