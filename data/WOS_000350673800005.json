In this paper, a lower bound on average Hamming auto- and cross correlations of an FHS set is derived. It generalizes and improves the lower bound proposed recently by Peng, Niu and Tang. A simple necessary and sufficient condition for an FHS set to meet the new bound is given. Based on this condition, two classes of FHS sets whose average Hamming correlations reach the proposed bound are introduced.", "paper_title": "A LOWER BOUND ON THE AVERAGE HAMMING CORRELATION OF FREQUENCY-HOPPING SEQUENCE SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000350673800005"}
