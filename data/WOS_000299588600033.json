The QDFA method can learn an optimal feature aggregation function for a multi-example query, which takes into account multiple features and multiple examples with different importance. The experiments demonstrate that the QDFA method outperforms three other feature aggregation methods.", "paper_title": "QDFA: Query-Dependent Feature Aggregation for Medical Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588600033"}
