In this regard, we generalize (Davvaz and Khan in Inform Sci 181:1759-1770 2011) and define (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q(k))-fuzzy generalized bi-ideals in ordered semigroups, which is a generalization of the concept of an (alpha, beta)-fuzzy generalized bi-ideal in an ordered semi-group. We also define (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q(k))-fuzzy left (resp. right)ideals. Using these concept, some characterization theorems of regular, left (resp. right) regular, completely regular and weakly regular ordered semigroups are provided. The upper/lower parts of an (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q(k))-fuzzy generalized bi-ideal and (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q(k))-fuzzy left (resp. right)-ideal are given, and some characterizations are provided.", "paper_title": "Ordered semigroups characterized by (is an element of, is an element of boolean OR q(k))-fuzzy generalized bi-ideals", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800013"}
