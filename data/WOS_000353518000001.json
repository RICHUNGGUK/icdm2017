Geocast, delivering messages to a few specific areas, has become an important issue with the accelerating development of the location-based services in vehicular networks. Different from the conventional geocast schemes focusing on the static target areas, in this paper, we propose a content-based mobile tendency geocast (CMTG) routing protocol for urban vehicular networks from the delay tolerant networks (DTNs) perspective to better deal with the high mobility and transient connectivity issues. The target roads of dissemination depend on the preferred tendency and path of message, based on the determination to the message's expected propagating roads. And vehicle decides whether to relay the messages carried to other encountered vehicles by calculating the mobile tendency to the source location of message. The robustness and adaptability of protocol are also proved theoretically. Extensive performance comparisons with other protocols are conducted to show the advantages of CMTG.", "paper_title": "CMTG: A Content-Based Mobile Tendency Geocast Routing Protocol in Urban Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000353518000001"}
