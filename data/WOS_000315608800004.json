First, the linear stability of the axi-symmetric collision flow is analyzed numerically by solving the nonlinear, axi-symmetric basic flow and the linearized, 3-d disturbance equations simultaneously. The basic flow is linearly stable for the Reynolds number Re-Gamma = 1955, but exhibits algebraic growth phases. Then the fully nonlinear equations are solved for the Reynolds numbers Re-Gamma = 1806.91, Re-Gamma = 2701.82 and the same but enhanced initial disturbances. It is shown that the two vortex rings mutually expand in diameter with the subsequent formation of instabilities along the circumference of the resultant, compound vortex ring. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
