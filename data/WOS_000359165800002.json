A recent e-cash protocol by P. Sarkar, purported to be a suitable replacement to the now popular Bitcoin system, claims strong security properties, but offers no formal proof of security. In this paper we completely cryptanalyze Sarkar's protocol, showing how it fails to satisfy each of its claimed security properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
