CAVIAR uses the asychronous address-event representation (AER) communication framework and was developed in the context of a European Union funded project. It has four custom mixed-signal AER chips, five custom digital AER interface components, 45k neurons (spiking cells), up to 5M synapses, performs 12G synaptic operations per second, and achieves millisecond object recognition and tracking latencies.", "paper_title": "CAVIAR: A 45k Neuron, 5M Synapse, 12G Connects/s AER Hardware Sensory-Processing-Learning-Actuating System for High-Speed Visual Object Recognition and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000269518200004"}
