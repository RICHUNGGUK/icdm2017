Several years later, Common Cartridge (CC) is proposed as an enhancement of SCORM offering more flexibility and addressing needs not originally envisioned, namely assessment and web 2.0 standards, content authorization, collaborative forums, outcomes reporting, accessibility. Educational policy makers, specialists responsible for learning systems deployment, educational content authors and teachers committed to the learning object paradigm must opt for or coexist with two different, partially overlapping proposals for content packaging. While SCORM was conceived for self-paced computer based learning, Common Cartridge attempts at providing support for all forms of teaching and learning with a stress on interactive and collaborative environments., Variety of content, distributed content, discussion forums, assessment, student's tracking, interaction with external tools and authorization to access resources are listed as its main enhancements. This article reviews and compares SCORM and Common Cartridge from an educational perspective, seeking to provide some ground and guidelines on how to stand before these proposals. A simple process for authoring a Common Cartridge is described, as well as testing and conversion from SCORM. Suggestions are made to education practitioners on learning objects standards adoption in the most common scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
