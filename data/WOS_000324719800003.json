Several key components, such as pistons, the swash plate and the control valve, are modeled and discussed for analysis of the flow and pressure fluctuations. The structure, parameters and the location of the attenuator is investigated. The attenuator can adjust itself to keep its performance when the pump parameters changes within a certain range. The attenuator is also small enough to be integrated into the pump. Test results show that pressure fluctuation can be reduced with up to 80%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
