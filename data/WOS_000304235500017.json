Many signals and natural images, for example under the wavelet basis, have very sparse representations, thus those signals and images can be recovered from a small amount of measurements with very high accuracy. This paper is concerned with the dimensionality reduction problem based on the compressive assumptions. We propose novel unsupervised and semi-supervised dimensionality reduction algorithms by exploiting sparse data representations. The experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
