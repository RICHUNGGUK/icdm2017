These attacks are unique as they are closely related and must be performed in order, one after another. They break the untraceability, confidentiality and mutual authentication properties of the protocol, and show, for the first time, that breaking the privacy property may lead to attacks on the security properties of radio frequency identification (RFID) authentication protocols. Finally, we present a countermeasure to fix the flaws and make a brief security analysis of the improved protocol.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of Kulseng et al.'s mutual authentication protocol for RFID systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312962100001"}
