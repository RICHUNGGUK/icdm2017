The insights that were afforded through this formalism have led to the development of the granular computing (GrC) paradigm in the late 1990s. Subsequent research has highlighted the fact that many founding principles of GrC have, in fact, been adopted in other information-processing paradigms and, indeed, in the context of various scientific methodologies. This study expands on our earlier research exploring the foundations of GrC and casting it as a structured combination of algorithmic and non-algorithmic information processing that mimics human, intelligent synthesis of knowledge from information.", "paper_title": "Toward a theory of granular computing for human-centered information processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500005"}
