The total interference power received at the primary receiver is constrained to maintain reliable communication for the PU. An interference channel configuration is considered for ad hoc networking, where the receivers treat the interference from undesired transmitters as noise. Without the CR constraint, a convergent distributed algorithm is developed to obtain (at least) a locally optimal solution. With the CR constraint, a semidistributed algorithm is introduced. An alternative centralized algorithm based on geometric programming and network duality is also developed. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. The novel approach is flexible to accommodate modifications aiming at interference alignment. However, the stand-alone weighted sum-rate optimal schemes proposed here have merits over interference-alignment alternatives especially for practical SNR values.", "paper_title": "Optimal Resource Allocation for MIMO Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300035"}
