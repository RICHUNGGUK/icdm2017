Nevertheless, the LBS can lead to user privacy breach due to sharing location information with potentially malicious services. A high degree of location privacy preservation for LBS is extremely required. In this paper, a clustering K-anonymity scheme for location privacy preservation (namely CK) is proposed. The CK scheme does not rely on a trusted third party to anonymize the location information of users. In CK scheme, the whole area that all the users reside is divided into clusters recursively in order to get cloaked area. The exact location information of the user is replaced by the cloaked spatial temporal boundary (STB) including K users. The user can adjust the resolution of location information with spatial or temporal constraints to meet his personalized privacy requirement. The experimental results show that CK can provide stringent privacy guarantees, strong robustness and high QoS (Quality of Service).", "paper_title": "A Clustering K-Anonymity Scheme for Location Privacy Preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588600015"}
