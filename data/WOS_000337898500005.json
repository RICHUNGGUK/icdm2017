Whereas it is known that humans can perceive affect in voice, movement, music and even as little as point light displays, it is not clear how humans develop this skill. Is it innate? If not, how does this emotional intelligence develop in infants? The MEI robot develops these skills through vocal input and perceptual mapping of vocal features to other modalities. We base MEI's development on the idea that motherese is used as a way to associate dynamic vocal contours to facial emotion from an early age. MEI uses these dynamic contours to both understand and express multimodal emotions using a unified model called SIRE (Speed, Intensity, irRegularity, and Extent). Offline experiments with MEI support its cross-modal generalization ability: a model trained with voice data can recognize happiness, sadness, and fear in a completely different modality-human gait. User evaluations of the MEI robot speaking, gesturing and walking show that it can reliably express multimodal happiness and sadness using only the voice-trained model as a basis.", "paper_title": "The MEI Robot: Towards Using Motherese to Develop Multimodal Emotional Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000337898500005"}
