We present a set of new algorithms to render line-art illustrations of dynamic and specular (reflective and refractive) surfaces. We first introduce a real-time principal direction estimation algorithm to determine the line stroke directions on dynamic opaque objects using neighboring normal ray triplets. To render reflections or refractions in a line-art style, we develop a stroke direction propagation algorithm by using multi-perspective projections to propagate the stroke directions from the nearby opaque objects onto specular surfaces. Finally, we present an image-space stroke mapping method to draw line strokes using the computed or propagated stroke directions. We implement these algorithms using a GPU and demonstrate real-time illustrations of scenes with dynamic and specular 3D models in line-art styles.", "paper_title": "Line-art Illustration of Dynamic and Specular Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100050"}
