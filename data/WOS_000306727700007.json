As an alternative approach, high-performance systems are increasingly integrating multi-core processors and heterogeneous accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. However, usage of such hybrid systems has been limited largely to device experts due to significantly increased application design complexity. To enable more transparent usage of hybrid systems, we introduce elastic computing, which is an optimization framework where application designers invoke specialized elastic functions that contain a knowledge-base of implementation alternatives and parallelization strategies. For each elastic function, a collection of optimization tools analyze numerous possible implementations which enables dynamic and transparent optimization for different resources and run-time parameters. In this paper, we present the enabling technologies of elastic computing, and evaluate those technologies on four different hybrid systems, including the Novo-G FPGA supercomputer. The results include detailed case studies of using elastic computing for time-domain convolution and sum of absolute difference image retrieval, which achieved speedups up to 206x.
