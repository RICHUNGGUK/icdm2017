Thus, the authors developed the analysis of magnetic resonance signal intensity distribution (AMRSID) method to analyse the 3D distribution of the T2-weighted MR signal intensity within the IVD using normalised histograms, weighted centres and volume ratios. The objective was to assess the sensitivity of the AMRSID method to the segmentation process and data normalisation. Repetition of the semi-automatic segmentation by the same operator did not influence the quality of the contour or our new MR distribution parameters whereas the skills of the operator influenced only the MR distribution parameters, and the instructions given prior to the segmentation influenced both the quality of the contour and the MR distribution parameters. Bone normalisation produces an index that jointly highlights IVD and bone health, whereas cerebrospinal fluid normalisation only suppresses the effect of the acquisition gain. This robust AMRSID method has the potential to improve the diagnostic with earlier biomarkers and the prognosis of evolution.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity of MRI signal distribution within the intervertebral disc to image segmentation and data normalisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334487900009"}
