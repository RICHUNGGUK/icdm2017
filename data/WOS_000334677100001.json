The basic idea beyond these algorithms is the removal of vertical and/or horizontal paths of pixels (i.e., seams) containing low salient information. In this paper, we present a method which exploits the gradient vector flow (GVF) of the image to establish the paths to be considered during the resizing. The relevance of each GVF path is straightforward derived from an energy map related to the magnitude of the GVF associated to the image to be resized. To make more relevant, the visual content of the images during the content-aware resizing, we also propose to select the generated GVF paths based on their visual saliency properties. In this way, visually important image regions are better preserved in the final resized image. The proposed technique has been tested, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by considering a representative data set of 1000 images labeled with corresponding salient objects (i.e., ground-truth maps). Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves crucial salient regions better than other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Saliency-Based Selection of Gradient Vector Flow Paths for Content Aware Image Resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334677100001"}
