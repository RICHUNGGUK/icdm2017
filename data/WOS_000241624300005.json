However, traditional association rule is relatively weak in semantic representation. To address it, the main contributions of this paper included: (1) proposing formal concepts on h-Dimensional Enhanced Semantic Association Rule (h-DESAR) with self-contained logic operator; (2) proposing the h-DESAR mining method based on Immune-based Gene Expression Programming (ERIG); (3) presenting some novel key techniques in ERIG. Experimental results showed that ERIG is feasible, effective and stable.", "paper_title": "Mining h-Dimensional Enhanced Semantic Association Rule based on immune-based gene expression programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300005"}
