This paper contributes to the use of numerical integration to study the kinetic behavior of enzyme reactions, and describes the implementation and management of a new computing environment called PM-w2011 to simulate the kinetics of any enzyme system. This program emphasizes the graphical presentation of progress curves and features numerous display options and different formats for generating graphics files. From the differential equations describing the enzyme system under study, this computer application performs their integration by numerical methods, covers most of the requirements needed to facilitate the tasks of those who investigate the kinetics of enzymes, and even allows simultaneous studies based on the variation of any system parameter. PM-w2011 has been developed using Microsoft's NET (C# and C++) technology and has been designed for any current MS-Windows operating system version: XP, Vista or 7.
