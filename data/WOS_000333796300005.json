One of the key challenges for these systems is to compensate for the friction, which is particularly difficult to model at low velocities. The frequency-domain HOSIDF modeling framework is used to assist in designing a feedforward compensator. Experiments with a laboratory benchmark system (gimballed camera platform) prove the technique useful. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
