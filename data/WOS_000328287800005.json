Various corrosion cells with different concrete compositions under four different environmental conditions (air dry, submerged, 95% R. H and alternate wetting-drying) have been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. The results of these laboratory tests were utilized with an automated computer-aided simulation model. This model based on mass and energy stabilization through the porous media for the corrosion processwas coupled with modified stabilization methodology. By this coupling, it was possible to predict, maintain and transfer the influence of oxygen concentration on the corrosion rate of the reinforcement in concrete under various defined conditions satisfactorily. The variation in oxygen concentration available for corrosion reaction has been taken into account simulating the actual field conditions such as by varying concrete cover depth, relative humidity, water-cement ratio etc. The modeling task has been incorporated by the use of a computer based durability model as a finite element computational approach for stabilizing the effect of oxygen on corrosion of reinforced concrete structures.", "paper_title": "Computer based FEM stabilization of oxygen transport model for material and energy simulation in corroding reinforced concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000328287800005"}
