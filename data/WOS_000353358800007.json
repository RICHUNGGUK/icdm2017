It was implemented without any inductor and offers a differential output for balun use. Noise canceling and linearity boosting techniques were combined to improve the amplifier performance in such a way that they can be separately optimized. Linearity was improved using diode-connected transistors. The amplifier was implemented in a 130 nm CMOS process in a compact 136 mu m x 71 mu m area. Simulations are presented for post-layout schematics for two classes of design: one for best linearity, another for best noise figure (NF). When optimized for best linearity, simulation results achieve a voltage gain > 23.7 dB (power gain > 19.1 dB), a NF < 3.6 dB over the entire band (with 2.4 dB min figure), an input third-order intercept point (IIP3) > 3.3 dBm (7.6 dBm max.) and an input power reflection coefficient S (11) <-16 dB. When optimized for best NF, it achieves a voltage gain > 24.7 dB (power gain > 19.8 dB), a NF < 2 dB over the entire band, an IIP3 >-0.3 dBm and an S (11) <-11 dB. Monte Carlo simulation results confirm low sensitivity to process variations. Also a low sensitivity to temperature within the range -55 to 125 A degrees C was observed for Gain, NF and S11. Power consumption is 18 mW under a 1.2 V supply.", "paper_title": "High linearity 24 dB gain wideband inductorless balun low-noise amplifier for IEEE 802.22 band", "paper_id": "WOS:000353358800007"}
