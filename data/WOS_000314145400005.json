We propose to use Sobel- and interpolation-based masks to extract more accurate gradient information in the color difference domain. The extracted gradient information is utilized to assist the design of the proposed demosaicing algorithm. By experimenting on more than one thousand and three hundred test DTDI mosaic images, the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed demosaicing algorithm in terms of demosaiced image quality.
