This scheme utilizes neuro-fuzzy system to derive a proper set of contour pixels based on multi-scale images. We use these fuzzy derivatives to develop a new curve evolution model. The model automatically detect smooth boundaries, scaling the energy term, and change of topology according to the extracted contour pixels set. We present the numerical implementation and the experimental results based on the semi-implicit method. Experimental results show that one can obtains a high quality edge contour.", "paper_title": "A multi-scale scheme for image segmentation using neuro-fuzzy classification and curve evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000075"}
