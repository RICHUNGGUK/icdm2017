Here, a neural network is considered as a part of a large field called neural computing or soft computing. Moreover, in order to find the approximate parameters, a simple algorithm from the cost function of the fuzzy neural network is proposed. Finally, we illustrate our approach by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of fully fuzzy regression models by fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800011"}
