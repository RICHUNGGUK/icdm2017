Our proposed method is more accurate than other such methods in appearance-only simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Compared to position-invariant robust features [1], it is also more suitable for low-cost, single lens cameras with narrow fields of view. Testing our method in an outdoor environment at Shibuya Station. We captured images using a conventional hand-held single-lens video camera. These environments of experiments are public environments without any planned landmarks. Results have shown that the proposed method accurately obtains matches for two visual-feature sets and that stable, accurate SLAM is achieved in dynamic public environments.", "paper_title": "A Robust Visual-Feature-Extraction Method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping in Public Outdoor Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200002"}
