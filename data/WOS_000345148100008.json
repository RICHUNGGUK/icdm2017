The research uses the Expectation Confirmation Theory and Technology Acceptance Model as theoretical foundations to develop a model to achieve this aim. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a cross-sectional survey research design approach. An online marketplace web site that connects buyers and sellers in Malaysia serves as the research context. Data were collected using convenience approach. Findings - Results suggest satisfaction contributes to individual online shopping continuance intention. Consistent with extant research, perceived usefulness of web site links to online shopping continuance intention. Contrary to past findings, perceived ease of web site use does not directly contribute to online shopping continuance intention. Individual's price-oriented lifestyle, perceived ease of web site use and usefulness contributed to individual's satisfaction with online shopping experience. People with time-oriented, net-oriented and price-oriented lifestyles and preference for a web site contribute to perceived ease of web site use. Extraverts have online shopping intention while emotional stability moderates the relationship between perceived usefulness of web site and satisfaction in online shopping. Originality/value - Findings aid web service provider and internet retailers when explaining individual continuance intention of online shopping. This research advances understanding of the role of satisfaction, perceived ease of web site use and perceived web site usefulness regarding online shopping continuance intention. The research also sheds light on individual attributes as contributors to online shopping experience, continuance and perceptions of web site.", "paper_title": "Insights into individual's online shopping continuance intention", "paper_id": "WOS:000345148100008"}
