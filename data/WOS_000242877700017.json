However, the interfaces of mobile applications are often unnatural due to limited computational capability, miniaturized input/output controls, and so on. To complement the poor user interface (UI) and fully utilize mobility as feature of mobile devices, we explore possibilities for a new UI of mobile devices. This paper describes the method for recognizing and analyzing a user's continuous action including the user's various gestures and postures. The application example we created is mobile game called AM-Fishing game on mobile devices that employ the accelerometer as the main interaction modality. The demonstration shows the evaluation for the system usability.", "paper_title": "Recognizing and analyzing of user's continuous action in mobile systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242877700017"}
