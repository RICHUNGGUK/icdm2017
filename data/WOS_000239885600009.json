Our method is symbolic-numeric: we produce a new polynomial system which has the original multiple solution as a regular root. Using standard bases, a tool for the symbolic computation of multiplicities, we show that the number of deflation stages is bounded by the multiplicity of the isolated root. Our implementation performs well on a large class of applications. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
