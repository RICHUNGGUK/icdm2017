A first set of criteria is formulated for the purpose of comparing and ranking rehabilitation projects. Each proposed criterion is a measure of a particular impact of the condition of a pipe. The ELECTRE TRI method is implemented for defining rehabilitation priorities. Two reference profiles are used to define the limits of three categories associated with three increasing priority levels. With these two reference profiles, applying the ELECTRE TRI method to an asset stock (a set of pipes that are candidates for rehabilitation) means assigning each pipe to one of six possible priority groups. A second set of criteria, based on the concept of efficiency, is proposed for comparing alternative rehabilitation programs (subsets of the asset stock).", "paper_title": "A multicriteria decision support methodology for annual rehabilitation programs of water networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249193500003"}
