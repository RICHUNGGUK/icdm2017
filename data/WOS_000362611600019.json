The task of this problem is to find the minimum required bandwidth to satisfy channel demand from each cell without interference constraints violation. Different from existing works, a novel two-phase hyper-heuristic technique which integrates harmony search and a set of prior information based heuristics is proposed to solve it. We validate performance of our approach by integrating a local search procedure in the later iterations. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark problems, and the results are compared with the best state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that the method proposed in this article works effectively on the benchmark problems and has better performance on most problems than the algorithms that are investigated.
