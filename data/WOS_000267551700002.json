In this paper we implement the work with the prefix tree by P systems with strings and active membranes. We present the algorithms of searching in a dictionary and updating it implemented as membrane systems. The systems are constructed as reusable modules, so they are suitable for using as sub-algorithms for solving more complicated problems.", "paper_title": "Dictionary Search and Update by P Systems with String-Objects and Active Membranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000267551700002"}
