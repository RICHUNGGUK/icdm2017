Extending a conjecture of Erdos, Burr and Rosta conjectured that every graph is common. Thomason disproved both conjectures by showing that K-4 is not common. It is now known that in fact the common graphs are very rare. Answering a question of Sidorenko and of Jagger, St' ovicek and Thomason from 1996 we show that the 5-wheel is common. This provides the first example of a common graph that is not three-colourable.", "paper_title": "Non-Three-Colourable Common Graphs Exist", "paper_id": "WOS:000307179400006"}
