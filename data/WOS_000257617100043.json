A wide range of commercial information retrieval systems are based on standard Boolean model and at less scale vector models. Although the deficiencies of these models are now part of text-book knowledge, the development of new models still have to overcome the feasibility and testing challenge. This paper advocates a fuzzy based approach for information retrieval where a new model is put forward. Also, its feasibility and performance are demonstrated through a testing with a large-scale University database and whose results are compared to a standard commercial Boolean model.
