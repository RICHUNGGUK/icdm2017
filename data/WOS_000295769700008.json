In this paper, we study the solution of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations based on pseudospectral collocation method with domain decomposition algorithm for approximating the spatial variable. The problem is converted to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which will be integrated in time by explicit Runge-Kutta method of order four. The multidomain scheme has much better stability properties than the single domain. Thus this permits using much larger step size for the time integration which fulfills stability restrictions. The proposed scheme reduces the effects of round-of-error for the Chebyshev collocation and also uses less memory without sacrificing the accuracy. The numerical experiments are presented which show the multidomain pseudospectral method has excellent long-time numerical behavior and preserves energy conservation property. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
