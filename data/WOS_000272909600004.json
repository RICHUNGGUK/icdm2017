The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm in 3D multiple pulses per plane (MPP) codes is shown. This design ensures a maximum cross-correlation of '1' between any two codes. The performance metrics that have been investigated are the bit error rate due to multiple access interference (MAI) for different values of the number of simultaneous users and, cardinality for different values of temporal length (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
