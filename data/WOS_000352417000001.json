A novel medium access control scheme named BEDCA (Balanced EDCA) is presented, which provides service differentiation between the access point (AP) and the mobile stations (STAs) to enhance VoIP capacity. In BEDCA, the expression of AP's contention window is obtained which is a relative constant value independent of the participating STAs. The minimum contention window of the STAs is traffic-aware based on the proposed algorithm. The performance improvement of BEDCA is verified through intensive simulations and the results show the capacity improvement of 82.1% compared to EDCA.", "paper_title": "Boosting VoIP Capacity via Service Differentiation in IEEE 802.11e EDCA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352417000001"}
