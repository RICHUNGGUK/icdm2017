We generated random workloads of synthetic periodic task sets and executed them on a big multi-core machine, using Linux as Operating System, gathering an extensive amount of data related to their exhibited performance under various real-time scheduling strategies. The comparison involves the fixed-priority scheduler for multiprocessors as available in the Linux kernel (with priorities set so as to achieve RM), and on our own implementation of EDF, both configured in global, partitioned and clustered mode. The impact of the various scheduling strategies on the performance of the applications, as well as the generated scheduling overheads, are compared presenting an extensive set of experimental results. These provide a comprehensive view of the performance achievable by the different schedulers under various workload conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
