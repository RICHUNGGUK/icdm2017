To import real-world characters into virtual environments, however, surface reflectance properties must also be known. We describe a video-based modeling approach that captures human shape and motion as well as reflectance characteristics from a handful of synchronized video recordings. The presented method is able to recover spatially varying surface reflectance properties of clothes from multiview video footage. The resulting model description enables us to realistically reproduce the appearance of animated virtual actors under different lighting conditions, as well as to interchange surface attributes among different people, e.g., for virtual dressing. Our contribution can be used to create 3D renditions of real-world people under arbitrary novel lighting conditions on standard graphics hardware.", "paper_title": "Seeing people in different light - Joint shape, motion, and reflectance capture", "paper_id": "WOS:000247006000003"}
