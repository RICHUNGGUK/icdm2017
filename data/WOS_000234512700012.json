The company's first failed attempt exceeded project budgets, decreased software quality, and left projects unfinished. In its second offshore attempt, however, development costs decreased 10 to 15 percent compared to onshore costs, large government-mandated regulatory projects completed in less time, and internal IT staff morale increased. This experience shows how both the people involved in offshore projects and the projects themselves must be treated differently from internally developed projects. Even with the high complexities and intellectual property concerns surrounding embedded software development, the company has used these practices to establish processes that ensure successful delivery and protection of its intellectual property.", "paper_title": "Successfully outsourcing embedded software development", "paper_id": "WOS:000234512700012"}
