It transmits information to both ventral and dorsal pathways to process appearance and motion information, respectively. However, SFA only uses slowly varying features for local feature extraction, because they represent appearance information more effectively than motion information. To better utilize temporal information, we propose temporal variance analysis (TVA) as a generalization of SFA. TVA learns a linear transformation matrix that projects multidimensional temporal data to temporal components with temporal variance. Inspired by the function of V1, we learn receptive fields by TVA and apply convolution and pooling to extract local features. Embedded in the improved dense trajectory framework, TVA for action recognition is proposed to: 1) extract appearance and motion features from gray using slow and fast filters, respectively; 2) extract additional motion features using slow filters from horizontal and vertical optical flows; and 3) separately encode extracted local features with different temporal variances and concatenate all the encoded features as final features. We evaluate the proposed TVA features on several challenging data sets and show that both slow and fast features are useful in the low-level feature extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed TVA features outperform the conventional histogram-based features, and excellent results can be achieved by combining all TVA features.", "paper_title": "Temporal Variance Analysis for Action Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000369538200012"}
