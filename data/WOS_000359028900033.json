In this algorithm, a new component is introduced into the objective function to capture the feature groups and a new iterative process is defined to optimize the objective function so that the features of high-dimensional data are grouped automatically. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that the new algorithm outperforms the FG-k-means algorithm in terms of accuracy and choice of parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
