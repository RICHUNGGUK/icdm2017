To do this, there exist many different DEA models and different DEA viewpoints. Hence, selecting the best model (viewpoint) or the way of combining different models (viewpoints) for ranking DMUs is a main question in applied DEA. This paper provides a methodology. based upon Shannon's entropy formula, for combining the efficiency results of different DEA models (viewpoints). An application of the provided method in educational departments of a university in Iran is also illustrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
