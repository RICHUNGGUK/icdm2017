The population-based reduction approaches are attractive to find multiple reducts in the decision systems; which could be applied to generate multi-knowledge and to improve decision accuracy. In this paper, we design a multi-swarm synergetic optimization algorithm (MSSO) for rough set reduction and multi-knowledge extraction. It is a multi-swarm based search approach, in which different individual trends to be encoded to different, reduct. The approach discovers the best feature combinations in an efficient way to observe the change of positive region as the particles proceed throughout the search space. The performance of our approach is evaluated and compared with Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Empirical results illustrate that the approach can be applied for multiple reduct problems and multi-knowledge extraction effectively.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-SWARM SYNERGETIC OPTIMIZER FOR MULTI-KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION USING ROUGH SET", "paper_id": "WOS:000281702900006"}
