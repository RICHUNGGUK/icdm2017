In this paper, we study the complexity of planning in the class C(n) of planning problems, characterized by unary operators and directed path causal graphs. Although this is one of the simplest forms of causal graphs a planning problem can have, we show that planning is intractable for C(n) (unless P = NP), even if the domains of state variables have bounded size. In particular, we show that plan existence for C(n)(k) is NP-hard for k >= 5 by reduction from CNF-SAT. Here, k denotes the upper bound on the size of the state variable domains. Our result reduces the complexity gap for the class C(n)(k) to cases k = 3 and k = 4 only, since C(n)(2) is known to be tractable.", "paper_title": "Planning over Chain Causal Graphs for Variables with Domains of Size 5 Is NP-Hard", "paper_id": "WOS:000265865500007"}
