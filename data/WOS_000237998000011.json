It is a computer-aided intelligent system that can automatically generate the optimal joint types and assembly sequences for the best dimensional quality. The backbone of this system is the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methodology, which works by searching through a case library created from previous designs whose identifying features resemble the current case. Algorithms for initial solution generation, dimension chain generation, joint design selections, assembly sequence generation, and tolerance analysis and optimization are developed. Based on the framework, a software tool called Body Build Advisor, or BBA, is developed. The software allows process designers to analyze candidate assembly schemes and achieve the best assembly process design prior to having detailed knowledge of geometry of the parts, and thus is ideal for architectural process design. In addition, the system has the advantage of an open structure that can be easily modified and adapted to accommodate existing assemblies and to suggest areas for improvement. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
