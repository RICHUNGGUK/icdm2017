It also presents a compact circuit model for the transformer based on the \"2-pi\" model of on-chip spiral inductors. All the RLC circuit elements can be calculated from the transformer's geometrical and process parameters. Verification with accurately calibrated electromagnetic (EM) simulation data demonstrates accurate performance prediction and good scalability for a wide range of transformers' layout.", "paper_title": "Characterization, design and modeling of on-chip interleaved transformers in CMOS RFICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900008"}
