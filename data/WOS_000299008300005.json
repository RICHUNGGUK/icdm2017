The mandatory certification implies a worst-case delay analysis of all the flows transmitted on the AFDX network. Up to now, this analysis is done thanks to a tool based on a Network Calculus approach. The more recent Trajectory approach has been proposed for the computation of worst-case response time in distributed systems. It has been shown that the worst-case delay analysis of an AFDX network can be improved using an optimized Trajectory approach. This paper extends this optimized approach with the integration of static priority QoS policies. This extension makes possible to compute the bounds needed for deterministic avionics flows (high priority) when (lower priority) non avionics flows are added. Moreover, the paper provides an analysis of the pessimism of the obtained bounds.", "paper_title": "Applying Trajectory approach with static priority queuing for improving the use of available AFDX resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000299008300005"}
