In this paper, we propose a WS Selection Approach based on QoS Estimation (WSSAQE). The aim of WSSAQE is to perform accurate QoS estimation, and then alleviate the deviations between requiring and receiving QoS in WS selection. Experimental results show that our proposed WSSAQE is effective and efficient. Moreover, it significantly improves the QoS-based WS selection process.", "paper_title": "Towards Web Service selection based on QoS estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000285771300005"}
