However, the viewer's experience of a 3D world is dependent on the nature of the virtual cinematography, in particular, the camera position, orientation and motion in relation to the elements of the scene and the action. Camera control encompasses viewpoint computation, motion planning and editing. We present a range of computer graphics applications and draw on insights from cinematographic practice in identifying their different requirements with regard to camera control. The nature of the camera control problem varies depending on these requirements, which range from augmented manual control (semi-automatic) in interactive applications, to fully automated approaches. We review the full range of solution techniques from constraint-based to optimization-based approaches, and conclude with an examination of occlusion management and expressiveness in the context of declarative approaches to camera control.", "paper_title": "Camera Control in Computer Graphics", "paper_id": "WOS:000261137800017"}
