In this paper, a RFID-based Resource Management System (RFID-RMS) is designed to help users to select the most suitable resource usage packages for handling warehouse operation orders by retrieving and analysing useful knowledge from a case-based data warehouse for solutions in both time saving and cost effective manner. In addition, a pure integral-linear programming model using a branch and bound algorithm to define the optimum travel distance of forklifts is also developed and embedded in the proposed system. The proposed system, which is suitable for usage in a warehouse operation environment, enhances the effectiveness in formulating resource usage package and managing resource operation by integrating the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), case-based reasoning (CBR) technologies and the programming model for forklift route optimization. Through applying RFID-RMS in the GENCO Distribution System, a multinational logistics company, the utilization of warehouse resources is expected to be maximized while work efficiency will be greatly enhanced.
