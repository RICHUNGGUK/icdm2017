Diverse types of molecular descriptors were calculated to represent the molecular structures of the various compounds studied. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was employed to select an optimal subset of descriptors that have significant contributions to the ?HSolv overall property. Our investigation revealed that the dependence of physicochemical properties on solvation enthalpy is a nonlinear observable fact and that MLR method is unable to model the solvation enthalpy accurately. It has been observed that support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) demonstrates better performance compared with MLR. The standard error value of the test set for SVM is 1.731 kJ?mol-1, while it is 2.303 kJ?mol-1 and 5.146 kJ?mol-1 for ANN and MLR, respectively. The results showed that the calculated ?HSolv values by SVM were in good agreement with the experimental data, and the performance of the SVM model was superior to those of MLR and ANN ones.", "paper_title": "A Novel QSPR Model for Prediction of Gas to Dimethyl Sulfoxide Solvation Enthalpy of Organic Compounds Based on Support Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000303857900005"}
