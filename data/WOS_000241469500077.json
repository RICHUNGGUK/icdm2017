In order to support high availability, AS includes important features, such as device hot addition and removal, redundant pathways, and fabric management failover. This work presents an AS model developed in OPNET. The contribution of this tool is that it can help researchers to design and evaluate management mechanisms for this new technology. It can also be used to analyze other key aspects of the architecture, such as routing, congestion, and quality of service.", "paper_title": "A model for the development of AS fabric management protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500077"}
