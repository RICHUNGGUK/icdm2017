The proposed algorithm, called AGEGT, aids cloud operators to adapt the resource allocation to applications and their locations according to the operational conditions in a cloud (e.g. workload and resource availability) with respect to multiple conflicting objectives such as response time, resource utilization and power consumption. In AGEGT, evolutionary multiobjective games are performed on application deployment strategies (i.e. solution candidates) with an aid of guided local search. AGEGT theoretically guarantees that each application performs an evolutionarily stable deployment strategy, which is an equilibrium solution under given operational conditions. Simulation results verify this theoretical analysis; applications seek equilibria to perform adaptive and evolutionarily stable deployment strategies. AGEGT allows applications to successfully leverage DVFS to balance their response time, resource utilization and power consumption. AGEGT gains performance improvement via guided local search and outperforms existing heuristics such as first-fit and best-fit algorithms (FFA and BFA) as well as NSGA-II.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Active-Guided Evolutionary Games for Adaptive and Stable Deployment of DVFS-Aware Cloud Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000361952700004"}
