The key to robust design is the application of computer simulations, which is used to as a tool to avoid detectable loopholes in the market. An example illustrates the method. Computer simulation not only provides much information about the dynamics of economic agents' interaction, but also allows modeling of aggregate market outcomes from heterogeneous individual behavior. With this method, the policymakers have a better opportunity to communicate with others and to understand the possible consequences of different decisions under different optional policies and market conditions.
