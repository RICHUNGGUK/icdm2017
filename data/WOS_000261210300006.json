A human-machine shared force controller is designed to combine manual control with local force control. A position-based force control strategy for surface tracking on the constrained motion plane is adopted. A precise method to measure the contact point's spatial location during the surface tracking process is proposed. The operational space calibration for the L-pipe part is solved by direct least-squares fitting algorithm of elliptic tracking trajectory and L-pipe part calibration algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed calibration method can make the operational space model error less than 1 mm, which meets the requirements of carrying out assembling contact tasks during the remote welding process with passive compliance.
