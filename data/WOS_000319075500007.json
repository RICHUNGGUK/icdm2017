Since the most computationally expensive step in the SSL handshake protocol is the server's RSA decryption, it is introduced that the proposed secret exchange algorithm can be used to speed up the SSL session initialization. This paper first points out that the previous batch method is impractical since it requires multiple certificates. It then proposes a unique certificate scheme to overcome the problem. The optimization strategy, which is based on the constrained model considering the user requirements-aware security ranking, focuses on the optimal result in different public key sizes. It is also introduced that the parameter is optimized when integrating user requirements for Internet QoS, such as the stability of the system and the tolerable response time. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated to be practical and efficient through both analysis and simulation studies.", "paper_title": "User requirements-aware security ranking in SSL protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500007"}
