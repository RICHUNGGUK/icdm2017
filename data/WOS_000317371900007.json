Distributed software infrastructure bootstrapping is the procedure of instantiating all processes of the distributed system on the appropriate hardware nodes and disseminating to these processes the information that they need to complete the infrastructure's start-up phase. In this paper, we describe the lightweight infrastructure-bootstrapping infrastructure (LIBI), both a bootstrapping API specification and a reference implementation. We describe a classification system for process launching mechanism and then present a performance evaluation of different process launching schemes based on our LIBI prototype.
