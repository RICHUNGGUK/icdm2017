One of determinative parameters for QoS achievement in IoT framework is the communication technology. Motivated by the issues, this paper provides an insight and approach to develop high quality communication frameworks for IoT data test-bed, based on LTE communications systems. The test-bed framework is achieved by featuring an emulation of EPC construction using NetFPGA and OpenFlow platforms. The test-bed model will be expected to offer the sensitiveness control over IoT communication data type. In addition the emulation scheme provided by this test-bed will allow an extensive achievement toward M2M over LTE compliance for IoT integrated architecture in the near future.", "paper_title": "Integrated LTE Test-Bed Framework Evaluating EPC Compliance for IoT QoS Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900002"}
