Navigable Web sites allow users to form a mental model of the type and location of information in the Web site and an expectation of where and to what a particular hyperlink will lead. Existing navigability measures are based mainly on the static hyperlink structure of a Web site. Such measures, however, have two main drawbacks: 1) the effect on navigability of a hyperlink structure cannot be well characterized and 2) the effect on navigability of the navigation aids (such as the \"Back\" button provided by a browser) is ignored. In this paper, we abstract a dynamic Web surfing behavior as a Markov model which synthesizes typical surfing actions. Based on this model, we propose a novel navigability measure MNav. The experimental results show that MNav can be efficiently computed and it provides an effective and useful measurement of Web site navigability.", "paper_title": "MNav: A Markov model-based web site navigability measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000250389400006"}
