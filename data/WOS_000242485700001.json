This paper considers the continuity of triangular Bezier surfaces at the three corners, so that the boundary curves preserve endpoints continuity of any order alpha. The l(2)- and L-2-norm combined with the constrained least-squares method are used to get the matrix representations for the control points of the degree reduced surfaces. Both methods can be applied to piecewise continuous triangular patches or to only a triangular patch with the combination of surface subdivision. And the resulting piecewise approximating patches are globally C-o continuous. Finally, error estimation is given and numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
