It is a highly constrained multiobjective optimization problem involving conflicting objectives with both equality and inequality constraints. In this paper, multi-objective differential evolution has been proposed to solve EED problem. Numerical results of three test systems demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. Results obtained from the proposed approach have been compared to those obtained from pareto differential evolution, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2.
