We suggest some alternative estimation strategies for parameters based on shrinkage and pretest principles. It is advantageous to use the non-sample information in the estimation process to construct alternative estimations for the parameter of interest. In this article, large sample properties of the suggested estimators will be assessed numerically using computer simulation. The relative performance of the suggested estimators for moderate and large samples will also be simulated. For illustration purposes, the proposed methodology is applied using data collocated from the Pepsi Cola production company in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia.", "paper_title": "Shrinkage estimation in replicated median ranked set sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000283061500001"}
