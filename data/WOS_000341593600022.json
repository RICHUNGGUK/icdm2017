Human participants and a computer model carried out a task in which they were required to locate a color-cued target face. Human-generated eye fixations and scanpaths were compared with those generated by the computational model. Throughout the comparison, we considered the similarities and dissimilarities between the two systems' performances. Their results show that the eye fixations in a valid cue search are highly correlated with the computer-generated fixation points in a valid cue search but not to those in random and invalid cue searches. Moreover, the comparison between human- and computer-generated scanpaths showed that the scanpath that links the fixation points is not randomly generated. Our results imply that eye movement is accomplished not only by cue-driven activation, but also by a spatial strategy.", "paper_title": "Scanpath Generated by Cue-Driven Activation and Spatial Strategy: A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000341593600022"}
