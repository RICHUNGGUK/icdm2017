Secret information can be imperceptibly embedded into OOXML documents by splitting up the printable text, which is defined by the main document body of the OOXML format document. The number of printable words contained in each segment represents the secret message. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that embedding bit rate of the proposed method can take the maximum value (0.8) when 2?bits of secret message are embedded into each segment. Experiments show that 0.44?bit is embedded into each word and 1/151?bit is embedded into each bit of the document on average, which is higher than contemporary linguistic steganography approaches. The method can resist Format, Impersonation, Save As, Copy, and other active attacks, and all these changes will not be shown on the MS Office screen display. Therefore, the proposed method can apply to the fields of covert communication and security protection for OOXML format documents.
