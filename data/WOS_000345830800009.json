The article is divided in two parts. The first part investigates the importance of the concept of responsibility attribution for emotion theory in general and, in particular, for the theory of attribution emotions such as guilt, pride, moral approval and moral disapproval. The second part explores the collective dimension of responsibility attribution and attribution emotions, namely the concepts of collective responsibility and collective guilt. The proposed analysis is based on an extension of the logic STIT (the logic of 'Seeing To It That') with three different types of knowledge and common knowledge modal operators depending on the time of choice: before one's choice, after one's choice but before knowing the choices of other agents, and after the choices of all agents have become public. Decidability of the satisfiability problem of the logic is studied in the article.", "paper_title": "A logical analysis of responsibility attribution: emotions, individuals and collectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000345830800009"}
