This approach has been tested on realistic instances of the problem providing an adequate balance between computation time and memory space. This solution can be applied to real transport networks in order to reduce the impact of traffic congestion on pollution, economy, and citizen's welfare. A comparison with two previous approaches are given from theoretical point of view as well as experimental performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
