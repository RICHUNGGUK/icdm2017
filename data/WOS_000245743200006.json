We analyzed the relationship between the \"wrap around\" effect and the distribution of FRAT (Finite Radon Transform) coefficients first, and then based on study of some properties of the columnwisely FRAT reconstruction procedure, we proposed an energy-based adaptive orthogonal FRIT scheme (EFRIT). Experiments using nonlinear approximation show its superiority in energy concentration over both Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Finite Ridgelet Transform (FRIT). Furthermore, we have modeled the denoising problem and proposed a novel threshold selecting method. Experiments carried out on images containing strong linear singularities and texture components with varying levels of addictive white Gaussian noise show that our method achieves prominent improvement in terms of both SNR and visual quality as compared with that of DWT and FRIT.", "paper_title": "Energy-based adaptive orthogonal FRIT and its application in image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000245743200006"}
