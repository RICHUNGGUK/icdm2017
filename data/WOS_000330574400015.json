To address large scale industrial problems, a Lagrangean scheme is proposed to decompose the MINLP of Part I according to the warehouses. The subproblems are first approximated by an adaptive piece-wise linearization scheme that provides lower bounds, and the MILP is further relaxed to an LP to improve solution efficiency while providing a valid lower bound. An initialization scheme is designed to obtain good initial Lagrange multipliers, which are scaled to accelerate the convergence. To obtain feasible solutions, an adaptive linearization scheme is also introduced. The results from an illustrative problem and two real worldindustrial problems show that the method can obtain optimal or near optimal solutions in modest computational times. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
