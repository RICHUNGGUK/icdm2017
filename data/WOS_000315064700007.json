Winkler's analytical model and the FOSM method are used to estimate uncertainties in terms of the coefficient of variation in the differential settlement (CV Delta) and the bending moment (CVM) as the function of the uncertainties in the subgrade reaction modulus (k(s)) and the low stiffness zone length beneath the pipe. Results show that the values of CV Delta and CVM are very different depending on the uncertainties of k(s) and the length of the low stiffness zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
