A(.)VI(.)RE supports semi-structured collections (exhibitions) containing various resources and annotations. Its users are encouraged to contribute, share, annotate and interpret resources. Similar to the act of adding items into shopping carts in the e-commence applications, a user's acts of searching and organizing and interpreting data in A(.)VI(.)RE are considered as evidence of the user's preferences. The design process of NEAR was guided by several design moves analyzed from literatures. It implements new navigation and communication approaches that support discovery of relations.", "paper_title": "NEAR: Visualizing information relations in a multimedia repository", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000023"}
