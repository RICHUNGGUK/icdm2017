Therefore, regional investigations are necessary for durability based design and evaluation of the proposed service life prdiction models. In this paper, four reinforced concrete jetties exposed to severe marine environment were monitored to assess the long term chloride penetration at 6 months to 96 months. Also, some accelerated durability tests were performed on standard samples in laboratory. As a result, two time-dependent equations are proposed for basic parameters of chloride diffusion into concrete and then the corrosion initiation time is estimated by a developed probabilistic service life model Also, two famous service life prediction models are compared using chloride profiles obtained from structures after about 40 years in the tidal exposure conditions. The results confirm that the influence of concrete quality on diffusion coefficients is related to the concrete pore structure and the time dependence is due to chemical reactions of sea water ions with hydration products which lead a reduction in pore structure. Also, proper attention to the durability properties of concrete may extend the service life of marine structures greater than fifty years, even in harsh environments.", "paper_title": "Prediction of RC structure service life from field long term chloride diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000359968800006"}
