In particular, the comparison analyzed accuracy, driving speed, power consumption and area occupied. Moreover, in order to allow array simulations, the RC equivalent models of the pixel were also derived. The results were achieved considering a QVGA display (320 x 240), a line frequency of 60 Hz, and were verified by simulations with AIM-SPICE. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
