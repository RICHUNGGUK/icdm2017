Two related secondary structures are also investigated, taking into the account imperfect bonds (bulges, mismatches) and multiple hairpins. We characterize maximal sets of hairpin-forming DNA sequences, as well as hairpin-free ones. We study their algebraic properties and their computational complexity. Related polynomial-time algorithms deciding hairpin-freedom of regular sets are presented. Finally, effective methods for design of long hairpin-free DNA words are given.", "paper_title": "Hairpin structures in DNA words", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800012"}
