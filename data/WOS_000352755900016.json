Health-IoT is a very complex system, involving computer science, microelectronics systems, wireless communications, medical and health, and many other related fields. In this paper, we review the background and state-of-the-art of Health-IoT. We first introduce the general background of Health-IoT and the difference between Health-IoT and traditional IoT are given. Then we give the definition of Health-IoT and the Health-IoT's features. We then focus on the researches closely related to the Health-IoT, including physiological information collection, data transmission, wearable computing, and health big data analysis. We introduce the four typical application scenarios of the Health-IoT, including the medical industry, health monitoring, exercise promotion and mental support. Finally, we give the outlook of Health-IoT and the summary.", "paper_title": "Health Internet of Things: Recent Applications and Outlook", "paper_id": "WOS:000352755900016"}
