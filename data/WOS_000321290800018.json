This problem generalizes the well-known Hamiltonian path problem, hence it is NP-hard in general graphs. In this paper, first we give a sequential linear-time algorithm for the longest path problem in meshes. Then based on this algorithm, we present a constant-time parallel algorithm for the problem, which can be run on every parallel machine.", "paper_title": "An efficient parallel algorithm for the longest path problem in meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800018"}
