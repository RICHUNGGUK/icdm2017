Besides, the array beam field is quite demanding to produce. To widen the imaged area, we developed an extended, more general HFR method for 2D imaging. It allows any form of transmission field as long as the field is known, and it achieves the frame per transmission imaging rate. For verification, computer simulations use a linear transducer array and a cylindrical diffraction transmission field defined by the zero order Hankle function. The output images are in the sector format and have low sidelobes. The simulation results are consistent with our theory. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
