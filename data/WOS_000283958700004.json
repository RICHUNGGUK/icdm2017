The library provides for a given communication pattern a large number of implementations and incorporates a runtime selection logic in order to choose the implementation leading to the highest performance. In this paper, we demonstrate how an application utilizing ADCL is deployed on a wide range of HFC architectures, including an IBM Blue Gene/L, an NEC SX-8, an IBM Power PC cluster using an IBM Federation Switch, an AMD Opteron cluster utilizing a 4xInfiniBand and a Gigabit Ethernet network, and an Intel EM64T cluster using a hierarchical Gigabit Ethernet network with reduced uplink bandwidth. We demonstrate, how different implementations for the three-dimensional neighborhood communication lead to the minimal execution time of the application on different architectures. ADCL gives the user the advantage of having to maintain only a single version of the source code and still have the ability to achieve close to optimal performance for the application on all architectures.
