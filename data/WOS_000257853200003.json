All packets have unit size and arrive from the exterior according to independent batch Bernoulli arrival processes. The service discipline of each node is work-conserving and the service discipline of node 0 has to be HoL-based, which is an additional assumption that is satisfied by, a. o., m(i)-limited service, exhaustive service, and priority disciplines. Let a type i packet be a packet that visits queue i of node 0. We establish a distributional relation between the number of type i packets in the network and in a single station system, and we show equality of the mean end-to-end delay of type i packets in the two systems. Essentially this reduces an arbitrary tree network to a much simpler system of one node, while preserving the mean end-to-end delay of type i packets.", "paper_title": "Reduction of a polling network to a single node", "paper_id": "WOS:000257853200003"}
