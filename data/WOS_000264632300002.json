Considerable efforts have been made by both academia and industry on P2P streaming design. While academia mostly focus on exploring design space to approach the theoretical performance bounds, our recent measurement study on several commercial P2P streaming systems indicates that they are able to deliver good user quality of experience with seemingly simple designs. One intriguing question remains: how elaborate should a good P2P video streaming design be? Towards answering this question, we developed and implemented several representative P2P streaming designs, ranging from theoretically proved optimal designs to straightforward \"naive\" designs. Through an extensive comparison study on PlanetLab, we unveil several key factors contributing to the successes of simple P2P streaming designs, including system resource index, server capacity and chunk scheduling rule, peer download buffering and peering degree. We also identify regions where naive designs are inadequate and more elaborate designs can improve things considerably. Our study not only brings us better understandings and more insights into the operation of existing systems, it also sheds lights on the design of future systems that can achieve a good balance between the performance and the complexity.", "paper_title": "Investigating the Scheduling Sensitivity of P2P Video Streaming: An Experimental Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632300002"}
