When more than one quality characteristic is considered, an important question is how to trade off robust design solutions. In this paper, we consider a bi-objective robust design problem for which Pareto solutions of two quality characteristics need to be obtained. In practical robust design applications, a second-order polynomial model is adequate to accommodate the curvature of process mean and variance functions, thus mean-squared robust design models, frequently used by many researchers, would contain fourth-order terms. Consequently, the associated Pareto frontier might be non-convex and supported and non-supported efficient solutions needs to be generated. So, the objective of this paper is to develop a lexicographic weighted-Tchebycheff based bi-objective robust design model to generate the associated Pareto frontier. Our numerical example clearly shows the advantages of this model over frequently used weighted-sums model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
