A multilayer design matches the optimal solutions from the electronic layer to the physical topology available using a particular DNI-routing-and-wavelength-assignment formulation. Study cases with 20 different traffic matrices are performed over translucent and opaque networks with 13 nodes. Despite the excessive traffic duplication of the VR, there is only a minor distinction from the DC performance, even under heavy intra-ring traffic, thanks to an optimally chosen intra-ring lightpath in translucent networks.
