However, creating a map of a large metabolic model is a difficult and time-consuming process. MetDraw fully automates the map-drawing process for metabolic models containing hundreds to thousands of reactions. MetDraw can also overlay high-throughput 'omics' data directly on the generated maps.", "paper_title": "MetDraw: automated visualization of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions and high-throughput data", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100030"}
