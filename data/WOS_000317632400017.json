The novel method decomposes the signal into branch signals orthogonally, which can adapt to the change of saturate power of each branch power amplifiers. Furthermore, the novel method has the advantages of both high power efficiency of power amplifier and low PAPR of branch signals. Therefore, this is more suitable for practical application. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method can increase the power efficiency remarkably without reducing the BER performance in the receiver.", "paper_title": "A high power efficiency method using orthogonal signal decomposition in high PAPR system", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400017"}
