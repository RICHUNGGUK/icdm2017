Today, the tool has broken the boundaries of its original intents and can be considered, under every aspect, an extensible platform for knowledge management and acquisition. The semantic bookmarking and annotation facilities of Semantic Turkey are now supporting just a part of a whole methodology where different actors, from domain experts to knowledge engineers, can cooperate in developing, building and populating ontologies while navigating the Web.", "paper_title": "Semantic Turkey: A browser-integrated environment for knowledge acquisition and management", "paper_id": "WOS:000209436800005"}
