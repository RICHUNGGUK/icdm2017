Conventionally, multicarrier schemes are designed based on Nyquist criterion to avoid inter-carrier interference and inter-symbol interference. Also, the time-frequency lattice and the prototype filter are designed considering the worst-case of time-varying multipath channel. However, this approach ignores to make use of multi-user diversity and leads excessive spacings between successive symbols in time and frequency. Unlike the conventional methods, in this study, symbols are allowed to be overlapped (depending on time-frequency dispersion of their individual channels) as long as the signal-to-interference ratios observed by all users are kept above a certain level. Additionally, in order to achieve more flexibility in packing symbols, user specific filters that have different time-frequency characteristics are utilized. This enables further spectral efficiency improvement in our system design.", "paper_title": "Intentional-overlapping for multicarrier schemes based on user-specific filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500013"}
