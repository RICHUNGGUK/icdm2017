The proposed algorithm uses Rademacher-Walsh polynomials to combine M (>= 2) individual classifiers in a nonlinear way. The resulting classifier is optimal in the sense that its misclassification error rate is always less than, or equal to, that of each constituent classifier. A number of numerical examples (based on both real and simulated data) are also given. These examples demonstrate some new, and far-reaching, benefits of working with combined classifiers.", "paper_title": "Aggregating classifiers via Rademacher-Walsh polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000347703300008"}
