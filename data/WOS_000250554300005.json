Medical broad-band applications have attracted increased attention in recent years and furthermore, the tremendous growth of wireless technologies has introduced the potential of continuous healthcare monitoring for mobile patients. The bandwidth requirements and the emergency nature of medical applications introduce the need for QoS provisioning in wireless broadband medical networks. Wireless networks may support a number of e-health applications with different traffic requirements and characteristics, providing at the same time QoS guarantees. Resource allocation in e-health application is inherently different in many aspects including the offered services, traffic requirements, propagation characteristics, and network structure. In this paper, an adaptive resource allocation scheme for QoS provisioning in wireless healthcare information systems is proposed.", "paper_title": "Simulation and modeling bandwidth control in wireless healthcare information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250554300005"}
