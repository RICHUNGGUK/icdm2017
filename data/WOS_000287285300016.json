Multiple-access interference may be better tolerated in these systems, allowing higher levels of spatial reuse and a reduction in the overhead required to schedule transmissions. We present a protocol which leverages these features of DSSS to support greater end-to-end throughput and terminal mobility rates. A protocol extension allows terminals to adjust protocol overhead in order to preserve network connectivity in sparse networks. For each transmission, terminals use a combination of common and transmitter-oriented spreading sequences in a format which allows for discovery of nearby terminals and adaptation of transmission rates to maximize throughput. The protocol does not operate over an artificial network graph, nor does it require an initialization phase or two-way exchange of information during a transmission slot. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the transmission scheduling protocol in a variety of static and mobile scenarios. For comparison, we also simulate a centralized transmission scheduling protocol with perfect knowledge of topology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
