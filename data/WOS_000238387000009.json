This paper proposes and evaluates a solution to the latter problem for applications based on linear computations that involve scalar as well as array arithmetic. We demonstrate that, for certain classes of applications, it is possible to use an optimizing compiler to automatically transform code structure and data layout so that an application can safely be executed on an untrusted remote host without being reverse engineered.", "paper_title": "Secure execution of computations in untrusted hosts", "paper_id": "WOS:000238387000009"}
