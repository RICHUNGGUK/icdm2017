The filtering method (entitled as Fuzzy Random Impulse Noise Reduction method (FRINR)) consists of a fuzzy detection mechanism and a fuzzy filtering method to remove (random-valued) impulse noise from corrupted images. Based on the criteria of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and subjective evaluations we have found experimentally, that the proposed method provides a significant improvement on other state-of-the-art methods.
