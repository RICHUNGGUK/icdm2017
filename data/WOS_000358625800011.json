Such a logic may be employed for several distinct reasoning tasks and one that has potential to be one of the most useful is building a model from a specification, a simple form of synthesis. In this paper, we consider the task of model-building for temporal logic specifications over the real-number linear flow of time. We present a new notation for giving a detailed description of the compositional construction of such a model and an efficient procedure for finding such a description from the temporal specification.
