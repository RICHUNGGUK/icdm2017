Given a (1-epsilon) satisfiable 2CSP our first algorithm finds an assignment of variables satisfying a 1-O(root epsilon) fraction of all constraints. The best previously known result, due to Zwick, was 1-O(epsilon(1/3)). The second algorithm finds a ck/2(k) approximation for the MAX k-CSP problem (where c > 0.44 is an absolute constant). This result improves the previously best known algorithm by Hast, which had an approximation guarantee of Omega(k/(2(k) log k)). Both results are optimal assuming the unique games conjecture and are based on rounding natural semidefinite programming relaxations. We also believe that our algorithms and their analysis are simpler than those previously known.", "paper_title": "Near-Optimal Algorithms for Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268471900008"}
