So far, most related work on data replication in data grid systems focuses on read-only dataset. Though write operations have been widely used in practice, its optimization problem has not been sufficiently studied. In tins paper, we show that write requests from users can be processed by a nearest site, regardless of the location of latest written replicas. The policy of write nearby instead of write to the latest replica can improve the performance of write operations, while inconsistency is caused between multiple replicas. Therefore, we propose two metadata management algorithms to make sure that users can retrieve up-to-date datasets at any time. We extend OptorSim to support the implementation and evaluation of our scheme. The results of simulation show that our scheme achieves performance gains up to 3.3 compared with WriteMaster scheme.", "paper_title": "Optimizing write operation on replica in data grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800001"}
