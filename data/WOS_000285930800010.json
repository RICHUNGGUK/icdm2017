In this study, two real world credit datasets in the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository are selected for the numerical experiments. SVM, GA-SVM and gr-GA-SVM, are employed to predict the accuracy of credit scoring in two datasets. Numerical results indicate that gr-GA-SVM is more accurate and efficient than SVM and GA-SVM.", "paper_title": "A Modified Support Vector Machine model for Credit Scoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930800010"}
