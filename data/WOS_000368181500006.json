We aim to derive a sufficient CSR that can prevent the hidden-node collisions in a general 802.11 PNC network. The analysis includes two steps. First, we analyze the six link-to-link interference cases in an 802.11 PNC network to show that the mutual interference will be most severe when each node in the network initiates a two-hop end node link. Second, we consider the worst interference case that all concurrently transmitting links in the network are two-hop end node links and placed in the densest manner and develop a closed-form expression of a sufficient CSR that prevents the hidden-node collisions in a PNC network. From the analysis results, we find that to prevent the hidden-node collisions, the CSR in PNC network should be bigger than the one in traditional non-network-coding network. Furthermore, we carry out extensive simulations to find out the throughput gain of PNC scheme in a general wireless network when considering the impact of CSR. Simulation results show that compared with the non-network-coding scheme, PNC scheme has throughput gain when a large proportion (i.e., 90%) of links in the network are two-hop links and the link density has little effect on the throughput gain of PNC scheme.
