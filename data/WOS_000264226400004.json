The myVocs framework enables virtual organization (VO) self-management across unrelated security domains for multiple, unrelated VOs. By leveraging the emerging distributed identity management infrastructure. myVocs provides an accessible, secure collaborative environment using standards for federated identity management and open-source software developed through the National Science Foundation Middleware Initiative. The Shibboleth software, an early implementation of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards Security Assertion Markup Language standard for browser single sign-on, provides the middleware needed to assert identity and attributes across domains so that access control decisions can be determined at each resource bused on local policy. The eduPerson object class for lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) provides standardized naming, format, and semantics for a global identifier. We have found that a Shibboleth deployment supporting VOs requires the addition of a new VO service component allowing VOs to manage their own membership and control access to their distributed resources. The myVocs system can be integrated with Grid authentication and authorization using GridShib.
