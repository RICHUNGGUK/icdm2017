The system possesses time-varying and norm-bounded uncertainties. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis approaches, new stability criteria are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the delayed neural networks to be robustly exponentially stable in the mean square for all admissible parameter uncertainties. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
