Here, mushroom type resonator is used to realize a triple passband filter using the coupling matrix approach. The electric and magnetic couplings between the mushroom resonators are achieved by proper positioning of corner via which have been analyzed and presented. Finally, the frequency transformation has been applied to design a highly selective 12-pole triple-passband cascaded-quartets filter. This symmetric triple-band filter is operative at center frequencies 3.41/3.56/3.72 GHz with 100 MHz bandwidth of each band. It is observed that the measured results are in good agreement with the simulated results. A significant size reduction has been achieved while realizing triple-passband filter, which is as small as 50 mm x 25 mm x 1.27 mm.
