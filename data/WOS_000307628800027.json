This is also evident in the Northeast Asia area including Northeast China, South Korea and Japan, etc. This paper proposes a tie-line constrained equivalent assisting generator model (WTEAG) considering wind turbine generator (WTG) newly. An interconnection power system reliability evaluation program \"NEAREL-II\" using the proposed model is developed. Additionally, this paper presents results of case studies of reliability evaluation for the actual power systems of six countries in the Northeast Asia area including WTG.", "paper_title": "RELIABILITY EVALUATION OF INTERCONNECTED POWER SYSTEMS INCLUDING WIND TURBINE GENERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800027"}
