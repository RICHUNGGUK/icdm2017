The paper recommends a strategy for modelling mechanically mixed sewage sludge at laboratory scale. Generated flow patterns are analysed and conclusions drawn as to the effectiveness of mixing in the laboratory scale digester. Data relating biogas yield to different mixing regimes are reported and combined with CFD model results. From this, novel conclusions regarding velocity gradients and biogas yield are drawn.
