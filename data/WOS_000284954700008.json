The Query packet, injected by the mobile sink, is routed to the specific area and the corresponding Response packet is expected to return via multi-hop communication. In this paper, we analyze such a network model to address the problem of efficient data collection for mobile wireless monitoring applications. We first propose a meeting position-aware routing (MPAR) protocol for routing the Response packet efficiently and then propose an efficient query-based data collection scheme (QBDCS) for mobile wireless monitoring applications based on the MPAR. In order to minimize the energy consumption and packet delivery latency, the QBDCS chooses the optimal query time of injecting the Query packet and tailors the routing mechanism for sensor nodes forwarding packets. Simulation study has verified the analysis and demonstrated that the QBDCS can significantly reduce the energy consumption and end to end delivery latency.", "paper_title": "Efficient Query-Based Data Collection for Mobile Wireless Monitoring Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000284954700008"}
