In this paper, early detection of breast cancer through classification of microcalcification clusters from mammograms is emphasized. Although artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely applied in this area, the average accuracy achieved is only around 80% in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve A(z). This performance may become much worse when the training samples are imbalanced. As a result, an improved neural classifier is proposed, in which balanced learning with optimized decision making are introduced to enable effective learning from imbalanced samples. When the proposed learning strategy is applied to individual classifiers, the results on the DDSM database have demonstrated that the performance from has been significantly improved. An average improvement of more than 10% in the measurements of F(1) score and A(z) has fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method for the successful classification of clustered microcalcifications.
