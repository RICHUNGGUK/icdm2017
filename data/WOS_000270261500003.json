In this article, we exploit this concept for binary images and propose a shape salience detector and a shape descriptor-Tensor Scale Descriptor with Influence Zones. It also introduces a robust method to compute tensor scale, using a graph-based approach-the Image Foresting Transform. Experimental results are provided, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods, when compared to other relevant methods, such as Beam Angle Statistics and Contour Salience Descriptor. with regard to their use in content-based image retrieval tasks.
