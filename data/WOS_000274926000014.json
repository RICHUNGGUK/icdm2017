By synthesizing survey results in existing studies, this research focuses on representative aspects of the attitudes and behaviors recorded through the years. It finds that although an increase in the publishing and awareness rates of scholars with regard to OA journals has been observed, scholars have been consistently concerned with the low prestige of such journals and their lack of peer review, which is not the case in practice. It is hoped that the findings will provide useful information for the improvement of OA advocacy.", "paper_title": "A Longitudinal Study of Scholars Attitudes and Behaviors Toward Open-Access Journal Publishing", "paper_id": "WOS:000274926000014"}
