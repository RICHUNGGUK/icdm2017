Moreover, four measurements are defined to evaluate the quality of a recovered image. In the proposed algorithm, the original image is divided into 2x2 blocks to improve localization precision and decrease PFR under occurrence of random tampering. The PFR under occurrence of region tampering can be effectively decreased by randomly embedding the watermark of each block in conjunction with a novel method of tamper detection. Compared with the current self-recovery fragile watermarking algorithms, the proposed scheme not only resolves the tamper detection problem of self-embedding watermarking, but also improves the robustness against the random tampering of self-embedding watermarking. In addition, the subjective measurements are provided to evaluate the performance of the self-recovery watermarking schemes for image authentication.", "paper_title": "A self-recovery fragile watermarking scheme for image authentication with superior localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000259676700007"}
