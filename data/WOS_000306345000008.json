Although WiBro was the first wireless broadband internet technology in the world to be developed, commercialized and subsequently designated as an international standard, its performance on the global market has been without notable success and no active research is taking place to change this current state. In order to escape from a narrow domestic market and get to launch abroad, it is important to suggest a strategic roadmap with policy supports of a government as well as to introduce the policy for Wibro standardization. This research analyzed the effects of standardization on business strategies. Based on the Delta Model, this research devises strategies for the WiBro service's commercialization on the global market and presents a strategic framework based on empirical research using the ANP methodology. The analysis results in this study suggest a strategic roadmap for global commercialization of WiBro.", "paper_title": "Developing a strategic framework for the WiBro service in the global market", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000008"}
