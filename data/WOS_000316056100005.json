This coupled objective function is introduced in our kinematics-driven finite element model to estimate muscle forces and to identify the role of abdominal muscles in upright standing while lifting symmetrically a weight at different heights. Predictive equations for the compression and buckling forces are developed. Results are also compared with the conventional objective function that neglects abdominal muscle forces. An overall optimal solution involving smaller spinal compression but higher trunk stability is automatically attained when choosing muscle stress powers at and around 3. Results highlight the internal oblique muscle as the most efficient abdominal muscle during the tasks investigated. The estimated relative forces in abdominal muscles are found to be in good agreement with the respective ratios of recorded electromyography activities.", "paper_title": "Coupled objective function to study the role of abdominal muscle forces in lifting using the kinematics-driven model", "paper_id": "WOS:000316056100005"}
