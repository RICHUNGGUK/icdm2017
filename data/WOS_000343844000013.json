After a comprehensive search of the scientific literature, 112 works were selected for the review. The survey identifies and analyzes the advantages and risks that the use of cloud computing may have for the main stakeholders in education, which can be useful to identify the scenarios in which the use of cloud computing in an educational context may have significant advantages. Furthermore, the survey categorizes and discusses the main technical and domain-specific research challenges, thus facilitating researchers the task of finding relevant issues, in which they can focus their efforts.
