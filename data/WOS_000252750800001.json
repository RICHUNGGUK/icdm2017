(2) two alternative types of constraints are imposed to ensure that employees get a sufficient proportion of weekends off, (3) the maximum work stretch is four consecutive workdays for each employee, and (4) the maximum number of successive weeks with weekend work is specified. A mathematical model of this problem is formulated and efficiently solved by introducing a bound on workforce size. First, the problem structure is used to determine the minimum workforce size. Subsequently, a workforce-size constraint is added to the integer programming model in order to facilitate solution. Finally, multiple-week rotation schedules are produced to satisfy all constraints and limit or minimize the number of successive weeks with weekend work.", "paper_title": "Compressed workweek scheduling with days-off consecutivity weekend-off frequency and work stretch constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000252750800001"}
