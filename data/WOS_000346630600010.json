A two stage approach is adopted: first, combine spline theory and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), the parameter estimation problem is formulated as an optimization problem with only algebraic constraints; then, a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed to find a feasible solution. The approach is designed to handle problem of realistic size with noisy observation data. Three cases are studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm: two are based on benchmark models with priori-determined structure and parameters; the other one is a particular biological system with unknown model structure. In the last case, only a set of observation data available and in this case a nominal model is adopted for the identification. All the test systems were successfully identified by using a reasonable amount of experimental data within an acceptable computation time. Experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed method is capable of fast estimation on the unknown parameters with good precision.", "paper_title": "A Parameter Estimation Method for Biological Systems Modelled by ODE/DDE Models Using Spline Approximation and Differential Evolution Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000346630600010"}
