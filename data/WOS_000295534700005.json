However, bringing mobile information services to the Web to enable a new generation of mobile Web services presents several research challenges on identity and privacy management. In this paper, we describe a framework for identity management in mobile services that empowers users to govern the use and release of their personal information. Our framework is based on a brokering approach that intermediates between the mobile operator's information services and the Web service providers. By leveraging on Web services, identity management infrastructure and privacy enhancing technologies, our framework provides an effective, privacy-considerate delivery of services over the mobile Web environment. This paper describes the design principles and architecture of the framework as well as the feasibility, applicability and user-experience evaluation we have carried out.", "paper_title": "A Privacy-Considerate Framework for Identity Management in Mobile Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000295534700005"}
