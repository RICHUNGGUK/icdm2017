We propose visually recognizable binary image and text information as watermark (copyright) information embedded in audio signal. Cepstrum representation of audio can be shown to be very robust to a wide range of attacks. We apply SMM(statistical mean manipulation) theory in embedding image watermarking, and address attacks against lossy audio compression like MP3, white Gaussian noise and so on. A blind detection watermarking can be realized with the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "An audio copyright protection schemes based on SMM in cepstrum domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100102"}
