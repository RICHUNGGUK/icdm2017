Many papers have introduced the problem with the random or fuzzy demands of customers, but few give the case that the customers' demands are random fuzzy. In this paper, the expected cost minimization model, (alpha, beta)-cost minimization model and chance maximization model are presented with random fuzzy demands. In order to solve these random fuzzy models, the simplex algorithm, random fuzzy simulations and genetic algorithm are integrated to produce a hybrid intelligent algorithm. Finally, some numerical examples are provided for the sake of illustration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
