This elementary observation leads to a new bound on the complexity of the overlay of minimization diagrams of collections of d-variate semi-algebraic surfaces, a tight bound on the complexity of the overlay of minimization diagrams of collections of hyperplanes, and faster algorithms for constructing such overlays. Further algorithmic implications are discussed.", "paper_title": "On Overlays and Minimization Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000263976800004"}
