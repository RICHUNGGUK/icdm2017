However, most existing clustering protocols consume large amounts of energy, incurred by cluster formation overhead and fixed-level clustering, particularly when sensor nodes are densely deployed in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose PEACH protocol, which is a power-efficient and adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol for wireless sensor networks. By using overhearing characteristics of wireless communication, PEACH forms clusters without additional overhead and supports adaptive multi-level clustering. In addition, PEACH can be used for both location-unaware and location-aware wireless sensor,networks. The simulation results demonstrate that PEACH significantly minimizes energy consumption of each node and extends the network lifetime, compared with existing clustering protocols. The performance of PEACH is less affected by the distribution of sensor nodes than other clustering protocols. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
