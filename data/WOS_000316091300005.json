The proposed classification system presents two main stages, online system stage and off-line system stage. In online stage, the system classifies inputs and saves misclassification information in order to perform posterior analyses. In the off-line optimization stage, the topology of a Probabilistic Neural Network is optimized by a Feature Selection algorithm combined with the Probabilistic Neural Network to increase the classification rate. The proposed Feature Selection algorithm searches for the signal spectrogram by combining three basic elements: a Sequential Forward Selection algorithm, a Feature Cluster Grow algorithm with classification rate gradient analysis and a Sequential Backward Selection. Also, a trash-data recycling algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal feedback samples selected from the misclassified ones. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
