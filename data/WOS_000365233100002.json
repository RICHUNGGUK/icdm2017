More specifically, in order to benchmark the near-capacity design examples, both the capacity and the Outage Probability (OP) of the Continuous-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (CCMC), of the Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (DCMC) as well as of the Differential Discrete-input Continuous-output Memoryless Channel (D-DCMC) are characterised. Furthermore, the EXIT-chart aided near-capacity design principles are illustrated by detailing the design process of three characteristic prototype schemes, which represent the family of coherent and non-coherent detection based systems as well as Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems, respectively. Moreover, the beneficial application of the EXIT-chart based design principle is also demonstrated in the context of cooperative systems using a specific distributed MIMO prototype scheme.", "paper_title": "Near-Capacity Wireless System Design Principles", "paper_id": "WOS:000365233100002"}
