Our descriptional complexity measure will be the number of rules present in the system. We present two universal time-varying distributed H systems: of degree 2 with 15 rules and of degree 1 with 17 rules, and also three universal splicing test tube systems with 3 or 2 test tubes and 10 rules.", "paper_title": "SMALL UNIVERSAL TVDH AND TEST TUBE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200013"}
