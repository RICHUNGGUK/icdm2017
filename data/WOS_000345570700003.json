This work is a continuation of our earlier research [Komosinski et al. 2012], where a general scheme of the procedure has been proposed. Here, a more advanced system developed to generate and evaluate abductive hypotheses is introduced. Abductive hypotheses have been generated by the implementation of the synthetic tableau method. Prior to the evaluation, the set of hypotheses has undergone several reduction phases. To assess usefulness of abductive hypotheses in the reduced set, several criteria have been employed. The evaluation of efficiency of the hypotheses has been provided by the multicriteria dominance relation. To comprehend the abductive procedure and the evaluation process more extensively, analyses have been conducted on a number of artificially generated abductive problems.", "paper_title": "Identifying Efficient Abductive Hypotheses Using Multicriteria Dominance Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000345570700003"}
