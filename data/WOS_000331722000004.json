Compared with the traditional T-S fuzzy model, the polynomial fuzzy model can represent a nonlinear system more accurately with a smaller number of fuzzy logic rules. It is worth emphasizing that the stability analysis and controller design of polynomial fuzzy model-based (PFMB) control systems are not based on the linear matrix inequalities but the recently developed sum-of-squares decompositions. In this paper, based on an existing result for traditional fuzzy control systems, we propose a new stability condition for the stability analysis of PFMB control systems. Furthermore, the stability of PFMB control systems with parameter uncertainties is investigated. The popular inverted pendulum and an unstable nonlinear system are employed to demonstrate the quality of the proposed stability conditions.", "paper_title": "Analysis of stability and robust stability of polynomial fuzzy model-based control systems using a sum-of-squares approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000331722000004"}
