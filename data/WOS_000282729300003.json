Starting from results of discrete geometry [3,4], the notion of maximal blurred segment of width v 12] has been proposed, well adapted to possibly noisy curves. The first method uses a fixed parameter that is the width of considered maximal blurred segments. The second method is deduced from the first one based on a multi-width approach to obtain a non-parametric method that uses no threshold for working with noisy curves. Comparisons with other methods in the literature prove the efficiency of our approach. Thanks to a recent result [5] concerning the construction of the sequence of maximal blurred segments, the complexity of the proposed methods is O(n log n). An application of vectorization is also given in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
