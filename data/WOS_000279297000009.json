Most previous feature aggregation schemes apply parallel topology, e.g., the linear combination scheme, which suffer from two problems. First, the function of individual visual feature is limited since the ranks of the retrieved images are determined only by the combined similarity. Second, the irrelevant images seriously affect the retrieval performance of feature aggregation scheme since all images in a collection will be ranked. To address these problems, we propose a new feature aggregation scheme, series feature aggregation (SFA). SEA selects relevant images using visual features one by one in series from the images highly ranked by the previous visual feature. The irrelevant images will be effectively filtered out by individual visual features in each stage, and the remaining images are collectively described by all visual features. Experiments, conducted with IAPR TC-12 benchmark image collection (ImageCLEF2006) that contains over 20,000 photographic images and defined queries, have shown that the proposed SFA can outperform conventional parallel feature aggregation schemes.
