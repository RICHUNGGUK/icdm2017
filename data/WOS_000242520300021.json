Hi3 combines efficient and secure end-to-end data plane transmission of HIP with robustness and resilience of i3. The architecture is well-suited for mobile hosts given the support for simultaneous host mobility, rendezvous and multi-homing. Although an Hi3 prototype is implemented and tested on PlanetLab, scalability properties of Hi3 for a large number of hosts are unknown. In this paper, we propose a simple model for bounds of size and latency of the Hi3 control plane for a large number of clients and in the presence of DoS attacks. The model can be used for a first approximation study of a large-scale Internet control plane before its deployment. We apply the model to quantify the performance of the Hi3 control plane. Our results show that the Hi3 control plane can support a large number of mobile hosts with acceptable latency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
