The approach aims at adding new value and playful features to traditional training environments with keeping their original look-and-feel. For example, a game monitoring service enables to automatically record game events so that players can review a gaming process and strategy for soul-searching, or replay most impressive scenes to share the experience with others after the game finishes. Even several services are running on background, digital devices and services are seamlessly integrated to the game environment in unobtrusive way so that players can concentrate on training as usual. The concept can be applied to both traditional games (e. g., poker and the game of Go) and non-gaming activities (e. g., calligraphy and drumming). We developed four case studies on the concept: Augmented Reality Go, EmoPoker, Augmented Calligraphy and AR Drum Kit. We discuss design issues in the reality-oriented augmentation process based on user study results.", "paper_title": "Playful training with augmented reality games: case studies towards reality-oriented system design", "paper_id": "WOS:000313965800012"}
