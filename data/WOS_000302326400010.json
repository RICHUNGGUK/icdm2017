Indeed, in this framework many existing stochastic methods fail in estimating the failure probability with robustness. Therefore, the aim of this article is to present and prove theoretical results about the validity of an original method we have introduced to overcome the specific constraints mentioned above. This new method turns out to be competitive compared with the existing techniques. It is a variant of accelerated Monte Carlo simulation method, named ADS-2-Adaptive Directional Stratification. It combines, in a two steps adaptive strategy, the stratification into quadrants and the directional simulation techniques. Two ADS-2 estimators are presented and their properties are studied.", "paper_title": "Analysis of adaptive directional stratification for the controlled estimation of rare event probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000302326400010"}
