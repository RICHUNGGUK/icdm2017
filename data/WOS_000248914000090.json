While our approach is primarily image-based, we do not model each leaf directly from images due to the large leaf count, small image footprint, and widespread occlusions. Instead, we populate the tree with leaf replicas from segmented source images to reconstruct the overall tree shape. In addition, we use the shape patterns of visible branches to predict those of obscured branches. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of trees.", "paper_title": "Image-based tree modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000090"}
