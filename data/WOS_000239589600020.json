This restricts the applicability of these systems. In this paper, we formalize a sufficient condition under which Bayesian networks can be recovered even with deterministic relations. The sufficient condition leads to an improvement to Pearl's IC algorithm; other constraint-based algorithms can be similarly improved. The new algorithm, assuming the sufficient condition proposed, is able to recover Bayesian networks with deterministic relations, and moreover suffers no loss of performance when applied to nondeterministic Bayesian networks.", "paper_title": "Learning Bayesian networks in semi-deterministic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600020"}
