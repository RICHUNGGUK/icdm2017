This effect becomes especially significant on instance-based learning due to the use of some dissimilarity measure. We analyze the effects of class imbalance on the classifier performance and how the overlap has influence on such an effect, as well as on several techniques proposed in the literature to tackle the class imbalance. Besides, we study how these methods affect to the performance on both classes, not only on the minority class as usual.", "paper_title": "Combined effects of class imbalance and class overlap on instance-based classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900045"}
