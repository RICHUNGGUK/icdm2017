According to the Web Service Architecture (WSA) published by W3C, users can find services through the repository Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI). However, the UDDI may find many web services with similar functions without considering the nonfunctional quality of service (QoS) information. Under such circumstances, users may have difficulty deciding which service is suitable. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based UDDI with QoS support. Unlike many similar researches, the proposed method tries to consider not only the objective factors described by service providers but also the subjective information with trustability evaluations from users who use those services. Genetic algorithm (GA) is adapted to learn user preferences, and fuzzy logic is applied for making decisions. With a fuzzy query interface to input subjective and objective factors, users can determine the most suitable web service for personal use. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
