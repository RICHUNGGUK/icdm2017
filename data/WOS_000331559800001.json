It expounds the idea of designing the CSSCI system, and its major functions and features in particular. The data organization as well as data encoding methods of the CSSCI system is well explained. Moreover, this article elaborates on how the citation index data can be used in analyzing discipline features, exploring research hotspots and developing trends, identifying important academic works and constructing academic network. Such efforts are supposed to help the readers better understand the application value of citation index system. It also provides the academic circle with a new understanding of citation index system.", "paper_title": "The design and application value of the Chinese Social Science Citation Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000331559800001"}
