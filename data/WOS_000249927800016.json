This autonomously exercised policy freedom can cause instability, where unresolvable policy-based disputes in the network result in interdomain route oscillations. Several recent works have established that such instabilities can only be eliminated by enforcing a globally accepted preference ordering on routes (such as shortest path). To resolve this conflict between policy autonomy and system stability, we propose a distributed mechanism that enforces a preference ordering only when disputes resulting in oscillations exist. This preserves policy freedom when possible, and imposes stability when required.", "paper_title": "Resolving inter-domain policy disputes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249927800016"}
