It has various applications in geographical information system (GIS), for example, iso-lines triangulation or the triangulation of polygons in land cadastre. The presented algorithm uses a sweep-line paradigm combined with Lawson's legalisation. An advancing front moves by following the sweep-line. It separates the triangulated and non-triangulated regions of interest. Our algorithm simultaneously triangulates points and constraining edges and thus avoids consuming location of those triangles containing constraining edges, as used by other approaches. The implementation of the algorithm is also considerably simplified by introducing two additional artificial points. Experiments show that the presented algorithm is among the fastest constrained Delaunay triangulation algorithms available at the moment.", "paper_title": "Sweep-line algorithm for constrained Delaunay triangulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254214600005"}
