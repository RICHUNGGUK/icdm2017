In the buckling phase the Von-Karman's equilibrium equation is solved exactly to obtain out-of-plane mode shapes and critical loads. The VonKarman's compatibility equation is solved exactly in the post-buckling phase with the assumption that the deflected form after buckling is a combination of obtained buckling modes (single or multiple mode shapes). The principle of minimum potential energy is invoked to solve for the unknown coefficients in the assumed out-of-plane deflections and rotation functions. (C) 2014 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
