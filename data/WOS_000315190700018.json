In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis for the time-dependent simplified P-N equations up to N = 3. Additionally, SPN equations of arbitrary order are derived in an ad hoc way. The resulting SPN equations are hyperbolic and differ from those investigated in a previous work by some of the authors. In two space dimensions, numerical calculations for the P-N and SPN equations are performed. We simulate neutron distributions of a moving rod and present results for a benchmark problem, known as the checkerboard problem. The SPN equations are demonstrated to yield significantly more accurate results than diffusion approximations. In addition, for sufficiently low values of N, they are shown to be more efficient than P-N models of comparable cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
