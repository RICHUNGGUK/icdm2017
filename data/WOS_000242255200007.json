However, every single-machine subsystem of the power system can be approximated by a set of fuzzy models, every fuzzy model represents a linearized model of the subsystem corresponding to the operating point of the controlled system. In fact, in many cases it is very difficult to estimate accurately many parameters of the dynamic behavior of the power system, namely, the system model is uncertain, there are modeling errors between the fuzzy models and the practice system. Based on these fuzzy models, considering the model uncertainties, a new H-infinity fuzzy tracking control scheme is proposed, the tracking control for the multi-machine interconnected power system with model uncertainties is achieved in this paper. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) is employed to represent the feedback controller, the parameters of the controller are obtained using convex optimization techniques of LMI. The stability of the system is also guaranteed. The stable tracking performances are tested by simulation examples.", "paper_title": "H-infinity fuzzy tracking control for multi-machine interconnected power system with model uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255200007"}
