Molecular geometries calculated at the BP86/6-311G(d) level reveal bowl-shape, trigonal prismatic conformations for all compounds with a variable bowl-depth that depends on the number of mesa-nitrogen atoms in corresponding molecule. TDDFT-PCM calculations predict that the Q-band should undergo gradual high-energy shift, while the B-band should undergo low-energy shift upon stepwise substitution of the mesa-nitrogen atoms in subphthalocyanine toward tribenzosubporphyrin. The TDDFT-PCM predicted trend was rationalized on the basis of electronic structures of target macrocycles. When comparison between theory and experiment is available, TDDFT-PCM calculations are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data.
