Compared with the present schemes of dealing with time delay and hystereses input, the main advantages of the proposed scheme are that the prespecified transient and steady-state performance of tracking error can be guaranteed, the computational burden can be greatly reduced and the explosion of complexity problem inherent in backstepping control can be eliminated. Moreover, the utilisation of saturated-type PrandtlIshlinskii model makes our scheme more applicable. It is proved that the new scheme can guarantee all the closed-loop signals semiglobally uniformly ultimate bounded. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems preceded by unknown hysteresis", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200008"}
