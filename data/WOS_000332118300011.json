Mesh joinery is capable of producing complex fabricable structures in an efficient and visually pleasing manner. We represent an input geometry as a set of planar pieces arranged to compose a rigid structure, by exploiting an efficient slit mechanism. Since slices are planar, to fabricate them a standard 2D cutting system is enough. We automatically arrange slices according to a smooth cross-field defined over the surface. Cross-fields allow representing global features that characterize the appearance of the shape. Slice placement conforms to specific manufacturing constraints.", "paper_title": "Field-Aligned Mesh Joinery", "paper_id": "WOS:000332118300011"}
