For any given constant epsilon > 0, if an instance of the Min-CVCB problem has a minimum vertex cover of size (k(u), k(t)), our algorithm constructs a vertex cover of size (k(u)*, k(t)*), satisfying max {k(u)*/k(u), k(t)*/k(t)} <= 1 + epsilon.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithm based on chain implication for constrained minimum vertex covers in bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000259322900008"}
