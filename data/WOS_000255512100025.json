Specifically, a local minimum of the original function is first obtained, and then a stretching function technique is used to modify the objective function with respect to the obtained local minimum. The transformed function stretches the function values higher than the obtained minimum upward while it keeps the ones with lower values unchanged. Next, an auxiliary function is constructed on the stretched function, which always descends in the region where the function values are higher than the obtained minimum, and it has a stationary point in the lower area. We optimize the auxiliary function and use the found stationary point as the starting point to turn to the first step to restart the search. Repeat the procedure until termination. A theoretical analysis is also made. The main feature of the new method is that it relaxes significantly the requirements for the parameters. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions with different dimensions (up to 50) demonstrate that the new algorithm has a more rapid convergence and a higher success rate, and can find the solutions with higher quality, compared with some other existing similar algorithms, which is consistent with the analysis in theory.
