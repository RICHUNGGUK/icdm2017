Jobs arrive over time. First, we deal with the on-line problem on a bounded batch machine with the objective to minimize makespan. A class of algorithms with competitive ratio (root 5 + 1)/2 are given. Then we consider the scheduling on an unbounded batch machine to minimize the time by which all jobs have been delivered, and provide a class of on-line algorithms with competitive ratio (root 5+ 1)/2. The two class of algorithms are optimal for the problems studied here.", "paper_title": "Optimal on-line algorithms for one batch machine with grouped processing times", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200003"}
