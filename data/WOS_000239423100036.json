However, they rely on computations which are too hard to be performed by humans and are instead done on computers. Trusting a digital signature implies trusting the computer which produced/checked it. Often, this trust cannot be taken for granted. This paper presents a method for visual authentication of large messages which relies on embedding a human-recognizable watermark and needs practically no computational power on the receiver side. Also, using a simple challenge-response mechanism is proposed to prevent attackers from obtaining signatures without author's knowledge.", "paper_title": "Visual document authentication using human-recognizable watermarks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423100036"}
