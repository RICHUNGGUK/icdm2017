We show that the spherical cap discrepancy of random point sets, of spherical digital nets and of spherical Fibonacci lattices converges with order N-1/2. Such point sets are therefore useful for numerical integration and other computational simulations. The proof uses an area-preserving Lambert map. A detailed analysis of the level curves and sets of the pre-images of spherical caps under this map is given.", "paper_title": "Point Sets on the Sphere S-2 with Small Spherical Cap Discrepancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000311503200007"}
