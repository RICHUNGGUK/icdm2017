After introducing the system model and the concept of ergodic capacity of MIMO channels, we derive the explicit expressions for the expected values of the determinant and log-determinant of complex noncentral Wishart matrices. Subsequently, we obtain new upper and lower bounds on the ergodic capacity of rank-1 Ricean-fading MIMO channels at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that our bounds are tighter than previously reported analytical bounds, and discuss the impact of spatial fading correlation and Ricean K-factor with the help of these bounds. Furthermore, we extend the analysis of ergodic capacity to frequency selective spatially correlated Ricean-fading MIMO channels. We demonstrate that the calculation of ergodic capacity of frequency selective fading MIMO channels can be converted to the calculation of the one of equivalent frequency flat-fading MIMO channels. Finally, we present numerical results that confirm the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "On the ergodic capacity of rank-1 Ricean-fading MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000243953400004"}
