A novel observer named impulsive observer is presented to estimate the states of SCIG. Conditions for the existence of the impulsive observer are established by using linear matrix inequalities. A realization for the observer in SCIG is proposed. Simulation results are provided to show the validation of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FLUX DETECTION BY USING IMPULSIVE OBSERVER FOR WIND ENERGY APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000323354000004"}
