This information is stored in lookup tables. To be accurate and effective, these optimizations usually require large dedicated on-chip tables. Although technology advances offer an increased amount of on-chip resources, these resources are allocated to increase the size of on-chip conventional cache hierarchies. This work proposes Predictor Virtualization, a technique that uses the existing memory hierarchy to emulate large predictor tables. We demonstrate the benefits of this technique by virtualizing a state-of-the-art data prefetcher. Full-system, cycle-accurate simulations demonstrate that the virtualized prefetcher preserves the performance benefits of the original design, while reducing the on-chip storage dedicated to the predictor table from 60KB down to less than one kilobyte.", "paper_title": "Predictor virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000256501300017"}
