By exploiting the semantic relationships that characterize learning objects (LOs) and learner profile, the approach dynamically selects, sequences, and links learning resources into a coherent, individualized curriculum to address learners' focused learning needs. We developed an active learning system with semantic support for learners to access and navigate through learning resources in an efficient and personalized manner, while providing facilities for instructors to manipulate the structured learning resources via a convenient visual interface.", "paper_title": "Topic-centered adaptive curriculum for e-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300048"}
