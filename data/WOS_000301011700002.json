The project provides a scalable and sustainable infrastructure, called the Entity Name System (ENS), for the systematic reuse of global and unique entity identifiers. The ENS provides a collection of core services supporting entity identifiers pervasive reuse. The ENS is required to be reliable data intensive load-balancing cluster system for service provisioning. Given the project's successful outcome, this paper presents the ENS security framework and how it enables scalable secure service provisioning underpinned by trust negotiation based access control. A detailed security performance evaluation is given, with supporting conclusions of scalable and efficient security design and implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
