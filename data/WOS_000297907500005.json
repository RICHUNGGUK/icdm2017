A new form of evolution equation of damage, which is a function of plastic relative rotational angles, is introduced in order to remove the mesh-dependence caused by the strain-dependence of damage. The elasto-plastic damage behavior of framed structures can be accurately and efficiently predicted by the combination of the ASI technique and the new damage evolution equation. Some numerical studies are carried out to show the mesh-independence of the proposed computational method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
