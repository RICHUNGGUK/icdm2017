Starlink applications were used extensively, primarily in the UK astronomical community, and form the basis of a number of advanced data reduction pipelines today. This paper provides an overview of the historical drivers for the development of NDF and the lessons learned from using a defined hierarchical data model for many years in data reduction software, data pipelines and in data acquisition systems.
