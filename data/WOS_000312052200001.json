Some sample theorems about the boundaries of algorithmic scientific inference are then presented and interpreted. There is some discussion about (but there are not presentations of) succinct machine self-reference proofs of these theorems and whether non-artifactual self-referential examples may exist in the world. There is also a brief discussion regarding the possibility that the expected behavior of reality may be infeasibly computable.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic Scientific Inference Within Our Computable Expected Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000312052200001"}
