It is called the dynamic pump wavelength selection (DPS) switch. A PWC, which performs multiple wavelength conversion, uses a pump wavelength that can be flexibly chosen to define which wavelengths can be converted. To enhance switch performance, the DPS switch employs a matching scheme, which sets connections between input and output ports, in combination with dynamic pump wavelength selection; a conventional switch, on the other hand, performs matching with a given set of pump wavelengths that are configured in a static manner. The dynamic pump wavelength selection is used to select the pump wavelength for each PWC to maximize the number of wavelength conversion pairs supported. Numerical results from a simulation show that the DPS switch provides lower blocking rates than the conventional switch with pump wavelengths assigned statically, under both uniform and nonuniform traffic.", "paper_title": "Optical Packet Switch Based on Dynamic Pump Wavelength Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459900007"}
