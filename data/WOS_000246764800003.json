The technique is based on using peak cancellation to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the input signal. Conventional iterative peak cancellation requires several iterations so as to converge into the targeted PAPR, since filtering causes peak re-growth. The proposed algorithm is able to eliminate several iterations, which subsequently saves hardware resources. In numerical simulations using four WCDMA carriers, it achieves a PAPR of 5.7 dB with a fixed EVM of 10%. A 240 W PEP Class AB power amplifier was utilized to verify the performance of the proposed technique and demonstrate the efficiency gains. The measured results demonstrate that this algorithm can enhance the efficiency of our PA by up to 6.6%, when compared to the efficiency without the PAPR technique.", "paper_title": "An efficient crest factor reduction technique for wideband applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000246764800003"}
