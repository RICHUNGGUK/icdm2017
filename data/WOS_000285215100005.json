The proposed architecture implements a division operation of two inputs by means of a logarithmic transformation, in which the division can be performed with a subtraction. A combination of non-uniform segmentation and multipartite LUT technique is proposed for the arctangent of the logarithm approximation. The architecture was implemented in a Xilinx FPGA device achieving higher throughput than the approach based on CORDIC algorithm and lower area than previous LUT-based approaches.
