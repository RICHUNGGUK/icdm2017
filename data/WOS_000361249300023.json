Due to nonlinear and nonconvex physics and engineering models as well as discrete controllability of active network devices, these problems lead to difficult nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear optimization models. The proposed method is based on mixed-integer linear techniques using piecewise linear relaxations of the nonlinearities and a tailored alternating direction method. Most other publications in the field of gas transport optimization only consider pressure and flow as main physical quantities. In this work, we additionally incorporate heat power supplies and demands as well as a mixing model for different gas qualities. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method on Germany's largest transport networks and hereby present numerical results on the largest instances that were ever reported in the literature for this problem class.
