Modern optical flow algorithms employ the coarse to fine approach. We suggest to upgrade this class of algorithms, by adding over-fine interpolated levels to the pyramid. Theoretical analysis of the coarse to over-fine approach explains its advantages in handling flow-field discontinuities and simulations show its benefit for sub-pixel motion. By applying the suggested technique to various multi-scale optical flow algorithms, we reduced the estimation error by 10-30% on the common test sequences. Using the coarse to over-fine technique, we obtain optical flow estimation results that are currently the best for benchmark sequences. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
