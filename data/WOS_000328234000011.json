The goal of such systems is to respond adequately to population calls by providing first aid services and transferring patients, when needed, to the emergency department of the appropriate hospital. In order to achieve this goal, a variety of tools (e.g. simulation, mathematical programming and queuing theory models) have been used to improve the performance of EMS. This paper focuses specifically on computer simulation models used for the analysis and improvement of EMS. In particular, we give a critical overview of the existing international literature on simulation models for EMS by pinpointing the issues considered, the associated modeling assumptions as well as the results obtained. Such a contribution is lacking in the current literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
