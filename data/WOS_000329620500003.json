The motion features in a video are often used to detect events because an event may contain some specific actions or moving patterns. Raw motion features are extracted from the entire video first and then aggregated to form the final video representation. However, this video-based representation approach is ineffective when used for realistic videos because the video length can be very different and the clues for determining an event may happen in only a small segment of the entire video. In this paper, we propose using a segment-based approach for video representation. Basically, original videos are divided into segments for feature extraction and classification, while still keeping the evaluation at the video level. The experimental results on recent TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection datasets proved the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Multimedia Event Detection Using Segment-Based Approach for Motion Feature", "paper_id": "WOS:000329620500003"}
