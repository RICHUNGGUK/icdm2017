However, the research concerning TDD is at its beginning and the body of knowledge is largely immature. This paper discusses an experiment carried out within a Spanish software company with the aim of comparing productivity in TDD and TAC.", "paper_title": "Productivity of test driven development: A controlled experiment with professionals", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900028"}
