The main result of this work is a complete characterization of the set of achievable distortion pairs at the two receivers given a power constraint at the transmitter. Further, a constructive hybrid uncoded-coded scheme consisting of the cascade of source coding with side information and channel coding with side information systems is shown to achieve the entire power-mean squared error (MSE) distortion region associated with the problem. An interesting operating point in this region is one where the digital receiver obtains the classical point-to-point optimal quality and the analog receiver attains the best possible simultaneously achievable distortion. This problem is motivated by the practical application of the seamless \"in-band\" digital upgrade of legacy analog transmission systems.", "paper_title": "Colored Gaussian source-channel broadcast for heterogeneous (analog/digital) receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300035"}
