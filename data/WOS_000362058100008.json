In relational databases, higher-order queries appear in numerous aspects including query rewriting and query specification. This work investigates languages that combine higher-order transformations with ordinary relational database query languages. We study the two most basic computational problems associated with these query languages - the evaluation problem and the containment problem. We isolate the complexity of evaluation at every order, in an analysis similar to that for that standard typed lambda calculus. We show that the containment problem (and hence, the equivalence problem) is decidable in several important subcases, particularly in the case where query constants and variables range over the positive relational operators. The main decidability result relies on techniques that differ from those used in classical query containment. We also show that the analysis of higher-order queries is closely connected to the evaluation and containment problems for non-recursive Datalog. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
