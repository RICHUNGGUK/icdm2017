These currents have undesirable effects, including potential damage to the transformer, reduced power quality on the system, and relay malfunction. In the present article the effect of voltage sag on inrush current are investigated. Due to aim of this article which is educational purpose the well-known software MATLAB-SIMULINK is used to simulate the effect of voltage sag on inrush current. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
