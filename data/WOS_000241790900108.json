The Internet allows access to large numbers of documents archived in digital format. However, no user can be an expert in every field, and they trouble finding the documents that suit their purposes experts when they cannot formulate queries that narrow the search to the context they have in mind. Accordingly, we propose a method for extracting terms from searched documents to replace user-provided query terms. Our results show that our method is successful in discovering terms that can be used to narrow the search.", "paper_title": "A new measure for query disambiguation using term co-occurrences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900108"}
