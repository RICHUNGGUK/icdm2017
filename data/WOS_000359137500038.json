In the literature, most identity-based multi-proxy signature, proxy multi-signature and multi-proxy multi-signature schemes are based on bilinear pairings. Without incorporating bilinear pairings, Tiwari and Padhye proposed an identity-based proxy multi-signature scheme in 2011. Subsequently, an identity-based multi-proxy multi-signature scheme was proposed by Tiwari et al. in 2012. First, we review identity-based (multi)-proxy multi-signature schemes without bilinear pairings and show that unfortunately, they are insecure in their security models. Secondly, we propose an identity-based multi-proxy multi-signature scheme without bilinear pairings, where identity-based multi-proxy signature and proxy multi-signature schemes are its special cases. Then, we prove that they are secure under Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) assumption in the random oracle model by presenting a new Forking Lemma. The proposal and its special cases are the first identity-based multi-proxy signature, proxy multi-signature and multi-proxy multi-signature from RSA assumption.", "paper_title": "An Identity-Based Multi-Proxy Multi-Signature Scheme Without Bilinear Pairings and its Variants", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500038"}
