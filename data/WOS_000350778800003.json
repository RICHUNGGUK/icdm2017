The complementary role played by RED under these circumstances is illustrated and discussed for a shallow foundation, a reinforced rock slope, a Norwegian clay slope with spatial variability, a laterally loaded pile requiring implicit numerical analysis, and an anchored sheet pile wall. A pragmatic RBD approach involving first-order reliability method (FORM) only and a more rigorous RBD approach involving both first-order and second-order reliability method (SORM) are offered. Both approaches are imple-mentable using either spreadsheet-based FORM and SORM procedures, or using various commercially available FORM/SORM packages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
