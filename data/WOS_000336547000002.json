In this new scenario, there are several challenges for VoIP providers. First, VoIP requires a detailed monitoring of both users' quality of service (QoS) and experience (QoE) to a greater extent than in traditional PSTNs. Second, such a monitoring process must be able to track VoIP traffic in high-speed networks, nowadays typically of multi-Gb/s rates. Third, recent government directives require that providers retain information from their users' calls. Similarly, the convergence of data and voice services allows operators to provide new services such as full-data retention, in which users' calls can be recorded for either quality assessment (call centers, QoE) or security purposes (lawful interception). This implies a significant investment in infrastructure, especially in large-scale networks which require multiple points of measurement and redundancy. This paper proposes a novel methodology, architecture and system to fulfill such challenges, called VoIPCallMon, as well as the data structures and necessary hardware-tuning knowledge for its development. As distinguishing features, VoIPCallMon provides very high performance, being able to process VoIP traffic on-the-fly at high bitrates, novel services and significant cost reduction by using commodity hardware with minimal interference with operational VoIP networks. The performance evaluation shows that the system copes with the VoIP load of real-world operators. We further evaluated the system performance at a fully saturated 10 Gb/s link and no packet loss was reported, therefore demonstrating the potential of commodity hardware solutions.
