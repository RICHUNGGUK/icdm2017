Some influence methods, such as the local influence and generalized leverage, are presented. Additionally, we derived the normal curvatures of local influence under some perturbation schemes. An empirical application to a real data set is presented in order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A log-Birnbaum-Saunders regression model with asymmetric errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000310959200006"}
