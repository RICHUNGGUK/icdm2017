This algorithm starts with a new suitable partition of the n-simplex over which the algebraic splines are defined. Then a cubic algebraic spline is constructed which meets the initial surfaces with G(2) continuity. Examples are provided to demonstrate the blending process. The results show some advantages of the new blending method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
