However, most conventional approaches predict future contact without considering its uncertainty, which makes a limitation on routing performance. A novel approach is proposed by employing interval algebra to characterize the contact's uncertainty and time-varying nature. The contact is predicted by using the Bayesian estimation to achieve a better routing performance. Simulation results show that this approach achieves a good balance between delivery latency and delivery ratio.", "paper_title": "An Interval Algebra-based Modeling and Routing Method in Bus Delay Tolerant Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000354983500006"}
