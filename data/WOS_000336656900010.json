After that, by comparing the difference of wavelet power spectra of real climatic time series and red noise, we can extract intrinsic features of climatic time series. Finally, we use our method to analyze Arctic Oscillation (AO) which is a key aspect of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere, and discover a great change in fundamental properties of the AO, commonly called a regime shift or tripping point.", "paper_title": "HAAR WAVELET ANALYSIS OF CLIMATIC TIME SERIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000336656900010"}
