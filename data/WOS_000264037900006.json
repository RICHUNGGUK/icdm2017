The problem is often an important and strategic operations management problem in SCM. The design task involves the choice of facilities (plants and distribution centers (DCs)) to be opened and the distribution network design to satisfy the customer demand with minimum cost. This paper presents it solution procedure based on steady-state genetic algorithms (ssGA) with it new encoding structure for the design of a single-source, multi-product, multi-stage SCN. The effectiveness of the ssGA has been investigated by comparing its results with those obtained by CPLEX, Lagrangean heuristic, hyrid GA and simulated annealing on a set of SCN design problems with different sizes.
