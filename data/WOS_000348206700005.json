However, little progress has been made for ISTs in general BC networks. In this paper, we first propose the definitions of conditional BC networks and V-dimensional-permutation. We then give a linear parallel algorithm of ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex in conditional BC networks, which include hypercubes, crossed cubes, locally twisted cubes, and Mobius cubes, based on the ascending circular dimensional-permutation, where the ISTs are all isomorphic to the binomial-like tree. In addition, we show that there exists an efficient algorithm to construct a spanning tree rooted at an arbitrary vertex in any BC network X-n, and all V-dimensional-permutations can be used to construct spanning trees isomorphic to the n-level binomial tree and rooted at an arbitrary vertex in X-n.", "paper_title": "Dimensional-Permutation-Based Independent Spanning Trees in Bijective Connection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206700005"}
