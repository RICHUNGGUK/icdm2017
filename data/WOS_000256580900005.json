Unlike Web caching, which exploits the temporal locality, Web prefetching utilizes the spatial locality of Web objects. Specifically, Web prefetching fetches objects that are likely to be accessed in the near future and stores them in advance. In this context, a sophisticated combination of these two techniques may cause significant improvements on the performance of the Web infrastructure. Considering that there have been several caching policies proposed in the past, the challenge is to extend them by using data mining techniques. In this paper, we present a clustering-based prefetching scheme where a graph-based clustering algorithm identifies clusters of \"correlated\" Web pages based on the users' access patterns. This scheme can be integrated easily into a Web proxy server, improving its performance. Through a simulation environment, using a real data set, we show that the proposed integrated framework is robust and effective in improving the performance of the Web caching environment.
