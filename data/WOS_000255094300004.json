Two symmetrical linear arrays can be dynamically reconfigured that could switch radiation pattern with a switchable feed circuit between direction and onmidirection. The antenna can also be used for a pattern diversity antenna for the multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems. The design process for the antenna system is given, and the parameters and characteristics of the antennas are achieved by the method. Measured return losses, isolation, and radiation patterns are in good agreement with the simulated ones, which illustrates that the method is valid and the antenna system can be integrated with pattern reconfigurable and pattern diversity applications.
