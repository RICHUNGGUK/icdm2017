Given an existing animation, the artist directly manipulates the deformable body at any time frame, and the surrounding animation immediately adjusts in response. The automatic adjustments are designed to respect physics, preserve detail in both the input motion and geometry, respect prescribed bilateral contact constraints, and controllably and smoothly decay in spacetime. While the utility of interactive editing for rigid body and articulated figure animations is widely recognized, a corresponding approach to deformable bodies has not been technically feasible before. We achieve interactive rates by combining spacetime model reduction, rotation-strain coordinate warping, linearized elasticity, and direct manipulation. This direct editing tool can serve the final stages of animation production, which often call for detailed, direct adjustments that are otherwise tedious to realize by re-simulation or frame-by-frame editing.", "paper_title": "Interactive Editing of Deformable Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000308250300046"}
