By using Lyapunov functions and Razumikhin techniques, several global exponential stability and uniform stability criteria are derived, which can be applied to impulsive functional differential equations with any time delays. The results obtained improve and extend those in earlier publications. Moreover, our results show that delay differential equations can be exponentially stabilized by impulses in which the state variables are related to the time delay. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the results obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
