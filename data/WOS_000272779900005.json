We provide a result that characterizes any isometry based on the order structure in the original poset. From this result we provide upper bounds for the number of isometries over the order polytope in terms of its number of connected components. Finally, as an example of application, we recover the set of isometries for the polytope of fuzzy measures and the polytope of p-symmetric measures when the indifference partition is fixed.
