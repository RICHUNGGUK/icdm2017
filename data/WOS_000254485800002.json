Vie introduce a small set of fully distributed positioning rules to guide the birds' movements and demonstrate, by means of simulations, that they tend to lead to stabilization into several of the well-known V like formations that have been observed in nature. Vie also provide quantitative indicators that we believe are closely related to achieving NI-like formations, and study their behavior over a large set of independent simulations.", "paper_title": "V-like formations in flocks of artificial birds", "paper_id": "WOS:000254485800002"}
