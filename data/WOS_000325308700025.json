A set L subset of V (G) is a liar's dominating set if (1) vertical bar N-G[v]boolean AND L vertical bar >= 2 for all v is an element of V (G), and (2) vertical bar(N-G[u] boolean OR N-G[v])boolean AND L vertical bar >= 3 for every pair u, v is an element of V(G) of distinct vertices in G, where N-G[x] = {y is an element of V vertical bar xy is an element of E} boolean OR {x} is the closed neighborhood of x in G. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the liar's domination problem is to check whether G has a liar's dominating set of size at most k. The liar's domination problem is known to be NP-complete for general graphs. In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm for computing a minimum cardinality liar's dominating set in a proper interval graph. We also strengthen the NP-completeness result of liar's domination problem for general graphs by proving that the problem remains NP-complete even for undirected path graphs which is a super class of proper interval graphs.
