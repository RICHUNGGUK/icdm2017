A graph is called antimagic if it has all antimagic labeling. The antimagicness of the Cartesian product of graphs in several special cases has been studied [Tao-Ming Wang, Toroidal grids are anti-magic, in: Proc. 11th Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference, COOCOON'2005, in: LNCS, vol. 3595, Springer, 2005, pp. 671-679, Yongxi Cheng, A new class of antimagic cartesian product graphs, Discrete Mathematics 308 (24) (2008) 6441-6448]. In this paper, we develop new construction methods that are applied to more general cases. We prove that the Cartesian product of paths is antimagic, if one of them has at least three edges. This (almost) answers the open problems ill [Yongxi Cheng, Lattice grids and prisms are antimagic, Theoretical Computer Science 374 (2007) 66-73]. We also prove that the Cartesian product of an antimagic regular graph and a connected graph is antimagic, which extends the results of the latter of the two references, where several special cases are studied.
