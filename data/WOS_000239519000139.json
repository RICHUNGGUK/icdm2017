The solution emulates the computer mouse and consequently it gives its user direct access to any mouse controlled SW system. One of those is a SW keyboard, which is nowadays a common part of computer operating system. In the same way the system can be combined with other text entering solutions. Section 4 provides a brief report on corresponding preliminary experiments as well as description of some edutainment applications, for which I4Control (R) device seems to be very well suited. The very same solution can be applied for design of a control element in a computer-driven working environment where the hands of the PC user have to be engaged in another (primary) activity (i.e., during medical surgery or when handling greasy components of a complex machine).", "paper_title": "Eye as an actuator", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000139"}
