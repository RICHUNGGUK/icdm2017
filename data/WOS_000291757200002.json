In 2006, Shieh-Wang pointed out the weakness of Juang's remote mutual authentication scheme using smart card and further proposed a novel remote user authentication scheme using smart card. However, this paper demonstrates that Shieh-Wang's scheme still does not provide perfect forward secrecy and is vulnerable to a privileged insider's attack. We also present an improved scheme based on the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP) and secure one-way hash function, in order to isolate such security problems.", "paper_title": "Remote mutual authentication and key agreement scheme based on elliptic curve cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000291757200002"}
