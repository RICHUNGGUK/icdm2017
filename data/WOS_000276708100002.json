In this paper, we investigate the problem of building a unique cast tree of minimum total energy, which we call Minimum Unique Cast (MUC) tree, to be used for all-to-all broadcast. The MUC tree is unoriented and unrooted. We study three known heuristics for the minimum-energy broadcast problem: the Broadcast Incremental Power (BIP) algorithm, the Wireless Multicast Advantage-conforming Minimum Spanning Tree (WMA-conforming MST) algorithm, and the Iterative Maximum-Branch Minimization (IMBM) algorithm. Experimental results conducted on various types of networks are reported. We show that neither of these methods is best overall for building all-to-all broadcast trees.
