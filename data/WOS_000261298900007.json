For small experiments, these approximations can be poor and result in estimators with considerable bias. We investigate the properties of designs for small experiments when the response is described by a simple logistic regression model and parameter estimators are to be obtained by the maximum penalized likelihood method of Firth [Firth, D., 1993, Bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates. Biometrika, 80, 27-38]. Although this method achieves a reduction in bias, we illustrate that the remaining bias may be substantial for small experiments, and propose minimization of the integrated mean square error, based on Firth's estimates, as a suitable criterion for design selection. This approach is used to find locally optimal designs for two support points.", "paper_title": "Design considerations for small experiments and simple logistic regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000261298900007"}
