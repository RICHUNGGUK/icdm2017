Spielman and Teng then proved that the Fiedler Value - the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix - of the k-NNG of any n points in R(d) is O((k/n)(2/d)). In this paper, we extend these two results to nearest neighbor graphs in a metric space with a finite doubling dimension and in a metric space that is nearly-Euclidean. We prove that for every l > 0. if (X, dist) forms a metric space with doubling dimension gamma, then the k-NNG of every set P of n points in X has a vertex separator of size O(k(2)l(64l + 8)(2 gamma) log(2) L/S log n + n/l), where L and S are, respectively, the maximum and minimum distances between any two points in P. We show how to use the singular value decomposition method to approximate a k-NNG in a nearly-Euclidean space by a Euclidean k-NNG. This approximation enables us to obtain an upper bound on the Fiedler value of k-NNGs in a nearly-Euclidean space. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
