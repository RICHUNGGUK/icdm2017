In fact, for many processes, products are either connected or autocorrelated and, consequently, obtained observations are autocorrelative rather than independent. In this scenario, applying an independence assumption instead of autocorrelation for process monitoring is unsuitable. This study examines a generally weighted moving average (GWMA) with a time-varying control chart for monitoring the mean of a process based on autocorrelated observations from a first-order autoregressive process (AR(1)) with random error. Simulation is utilized to evaluate the average run length (ARL) of exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and GWMA control charts. Numerous comparisons of ARLs indicate that the GWMA control chart requires less time to detect various shifts at low levels of autocorrelation than those at high levels of autocorrelation. The GWMA control chart is more sensitive than the EWMA control chart for detecting small shifts in a process mean.", "paper_title": "Monitoring the mean of autocorrelated observations with one generally weighted moving average control chart", "paper_id": "WOS:000271650500001"}
