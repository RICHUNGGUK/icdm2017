Detection of fundamental heart sounds (HSs), S1s and S2s, is considered to be a crucial step in PCG analysis. Electrocardiogram (ECG), noted as a reference signal, is often synchronously recorded in order to simplify the S1/S2 detection process. Nevertheless, electronic stethoscopes are frequently used without additional ECG equipment. We propose a new algorithm for automatic fundamental HSs detection via: joint time-frequency representation based on pseudo affine Wigner-Ville distribution (PAWVD), Haar wavelet lifting scheme (Haar-LS), normalized average Shannon energy (NASE) and autocorrelation. The performance of the proposed algorithm was calculated on both normal (SO) and pathological (75) PCG recordings, eight seconds long each, contributed by 125 different pediatric patients. The algorithm showed relatively high recall (90.41%) and precision (96.39%) rates of S1/S2 detection procedure in a variety of PCG signals, without ECG as a reference. Furthermore, it indicated the ability to overcome splitting within the S1/S2 heart sounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
