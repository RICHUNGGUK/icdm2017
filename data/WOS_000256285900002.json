In this paper, ant colony systems (ACSs) are used to optimize the process of finding the collapse load factor of two-dimensional frames. Three variants of ACS algorithms are developed and their relative performances are compared. It is observed that if an ACS is finely tuned and its parameters are carefully adjusted, satisfactory results can be obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
