This method comprises two stages. In the first stage, a fractional factorial design (2(6-2)) is carried out in order to address the responses, reduce later experimentation and study how the factors, though confounded, interact with each other. In the second stage, optimization is carried out using the simplex algorithm. This method has advantages over response surface modelling, for example, when the number of significant factors is high. If simplex is begun in a suitable zone, the number of experiments may be considerably reduced.
