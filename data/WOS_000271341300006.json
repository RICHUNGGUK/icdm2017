The results accuracy and the solution convergence are governed by mesh size and contact algorithms options. Their influences were investigated to evaluate displacements and stresses near the contact edge where fretting fatigue failure occurs. Four contact algorithms were tested: Penalty function, Augmented Lagrangian, Normal Lagrange and Pure Lagrange. Performance criteria such as precision and time were highlighted and specific convergence control parameters were found. Finally, best practice rules for interference fit FEA are specified.
