The recent influx of new sequence data in the biosciences means that to address evolutionary questions, we need a means for rapid and easy model development and implementation. Here we present GeLL, a Java library that lets users use text to quickly and efficiently define novel forms of discrete data and create new substitution models that describe how those data change on a phylogeny. GeLL allows users to define general substitution models and data structures in a way that is not possible in other existing libraries, including mixture models and non-reversible models. Classes are provided for calculating likelihoods, optimizing model parameters and branch lengths, ancestral reconstruction and sequence simulation.", "paper_title": "GeLL: a generalized likelihood library for phylogenetic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000358173500025"}
