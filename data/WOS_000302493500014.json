The limited processing capabilities of the contemporary in-car computers in smart cars may cause bottlenecks in smart control. The content in smart car applications can hardly be extended. In addition, the traditional software installation approach that is used in smart cars is neither economical nor convenient. To address these issues in smart cars, this paper presents a Cloud-based Information Integration Platform that has the ability to improve flexibility and enhance the value of smart cars. In this work, the architecture of the Cloud-based Information Integration Platform was designed based on new technologies such as Cloud computing, Web Services, and Controller Area Network Applications. This service-oriented solution has a vertically integrated architecture that uses full information gathering and service driven synergies. To achieve the smart control and information sharing in smart cars, we also designed a Smart Car Information Service as the user interface to implement smart car applications through customized business processes. This fills the information processing gap between the smart car and cloud computing. The proposed platform can be used for different usage scenarios, such as car diagnosis, car repair facilitation, etc.", "paper_title": "A Cloud-Based Design of Smart Car Information Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000302493500014"}
