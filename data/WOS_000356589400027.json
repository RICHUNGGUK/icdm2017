In this paper, we propose a novel distance called Split-Jaccard Distance of Hierarchical Decompositions. It extends the Jaccard coefficient and incorporates the concept of the splits of leaves in a hierarchical decomposition. We analyze the proposed distance and derive its properties, including the lower-bound and the metric space.", "paper_title": "Split-Jaccard Distance of Hierarchical Decompositions for Software Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589400027"}
