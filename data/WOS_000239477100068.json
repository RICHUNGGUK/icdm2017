To assess such a system, students with different abilities use it, and then researchers measure how well it addresses their needs. In this paper, we describe an approach using simulated students to perform this assessment. This enables researchers to determine if the system functions well enough for the students to learn the curriculum and how factors such as corpus size and retrieval criteria affect performance. We discuss how we have used simulated students to assess the REAP system and to prepare for an upcoming study, as well as future work.", "paper_title": "Using simulated students for the assessment of authentic document retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100068"}
