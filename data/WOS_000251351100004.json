This provides an upper bound for the rate of production or destruction of entanglement induced dynamically. We then investigate the dependence of the upper bound on the degree of chaos of the system, which in turn, through the inequality, gives a measure of the stability of the entangled state. Our analytical results are supported by extensive numerical calculations.", "paper_title": "A curvature dependent bound for entanglement change in classically chaotic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351100004"}
