These distributed pervasive systems take advantage of resources and enhance collaborations worldwide. However, due to lack of central management, they are severely threatened by a variety of malicious users in today's Internet. Current reputation-and anonymity-based technologies for node communication enhance system trustworthiness. However, most of these technologies gain trustworthiness at the cost of efficiency degradation. This paper presents a P2P-based infrastructure for trustworthy and efficient node communication in wide-area distributed systems. It jointly addresses trustworthiness and efficiency in its operation in order to meet the high-performance requirements of a diversified wealth of distributed pervasive applications. The infrastructure includes two policies: trust/efficiency-oriented request routing and trust-based adaptive anonymous response forwarding. This infrastructure not only offers a trustworthy environment with anonymous communication but also enhances overall system efficiency through harmonious trustworthiness and efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results from simulations and the real-world PlanetLab testbed show the superior performance of the P2P-based infrastructure in achieving both high trustworthiness and high efficiency in comparison to other related approaches.", "paper_title": "A P2P-Based Infrastructure for Adaptive Trustworthy and Efficient Communication in Wide-Area Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000002"}
