It also proposes a new approach that consists of measuring two validity indices - predictive and mediating efficiencies - to compare the efficacies of a research model with and without a higher-order abstraction. To illustrate this concept, we test a second- order measurement model of trust and study how it behaves in a nomological network of the consumer's prior experience as an antecedent and willingness to buy as a consequent variable.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Testing Nomological Validity and Its Application to a Second-Order Measurement Model of Trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000321816800001"}
