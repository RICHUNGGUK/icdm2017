The objective is to find a mechanism to mitigate the UL interference between the two subsystems and maximize the weighted sum throughput as well. This optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) which is further decomposed into PRBs assignment and transmission power allocation. Specifically, the scenario of applying imperfect channel state information (CSI) is also taken into account in our study. Analysis reveals that the proposed PRBs allocation strategy is energy efficient and it suppresses the interference not only suffered by the LTE-A system but also to the D2D users. In another side, a low-complexity technique is proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation which resides in one of at most three feasible power vectors. Simulations show that the optimal power allocation combined with the proposed PRBs assignment achieves a higher weighted sum throughput as compared to traditional algorithms even when imperfect CSI is utilized.", "paper_title": "Interference-Aware Radio Resource Allocation in D2D Underlaying LTE-Advanced Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333200003"}
