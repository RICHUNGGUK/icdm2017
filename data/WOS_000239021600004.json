We provide an efficient zone-based algorithm for minimum-cost reachability. Furthermore, we show how the simple structure of the linear programs encountered during symbolic minimum-cost reachability analysis of priced timed automata can be exploited in order to substantially improve the performance of the current algorithm. The idea is rooted in duality of linear programs and we show that each encountered linear program can be reduced to the dual problem of an instance of the min-cost flow problem. Experimental results using UPPAAL show a 70-80 percent performance gain. We provide priced timed automata models for the scheduling problems and provide experimental results illustrating the potential competitiveness of our approach compared to existing approaches such as mixed integer linear programming.", "paper_title": "On using priced timed automata to achieve optimal scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000239021600004"}
