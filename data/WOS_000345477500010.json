The liquid phase turbulence is described by the k-epsilon model and the Reynolds stress model (RSM). Simulation results are compared with experimental data from the literature. For the bubble column operated at 0.10 m/s, minor difference is found in the predicted profiles when using 10 and 20 bubble classes. With the Rampure drag coefficient, Tomiyama lift coefficient and bubble-induced turbulence (BIT), the gas holdup is well predicted by both k-epsilon model and RSM. For the bubble column operated at 0.12 m/s, good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the k-epsilon BIT model works with the Tsuchiya drag coefficient and Tomiyama lift coefficient. The RSM with BIT also gives reasonable prediction when using the combination of Tsuchiya drag coefficient and Tomiyama lift coefficient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
