Automatic knot detection and segmentation in the presence of wet areas like sapwood for softwood species is a recurrent problem in the literature. This article describes an algorithm named TEKA able to segment knots even into sapwood and other wet areas by using parallel tangential slices into the log that enable to follow the knot from the stem pith to the bark. On each tangential slice, knot pith is detected, then knot diameter is estimated by analyzing gray level variations around the knot pith. A validation was performed on 125 knots from five softwood species. The CT slice resolution ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mm/pixel with an interval between slices of 1.25 mm. Compared to manual diameter measurements performed on the same CT slices, the TEKA algorithm led to a RMSE of 3.37 mm and a bias of 0.81 mm, which is rather good compared to other algorithms working only in heartwood.
