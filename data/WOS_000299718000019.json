Similar to the conventional MTCMOS switches, the tri-modal switch comes in two flavors: header and footer. The hi-modal switch provides three different power modes for the underlying circuit: active, drowsy, and sleep. The ability of data retention in the drowsy mode makes the proposed tri-modal switch an excellent candidate for implementing data-retentive power gating designs. We will see that three different low-power design schemes, namely data-retentive power gating, multi-drowsy mode structures, and on-chip dynamic voltage scaling, are implemented using the proposed tri-modal switch. We show that our proposal introduces superior low-power solutions across various circuit operating modes using a single circuitry.", "paper_title": "Design of a Tr-Modal Multi-Threshold CMOS Switch With Application to Data Retentive Power Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000019"}
