Through reducing the forwarding times for data packets in MANET, NCRM can not only decrease the energy consumption but also improve the throughput performance. To satisfy the maximum end-to-end delay deadline requirements for real-time services, NCRM adopts a mechanism with strict delay constraints. Simulation results show that, in those real-time multicast scenarios with many receivers and/or high node motilities, NCRM outperforms those traditional protocols such as PUMA and MAODV in terms of transmission reliability and energy consumption significantly.", "paper_title": "REAL-TIME MULTICAST WITH NETWORK CODING IN MOBILE AD-HOC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578100002"}
