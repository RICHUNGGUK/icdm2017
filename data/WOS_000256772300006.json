A partitioned time-marching algorithm is employed for the solution to the time-dependent coupled discretized problem, thus enabling the use of highly developed, robust and well-tested solvers for each field. Coupling of the fields is achieved through a conservative transfer of information at the fluid-structure interface. An implicit coupling is achieved when the solutions to the fluid and structure subproblems are cycled at each time step until convergence is reached. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible fluid is solved using a powerful implicit dual time-stepping technique with an explicit multistage Runga-Kutta time stepping in pseudo-time and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation for the moving boundaries. A finite element dynamic analysis of the highly deformable structure is carried out with a numerical strategy combining the implicit Newmark time integration algorithm with a Newton-Raphson second-order optimization method. Various test cases are presented for benchmarking and to demonstrate the potential applications of this method.
