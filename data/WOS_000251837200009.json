However, its adoption and extensive use in real practice largely depends on the extent to which teachers can design and author their own UoLs according to the requirements of their educational situations. Many of the proposed design processes for facilitating the creation of UoLs are based on the reuse of complete or non-complete learning design solutions at different levels of granularity. This paper introduces a comparison framework that conceptually analyzes and classifies reusable learning design solutions and processes that drive the creation of ready-to-run UoLs. The framework provides a comprehensible representation of such processes and units of reuse over two dimensions, namely granularity and completeness. It also offers a frame for discussing issues, such as the proper level of reuse, of existing and forthcoming proposals. Finally, it opens the path to other strands for future research such as providing language independence of learning designs or proposing approaches for the selection of the reusable solutions.", "paper_title": "A framework for the conceptualization of approaches to \"Create-by-Reuse\" of learning design solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000251837200009"}
