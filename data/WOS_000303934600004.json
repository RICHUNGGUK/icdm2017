To that end, an essential challenge is to build a proper weighted scoring rule, which assigns more weight to the more important scores and derives a final scoring value. In this paper, we first introduce some desirable properties of weighted scoring rules, and then propose a scheme that can incorporate weights into scores in a natural way. In addition, we show our method has overcome some drawbacks of a classic weighted scoring method. Finally, as a case study, we apply these weighted scoring methods to outlier detection to evaluate how much they help solve the ultimate ranking problem.", "paper_title": "A linear transform scheme for building weighted scoring rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000303934600004"}
