We consider the demand for and the duration of surgery to be random variables. The objective is to minimize three competing criteria: expected cost of surgery cancellations, patient waiting time, and operating room overtime. We discuss properties of the model and an implementation of the progressive hedging algorithm to find near-optimal surgery schedules. We conduct numerical experiments using data from a large hospital to identify managerial insights related to surgery planning and the avoidance of surgery cancellations. We compare the progressive hedging algorithm to an easy-to-implement heuristic for practical problem instances to estimate the value of the stochastic solution. Finally, we discuss an implementation of the progressive hedging algorithm within a rolling horizon framework for extended planning periods.", "paper_title": "A Progressive Hedging Approach for Surgery Planning Under Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000366057400011"}
