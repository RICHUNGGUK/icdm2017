Testing the average bias, as well as zero intercept and unit slope are all questionable procedures. Application of the general regression hypothesis test is applicable, but its pair of hypotheses is not relevant. The relevant question is: if the bias exceeds an acceptable level or not? This is an interval hypothesis, that may be properly tested using the two one-sided t-tests (TOST) approach. It is practically executed by calculating the 1-2 beta confidence band for the bias, and checking if it is within the allowed interval throughout the concentration range. If the bias does not depend on the concentration, this method is identical to the TOST procedure for the average bias.
