Before providing mortgage credits, banks have to decide whether the mortgage loan will be repaid back successfully or not. Acceptance or rejection of providing mortgage credits to demanders is a MCDM 'multi-criteria decision making' process. Due to the uncertainty of information and the vagueness of human feeling and recognition, it is difficult to provide exact numerical values for the criteria and to make evaluations which exactly convey the feeling and recognition of objects for decision makers. So, in this study, regarding the uncertainty, fuzzy AHP is utilized to make an evaluation model for mortgage demanders credibility.", "paper_title": "Mortgage Demanders Evaluation by Fuzzy AHP", "paper_id": "WOS:000326481400005"}
