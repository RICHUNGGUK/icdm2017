In view of this, we propose in this paper an energy-conserving on-demand data broadcasting system that employs the data indexing technique. Different from prior work, the power consumption of turning on and turning off the wireless network interfaces is considered. In addition, we also employ a server cache to reduce the effect of the time to retrieve data items from the corresponding data servers. Specifically, we first analyze the access and tuning times of data requests,. and propose an Adaptive Index and Data Organizing Algorithm (AIDOA) to adjust the degree of buckets according to the system workload. Several experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of algorithm AIDOA. The experimental results show that algorithm AIDOA is able to greatly reduce the power consumption at the cost of a slight increase in the average access time and dynamically adjust the index and data organization to adapt to the change of system workload.", "paper_title": "AIDOA: An adaptive and energy-conserving indexing method for on-demand data broadcasting systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900007"}
