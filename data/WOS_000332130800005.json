We aim to provide insights into trade in the knowledge market through an empirical analysis. Using a research model with a theoretical basis on knowledge sharing culture and trade in knowledge market, we conducted an empirical study using data on enterprises' knowledge management systems (KMSs). The results revealed that 62.6% of the variance in knowledge transfer activation was explained by the items of knowledge organization, knowledge strategy, KMS, and knowledge reward through knowledge sharing culture and trade in knowledge market. This suggests that horizontal organization and a strategy that pursues an organization's objectives positively impact knowledge sharing culture, while knowledge technology (KMS) and reward positively affect the trade in knowledge market. We therefore conclude that trade in knowledge market is an important factor to activate knowledge transfer. This article contributes to lay the foundation for future work on empirical study of knowledge transfer based on trade in knowledge market.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER ACTIVATION ANALYSIS: KNOWLEDGE TRADE PERSPECTIVE", "paper_id": "WOS:000332130800005"}
