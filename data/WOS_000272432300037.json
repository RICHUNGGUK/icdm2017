The proposed CRM model consists of module 1: a customer purchasing behavior model. module 2 a Markov chain model, and module 3. a financial returns model. By considering the marketing activities and product attractiveness to the customer, the probability that a customer will (re)purchase can be modeled in module 1. The probabilities are then fitted into module 2 for the calculation of customer lifetime value (CLV) The estimated CLV for each customer IS Inputted into module 3 to predict the firm's return oil investment in the long term. By defining the parameters oil the attractiveness of a product and Oil User responses from historical marketing campaigns, a firm call easily evaluate its business strategy from both marketing and product development perspectives, thereby refining those parameters and adopting the best strategy for creating customer value and yielding the maximum profit A case study of a listed firm in Hong Kong is employed to illustrate our model, which not only gives insights into the product development, but can also support the decisions related to marketing activities.
