Despite this, all external cluster validity indexes calculate only point-level differences of two partitions without any direct information about how similar their cluster-level structures are. In this paper, we introduce a cluster level index called centroid index. The measure is intuitive, simple to implement, fast to compute and applicable in case of model mismatch as well. To a certain extent, we expect it to generalize other clustering models beyond the centroid-based k-means as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
