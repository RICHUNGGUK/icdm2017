In this paper, we propose a computer interactive conversion method to capture components which is used to generate 3D sequences. First, we divide the key frame into foreground and background, and then label the objects by convenient computer interactive operation. Depth information of objects is labeled after segmentation. Second, we use object tracking technique which synthesizes the advantages of kernel-based mean shift tracker and contour tracker to accomplish object depth capture for non-key frame. Finally, all the 3D information is prepared to render 3D sequences. After all, we propose our future work direction: a 2D-to-3D system which can generate 3D sequence interactively.", "paper_title": "3D video components generation using object tracking technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400004"}
