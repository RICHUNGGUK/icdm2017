In order to use models trained using full-frame-rate data in the recognition of reduced-frame-rate (RFR) data, we propose a method for adapting the transition probabilities of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to match the frame rate of the observation. Experiments on the recognition of clean and noisy connected digits are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively compensate for the frame-rate mismatch between the training and the test data. Using our adapted model to recognize the RFR speech data, one can significantly reduce the computation time and achieve the same level of accuracy as that of a method, which restores the frame rate using data interpolation.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of Hidden Markov Models for Recognizing Speech of Reduced Frame Rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500049"}
