Given a set of keyframe orientations of a rigid object, the user first edits its angular velocity trajectory by sketching curves, and then the system computes the altered rotational motion by solving a variational curve fitting problem. The solved rotational motion not only satisfies the orientation constraints at the keyframes, but also fits well the user-specified angular velocity trajectory. Our system is simple and easy to use. We demonstrate its usefulness by adding interesting and realistic rotational details to several keyframe animations.", "paper_title": "Sketch-based rotation editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000297416200001"}
