Scheduling is a good way of avoiding interference, but previous studies on broadcast scheduling algorithms all assume highly theoretical models such as the unit disk graph model. In this work, we reinvestigate this problem by using the 2-Disk and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) models. We first design a constant approximation algorithm for the 2-Disk model and then extend it to the SINR model. This result, to the best of our knowledge, is the first result on broadcast scheduling algorithms in the SINR model.", "paper_title": "Broadcast scheduling in interference environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259184300004"}
