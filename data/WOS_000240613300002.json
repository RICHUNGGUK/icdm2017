It is shown that if pi(wz) = pi(w), then |z| < pi(w) - gcd (|w|, |z|). Detailed improvements of this result are also proven. Finally, we show that each primitive word w has a conjugate w' = vu, where w = uv, such that pi(w') = |w'| and |u| < pi(w). As a corollary we give a short proof of the fact that if u,v,w are words such that u(2) is a prefix of v(2), and v(2) is a prefix of w(2), and v is primitive, then |w| > 2|u|.", "paper_title": "Periods in extensions of words", "paper_id": "WOS:000240613300002"}
