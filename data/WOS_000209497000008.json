The following key considerations are covered: (i) choice of different operators to modify the graph; (ii) information loss based on the cost of graph operations in terms of statistical characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient and path length) in the original graph; (iii) computational cost of the operations; (iv) in the case of the aggregation of two nodes, the choice of similar adjacent nodes rather than isomorphic topologies, in order to maintain the overall structure of the graph; (v) a statistically knowledgeable attacker who is able to search for regions of a simply anonymized graph based on statistical characteristics and map those onto a given node and its immediate neighborhood.", "paper_title": "DATA PRIVACY FOR SIMPLY ANONYMIZED SOCIAL NETWORK LOGS REPRESENTED AS GRAPHS - CONSIDERATIONS FOR GRAPH ALTERATION OPERATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209497000008"}
