To consider both the factors, a muscle-path-plane (MPP) method is introduced to model the paths of muscles during joint movement. This method is based on the premise that there is a MPP, constructed by origin, insertion and MPP control point, which represents the major direction of the muscle contraction for an arbitrary joint configuration at any time. Then, we can calculate the functions and the lengths of the muscle paths during instantaneous joint movement in MPP by mathematical approaches. Taking the triceps brachii as an example, the lengths of its paths during elbow flexion are calculated and compared with the relative studies reported in the literature. It is concluded that this method can provide an insight into the simulation of the muscle contraction.", "paper_title": "A muscle-path-plane method for representing muscle contraction during joint movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800010"}
