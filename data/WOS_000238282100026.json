Since the previous feature extraction methods are usually process monophony audio, for extracting more descriptive features from polyphony audio, Gabor filters bank is introduced. Meanwhile the measure criteria is suggested for qualitatively and quantitatively weighting the discernibility of extracted features. In addition, the presented algorithm is based on the incremental match and has time complexity O(nlog(n)). Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method could extract complete and meaningful repeating patterns from polyphony audio.", "paper_title": "Repeating pattern discovery from audio stream", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100026"}
