These -free edge modification problems are well known to be fixed-parameter tractable for every fixed . In this paper we study the incompressibility, i.e., nonexistence of polynomial kernels, for these -free edge modification problems in terms of the structure of , and completely characterize their nonexistence for being paths, cycles or 3-connected graphs. We also give a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of polynomial kernels for -Free Edge Deletion problems, where is a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs. As an effective tool, we have introduced an incompressible constraint satisfiability problem Propagational- Satisfiability to express common propagational behaviors of events, and we expect the problem to be useful in studying the nonexistence of polynomial kernels in general.", "paper_title": "Incompressibility of H-Free Edge Modification Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350232300009"}
