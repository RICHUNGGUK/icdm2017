In this paper, a novel transition region extraction and thresholding method based on gray level difference is proposed by analyzing properties of transition region. The gray level difference can effectively represent the essence of transition region. Hence, the proposed algorithm can accurately extract transition region of an image and get ideal segmentation result. The proposed algorithm was compared with two classic transition region-based methods on a variety of synthetic and real world images, and the experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.
