In this letter, we study the PSM in the over-determined MIMO system where the receive antenna subset (RAS) selection is considered. The optimal selection criterion is first given, and a fast greedy incremental algorithm is then proposed. The proposed algorithm constructs the RAS by adding antennas one by one, where the low-complexity recursive computation of the matrix inverse can be further employed. Simulation results show that the proposed fast algorithm can achieve most of the antenna selection gain with very low complexity.", "paper_title": "Fast Receive Antenna Subset Selection for Pre-Coding Aided Spatial Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800023"}
