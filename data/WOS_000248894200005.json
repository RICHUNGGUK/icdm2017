A main task in mining such knowledge is peculiarity identification. Previous methods for finding peculiar data focus on attribute values. By extending to record-level peculiarity, this paper investigates relational peculiarity-oriented mining. Peculiarity rules are mined, and more importantly explained, in a relational mining framework. Several experiments are carried out and the results show that relational peculiarity-oriented mining is effective.", "paper_title": "Relational peculiarity-oriented mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000248894200005"}
