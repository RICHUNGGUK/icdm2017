Using this approach the detectability of CEOAEs, in terms of lower frequency SNRs and whole wave reproducibility, was significantly improved. Evaluations of screening outcomes demonstrated this method significantly reduced the overall referral rate, by 2.5 percentage points in initial CEOAE hearing screening. This approach may have potential application in OAE technology and in neonatal hearing screening programmes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
