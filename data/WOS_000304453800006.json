This work is an extended version of our previous works on ontology alignment, which is the task of designating correspondences between two ontologies. After investigating recent approaches, we noticed a lack of analysis of the lowest level of expressing knowledge within them. We treat attributes of concepts as this level and we claim that embedding their precise definition, semantics, and the ways in which they can interact with each other in the process of mapping ontologies can enhance former solutions of this problem. We show that developing such an approach brings us closer to a consistent and more intuitive methodology of aligning ontologies.", "paper_title": "A Method for Ontology Alignment Based on Semantics of Attributes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304453800006"}
