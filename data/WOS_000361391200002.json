However, except in the case of Q-learning, there are no studies about using these two approaches in a cooperative multi-agent learning setting. This paper addresses this shortcoming by using temporal difference and eligibility traces as the core learning method in multi-criteria expertness based cooperative learning (MCE). The experiments, performed on a sample maze world, show the results of an empirical study on temporal difference and eligibility trace methods in a MCE based cooperative learning setting.", "paper_title": "Multi-criteria expertness based cooperative method for SARSA and eligibility trace algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000361391200002"}
