Most of these definitions are based either on Shannon's information theory or on Kolmogorov complexity; these two are often compared, but very few studies integrate the two ideas. In this article we introduce a new measure of complexity that builds on both of these theories. As a demonstration of the concept, the technique is applied to elementary cellular automata and simulations of the self-organization of porphyrin molecules.", "paper_title": "Complexity Measurement Based on Information Theory and Kolmogorov Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000354967900007"}
