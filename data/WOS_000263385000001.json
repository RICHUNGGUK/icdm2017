This paper proposes an architecture-centric metric using entropy for assessing structural dependencies among software components. The proposed metric is based on a mathematical model representing the maintainability snapshot of a system. The introduced architectural-level metric includes measures for coupling and cohesion. From this model, the relative maintainability of a component, referred to as a maintainability profile, can be developed to identify architectural decisions that are detrimental to the maintainability of a system.
