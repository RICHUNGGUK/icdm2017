Most of the existing pore extraction methods detect pores by using a static isotropic pore model; however, their detection accuracy is not satisfactory due to the limited approximation capability of static isotropic models to various types of pores. This paper presents a dynamic anisotropic pore model to describe pores more accurately by using orientation and scale parameters. An adaptive pore extraction method is then developed based on the proposed dynamic anisotropic pore model. The fingerprint image is first partitioned into well-defined, ill-posed, and background blocks. According to the dominant ridge orientation and frequency on each foreground block, a local instantiation of appropriate pore model is obtained. Finally, the pores are extracted by filtering the block with the adaptively generated pore model. Extensive experiments are performed on the high resolution fingerprint databases we established. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect pores more accurately and robustly, and consequently improve the fingerprint recognition accuracy of pore-based AFRS.
