Analogously to free partially commutative monoids (trace monoids), free partially commutative inverse monoid are the quotients of free inverse monoids modulo a partially defined commutation relation on the generators. An O(n log(n)) algorithm on a RAM for the word problem is presented, and NP-completeness of the generalized word problem and the membership problem for rational sets is shown. Moreover, free partially commutative inverse monoids modulo a finite idempotent presentation are studied. For these monoids, the word problem is decidable if and only if the complement of the commutation relation is transitive.", "paper_title": "Partially commutative inverse monoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700026"}
