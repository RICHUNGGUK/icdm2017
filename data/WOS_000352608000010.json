A GLRQ is composed of a spatial location, a set of keywords, a query predicate, and a ranking function formulated on location, text and other attributes. The result consists of k objects satisfying the predicate ranked according to the ranking function. An example is a query searching for the restaurants that 1) are nearby, 2) offer \"American\" food, and 3) have high ratings (rating > 4.0). Such queries can not be processed efficiently using existing techniques. In this work, we propose a novel framework called LINQ for efficient processing of GLRQs. To handle the predicate and the attribute-based scoring, we devise a new index structure called synopses tree, which contains the synopses of different subsets of the dataset. The synopses tree enables pruning of search space according to the satisfiability of the predicate. To process the query constraints over the location and keywords, the framework integrates the synopses tree with the spatio-textual index such as IR-tree. The framework therefore is capable of processing the GLRQs efficiently and holistically. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our solution provides excellent query performance.", "paper_title": "LINQ: A Framework for Location-Aware Indexing and Query Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000352608000010"}
