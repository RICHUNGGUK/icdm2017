The novel design is based on using meander lines to increase the effective inductance of EBG patches. The simulated and measured results demonstrate the simultaneous switching noise (SSN) can be mitigated with an ultra-wideband from 280 MHz to 20 GHz at the restraining depth of -40 dB. Compared with the traditional L-bridge and meander lines EBG structures, this novel structure has the advantages of suppression bandwidth and fabrication cost. Moreover, signal integrity is achieved by the time-domain simulation. The proposed structure provides a new kind of theoretical designing reference for EBG structure to improve the bandwidth of restraining SSN.
