A fuzzy logic based optimization approach is employed to solve autonomously the constrained control allocation problem by suitably adjusting the components of the output vector and finding a proper vector in the attainable moment set. Simulations show that the designed fuzzy controller is better suited to resist external disturbances, and is robust against parameter perturbations.", "paper_title": "Control allocation for a V/STOL aircraft based on robust fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000022"}
