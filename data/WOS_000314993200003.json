The OPVP is defined on a complete undirected graph G = (V,E), with a depot at vertex 0. Every vertex iV \\{0} has a profit pi to be collected, and an associated collection parameter i[0, 1]. The vehicle may make a number of passes, collecting 100i percent of the remaining profit at each pass. In an alternative model, the vehicle may spend a continuous amount of time at every vertex, collecting a percentage of the profit given by a function of the time spent. The objective is to determine a maximal profit tour for the vehicle, starting and ending at the depot, and not exceeding a travel time limit. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
