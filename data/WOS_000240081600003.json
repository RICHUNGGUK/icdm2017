We proposed a kind of evolutionary granular kernel trees (EGKTs) for drug activity comparisons [1]. In EGKTs, feature granules and tree structures are predefined based on the possible substituent locations. In this paper, we present a new system to evolve the structures of granular kernel trees (GKTs) in the case that we lack knowledge to predefine kernel trees. The new granular kernel tree structure evolving system is used for cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor activity comparison. Experimental results show that the new system can achieve better performance than SVMs with traditional RBF kernels in terms of prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary construction of granular kernel trees for cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor activity comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081600003"}
