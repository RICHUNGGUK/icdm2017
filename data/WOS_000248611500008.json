The dynamic condition indicates a multi-period planning horizon, in which the product mix and demand in each period can be different. As a result, the best cells designed for one period may not be efficient cells for subsequent periods and some of reconfigurations are required. Uncertain condition implicates to the imprecise nature of the part demand and also the availability of the manufacturing facilities in each period planning. An extended mixed-integer programming model of dynamic cellular manufacturing system, in which some of the coefficients in objective function and constraints are fuzzy quantities, is solved by a developed fuzzy programming based approach. The objective is to determine the optimal cell configuration in each period with maximum satisfaction degree of the fuzzy objective and constraint. To illustrate the behavior of the proposed model and verify the performance of the developed approach, a number of numerical examples are solved and the associated computational results are reported.", "paper_title": "Designing cellular manufacturing systems under dynamic and uncertain conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000248611500008"}
