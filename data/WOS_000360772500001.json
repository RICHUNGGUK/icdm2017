The main purpose of the system is the tracking of the vehicles to understand lane changes, gates transits and other behaviors useful for traffic analysis. The discrimination of the vehicles into two classes (cars vs. trucks) is also required for electronic truck-tolling. Both tracking and classification are performed online by a system made up of two components (tracker and classifier) plus a controller which automatically adapts the configuration of the system to the observed conditions. Experiments show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on the considered data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
