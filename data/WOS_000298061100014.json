The paper provides: (1) Research literature that employs AI functions and methods for educational or training purposes by the use of Intelligent Software Agents. (2) Analysis of the pedagogical functions; pedagogical gain of employing pedagogical agents. Selected essential topics to learning with agents are investigated including personalization with intelligent agents, cognitive and meta-cognitive agents for teaching, emotions and affections of embodied pedagogical agents and agents as virtual humans. Applications of using intelligent agents are demonstrated from an educational perspective.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Pedagogical Functions of Intelligent Agents in Virtual Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100014"}
