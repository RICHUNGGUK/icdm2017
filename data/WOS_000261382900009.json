For the special distributions of traffic handling capacities of the links and traffic load on the nodes, the critical behavior of the jamming transition on scale-free networks is studied analytically. It is found that the links connecting to the nodes with larger degrees are more prone to suffering from traffic jams. This feature is associated with a propagation that follows a precise hierarchical dynamics. Finally, the average failure rate of the networks, which is defined as the fraction of total broken links of the network, is investigated analytically and by simulations in scale-free networks. We mainly find that, when beta > gamma (beta and gamma are the scaling exponents of the load distribution and degree distribution, respectively), there is a scaling between the average failure rate of the scale-free networks 1-G and the network size N, 1-G similar to N(-1), independent of gamma.", "paper_title": "EXTENDED FIBER BUNDLE MODEL FOR TRAFFIC JAMS ON SCALE-FREE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261382900009"}
