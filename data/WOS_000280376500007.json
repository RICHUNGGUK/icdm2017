To improve the drawbacks of the HT, the randomized Hough transform (RHT) was proposed. But the RHT is not suitable for detecting the pattern with the complex image because the probability is too low. In this paper, we propose a fast randomized Hough transform for circle/circular arc detection. We pick one point at random to be the seed point. Then, we propose a checking rule to confirm if the seed point is on the true circle. Compared with the previous techniques, the proposed method requires less computational time and is more suitable for complex images. In the experiments, synthetic and real images are used to show the effect of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A FAST RANDOMIZED HOUGH TRANSFORM FOR CIRCLE/CIRCULAR ARC RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000280376500007"}
