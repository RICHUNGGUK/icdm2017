In such a design assessment process, different criteria need to be evaluated, which can be of both of a quantitative and qualitative nature, and the knowledge provided by experts may be vague and/or incomplete. Consequently, the assessment problems may include different types of information (numerical, linguistic, interval-valued). Experts are usually forced to provide knowledge in the same domain and scale, resulting in higher levels of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework that can be used to model the assessment problems in different domains and scales. A fuzzy evaluation process in the proposed framework is investigated to deal with uncertainty and manage heterogeneous information in engineering evaluation processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
