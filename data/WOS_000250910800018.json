The Satellite Independent - Service Access Point, currently under study within the European Telecommunications Standardization Institute (ETSI), is taken as technological reference. The key elements of the ETSI solution are outlined in detail. A novel control algorithm is also proposed to tune bandwidth dimensioning within the envisaged architecture. The joint optimization of loss and delay performance metrics, together with the presence of mapping operations, introduce the generalization of the regular concept of \"equivalent bandwidth\". The generalization leads to the study of a proper measurement-based tool, able to capture the most stringent QoS requirement over time (between loss and delay) and the related instantaneous bandwidth need at the lower layer of the protocol stack. The control methodology is tested through real fading and traffic traces to highlight its effectiveness to support bandwidth dimensioning during mapping operations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
