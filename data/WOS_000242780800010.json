This paper introduces a new method for creating the structure of hierarchical classifiers using a novel method for determining clusters. The proposed method uses features obtained using Gabor wavelets to create similarity maps, which help separating the class space into smaller more distinctive clusters. This approach has been applied on the Road Sign Recognition problem and has shown encouraging results in comparison to k-means algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
