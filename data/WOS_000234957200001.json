This paper addresses the problem of the distortion effect produced by different types of non-linear deformation strategies on textured images. The images are modelled by a Gaussian random field. We first give various examples to illustrate that the model generates realistic images. We consider two types of deformations-a deterministic deformation and a landmark based deformation. The latter includes various radial basis type deformations including the thin-plate splines based deformation. The effects of deformations are assessed through Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The measure is estimated by statistical sampling techniques. It is found empirically that this divergence measure is approximately distributed as a lognormal distribution under various different deformations. Thus a coefficient of variation based on log-divergence provides a natural criterion to compare different types of deformations. It is found that the thin-plate splines deformation is almost optimal over the wider class of the radial type deformations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
