Oil the other hand, the user-centred evaluation allows showing the different impressions that the users have perceived about the system running. This work is focused oil discussing the problem of user-centred versus system-centred evaluation of a Web content personalization system where the personalization is based oil a user model that stores long term (section, categories and keywords) and short term interests (adapted from user provided feedback). The user-centred evaluation is based oil questionnaires filled ill by the users before and after using the system and the system-centred evaluation is based oil the comparison between ranking of documents, obtained from the application of a multi-tier selection process, and binary relevance judgments collected previously from real users. The user-centred and system-centred evaluations performed with 106 users during 14 working days have' provided valuable data concerning the behaviour of the users with respect to issues such as document relevance or the relative importance attributed to different ways of personalization. The results obtained shows general satisfaction oil both the personalization processes (selection, adaptation and presentation) and the system as a whole. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
