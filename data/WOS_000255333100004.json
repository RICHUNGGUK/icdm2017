The control development is based on new general potential functions, which attain the minimum value when the desired formation is achieved, and are equal to infinity when a collision between any robots occurs. Smooth and p times differential jump functions are introduced and embedded into the potential functions to deal with the robot limited sensing ranges. Formation tracking is also considered.", "paper_title": "Bounded controllers for decentralized formation control of mobile robots with limited sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333100004"}
