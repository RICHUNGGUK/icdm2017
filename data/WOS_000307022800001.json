Since the number of Web services-based business applications is increasing, the demands for privacy enhancing technologies for Web services will also be increasing in the future. In this paper, we investigate an extension of business protocols, i.e. the specification of which message exchange sequences are supported by the web service, in order to accommodate privacy aspects and time-related properties. For this purpose we introduce the notion of Timed Privacy-aware Business Protocols (TPBPs). We also discuss TPBP properties can be checked and we describe their verification process.", "paper_title": "TIMED PRIVACY-AWARE BUSINESS PROTOCOLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307022800001"}
