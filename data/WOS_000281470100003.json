As many other successfully applied biological-inspired algorithms and metaphors, Ant-Seeker is capable of tracing relevant information in web graphs, imitating the mission of real ants when they seek food far from their nests. The methodology uses swarm intelligence joined with soft computing techniques, as well as information retrieval theory in directed web crawling (web harvesting techniques). We describe the theoretical background and technologies used, as well as all the necessary amendments and considerations for applying ant colony-based algorithms to the Web. Finally, we describe an initial assessment of Ant-Seeker in selected sub-universes of the Web.", "paper_title": "Revealing information paths in web graphs through an ant colony based algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000281470100003"}
