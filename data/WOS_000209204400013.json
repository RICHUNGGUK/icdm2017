In order to improve it further we have developed a least squares variant of STM, termed as proximal support tensor machine (PSTM), where the classifier is obtained by solving a system of linear equations rather than a quadratic programming problem at each iteration of PSTM algorithm as compared to STM algorithm. This in turn provides a significant reduction in the computation time, as well as comparable classification accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed method has been demonstrated in simulations over face detection and handwriting recognition datasets.", "paper_title": "Proximal support tensor machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204400013"}
