Specifically, we consider two problems: (1) given an initial set of markings, construct a set of unreachable markings and (2) given a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of linear predicates in the marking space, construct a set of initial states such that all trajectories originating there satisfy the LTL specification. The starting point for our approach is the observation that a ContPN system can be expressed as a Piecewise Affine (PWA) system with a polyhedral partition. We propose an iterative method for analysis of PWA systems from specifications given as LTL formulas over linear predicates. The computation mainly consists of polyhedral operations and searches on graphs, and the developed framework was implemented as a freely downloadable software tool. We present several illustrative numerical examples.", "paper_title": "An Automated Framework for Formal Verification of Timed Continuous Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000284008200020"}
