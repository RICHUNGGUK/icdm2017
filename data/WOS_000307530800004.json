We show how to compute, for each possible degree, the Pythagorean hodograph curve of a given perimeter enclosing the greatest area. We also discuss the existence and construction of smooth solutions, obtaining a relationship with an interesting sequence of Appell polynomials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
