For each vertex v, the endpoints of all edges adjacent to v are assigned unique labels within the range 1 to deg (v) (the degree of v). The generic exploration strategy is implemented using a right-hand-rule transition function: after entering vertex v via the edge labeled i, the robot proceeds with its exploration, leaving via the edge having label [i mod deg (v)]+1 at v. A lot of attention has been given to the problem of labeling the graph so as to achieve a periodic exploration having the minimum possible length p. It has recently ;been proved ( Czyzowicz et al., Proc. SIROCCO'09, 2009) that pi <= 41/3n holds for all graphs of n vertices. Herein, we provide a new labeling scheme which leads to shorter exploration cycles, improving the general bound to pi <= 4n - 2. This main result is shown to be tight with respect to the class of labellings admitting certain connectivity properties. The labeling scheme is based on a new graph decomposition which may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "Graph Decomposition for Memoryless Periodic Exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000299482700002"}
