However, there are some information loss using discrete fuzzy sets and traditional matching degree method. This study aims to provide a new evidential structure to reduce information loss. This paper proposes a new intuitionistic fuzzy evidential reasoning (IFER) approach which combines intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and inclusion measure to improve the accuracy of representation and reasoning. The proposed approach has been validated by a stroke diagnosis. It is shown that the IFER approach leads to more accurate results.", "paper_title": "The Evidential Reasoning Approach to Medical Diagnosis using Intuitionistic Fuzzy Dempster-Shafer Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000346062500007"}
