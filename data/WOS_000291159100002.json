In this paper we present two new proofs of this theorem. The first one is based on the on-line matching algorithm for bipartite graphs. The second one, based on extractors, can be generalized to prove a version of Muchnik's theorem for space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. Another version of Muchnik's theorem is proven for a resource-bounded variant of Kolmogorov complexity based on Arthur-Merlin protocols.", "paper_title": "Variations on Muchnik's Conditional Complexity Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000291159100002"}
