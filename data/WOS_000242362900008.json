We show how the gamma distributions on the unknown hyperparameters can be used to prevent the proposed blind deconvolution method from converging to undesirable image and blur estimates and also how these distributions can be inferred in realistic situations. We apply variational methods to approximate the posterior probability of the unknown image, blur, and hyperparameters and propose two different approximations of the posterior distribution. One of these approximations coincides with a classical blind deconvolution method. The proposed algorithms are tested experimentally and compared with existing blind deconvolution methods.", "paper_title": "Blind deconvolution using a variational approach to parameter, image, and blur estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242362900008"}
