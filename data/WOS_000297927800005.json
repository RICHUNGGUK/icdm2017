Vandenbussche et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2009] proved that every k-tree that has a smooth degree-3 tree decomposition with width k has book thickness at most k. We prove this result is best possible for k >= 4, by constructing a k-tree with book thickness k + 1 that has a smooth degree-4 tree decomposition with width k. This solves an open problem of Vandenbussche et al.", "paper_title": "On the Book Thickness of k-Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000297927800005"}
