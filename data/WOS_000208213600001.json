However, the current IEEE 802.11 specification does not provide the fast handoff required for real-time multimedia applications. To support fast handoff in IEEE 802.11 networks, a number of fast-handoff schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this article we review these fast-handoff schemes and analyze their advantages and disadvantages qualitatively. After that, important design considerations for mobility support in future IEEE 802.11 networks are suggested. Also, we introduce a fast-handoff framework which adaptively meets different application requirements via a cross-layer approach.", "paper_title": "FAST-HANDOFF SUPPORT IN IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208213600001"}
