The first phase is MC node placement and use of a simple and straightforward Maximum Path Count First (MPCF) algorithm to obtain candidates for MC nodes. The second phase is multicast routing with MC-based schemes that minimizes the number of wavelength channels with minimum transmission delay as required by a given multicast session, in that a light-tree is first constructed to connect MC nodes in a multicast group by using two algorithms, namely, the Pre-computing Minimum Cost (PMC) tree algorithm and the Pre-computing Shortest Path (PSP) tree algorithm. System performance of the proposed MPCF MC node placement algorithm is compared with that of the Normalized Cuts (NC) MC node placement algorithm for both PMC and PSP multicast routing. Furthermore, simulation results compare PMC and PSP multicast routing based on MPCF and NC node placement with Re-route-to-Source (RTS), Re-route-to-Any (RTA), Member-First (MF), and Member-Only (MO) multicast routing based on a light forest for a given multicast session in terms of average number of wavelengths needed, average blocking probability, and mean maximum transmission delay.", "paper_title": "Performance assessment of multicast node placement for multicast routing in WDM networks with sparse light splitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000258160700002"}
