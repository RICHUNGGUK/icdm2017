This paper studies conchoid surfaces of spheres and shows that these surfaces admit rational parameterizations. Explicit parameterizations of these surfaces are constructed using the relations to pencils of quadrics in R-3 and R-4. Moreover we point to remarkable geometric properties of these surfaces and their construction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
