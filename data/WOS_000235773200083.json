The object's motion and epipolar geometry are exploited to guide the algorithm to the correct synchronization in an iterative manner. Our algorithm accurately synchronizes videos recorded at different frame rates, and takes few iterations to converge to sub-frame accuracy. We use synthetic data to analyze our algorithm's accuracy under the influence of noise. We demonstrate that it accurately synchronizes real video sequences, and evaluate its performance against manual synchronization.", "paper_title": "Motion guided video sequence synchronization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200083"}
