The features of agents including autonomous and distributed are designed to address the federation problems in grid, such as resource selection and policy reconciliation. Early work of resource federation is still highly depending on resource administrator (a person who manages the resources for corresponding institute). In this paper, automated agent negotiation in grid is presented to maximize the satisfaction level of federation outcome for involving parties. Using a new conflict resolution technique - creative negotiation, is introduced in solving communication problems during negotiation. A framework of automated negotiation with conflict resolution - select, match, negotiate and expand (SMNE) protocol, is proposed to guide resource administrators in performing resource federation with intelligent agent. According to the experimental result, the proposed SMNE protocol is able to guide resource administrator in conflict resolution when negotiated parties are unable to make further a concession in resource federation.
