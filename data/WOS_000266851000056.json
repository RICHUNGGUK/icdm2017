In most of the cases, these parameters deteriorate the forming behavior of TWB. It is necessary to predict suitable TWB conditions for achieving better-stamped product made of welded blanks. This is quite difficult and resource intensive, requiring lot of simulations or experiments to be performed under varied base material and weld conditions. Automotive sheet part designers will be greatly benefited if an 'expert system' is available that can deliver forming behavior of TWB for varied weld and blank conditions. This work primarily aims at developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the tensile behavior of welded blanks made of steel grade and aluminium alloy base materials. The important tensile characteristics of TWB are predicted within chosen range of varied blank and weld condition. Through out the work, PAM STAMP 2G (R) finite element (FE) code is used to simulate the tensile behavior and to generate output data required for training the ANN. Predicted results from ANN model are compared and validated with FE simulation for two different intermediate TWB conditions. it is observed that the results obtained from ANN are encouraging with acceptable prediction errors. An expert system framework is proposed using the trained ANN for designing TWB conditions that will deliver better formed TWB products. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
