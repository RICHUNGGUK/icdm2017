The global optimization operator is composed of two main terms, one part is the global Laplacian operator of the mesh which keeps the fairness and another is the constraint condition which reserves the fidelity to the mesh. The global optimization operator is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, which is easily solved by solving a sparse linear system. Our global mesh optimization approach can be effectively used in at least three applications: smoothing the noisy mesh, improving the simplified mesh, and geometric modeling with subdivision-connectivity. Many experimental results are presented to show the applicability and flexibility of the approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
