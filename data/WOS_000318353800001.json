We prove in this paper that the expected number of k-dominant skylines is asymptotically zero for large samples when 1 <= k <= d - 1 under two reasonable (continuous) probability assumptions of the input points, d being the (finite) dimensionality, in contrast to the asymptotic unboundedness when k = d. In addition to such an asymptotic zero-infinity property, we also establish a sharp threshold phenomenon for the expected (d - 1)-dominant skylines when the dimensionality is allowed to grow with n, the sample size. Several related issues, such as the dominant cycle structures, the numerical aspects, and the practical implications, are also briefly studied.", "paper_title": "THRESHOLD PHENOMENA IN k-DOMINANT SKYLINES OF RANDOM SAMPLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000318353800001"}
