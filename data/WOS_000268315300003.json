Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary technique used to effectively search multi-modal design spaces. With the aid of digital pheromones, members in a swarm can better communicate with each other to improve search performance. Previous work by the authors demonstrated the capability of digital pheromones within PSO for searching the global optimum in both single and coarse grain synchronous parallel computing environments. In the coarse grain approach, multiple swarms are simultaneously deployed across various processors and synchronization is carried out only when all swarms achieved convergence, in an effort to reduce processor-to-processor communication and network latencies. However, it is theorized that with an appropriate parallelization scheme, the benefits of digital pheromones and communication between swarms can outweigh the network bandwidth latencies resulting in improved search efficiency and accuracy. To explore this idea, a swarm is deployed in the design space across different processors. Through an additional processor, each part of the swarm can communicate with the others. While digital pheromones aid communication within a swarm, the developed parallelization model facilitates communication between multiple swarms resulting in improved search accuracy and efficiency. The development of this method and results from solving several multi-modal test problems are presented.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous parallelization of particle swarm optimization through digital pheromone sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000268315300003"}
