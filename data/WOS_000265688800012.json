Self-management, an important element of autonomic computing, is also characteristic of single and multiagent systems, as well as systems based on service-oriented architectures. Combining these technologies can be profitable for all - in particular, for the development of autonomic computing systems.", "paper_title": "Agents and Service-Oriented Computing for Autonomic Computing A Research Agenda", "paper_id": "WOS:000265688800012"}
