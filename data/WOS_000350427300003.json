A linear least-squares based optimization algorithm is developed for the purpose of detecting impulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from measured concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). The estimated impulse parameters are instrumental in evaluating the frequency and amplitude modulation functions parameterizing the pulse-modulated feedback. The proposed approach allows for the identification of all model parameters from the hormone concentrations of Te and LH. Simulation results of the complete estimated closed-loop system exhibiting similar to the clinical data behavior are provided.", "paper_title": "Modeling of Testosterone Regulation by Pulse-Modulated Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000350427300003"}
