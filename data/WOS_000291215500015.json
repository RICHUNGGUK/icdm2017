The MR is used to detect the magnetic markers, which provides the absolute positioning reference. The data from odometry and the MR are used to localize the vehicle by using unscented Kalman filter. The data association (DA) method is adopted to validate the observations from the MR. The experiment results show that the method is a robust way.", "paper_title": "Improved Intelligent Vehicle Localization Using Magnetic Ruler", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500015"}
