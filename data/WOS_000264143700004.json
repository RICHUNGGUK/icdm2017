In recent years, much attention is given to heuristic and search techniques. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are also known as efficient heuristic and search techniques. This paper proposes an efficient genetic algorithm for hybrid flow shop scheduling problems. The proposed algorithm is tested by Carlier and Neron's (2000) benchmark problem from the literature. The computational results indicate that the proposed efficient genetic algorithm approach is effective in terms of reduced total completion time or makespan (C-max) for HFS problems.", "paper_title": "AN APPLICATION OF EFFECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHMS FOR SOLVING HYBRID FLOW SHOP SCHEDULING PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143700004"}
