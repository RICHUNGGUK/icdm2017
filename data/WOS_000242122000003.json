Simulation results show that the proposed model is feasible and effective. Comparisons are also made when the stock exchange is performed using prediction results from different models. It shows that the proposed model could improve the prediction precision evidently and realize the main purpose for investors to obtain more profits.", "paper_title": "An improved OIF Elman neural network and its applications to stock market", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000003"}
