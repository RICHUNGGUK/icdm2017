As these solutions depend on both the specific network architecture and the type of learning algorithm used, it is important to develop spiking neural network devices that offer the possibility to reconfigure their network topology and to implement different types of learning mechanisms. Here we present a neuromorphic multi-neuron VLSI device with on-chip programmable event-based hybrid analog/digital circuits; the event-based nature of the input/output signals allows the use of address-event representation infrastructures for configuring arbitrary network architectures, while the programmable synaptic efficacy circuits allow the implementation of different types of spike-based learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this article are to demonstrate how the programmable neuromorphic system proposed can be configured to implement specific spike-based synaptic plasticity rules and to depict how it can be utilised in a cognitive task. Specifically, we explore the implementation of different spike-timing plasticity learning rules online in a hybrid system comprising a workstation and when the neuromorphic VLSI device is interfaced to it, and we demonstrate how, after training, the VLSI device can perform as a standalone component (i.e., without requiring a computer), binary classification of correlated patterns.", "paper_title": "Programmable Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity Learning Circuits in Neuromorphic VLSI Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000361067700007"}
