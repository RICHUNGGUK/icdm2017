Small cells will be overlapped with macrocells and possibly also with each other in areas where wider coverage capability and higher throughput are needed. Such heterogeneous network deployment presents many potential benefits but also some challenges that need to be resolved. In particular, multi-antenna techniques and processing in the spatial domain will be key enabling factors to mitigate these issues. This article presents different small cell deployment approaches: sharing the same frequency bands with the macrocell, or using separated higher frequency bands. For each approach, the benefits of beamforming are discussed.", "paper_title": "BEAMFORMING FOR SMALL CELL DEPLOYMENT IN LTE-ADVANCED AND BEYOND", "paper_id": "WOS:000336794100010"}
