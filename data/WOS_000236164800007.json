The proposed algorithm uses iterative merging of adjacent triangle pairs based on their orientations. The oversegmented regions are merged again in an iterative region merging process. Finally, the noisy boundaries of each region are refined. The boundaries of each region contain perceptually important geometric information of the entire mesh model. According to the purpose of the segmentation, the proposed mesh-segmentation algorithm supports various types of segmentation by controlling parameters. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
