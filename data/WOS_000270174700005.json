A secret sharing scheme which can meet the requirements of both the (t, n) threshold and the adversary structure is proposed basing on the existing (t, n) threshold schemes and the knowledge of set theory, and the validity of the proposed scheme is proved perfectly. The scheme does not need to traverse the whole set of participants to get the qualified or unqualified subsets, and can distribute the shadows according to the requirements of threshold and adversary structure directly. The scheme can prevent the participants from cheating, and does not need the participants to provide their real shadows when the shared secret is reconstructed. The shadows do not need to be renewed when the shared secret is changed. The comparisons to the existing schemes show that, the proposed scheme is more efficient when the threshold and the adversary structure are both required.", "paper_title": "A secret sharing scheme based on (t, n) threshold and adversary structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000270174700005"}
