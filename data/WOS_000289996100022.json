Our characters are equipped with a variety of motion skills to clear obstacles, narrow passages, and highly constrained environment features. Our control method incorporates a behavior model into well-known, standard path planning algorithms. Our behavior model, called deformable motion, consists of a graph of motion capture fragments. The key idea of our approach is to add flexibility on motion fragments such that we can situate them into a cluttered environment via constraint-based formulation. We demonstrate our deformable motion for realtime interactive navigation and global path planning in highly constrained virtual environments.", "paper_title": "Deformable Motion: Squeezing into Cluttered Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000289996100022"}
