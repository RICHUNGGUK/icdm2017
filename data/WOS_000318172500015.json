Unlike conventional structured query language based approaches, our approach features logic automation constructed with a new C-based event language that supports regular expressions on the basis of C functions, so that a wide variety of event-processing applications can be efficiently mapped to FPGAs. Evaluations on an FPGA-based network interface card show that we can achieve 12.3 times better event-processing performance than does a CPU software in a financial trading application.", "paper_title": "C-Based Complex Event Processing on Reconfigurable Hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000318172500015"}
