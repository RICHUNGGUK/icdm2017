Reaching an optimal fit and preventing the fitting process from getting trapped in local minima can be significantly improved by identifying appropriate rigid bodies (RBs) in the fitted component. Results: Here we present the RIBFIND server, a tool for identifying RBs in protein structures. The server identifies RBs in proteins by calculating spatial proximity between their secondary structural elements.", "paper_title": "RIBFIND: a web server for identifying rigid bodies in protein structures and to aid flexible fitting into cryo EM maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532300064"}
