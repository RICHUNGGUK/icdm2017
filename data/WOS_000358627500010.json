To increase the solution-search ability, the CA extracts problem-specific information during the evolutionary solution search to update the belief space of each generation, which has cultural influences and guidance on the next generation. The key design of the proposed CA is to propose the cultural and evolutionary operators specifically for the problem. This work is of high value as a comprehensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed CA rooted from evolutionary algorithm (EA) obtains 0.44%-1.13% better fitness and performs more stably than the previous best-known simulated annealing (SA) approach, which was shown to perform better than the EA previously.
