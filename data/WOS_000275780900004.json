Results are also given of a preliminary concept demonstrator which is based on a simple 2-Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) Revolute-Revolute (RR) manipulator incorporating the programmable brakes. Performance measures for the joint, as well as figures describing the ability of the 2-DOF prototype to constrain the end effector motion to a plane and a circle. are also provided.
