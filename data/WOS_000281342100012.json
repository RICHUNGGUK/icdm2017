We first propose an automatic process for silhouette extraction based on the combination of an adaptive background subtraction algorithm and a motion detection module. Such a combination takes advantage of both approaches and is able to tackle the problem of particular environments. The silhouette extraction results are then clustered based on their spatial belonging and colorimetric characteristics in order to preserve only the key regions that effectively represent the appearance of a person. The next important step consists in characterizing the extracted silhouettes by the appearance-based signatures. Our proposed descriptor, which includes both color and spatial feature of objects, leads to satisfying results compared to other descriptors in the literature. Since the passage of a person needs to be characterized by multiple frames, a large quantity of data has lobe processed. Thus, a graph-based algorithm is used to realize the comparison of passages of people in front of cameras and to make the final decision of re-identification. The global system is tested on two real and difficult data sets recorded in very different environments. The experimental results show that our proposed system leads to very satisfactory results.", "paper_title": "People Detection and Re-Identification in Complex Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342100012"}
