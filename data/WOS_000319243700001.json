Current models still have significant shortcomings, notably in their representation of socio-economic processes and the feedbacks between these and the environmental system. They are also often not designed with sufficient transparency to enable participation of interested parties or effective communication with stakeholders and policy makers. These deficiencies are discussed and possible directions for improvement are identified. This Thematic Issue provides a collection of papers that offer a number of innovative ideas for remedying these shortcomings using novel methods and approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
