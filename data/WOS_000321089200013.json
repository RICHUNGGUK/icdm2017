The objective is to place all pieces without overlapping into a strip of given width so as to minimize the total height of the pieces. Based on the definition of action space, a new sorting rule for candidate placements is proposed such that the position for the current piece is as low as possible, the distance between the current piece and other inside pieces is as close as possible, and the adverse impact for further placements is as little as possible. Experiments on four groups of benchmarks showed the proposed DHA achieved highly competitive results in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Also, as a deterministic algorithm, the DHA could achieve high quality solutions by only one independent run on both small-scale and large-scale problem instances and the results are repeatable.
