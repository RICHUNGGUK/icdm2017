Different versions of the heuristic are examined including 'skewed' VNS and a combination of a constructive heuristic followed by VNS. Extensive computational experiments are performed on a series of large random graphs as well as several instances of the related maximum diversity problem taken from the literature. The results obtained by VNS were consistently the best over a number of other heuristics tested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
