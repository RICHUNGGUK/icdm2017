The proposed algorithm incorporates a new method for dynamically updating the context vector each time it completes a cooperation operation with other particles. We first explain how this leads to enhanced search ability and improved optimization over previous methods, and demonstrate this empirically with comparative experiments using benchmark test functions. We then demonstrate a practical application of the proposed method, by showing how it can be applied to optimize the parameters for Otsu image segmentation for processing medical images. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods from the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
