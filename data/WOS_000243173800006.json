However, concerns about exposure to electromagnetic fields should also be taken into account when designing telecommunication networks. In this article we investigate how parallel cooperative meta-heuristics provide the means to achieve both goals: devising a complete network configuration that meets coverage and service quality constraints, and minimizing electromagnetic field levels.", "paper_title": "Tackling electrosmog in completely configured 3G networks by parallel cooperative meta-heuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000243173800006"}
