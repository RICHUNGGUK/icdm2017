The main objective is to achieve an integrated parameterization and design of the communication protocols, the control and fault diagnosis algorithms aiming at meeting high real-time requirements in industrial applications. To illustrate the design framework, a laboratory wireless fault-tolerant NCS platform is presented.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Design Framework of Fault-Tolerant Wireless Networked Control Systems for Industrial Automatic Control Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600048"}
