However, the method requires exact knowledge of the noise PDF, which reduces its practicality since in real life scenario the the distribution is usually unknown. In the present paper, we propose a more practicable method, in which the optimal p value is approximately determined by using the error samples on-line, without resorting to a priori knowledge of the noise. The mean-square convergence of the proposed algorithm is studied, and an upper bound of the step-size is derived. Monte Carlo simulation results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the new method.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE FILTERING WITH ADAPTIVE p-POWER ERROR CRITERION", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100017"}
