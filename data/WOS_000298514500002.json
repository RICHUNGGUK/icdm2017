Delays are quite common in this kind of systems and, when controlling multivariable plants, it is possible that different delays are applied to the multiple inputs and outputs of them. A control structure that allows compensating individually each one of the multiple loop delays would be useful when one of these delays changes. Inverted pendulums are quite sensitive to delays and for this reason are appropriated plants to be used in these conditions. The control structure is developed modifying the control in no-delay conditions with a generalized predictor able to deal with unstable and non-minimum plants as the chosen one is. The proposed structure has been simulated and implemented to control a real double rotary inverted pendulum.", "paper_title": "Controlling the Double Rotary Inverted Pendulum with Multiple Feedback Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000298514500002"}
