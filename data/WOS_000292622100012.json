The technical platform that matches the trend forms a new framework unlike that of GIS and is conceptualized in this paper as a collaborative virtual geographic environment (CVGE). This paper focuses on two key issues. One is scientific research on CVGE including the concept definition and the conceptual and system framework development. The other is a prototype system development according to CVGE frameworks for air pollution simulation in the Pearl River Delta. The prototype system integrates air pollution source data, air pollution dispersion models, air pollution distribution/dispersion visualization in geographically referenced environments, geospatial analysis, and geo-collaboration. Using the prototype system, participants from geographically distributed locations can join in the shared virtual geographic environment to conduct collaborative simulation of air pollution dispersion. The collaborations supporting this simulation happen on air pollution source editing, air pollution dispersion modeling, geo-visualization of the output of the modeling, and geo-analysis.
