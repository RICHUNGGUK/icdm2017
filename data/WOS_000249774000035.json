The traffic generated by the users is subject to a stringent quality of service requirement, which is defined in terms of the asymptotic decay-rate of buffer occupancy. The performance of this communication system is analyzed, and the corresponding achievable rate-region for the two-user scenario is identified. A simple user-cooperation scheme that improves performance is proposed. This cooperative scheme is shown to significantly enlarge the achievable rate-region of the service constrained communication system, provided that the quality of the wireless link between cooperating users is better than the individual connections from the users to the intended destination. Numerical results further indicate that the gains of cooperative can be substantial. This suggests that cooperation allows for a distribution of the wireless resources among active users.", "paper_title": "Quality of service analysis for wireless user-cooperation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249774000035"}
