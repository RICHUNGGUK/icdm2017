The List k-Coloring problem requires in addition that every vertex u must receive a color from some given set L(u)aS dagger{1,aEuro broken vertical bar,k}. Let P (n) denote the path on n vertices, and G+H and rH the disjoint union of two graphs G and H and r copies of H, respectively. For any two fixed integers k and r, we show that List k-Coloring can be solved in polynomial time for graphs with no induced rP (1)+P (5), hereby extending the result of HoA ng, KamiA\"ski, Lozin, Sawada and Shu for graphs with no induced P (5). Our result is tight; we prove that for any graph H that is a supergraph of P (1)+P (5) with at least 5 edges, already List 5-Coloring is NP-complete for graphs with no induced H.", "paper_title": "List Coloring in the Absence of a Linear Forest", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400002"}
