In this model, every node has a list of neighbors whose order is specified by an adversary. In step i every node opens a channel to its ith neighbor (modulo degree) on that list, beginning from a randomly chosen starting position. Then, the channels can be used for bi-directional communication in that step. The goal is to spread a message efficiently to all nodes of the graph. For random graphs (with sufficiently many edges) we present an address-oblivious algorithm with runtime O(logn) that uses at most O(nloglogn) message transmissions. For hypercubes of dimension logn we present an address-oblivious algorithm with runtime O(logn) that uses at most O(n(loglogn)(2)) message transmissions. Together with a result of Elsasser (Proc. of SPAA'06, pp. 148-157, 2006), our results imply that for random graphs the communication complexity of the quasirandom phone call model is significantly smaller than that of the standard phone call model.", "paper_title": "Communication Complexity of Quasirandom Rumor Spreading", "paper_id": "WOS:000354066300007"}
