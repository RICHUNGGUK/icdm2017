A scheduling scheme that satisfies the QoS requirements has become more important for wireless communications. We propose a scheduling scheme called adaptive priority-based scheduling (APS) for providing QoS guarantees in IEEE 802.16 networks. APS comprises two major components: priority assignment and resource allocation. Different service-type connections primarily depend on their QoS requirements to adjust priority assignments and dispatch bandwidth resources dynamically. We consider both starvation avoidance and resource management. Simulation results show that our APS methodology outperforms the representative scheduling approaches in both QoS satisfaction and maintains fairness in starvation prevention. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
