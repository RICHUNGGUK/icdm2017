However, no paper has provide quantitative data supporting the matter. This paper discusses productivity improvement through the use of an integrated CASE tool system named EAGLE (Effective Approach to Achieving High Level Software Productivity), as shown by various data collected in Hitachi from the 1980s to the 2000s. We have evaluated productivity by using three metrics, 1) program generation rate using reusable program skeletons and components, 2) fault density at two test phase, and 3) learning curve for the education of inexperienced programmers. We will show that productivity has been improved by the various facilities of EAGLE.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness of an integrated CASE tool for productivity and quality of software developments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237203100017"}
