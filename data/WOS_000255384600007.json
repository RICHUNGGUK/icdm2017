On the basis of the model, this paper proposes a view mechanism for finding and reusing legacy resource spaces according to users' idiosyncratic interests. It establishes a flexible reorganizing mechanism of legacy resource spaces to reduce redundant work. As a viewpoint organization strategy, the resource subject tree is proposed as an effective way of discovering desirable resource space views. A case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Resource space view tour mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000255384600007"}
