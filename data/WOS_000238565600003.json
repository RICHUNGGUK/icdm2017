We examine the distribution of the test statistic for both large and small samples and show that, for large samples, the test statistic converges to a half normal distribution. The procedure can also be used to test whether two independent samples come from identical distributions vs. the hypothesis that they come from different distributions. The one-sample test is shown to be applicable to a number of families. In particular, tests for the Weibull distribution and the gamma distribution are developed as a special application of the single-sample case.", "paper_title": "Testing for scale families using total variation distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565600003"}
