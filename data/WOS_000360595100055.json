The key aspect of sparse methods is the possibility of performing variable selection by forcing the model coefficients related to irrelevant variables to zero. In particular, two different sparse classification approaches, i.e. sPCA + kNN and sPLS-DA, were compared with the corresponding classical methods (PCA + kNN and PLS-DA) to classify Arabica and Robusta coffee species. Green coffee samples were analyzed using near infrared hyperspectral imaging and the average spectra from each hyperspectral image were used to build training and test sets; furthermore a test image was used to evaluate the performances of the considered methods at pixel-level. In our case, sparse methods led to similar results as classical methods, with the advantage of obtaining more interpretable and parsimonious models. An important result to highlight is that variable selection performed with two different sparse classification approaches converged to the selection of same spectral regions, which implies the chemical relevance of those regions in the discrimination of Arabica and Robusta coffee species.
