A cognitive network observes, learns, and makes informed decisions based on its current status and knowledge about past decisions and their results. To test the operation of cognitive algorithms in real time, we created the first operational testbed of a cognitive optical network based on the Cognitive Heterogeneous Reconfigurable Optical Network (CHRON) architecture. In this experiment, an intelligent control plane, enabled by a cognitive decision system (CDS), was successfully combined with a flexible data plane. The testbed was used to test and validate different scenarios, demonstrating benefits obtained by network cognition, particularly lightpath establishment and a tear-down scenario, improved failure restoration time, cognitive virtual topology reconfiguration, and a modulation format change.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Optical Network Testbed: EU Project CHRON", "paper_id": "WOS:000349548900019"}
