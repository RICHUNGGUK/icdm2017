We present a solution, based on vehicular sensor networks, for gathering data from a certain geographic area while satisfying with a specific delay bound. The method leverages the time interval during which the query is active in order to make the gathering process efficient, properly alternating data muling and multi-hop forwarding strategies like in delay-bounded routing protocols. Simulations show that our proposed solution succeeds in performing efficient data gathering outperforming other solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
