So the safety of cloud computing is the first consideration of users to choose. In the development of cloud computing, the application proportion of virtualization gradually increase, the scope and depth of the safety gradually expand. The related concepts of cloud computing and development situation are introduced in this paper. Not only the key technologies of cloud computing security are analyzed, but also a cloud security framework is put forward combined with the current security problems needed to resolve in cloud computing. We analyze and compare the present research results of security model and mechanism in the cloud. At last, we propose a security mechanism based on cloud computing.", "paper_title": "The Research of Data Security Mechanism Based on Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361376600028"}
