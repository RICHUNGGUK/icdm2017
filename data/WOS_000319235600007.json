The study is motivated by file transfer issues encountered in the Virtual Imaging Platform deployed on the European Grid Infrastructure. Approaches proposed in the last 6 years are classified using taxonomies of replication process, replication optimization, file models, resource models and replication validation. Most existing approaches implement file replication as a middleware service, using dynamic strategies. Production approaches are slightly different than works evaluated in simulation or in controlled conditions which (i) mostly assumes simplistic file models (undistinguished read-only files), (ii) rely on elaborated access patterns, (iii) assume clairvoyance of the infrastructure parameters and (iv) study file availability less than other metrics but insist on cost.
