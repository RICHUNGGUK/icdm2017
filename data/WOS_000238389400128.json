In this proposed scheme, since the performance of V-BLAST system depends on the first sub-stream detection capability, V probable streams are detected according to the first detected sub-stream of DFE detector and most probable stream is selected by likelihood test. And to reduce the computational complexity of DFE detector, a simple DFE detection scheme is also proposed. It has been shown that the proposed technique can detect the transmitted data more accurately than conventional DFE decoding scheme, and has very lower complexity than ML detector.", "paper_title": "Simplified signal detection for BLAST architecture with ML and DFE detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400128"}
