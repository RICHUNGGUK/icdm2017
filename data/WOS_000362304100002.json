Among other consequences, digitization and big data analytics reshape business models and impact employment amongst knowledge workers - just as automation did for manufacturing workers. This Viewpoint paper considers the mechanisms underlying how digitization and big data analytics drive the transformation of business and society and outlines the potential effects of digitization and big data analytics on employment - especially in the context of cognitive tasks. Its aim is to outline a critical research agenda to explore and conceptualize evident changes in business models and society arising from these technological advances. 2015 Elsevier B.V.
