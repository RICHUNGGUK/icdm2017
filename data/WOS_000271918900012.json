In this paper, we present a hierarchical semantic service discovery system for the Universal Network- UniNServ. It uses OWL-S (Web ontology language for services) to describe services, and adopts Chord as a distributed lookup protocol. Besides, UniNServ uses three types of ontologies to perform automatic semantic service discovery with QoS through exploiting the logical relationships within the services. Experiments demonstrate the high performance of our Chord- based semantic service discovery system.", "paper_title": "A HIERARCHICAL AND CHORD-BASED SEMANTIC SERVICE DISCOVERY SYSTEM IN THE UNIVERSAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900012"}
