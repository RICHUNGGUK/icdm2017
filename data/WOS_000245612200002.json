[E. Trillas, S. Cubillo, E. Castiheira, On conjectures in orthocomplemented lattices, Artificial Intelligence 117 (2000) 255-275] recently proposed a mathematical model for conjectures, hypotheses and consequences (abbr. CHCs), and with this model we can execute certain mathematical reasoning and reformulate some important theorems in classical logic. We demonstrate that the orthomodular condition is not necessary for holding Watanabe's structure theorem of hypotheses, and indeed, in some orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattices, this theorem is still valid. We use the CHC operators to describe the theorem of deduction, the theorem of contradiction and the Lindenbaum theorem of classical logic, and clarify their existence in the CHC models; a number of examples is presented. And we re-define the CHC operators in residuated lattices, and particularly reveal the essential differences between the CHC operators in orthocomplemented lattices and residuated lattices.
