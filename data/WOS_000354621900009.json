In each country, a group of users participated in requirements gathering sessions that were aimed at developing design ideas for overcoming country-specific usability problems. Using qualitative content analysis, it was found that in each country some specific interaction activities were considered more when participants generated design ideas for country-specific usability problems. It was also found that even for similar usability problems, participants suggested country-specific solutions. Therefore, it is suggested that participation of local users in the design process should not be limited to identification of usability problems, but should also include the problem-solving phase that is usually a phase in design and development processes in which requirements gathering techniques are being used.", "paper_title": "Users' participation in requirements gathering for smart phones applications in emerging markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000354621900009"}
