In this paper, a simple and efficient neural network with a single recurrent unit is proposed for realizing associative memories. Compared with the existing neural networks for associative memories, the main advantage of the proposed model is that it has only one recurrent unit, which lowers the model complexity by the greatest extent. In the proposed neural network, each prototype pattern is stored in the connection weights between the input and hidden layers. In addition, the advanced performance of the proposed network is demonstrated by means of simulations of three numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
