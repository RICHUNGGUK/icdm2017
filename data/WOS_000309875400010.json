The expectation maximization (EM) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are adopted to estimate the parameters for the MRF model due to their comparatively good performance. Although the image segmentation algorithms via graph cuts have become very popular nowadays, our proposed algorithm still performs significantly better in automatic identification and segmentation of fuzzy images than them, which is shown by the quantitative results on synthesized images. In practical applications, the proposed two-step pseudo MAP method is superior in segmenting the fuzzy laser images reflected from the weld pool surfaces during the P-GMAW welding process.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of fuzzy images: a novel and fast two-step pseudo MAP method", "paper_id": "WOS:000309875400010"}
