The aim of the research outlined in this paper is to design and implement a novel performance analysis tool to measure swimmer performance using wireless technology previously developed at Loughborough University. The Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open System Architecture (CIMOSA) has been coupled with a software architecture based on object-oriented techniques to formalize and structure the development of a computer integrated real-time monitoring system. Filtering and signal-processing algorithms are applied to extract performance indicators in real time, hence allowing faster access of feedback that can be used to enhance the swimming performance during each training session.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of an Integrated Performance Monitoring Tool for Swimming to Extract Stroke Information at Real Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000317645300006"}
