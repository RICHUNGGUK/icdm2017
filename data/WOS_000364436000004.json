Among various solutions, clipping methods based on the Bernstein-Bezier form usually have good numerical stability. A traditional clipping method using polynomials of degree r can achieve a convergence rate of r + 1 for a single root. It utilizes two polynomials of degree r to bound the given polynomial f(t) of degree n, where r = 2, 3, and the roots of the bounding polynomials are used for clipping off the subintervals containing no roots of f(t). This paper presents a rational cubic clipping method for finding the roots of a polynomial f(t) within an interval. The bounding rational cubics can achieve an approximation order of 7 and the corresponding convergence rate for finding a single root is also 7. In addition, differently from the traditional cubic clipping method solving the two bounding polynomials in O (n(2)), the new method directly constructs the two rational cubics in O(n) which can be used for bounding f (t) in many cases. Some examples are provided to show the efficiency, the approximation effect and the convergence rate of the new method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
