Here K S is an element of k(x), and a is an automorphism of k(x) which maps k[x] onto k[x]. We show that the degrees of the numerator and denominator of K are simultaneously minimized iff K = r/s where r, s is an element of k[x] and r is coprime with sigma(n)s for all n is an element of Z. Assuming existence of algorithms for computing orbital decompositions of R is an element of k(x) and semi-periods of irreducible p is an element of k[x] \\ k, we present an algorithm for minimizing w(deg num(S). deg den(S)) among representations with minimal K, where to is any appropriate weight function. This algorithm is based on a reduction to the well-known assignment problem of combinatorial optimization. We show how to use these representations of rational functions to obtain succinct representations of sigma-hypergeometric terms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
