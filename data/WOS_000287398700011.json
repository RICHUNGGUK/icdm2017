Current-mode techniques have been used to improve the overall performance of the compressor. New fully differential proposed circuit improves speed up to 45% also reduces occupied area in comparison to other high-speed conventional compressor circuits. To evaluate the performance of the proposed circuit, two other structures have been chosen and all of the circuits have been simulated in 0.18 mu m standard TSMC CMOS process with 1.8 V power supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A very high-speed CMOS 4-2 compressor using fully differential current-mode circuit techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000287398700011"}
