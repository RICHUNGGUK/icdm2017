The key advantage of the proposed scheme is that two very restrictive assumptions in most existing ISMC approaches for stochastic fuzzy systems have been removed. It is shown that the closed-loop control system trajectories are kept on the integral sliding surface almost surely since the initial time. It is also shown that the stochastic stability of the resulting sliding motion can be guaranteed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and moreover, the sliding-mode controller can be obtained simultaneously. Simulation results from an inverted pendulum example illustrating the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are provided in the end.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity Control for Stochastic T-S Fuzzy Systems via Integral Sliding-Mode Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000344661600013"}
