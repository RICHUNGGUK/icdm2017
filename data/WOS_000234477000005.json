These data-dependent statistics involve arithmetically simple parameter estimation, convenient approximate distributions and provide a comprehensive assessment of how well the data agree with a binomial distribution. We suggest that a well-performed single test of fit statistic is the Anderson-Darling statistic.", "paper_title": "Improved testing for the binomial distribution using chi-squared components with data-dependent cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000234477000005"}
