This design consists of a virtual environment with two degrees of freedom motion platform and integrated ground contact force feedback. Differential drive mobility users continue to be in touch with reality on their own mobility aid while interacting with virtual objects. The major domain related to the differential drive mobility of the disabled members of society which coincides with the use of manual wheelchairs, electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters. In order to account for environmental and dynamic effects, the wheeled mobility user needs to map the intended trajectory into the virtual world. Motion and inertia force feedback produced on the augmented simulator give the users a haptic sensory stimulus input regarding spatial movement and ground contact forces. The main objective is to model and design an augmented reality platform with real world kinematic and dynamic properties to place a wheeled mobility user closer to real world encounters. The use of the designed augmented reality platform will be beneficial to disabled wheeled mobility users in need of occupational therapist training and evaluation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
