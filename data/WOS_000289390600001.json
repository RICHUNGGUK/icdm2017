Design/methodology/approach - The complex mechanism of debonding/peeling failure of FRP reinforcement is studied within the context of damage mechanics to appropriately catch transversal effects and developing a more realistic and comprehensive study of the delamination process. The FE ABAQUS (c) code has been supplemented with a numerical procedure accounting for Mazars's damage law inside the contact algorithm. Findings - It has been shown that such an approach is able to catch the delamination evolution during loading processes as well. Originality/value - A Drucker-Prager constitutive law is adopted for concrete whereas FRP elements are assumed to behave in a linear-elastic manner, possibly undertaking large strains/displacements. Surface-to-surface contact conditions have been applied between FRP and adjacent concrete, including the enhancement given by the strain-softening law according to Mazars' damage model. The procedure has been introduced to describe the coupled behaviour between concrete, FRP and adhesive resulting in specific bonding-debonding features under different load levels.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional modelling of bond behaviour between concrete and FRP reinforcement", "paper_id": "WOS:000289390600001"}
