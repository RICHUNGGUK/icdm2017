A system is said to be positive if its state and output are non-negative whenever the initial condition and input are non-negative. Two results are obtained. First, if a positive system is asymptotically stable for all bounded (further continuous, for continuous-time systems) time-varying delays, then it is exponentially stable for all such delays. In particular, if a positive system is asymptotically stable for a given constant delay, then it is exponentially stable for all constant delays. Second, if the involved delays are unbounded, then the positive system may be not exponentially stable even if it is asymptotically stable.", "paper_title": "Relationships between asymptotic stability and exponential stability of positive delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311369600004"}
