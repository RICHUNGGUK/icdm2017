It takes advantage of dynamic programming and parallel computing to produce optimal results in reasonable time. More importantly, the algorithm makes it possible for biologists to analyze datasets that were previously considered too long, often leading to memory overflow or prohibitively long time for computation.", "paper_title": "Parallel computing for optimal genomic sequence alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000061"}
