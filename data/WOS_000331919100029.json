MSSM", " Beyond standard model"], "paper_abstract": "micrOMEGAs is a code to compute dark matter observables in generic extensions of the standard model. This new version of micrOMEGAs is a major update which includes a generalization of the Boltzmann equations to accommodate models with asymmetric dark matter or with semi-annihilation and a first approach to a generalization of the thermodynamics of the Universe in the relic density computation. Furthermore a switch to include virtual vector bosons in the final states in the annihilation cross sections or relic density computations is added. Effective operators to describe loop-induced couplings of Higgses to two-photons or two-gluons are introduced and reduced couplings of the Higgs are provided allowing for a direct comparison with recent LHC results. A module that computes the signature of DM captured in celestial bodies in neutrino telescopes is also provided. Moreover the direct detection module has been improved as concerns the implementation of the strange \"content\" of the nucleon. New extensions of the standard model are included in the distribution.

Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 842 Does the new version supersede the previous version: yes Nature of physical problem: Calculation of the relic density and direct and indirect detection rates of the lightest stable particle in a generic new model of particle physics. Method of solution: In numerically solving the evolution equation for the density of dark matter, relativistic formulae for the thermal average are used. All tree-level processes for annihilation and coannihilation of new particles in the model are included as well as some 3-body final states. The cross-sections for all processes are calculated exactly with CalcHEP after definition of a model file. The propagation of the charged cosmic rays is solved within a semi-analytical two-zone model. Reasons for the new version: There are many experiments that are currently searching for the remnants of dark matter annihilation and the relic density is determined precisely from cosmological measurements. In this version we add the computation of dark matter signals in neutrino telescopes, we generalize the Boltzmann equations so as to take into account a larger class of dark matter models and improve the precision in the prediction of the relic density for DM masses that are below the W mass. We compute the signal strength for Higgs production in different channels to compare with the results of the LHC. Summary of revisions: Generalization of the Boltzmann equations to include asymmetric dark matter and semi-annihilations: the DM asymmetry is taken into account when computing direct/indirect detection rates. Incorporating loop-induced decays of Higgs particles to two-photons and two-gluons, and computing the signal strength for Higgs production in various channels that can be compared to results from LHC searches. New module for neutrino signature from DM capture in the Sun and the Earth Annihilation cross sections for some selected 3-body processes in addition to the 2-body tree-level processes. The 3-body option can be included in the computation of the relic density and/or for annihilation of dark matter in the galaxy.
