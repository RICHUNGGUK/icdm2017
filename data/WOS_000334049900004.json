In this study we use computational fluid dynamics method to simulate and analyse two models of axial blood pumps with a three-blade diffuser and a six-blade diffuser, named pump I and pump II, respectively, and to compare the flow patterns of these two kinds of blood pumps while both of them satisfy the conditions of the normal human blood differential pressure and blood flow. Results indicate that (i) the high shear force occurs between the diffuser and the rotor in which the crucial place leads to haemolysis and (ii) under the condition of 100mmHg pressure head and 5l/min flow rate, the difference between the two kinds of blood pumps, as far as the haemolytic performance is concerned, is notable. The haemolysis index of the two pumps is 0.32% and 0.2%. In conclusion, the performance of the blood pump is influenced by the diffusers' blade number. Pump II performed better than pump I, which can be the basic model for blood pump option.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation and comparative analysis of flow field in axial blood pumps", "paper_id": "WOS:000334049900004"}
