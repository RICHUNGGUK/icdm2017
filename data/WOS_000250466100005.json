The Beltrami flow can display linear as well as nonlinear behavior according to the values of a parameter beta, which represents the ratio between spatial and color distances. In general, the standard schemes fail to satisfy the discrete maximum principle. In this work we show that a nonnegative second order difference scheme can be built for this flow only for small beta, i.e. linear-like diffusion. Since this limitation is too severe, we construct a novel finite difference scheme, which is not nonnegative and satisfies the discrete maximum principle for all values of beta. Numerical results support the analysis.", "paper_title": "On the discrete maximum principle for the beltrami color flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000250466100005"}
