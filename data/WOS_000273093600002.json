We analyze the H.264 transform and quantization and reveal that for some quantization parameters there always exists at least one clipping compensation matrix to make the H.264 intraframe multi-generation coding idempotent as long as the same prediction mode and the same quantization parameter are selected for each coding generation. In addition, an idempotent H.264 intraframe multi-generation coding procedure is presented. The procedure has three additional steps to achieve idempotence: Prediction Mode and QP Restriction, Prediction Mode and QP Identification, and Clipping Compensation. Experiment results show that the proposed idempotent coding produces no generation PSNR loss and the rate-distortion efficiency is almost same as that of traditional H.264.", "paper_title": "Idempotent H.264 intraframe compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000273093600002"}
