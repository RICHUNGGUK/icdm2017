In the new algorithm, a variable-length real-value chromosome representation and a set of problem-specific evolutionary operators are used. Therefore, the proposed GA with message-based similarity (GAMS) clustering algorithm is able to automatically evolve and find the optimal number of clusters as well as proper clusters of the data set. Effectiveness of GAMS clustering algorithm is demonstrated for both artificial and real-life data set. Experiment results demonstrated that the GAMS clustering algorithm has high performance, effectiveness and flexibility. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
