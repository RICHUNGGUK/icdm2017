In the proposed method, the discretized signed distance function, a kind of level set function, is used as the design variables, and these are then updated using their sensitivities. The signed distance characteristic of the design variables are maintained by performing a re-initialization at every update during the iterated optimization procedure. In this paper, a minimum mean compliance problem and a compliant mechanism design problem are formulated based on the level set method. In the formulations of these design problems, a perimeter constraint is imposed to overcome the ill-posedness of the structural optimization problem. The sensitivity analysis for the above structural optimization problems is conducted based on the adjoint variable method. The augmented Lagrangian method is incorporated to deal with multiple constraints. Finally, several numerical examples that include multiple constraints are provided to confirm the validity of the method, and it is shown that appropriate optimal structures are obtained.", "paper_title": "A level set based topology optimization method using the discretized signed distance function as the design variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000276075900003"}
