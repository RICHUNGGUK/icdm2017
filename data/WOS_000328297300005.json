The result is extended through the center manifold theory for coupled oscillators. The main novelty of the result is that the surfaces, where the jumps occur, are not flat. Examples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results as well as application opportunities. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
