The paper discusses how the TBM and CBM techniques work toward maintenance decision making. Recent research articles covering the application of each technique are reviewed. The paper then compares the challenges of implementing each technique from a practical point of view, focusing on the issues of required data determination and collection, data analysis/modelling, and decision making. The paper concludes with significant considerations for future research. Each of the techniques was found to have unique concepts/principles, procedures, and challenges for real industrial practise. It can be concluded that the application of the CBM technique is more realistic, and thus more worthwhile to apply, than the TBM one. However, further research on CBM must be carried out in order to make it more realistic for making maintenance decisions. The paper provides useful information regarding the application of the TBM and CBM techniques in maintenance decision making and explores the challenges in implementing each technique from a practical perspective.
