The Price of Defense is the worst-case ratio, over all Nash equilibria, of the optimal gain of the defender over its gain at a Nash equilibrium. We provide a comprehensive collection of trade-offs between the Price of Defense and the computational efficiency of Nash equilibria.", "paper_title": "The price of defense", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700062"}
