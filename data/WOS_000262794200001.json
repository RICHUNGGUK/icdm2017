Different strategies can be used to perform this task. In this work, an approach that combines the global group results and the individual performance is presented. This approach makes use of a semantic framework to rank the individual participation of each group member and to compare their results with those they should have obtained to achieve the final mark. An experiment performed ill real settings is also reported in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
