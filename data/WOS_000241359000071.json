In this paper, we present the use of an ontology to filter medical documents and of visual concepts to describe and index associated images. These visual concepts are meaningful medical terms with associated visual appearance from image samples that are manually designed and learned from examples. Text and image indexing processes are performed in parallel and merged to answer mixed-mode queries. We show that fusion of these two methods are of a great benefit and that external knowledge stored in an ontology is mandatory to solve precise queries and provide the overall best results.", "paper_title": "Structured visual learning approach mixed with ontology dimensions for medical queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000071"}
