This chip employs a context-dependent HMM (hidden Markov model) based speech recognition algorithm, and contains parallel and pipelined hardware units for emission probability computation and Viterbi beam search. To maximize the performance, we adopted several memory access reduction techniques such as sub-vector clustering and multi-block processing for the emission probability computation. We also employed a custom DRAM controller for efficient access of consecutive data. Moreover, we analyzed the access pattern of data to minimize the internal SRAM size while maintaining high performance. The experimental results show that the implemented system performs speech recognition 2.4 and 1.8 times faster than real-time utilizing 32-bit DDR SDRAM and SDR SDRAM, respectively.", "paper_title": "Memory Access Optimized VLSI for 5000-Word Continuous Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000289166100008"}
