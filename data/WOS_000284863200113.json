This paper proposes new concepts of CTM and carriers' flexibility. A simulation approach is used to (i) evaluate the benefits of the proposed CTM, (ii) explain the concept of carrier's flexibility, and (iii) optimize the delivery speed capability. Based on a simple supply chain including one retailer and one carrier, three different simulation models have been developed with changeable delivery lead time as follows: (1) Unconstrained delivery speed capability without CTM. (2) Constrained delivery speed capability without ON; and (3) Constrained delivery speed capability with CTM. Simulation results reveal that CTM can significantly reduce the retailer's total costs and improve the retailer's service level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
