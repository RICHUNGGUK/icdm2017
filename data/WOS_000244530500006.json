A fast session key distribution scheme is desirable for handling highly changeable message flows among group members. In this paper, we propose a group keying scheme using tree structures for many-to-many group secure communications. The key storage and computational complexity of the proposed scheme are acceptable and practical for real-life applications. Moreover, once keys are distributed, group members will be able to freely communicate with any member in security with no need of a group controller.", "paper_title": "A tree-based scheme for security of many-to-many communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000244530500006"}
