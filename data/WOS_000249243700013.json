A simple algorithm for spectral estimation through discrete Fourier transform is studied and the property of spectral estimation is analyzed by considering the estimation of correlation functions. The proposed approach has low computational complexity and does not require the prior information of model structure so it can be implemented very easily. Furthermore, some approximated evaluations on the estimation errors are presented for spectral estimation and frequency response estimation of the plant model. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed identification algorithms and error analysis.", "paper_title": "System identification and error analysis in frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700013"}
