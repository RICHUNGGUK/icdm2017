Managing people effectively has significant impact on the outcome of a project. An effective incentive system helps the organization achieve its goals while meeting the personal needs of participants. The present study proposes a novel incentive pay system for project management based on responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) and fuzzy linguistic variables. It adopts the structure of RAM to model each team member's responsibility and performance, which are then evaluated by fuzzy linguistic variables. Four models are proposed for variant project management circumstances. When tested in a realistic application, the resultant feedback was supportive, with it beings perceived to be more fair and timely when compared to a conventional incentive pay system. Its implementation is efficient; and its results are effective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
