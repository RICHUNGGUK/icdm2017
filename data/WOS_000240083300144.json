This process is used to make a decision on acceptance or rejection. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the utterance verification, using a boosting classifier with ten confidence measures. This classifier combines a set of 'weak' learners into a 'strong' one. The experimental results present that it can remarkably improve the verification performance. Compared with a single confidence measure, the equal error rate is reduced by up to 23%. The results also show that the boosting classifier is better than the SVM and MLP classifiers, in term of the equal error rate.", "paper_title": "A boosting approach for utterance verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300144"}
