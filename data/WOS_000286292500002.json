During the channel demultiplexing, phase and quantization errors influence the performance of MCDD; those errors affect the bit error rate (BER) performance of M-MCD and PPF differently. In this paper, we derive the phase error variances that satisfy the condition that M-MCD and PPF have the same signal to noise ratio according to quantization bits, and then, with these results, analyze the BER performances of M-MCD and PPF. The results provided here may be a useful reference for the selection of M-MCD or PPF in designing the MCDD in an OBP satellite communications system.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of MCDD in an OBP Satellite Communications System", "paper_id": "WOS:000286292500002"}
