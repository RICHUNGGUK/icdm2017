However, the lack of spatial and structural information suppresses its performance in applications. In this paper, we introduce a multi-cues description by fusing structural, content and spatial information for partial-duplicate image retrieval. Firstly, we propose a rotation-invariant Local Self-Similarity Descriptor (LSSD), which captures the internal structural layouts in the local textural self-similar regions around interest points. Then, based on the spatial pyramid model, we make use of both LSSD and SIFT to construct an image representation with multi-cues. Finally, we formulate the Semi-Relative Entropy as the distance metric. Comparison experiments with state-of-the-art methods on four popular databases show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
