Acquiring ECs in product planning house of quality (PPHOQ) is a crucial step of QFD methodology. In previous studies, methods for acquiring ECs are qualitative and subjective. In this paper, a novel quantitative methodology for acquiring ECs in PPHOQ is presented. In the proposed methodology. a hierarchical framework for generating the refined set of EC candidates from the EC candidates obtained by brainstorming is established. A concept of a general relationship between a CR and an EC is introduced, and then a novel approach for identifying the general relationship measures with the help of intelligent characteristics of rough set is proposed. Another concept of the intension threshold of the general relationship corresponding to a CR is introduced, and then a set-operation-based method of acquiring ECs used in PPHOQ is presented. An example of a two-cylinder washing machine is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
