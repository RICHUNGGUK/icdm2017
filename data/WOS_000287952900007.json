Recent studies have suggested that the incorporation of biological information into validation methods to assess the quality of clustering results might be useful in facilitating biological and biomedical knowledge discoveries. In this study, we generalize two bio-validity indices, the biological homogeneity index and the biological stability index, to quantify the abilities of soft clustering algorithms such as fuzzy c-means and model-based clustering. The results of an evaluation of several existing soft clustering algorithms using simulated and real data sets indicate that the soft versions of the indices provide both better precision and better accuracy than the classical ones. The significance of the proposed indices is also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
