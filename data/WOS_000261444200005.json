Two of the most promising heuristics from nature for a wide class of combinatorial optimization problems, genetic algorithms (CA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), share data structures and co-evolve in parallel in order to improve the performance of the constituent algorithms. A modular approach is also adopted in order to obtain an easy scalable parallel evolutionary-ant colony framework. The performance of the proposed framework on properly designed benchmark problems is compared with effective CA and ACO approaches taken as algorithm components. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
