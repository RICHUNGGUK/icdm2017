Because of limitations on wireless transmission range, previous protocols may either be very inefficient or even do not work at all. We designed GeoSENS, a fully distributed pairwise key establishment protocol using the zone information of the region in which sensor networks are deployed. GeoSENS can be used in a region that is substantially larger than sensors' wireless transmission area with an overhead of storing more keys in sensors. We showed that GeoSENS will have very nice properties as well as in Eschenauer and Gligor [L. Eschenauer and V. D. Gligor, A key-management scheme for distributed sensor networks, in: Ninth ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security, November 2002, pp. 41-47], as the theory of random graphs can also be applied.
