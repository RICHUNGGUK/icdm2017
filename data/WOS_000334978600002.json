A proximal gradient method is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem with more than one penalty constraints. The analysis shows that imposing a single constraint is not enough and the estimator can be improved by a trade-off between two convex penalties. The developed framework can be extended to solve wide arrays of constrained convex optimization problems. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of the proposed method to graphical lasso and the SPICE estimate of the inverse covariance matrix.
