This is, however, often laborious, because the randomness in the color distribution patterns for texture elements makes texture measurement very difficult, despite these elements having a very similar visual appearance. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-scale color histograms to measure the effect of color distribution patterns efficiently and without having to compute the actual patterns, which saves considerable effort. Meanwhile, the hue-saturation-intensity color model is mainly adopted to take the advantage of human visual experiences in texture recognition. We discuss and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method by applying to various benchmarks. The results show that we can extract quality dominant textures automatically in real time, and faster by several orders of magnitude than existing methods.", "paper_title": "Extracting Dominant Textures in Real Time With Multi-Scale Hue-Saturation-Intensity Histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800007"}
