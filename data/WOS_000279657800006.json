Quoting activity is measured by the frequency of price revisions in the Euro/Dollar foreign exchange market. The multivariate double autoregressive conditional Poisson model is designed for time series of count data. It is based on the double Poisson distribution, which can be both over- and underdispersed. The main findings are first a significant interaction between dealers' quoting activity, which confirms hot potato trading. Second, news announcements have a different impact on the quoting activity of different banks. Third, impulse-response functions to news announcements show the dynamic nature of the reaction to these news releases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
