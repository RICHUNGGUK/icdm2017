Convergence of filter coefficients to the correct echo paths is obtained by pre-processing which delays the input signal periodically by one sample in one of the two channels. The time difference between the two stereo components of the input signals causes a shift of the sound image. This shift is compensated for by presenting the delayed component of the stereo signals to a loudspeaker at a higher intensity, and the other component at a lower intensity. Correct echo-path identification is analytically shown in a more general form than in the preceding literatures. A subjective listening test shows that this method is more effective for vocal musics. The processed signals are scored 0.45 lower than the original input signals, using the ITU-R five-grade impairment scale.", "paper_title": "A stereo echo canceler with input slides and counter-lateralization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500050"}
