The parameter a (resp., beta) is called the root-distortion (resp., lightness) of the tree T. Shallow-light trees (SLTs) constitute a fundamental graph structure, with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In particular, they were used for constructing spanners in network design, for VLSI-circuit design, for various data gathering and dissemination tasks in wireless and sensor networks, in overlay networks, and in the message-passing model of distributed computing. Tight tradeoffs between the parameters of SLTs were established by Awerbuch, Baratz, and Peleg [Proceedings of the 9th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), 1990, pp. 177-187, Efficient Broadcast and Light-Weight Spanners, manuscript, 1991] and Khuller, Raghavachari, and Young [Proceedings of the Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), :1993, pp. 243-250]. They showed that for any is an element of > 0 there always exist (1 + is an element of, O(1/is an element of))-SLTs and that the upper bound beta = O(1/is an element of) on the lightness of SLTs cannot be improved. In this paper we show that using Steiner points one can build SLTs with logarithmic lightness, i.e., beta = O(log 1/is an element of). This establishes an exponential separation between spanning SLTs and Steiner ones. In the regime is an element of = 0 our construction provides a shortest-path tree with weight at most O(log n) . w(MST(G)). Moreover, we prove matching lower bounds that show that all our results are tight up to constant factors.", "paper_title": "STEINER SHALLOW-LIGHT TREES ARE EXPONENTIALLY LIGHTER THAN SPANNING ONES", "paper_id": "WOS:000360654100005"}
