In this paper, we derive the operational rate of a CLDS protocol operating over a realistic wireless channel. Then, a Rate-Distortion (R-D) empirical model for above-capacity Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is deduced to estimate the loss of video quality incurred under inaccurate rate estimation scenarios. Finally, we develop a novel Unequal Error Protection (UEP) scheme which leverages the characteristics of LDPC codes to reduce the distortion of video quality in case of typically-observed burst wireless errors. The efficacy of the proposed rate adaptation architecture over conventional protocols is demonstrated by realistic video simulations using actual IEEE 802.11b wireless traces.", "paper_title": "On Rate-adaptive LDPC-based Cross-layer SVC over Bursty Wireless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000310982100017"}
