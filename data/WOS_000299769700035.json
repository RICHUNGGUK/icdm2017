Possible isomers and several spin states of these nickel clusters are considered systematically. The ground spin state and the lowest energy isomers are identified for each cluster size. The results are compared to available experimental and other theoretical data. The molecular orbitals of the largest cluster are plotted for all spin states. The relative stabilities of these states are interpreted in terms of superatom orbitals and no-pair bonding.", "paper_title": "Density functional theory study of small nickel clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700035"}
