Several past studies have addressed the question of what distinguishes biosequences from random strings, the latter being clearly unpalatable to the living cell. Such studies typically analyze the organization of biosequences in terms of their constituent characters or substrings and have, in particular, consistently exposed a tenacious lack of compressibility on behalf of biosequences. This article attempts, perhaps for the first time, an assessement of the structure and randomness of polypeptides in terms on newly introduced parameters that relate to the vocabulary of their (suitably constrained) subsequences rather than their substrings. It is shown that such parameters grasp structural/functional information, and are related to each other under a specific set of rules that span biochemically diverse polypeptides. Measures on subsequences separate few amino acid strings from their random permutations, but show that the random permutations of most polypeptides amass along specific linear loci.", "paper_title": "The Subsequence Composition of Polypeptides", "paper_id": "WOS:000281199700004"}
