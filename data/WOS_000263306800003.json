In Part I of this work, we established the so-called local REM conjecture of Bauke, Franz and Mertens. Namely, we showed that, as n -> infinity, the suitably rescaled energy spectrum above some fixed scale alpha tends to a Poisson process, with density one. and the partitions corresponding to these energies become asymptotically uncorrelated. In this part. we analyze the number partitioning problem for energy scales alpha(n) that grow with n, and show that the local REM conjecture holds as long as n(-1/4)alpha(n) degrees -> 0, and fails if alpha(n) grows like kappa n(1/4) with kappa > 0. We also consider the SK-spin glass model, and show that it has an analogous threshold: the local REM conjecture holds for energies of order o(n). and fails if the energies grow like kappa n with kappa > 0.
