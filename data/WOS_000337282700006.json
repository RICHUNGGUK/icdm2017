Intelligent shared spaces (such as homes, classrooms, offices, libraries, etc.) need to consider the preferences of users from diverse backgrounds. However, there are high levels of uncertainties faced in intelligent shared spaces. Hence, there is a need to employ intelligent decision making systems which can consider the various users preferences and criteria in order to achieve the convenience of the various users while handling the faced uncertainties. Therefore, we propose a Fuzzy Logic-Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making (FL-MCGDM) system which provides a comprehensive valuation from a group of users/decision makers based on the aggregation of users' opinions and preferences. The proposed FL-MCGDM system employs an interval type-2 fuzzy logic and hesitation index [from Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs)]. We have carried out experiments in the intelligent apartment (iSpace) located in the University of Essex to evaluate various approaches employing group decision making techniques for illumination selection in an intelligent shared environment. It was found that the Footprint of Uncertainty (of interval type-2 fuzzy sets) and hesitation index (of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs)) are able to provide a measure of the uncertainties present among the various decision makers. The proposed Type 2-Hesitation FL-MCGDM system better agrees with the users' decision compared to existing fuzzy MCDM including the Fuzzy Logic based TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), type-1 FL-MCGDM and interval type-2 in FL-MCGDM.", "paper_title": "A type 2-hesitation fuzzy logic based multi-criteria group decision making system for intelligent shared environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000337282700006"}
