In contrast to the gradient-based neural network (GNN), the novel design of ZNN is based on a matrix-valued indefinite error function, instead of a scalar-valued norm-based energy function. Therefore, a ZNN model depicted in implicit dynamics can globally and exponentially converge to the time-varying theoretical solution of the given linear matrix equation. Computer simulation results further demonstrate the superior performance of the ZNN model in solving the time-varying linear matrix equation compared with the conventional GNN model.
