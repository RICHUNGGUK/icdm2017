The aim of this paper is to provide a brief review of the state of the art in the area of electrical machines and power-electronic systems for high-power wind energy generation applications. As the first part of this paper, latest market penetration, current technology and advanced electrical machines are addressed. Design/methodology/approach - After a short description of the latest market penetration of wind turbines with various topologies globally by the end of 2010 is provided, current wind power technology, including a variety of fixed-and variable-speed (in particular with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) supplied with partial- and full-power converters, respectively) wind power generation systems, and modern grid codes, is presented. Finally, four advanced electrical-machine systems, viz., brushless DFIG, open winding PMSG, dual/multi 3-phase stator-winding PMSG and magnetic-gear outer-rotor PMSG, are identified with their respective merits and challenges for future high-power wind energy applications. Findings - For the time being, the gear-drive DFIG-based wind turbine is significantly dominating the markets despite its defect caused by mechanical gears, slip rings and brush sets. Meanwhile, direct-drive synchronous generator, especially utilizing permanent magnets on its rotor, supplied with a full-capacity power converter has become a more effective solution, particularly in high-power offshore wind farm applications. Originality/value - This first part of the paper reviews the latest market penetration of wind turbines with a variety of mature topologies, by summarizing their advantages and disadvantages. Four advanced electrical-machine systems are selected and identified by distinguishing their respective merits and challenges for future high-power wind energy applications.", "paper_title": "Electrical machines and power-electronic systems for high-power wind energy generation applications Part I - market penetration, current technology and advanced machine systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314484400002"}
