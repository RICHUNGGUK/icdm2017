Given an FDR bound, the updated approach uses a theoretical FDR estimator to maximize the number of identifications that satisfy both a fold-change cutoff that varies with the t-test P-value as a power law and a stringency criterion that aims to detect lowly abundant proteins. The new version has yielded significant improvements in sensitivity over the previous one.", "paper_title": "Improving the TFold test for differential shotgun proteomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000305419800054"}
