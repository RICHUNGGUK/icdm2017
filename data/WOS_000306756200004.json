Based on the data gathered by various information technology (IT) systems, social links can be extracted and exploited in knowledge exchange systems of a new kind. Users of such a system ask their queries and the system recommends known and unknown experts selected out of user's friends. The friends either provide the solution or forward the query to their friends. By means of the established social paths to experts, the system facilitates informal learning and exchange of latent knowledge between organisation members in their workplace. The overall concept, limitations and detailed features of this novel knowledge exchange system are discussed in the article.", "paper_title": "Web-based knowledge exchange through social links in the workplace", "paper_id": "WOS:000306756200004"}
