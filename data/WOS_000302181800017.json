However, it is often unavoidable in practice that the input blur kernel is erroneous to some extent. Sometimes, the error could be severe, e. g., for images degraded by nonuniform motion blurring. When an inaccurate blur kernel is used as the input, significant distortions will appear in the image recovered by existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel convex minimization model that explicitly takes account of error in the blur kernel. The resulting minimization problem can be efficiently solved by the so-called accelerated proximal gradient method. In addition, a new boundary extension scheme is incorporated in the proposed model to further improve the results. The experiments on both synthesized and real images showed the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm to both the image noise and the model error in the blur kernel.", "paper_title": "Robust Image Deblurring With an Inaccurate Blur Kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800017"}
