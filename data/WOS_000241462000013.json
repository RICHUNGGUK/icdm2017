The recording of actor state assertions - essentially data that a client or service actor may assert about itself regarding an interaction, is evaluated as a critical provenance component within a service-oriented architecture. Actor state data can be combined with assertions of interaction to enable better reasoning within a provenance system. The types of data that may be recorded as actor state are subjective, and dependent on the nature of the application and the eventual use that is likely to be made of this data. A registry system that allows monitoring tools to be related to user needs is described with reference to an application scenario.", "paper_title": "Recording actor state in scientific workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000241462000013"}
