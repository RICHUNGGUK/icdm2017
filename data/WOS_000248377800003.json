We have developed properties which capture the notion of non-blocking responsive behaviour, together with machine-based checks implemented in the CSP model-checker, FDR. In this paper we illustrate the use of our responsiveness properties with a small example, and provide a detailed comparison to related work in CCS. This work has led to the discovery of a new semantic model for CSP with respect to which such properties are fully abstract. We present the new stable revivals model and discuss implications for responsiveness checking.", "paper_title": "Responsiveness and stable revivals", "paper_id": "WOS:000248377800003"}
