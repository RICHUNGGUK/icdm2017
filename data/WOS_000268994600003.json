It is based on a mixed current conveyor and voltage amplifiers topology avoiding stability problems. The transimpedance is continuously variable and directly proportional to a voltage-controlled resistance. Another voltage-controlled resistor within a variable-gain voltage amplifier increases the photo-sensitivity range. A fixed-gain voltage amplifier and a current biasing of the current conveyor enable frequency bandwidth enhancement leading to a large transimpedance bandwidth product. A linearity error smaller than 2.8%, a photo-sensitivity range of 541 (54.7 dB) with the largest photo-sensitivity of 2468 mV/mu W, an offset voltage < 13.7 mV, a frequency bandwidth up to 277 MHz, a slew rate up to 377 V/mu s, a transimpedance bandwidth product up to 122 T Omega Hz, and a maximum power consumption of < 4.3 mW are achieved.", "paper_title": "A 122 T Omega Hz transimpedance bandwidth product BiCMOS optical sensor front-end with a 54.7 dB voltage-controlled photo-sensitivity range", "paper_id": "WOS:000268994600003"}
