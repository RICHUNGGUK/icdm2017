We present a case study of related article search, a browsing tool designed to help users navigate the information space defined by results of the PubMed (R) search engine. This feature leverages content-similarity links that tie MEDLINE (R) citations together in a vast document network. We examine the effectiveness of related article search from two perspectives: a topological analysis of networks generated from information needs represented in the TREC 2005 genomics track and a query log analysis of real PubMed users. Together, data suggest that related article search is a useful feature and that browsing related articles has become an integral part of how users interact with PubMed.
