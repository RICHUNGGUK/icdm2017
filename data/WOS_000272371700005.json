A background in the architecture of knowledge based systems is presented, a list of common applications and a discussion of both rule- and frame-based knowledge representation. Hybrid systems which combine both types of knowledge representation were discussed. New conceptual modeling artifacts (extending UML 2.0) were defined to model hybrid systems and Specific usage of this artifact was made in ISA hierarchies, composition hierarchies and solution hierarchies to model the problem space for problems which involve classification, diagnosis and decision making.", "paper_title": "Solution hierarchies in object oriented conceptual models for knowledge-based systems using extensions of UML 2.0", "paper_id": "WOS:000272371700005"}
