This paper presents CARVE (Context-Aware Relational View dEfinition), a methodology for context-aware view definition, well-suited for the design of modern, dynamic applications that, in different environments and situations, need to access different portions of data. The methodological approach includes a context-design phase, followed by a phase when each of the possible application contexts is automatically associated with its relevant part of information (context-aware view). Accordingly, CARVE is based on a context model, on guidelines to define partial views related to components of the context, and on a set of operators used to perform partial-view composition to derive the context-aware views. The paper leverages on previously presented preliminary results and introduces and formalizes the overall methodology and its steps, providing a revised and assessed approach. The results of the application of the approach to a set of case studies are reported, together with a careful evaluation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
