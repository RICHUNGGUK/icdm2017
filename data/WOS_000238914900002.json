We analyze the switching-time effect on the burst loss probability using a continuous-time Markov chain. In our analysis, the transmission time of a burst is characterized with both the burst size and the switching time, and the burst loss probability, burst throughput, and data throughput are explicitly derived using the Geo,M/M/c/c queueing model. Numerical examples show that our analysis is quite useful for investigating the effect of the switching time on the timer-based burst assembly. We also consider voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) service as a delay-sensitive application, and we investigate the switching time on the VoIP service. From our performance analysis, we derive an appropriate switching time and a burst processing time of the VoIP service in terms of the transmission distance.
