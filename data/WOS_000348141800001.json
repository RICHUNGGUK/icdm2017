In this paper, we propose three evolved node B (eNB)-centric energy-saving cooperation techniques for long-term evolution (LTE) systems. These techniques, named as intra-network, inter-network, and joint cooperation, involve traffic-aware intelligent cooperation among eNBs belonging to the same or different networks. Our proposed techniques dynamically reconfigure LTE access networks in real time utilizing less number of active eNBs and thus, achieve energy savings. In addition, these techniques are distributed and self-organizing in nature. Analytical models for evaluating switching dynamics of eNBs under these cooperation mechanisms are also formulated. We thoroughly investigate the proposed system under different numbers of cooperating networks, traffic scenarios, eNB power profiles, and their switching thresholds. Optimal energy savings while maintaining quality of service is also evaluated. Results indicate a significant reduction in network energy consumption. System performance in terms of network capacity utilization, switching statistics, additional transmit power, and eNB sleeping patterns is also investigated. Finally, a comprehensive comparison with other works is provided for further validation.
