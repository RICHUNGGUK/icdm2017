By expanding DeLone and McLean's information system success model, this study develops a model of the impacts of system quality, information quality, perceived product complexity, trust, and satisfaction on repurchase intention in the context of online insurance Web sites. Data collected from 270 online-insurance-Web site consumers provide support for the model. The results indicate that perceived product complexity, trust, and satisfaction are determinants of repurchase intention. In addition, system quality and information quality significantly affect both perceived product complexity and trust. Furthermore, perceived product complexity is found to be a significant mediator of the indirect effects of system quality and information quality on customer satisfaction, and trust and satisfaction are statistically verified to be significant mediators of the indirect effects of system quality, information quality, and perceived product complexity on repurchase intentions. The research results provide online sellers with significant insights into the development of online systems and product/services that can better fulfill the needs of potential and repeat consumers. The theoretical and practical implications of this work are discussed.", "paper_title": "DETERMINANTS OF SUCCESS FOR ONLINE INSURANCE WEB SITES: THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS, PRODUCT COMPLEXITY, AND TRUST", "paper_id": "WOS:000329604500001"}
