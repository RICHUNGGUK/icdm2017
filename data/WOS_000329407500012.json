In this paper, general conductance model of DNA sensor-based graphene is obtained, and the electrical performance of nanostructured graphene-based DNA sensor is evaluated by the current-voltage characteristic. As a result, by increasing the complementary DNA concentration, the drain current is going toward higher amounts.", "paper_title": "Current-voltage modeling of graphene-based DNA sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500012"}
