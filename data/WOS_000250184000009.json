But crucially, colour transforms are underdetermined, which means that the number of colourimetric dimensions is smaller than the number of device channels. While the first three problems are associated with the LCD, the fourth problem stems from the additional channel in the HDR, the backlight. A 37\" flat-panel Brightside DR37-P HDR display was characterised. Using a spectroradiometer we recorded spectral radiance, chromaticities and luminance and estimated the true increase in gamut of the display due to the additional LED layer. We present a basic characterisation, propose a method for accurately presenting a desired luminance and chromaticity output despite the underdetermined problem and give an estimate of the available gamut.
