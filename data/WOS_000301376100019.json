Two parallel delay-line stages with slightly different incremental step sizes are cascaded, resulting in a finer resolution compared to the traditional parallel delay line. A 2-bit TDC fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology demonstrates the principle with a time resolution of 2.5 ps and a differential nonlinearity of 0.13 LSB.", "paper_title": "Vernier parallel delay-line based time-to-digital converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000301376100019"}
