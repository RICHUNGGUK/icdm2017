The number of the above entities is sufficiently large for describing the overall state of the system using a suitable probability distribution over the microscopic state. The first part of the paper is devoted to the derivation of suitable mathematical structures which can be properly used to model a variety of models in different fields of applied sciences. Then some research perspectives are analyzed, focussed on applications to biological systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
