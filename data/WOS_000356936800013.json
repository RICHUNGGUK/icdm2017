However, for a workflow-enabled application, a single workflow model is not possible to meet various requirements from different users. Therefore, many workflow platforms provide tools that can be used to change the workflow model by users. An approach to mine users' workflow change operations is proposed, through which change rules can be discovered and be reused to configure the workflow model automatically in the future. The method to retrieve the change operations is firstly introduced and a change rule-mining algorithm is given. Then the process of applying change rules to configure the workflow model is described. Finally, a prototype system and a case study are presented.", "paper_title": "Mining change operations for workflow platform as a service", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936800013"}
