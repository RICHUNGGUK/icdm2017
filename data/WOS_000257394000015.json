It not only unifies B-splines, trigonometric and hyperbolic polynomial B-splines, but also produces more new types of splines. omega B-spline bases are defined in the space spanned by {cos omega t, sin omega t, 1, t, ..., t(n) , ...} with the sequence of frequencies omega, where n is an arbitrary nonnegative integer. omega B-splines persist all desirable properties of B-splines. Furthermore, they have some special properties advantageous for modeling free form curves and surfaces.", "paper_title": "omega B-splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000015"}
