Among the various strategies proposed for telomerase inhibition or telomere uncapping, the stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) structures is a very promising one. Additionally, G4 stabilizing ligands also act over tumors mediated by the alternative elongation of telomeres. Accordingly, the discovery of novel compounds able to act on telomeres and/or inhibit the telomerase enzyme by stabilizing DNA telomeric G4 structures as well as the development of approaches efficiently prioritizing such compounds constitute active areas of research in computational medicinal chemistry and anticancer drug discovery. In this direction, we applied a virtual screening strategy based on the rigorous application of QSAR best practices and its harmonized integration with structure-based methods. More than 600,000 compounds from commercial databases were screened, the first 99 compounds were prioritized, and 21 commercially available and structurally diverse candidates were purchased and submitted to experimental assays. Such strategy proved to be highly efficient in the prioritization of G4 stabilizer hits, with a hit rate of 23.5%. The best G4 stabilizer hit found exhibited a shift in melting temperature from FRET assay of +7.3 degrees C at 5 mu M, while three other candidates also exhibited a promising stabilizing profile. The two most promising candidates also exhibited a good telomerase inhibitory ability and a mild inhibition of HeLa cells growth. None of these candidates showed antiproliferative effects in normal fibroblasts. Finally, the proposed virtual screening strategy proved to be a practical and reliable tool for the discovery of novel G4 ligands which can be used as starting points of further optimization campaigns.", "paper_title": "Harmonization of QSAR Best Practices and Molecular Docking Provides an Efficient Virtual Screening Tool for Discovering New G-Quadruplex Ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000363914200004"}
