But it seems that we are too busy sometimes to spare nearly two hours watching a movie from beginning to end. We'd like to find and watch the most exciting episodes that we are interested in as soon as possible. The media players we use often only provide a slider bar for locating, which is rather low in efficiency. Respecting this, an affective annotation method for video clips is proposed in this paper and the method is implemented in an affectively annotated media player. In addition, two experiments were set up to evaluate the proposed method. Experiment results indicate that affective annotation facilitates the subjects in quick locating target events and helps them understand the scenarios better.", "paper_title": "A color bar based affective annotation method for media player", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000070"}
