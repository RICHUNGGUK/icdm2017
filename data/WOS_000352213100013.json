A child and an adult share similar organs yet dramatically differ in size. Comparing the two is a challenging task to a computerized approach as scale and shape are coupled. Recently, it was shown that a local measure based on the Gaussian curvature can be used to normalize the local metric of a surface and then to extract global features and distances. In this paper we consider higher dimensions; specifically, we construct a scale invariant metric for volumetric domains which can be used in analysis of medical datasets such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", "paper_title": "Scale Invariant Metrics of Volumetric Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100013"}
