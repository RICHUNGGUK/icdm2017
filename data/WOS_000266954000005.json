The resolution of this lack of trust relating to the use of the Internet, particularly orientated towards its commercial use and online purchasing, requires partly from website developers to create and maintain web applications that are robust and provide a certain degree of resilience to attack from outside threats. This project intends to contribute to this particular aspect by providing site developers and system testers, as well as simple site users, with a tool for reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning and remote network mapping that is easily accessible and useable due to its web-based and visual, event-driven interface. It is anticipated that the cumbersome task of learning to use a number of command line tools and their exact functionality and parameters can be avoided through this and similar developments, and hence that this will potentially widen the access to security testing, particularly to small and medium businesses.
