This study thus adds to previous research of IS acceptance by investigating diverse post-adoptive use behaviors, which are the intensity, extent of use and embeddedness of BIS. We followed an exploratory approach to conceptualize a business intelligence extended use model. The findings show that personal innovativeness and readiness for change boost the transition to the embeddedness of BIS into workers routines. The relevance of the information provided by BIS is crucial for the deep structural usage of BIS, which has not been highlighted in previous models of IT acceptance. Besides taking pre- and post-implemental issues that address acceptance determinants into consideration, for the success of BIS we must consider trans-implemental issues.", "paper_title": "CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE EXTENDED USE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000352184100009"}
