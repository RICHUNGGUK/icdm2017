Each political decision in fact implies some form of social reactions, it affects economic and financial aspects and has substantial environmental impacts. Improving decision making in this context could have a huge beneficial impact on all these aspects. There are a number of Artificial Intelligence techniques that could play an important role in improving the policy-making process such as decision support and optimization techniques, game theory, data and opinion mining and agent-based simulation. We outline here some potential use of AI technology as it emerged by the European Union (EU) EU FP7 project ePolicy: Engineering the Policy Making Life Cycle, and we identify some potential research challenges.", "paper_title": "Sustainable Policy Making: A Strategic Challenge for Artificial Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000341805500003"}
