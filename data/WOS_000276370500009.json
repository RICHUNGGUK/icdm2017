In this article, a distributed, grant-funded research project group provides the setting for an analysis of the process that members went through as they disengaged from and dismantled their group when the funding period ended and the project was winding down. Qualitative interviews with group members were analyzed using a model of disengaging that was developed in an earlier study. The model comprises 12 interwoven parts of a disengaging process that begins well before the group ends and extends beyond the official termination of the group. The model frames the analysis and is revised as a result of the research findings.", "paper_title": "Disengaging From a Distributed Research Project: Refining a Model of Group Departures", "paper_id": "WOS:000276370500009"}
