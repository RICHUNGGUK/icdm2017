The system is built on Microsoft SharePoint and SharePoint Learning Kit (SLK) and enables the creation of modular and expansible software, presenting a simplified interaction with the user. PLEBOX has been used by 210 users (10 teachers and 200 engineering students) of the University of Beira Interior, Portugal and the University of Valladolid, Spain. The PLEBOX platform has innovative features compared to existing platforms, such as creating a customizable work environment, the ability to add applications, a framework for developing modules, and a new form to exposure learning contents, which can be used in engineering applications and education.
