Feng and Rao introduced a modified construction that improves the parameters while still using one-point divisors. A separate improvement of the parameters was introduced by Matthews considering the classical construction but with two-point divisors. Those two approaches are combined to describe an elementary construction of two-point improved codes. Upon analysis of their minimum distance and redundancy, it is observed that they improve on the previous constructions for a large range of designed distances.", "paper_title": "Improved Two-Point Codes on Hermitian Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500030"}
