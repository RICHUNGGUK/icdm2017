However, the grids on which the field data are stored are typically very large, consisting of thousands of data points, which make them cumbersome to store and manipulate. The wavelet transform is a commonly used data compression technique, for example, in signal processing and image compression. Here we use the wavelet transform to encode molecular interaction fields as wavelet thumbnails, which represent the original grid data in significantly reduced volumes. We describe a method for aligning wavelet thumbnails based on extracting extrema from the thumbnails and subsequently use them for virtual screening. We demonstrate that wavelet thumbnails provide an effective method of capturing the three-dimensional information encoded in a molecular interaction field.", "paper_title": "Compression of Molecular Interaction Fields Using Wavelet Thumbnails: Application to Molecular Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000301884400011"}
