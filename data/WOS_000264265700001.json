The task of this learning paradigm is to predict the label set for each unseen instance, through analyzing training instances with known label sets. In this paper, a neural network based multi-label learning algorithm named Ml-rbf is proposed, which is derived from the traditional radial basis function (RBF) methods. Briefly, the first layer of an Ml-rbf neural network is formed by conducting clustering analysis on instances of each possible class, where the centroid of each clustered groups is regarded as the prototype vector of a basis function. After that, second layer weights of the Ml-rbf neural network are learned by minimizing a sum-of-squares error function. Specifically, information encoded in the prototype vectors corresponding to all classes are fully exploited to optimize the weights corresponding to each specific class. Experiments on three real-world multi-label data sets show that Ml-rbf achieves highly competitive performance to other well-established multi-label learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Ml-rbf: RBF Neural Networks for Multi-Label Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000264265700001"}
