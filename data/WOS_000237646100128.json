However, obvious improvement can hardly be made until the introduction of the ensemble classifier. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Attribute-Oriented Ensemble Classifier (EAOEC) to improve the accuracy of sub-classifiers and at the same time maintain the diversity among them. EAOEC uses the idea of evolution to choose proper attribute subset for the building of every sub-classifier. To avoid the huge computation cost for the evolution, EAOEC uses the gini value gained during the construction of a sub-tree as the evolution basis to build the next sub-tree. Eventually, EAOEC classifier uses uniform weight voting to combine all sub-classifiers and experiments show that EAOEC can efficiently improve the predictive accuracy.", "paper_title": "An evolutionary and attribute-oriented ensemble classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100128"}
