The continuity and momentum equations governing the unsteady two-dimensional flow of a second-grade fluid are reduced to a single differential equation through similarity transformations. The resulting differential system is computed by a homotopy analysis method. Graphical results are discussed for both suction and blowing cases. In addition, the derived results are compared with the homotopy perturbation solution in a viscous fluid (Math. Probl. Eng., DOI: 10.1155/2009/603916).
