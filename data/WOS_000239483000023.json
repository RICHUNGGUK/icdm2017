As the data points needed by the auto-plotting system coming from the remote speech signals, to reach high recognition accuracy, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach was chosen as the speech recognition approach. Then the paper is detailed on the speaker dependent (SD), speaker independent (SI) and speaker adaptive (SA) speech recognition methods. We proposed the n-speech models SD system as the recognition system to gain the highest recognition performance in varying speech environments. However the system required that searching for the optimal model from the database should finish in 5 minutes, so the paper finally describes how the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was used to pre clustering to the n-speech models, to decrease the time for speech recognition and results evaluation and decrease matching time, Experiments show the n-speech models SD system can select the best-matching model in the limited time and improve the average speech recognition accuracy to 97.2. It ideally suits the system requirements.", "paper_title": "The clustering solution of speech recognition models with SOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000023"}
