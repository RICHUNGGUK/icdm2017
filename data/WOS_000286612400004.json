This complexity needs to be controlled via new technological advancements and balanced with a reduction in mission and operation costs. Planned and hypothesized missions involve self-management, biological-inspiration based on swarms, and autonomous operation as a means of achieving these goals. We consider a tailored software engineering approach to developing such systems based on agent-oriented software engineering and formal methods. We report on advances in modeling, implementing, and testing NASA swarm-based concept missions.", "paper_title": "Modeling NASA swarm-based systems: using agent-oriented software engineering and formal methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612400004"}
