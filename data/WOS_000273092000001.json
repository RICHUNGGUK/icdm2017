Recently some researchers have considered the impact of various error-control schemes on these objectives and on the tradeoff between them. In all these works performance and reliability are measured separately. However, we will argue in this paper that the use of error-control schemes in on-chip networks results in degradable systems, hence, performance and reliability must be measured jointly using a unified measure, i.e., performability. Based on the traditional concept of performability, we provide a definition for the \"Interconnect Performability\". Analytical models are developed for interconnect performability and expected energy consumption. A detailed comparative analysis of the error-control schemes using the performability analytical models and SPICE simulations is provided taking into consideration voltage swing variations (used to reduce interconnect energy consumption) and variations in wire length. Furthermore, the impact of noise power and time constraint on the effectiveness of error-control schemes are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Performability/Energy Tradeoff in Error-Control Schemes for On-Chip Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273092000001"}
