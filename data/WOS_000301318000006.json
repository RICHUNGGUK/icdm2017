Here, the application of damage theory to prediction of concrete spalling in fire is investigated in the context of a fully coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical formulation. The ability of the model to capture spalling is assessed as is its sensitivity to choice of parametric relationships. The model, calibrated against experimental results, is shown to be a useful indicator for spalling. However, selection of model parameters must be carefully considered as a whole, not in isolation.
