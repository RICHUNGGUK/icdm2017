When the number of records is fixed in advance, the data are referred to as inversely sampled record-breaking data. In this paper, we study the problems of constructing the nonparametric confidence intervals for quantiles and quantile intervals of the parent distribution based on record data. For a single record-breaking sample, the confidence coefficients of the confidence intervals for the pth quantile cannot exceed p and 1 - p, on the basis of upper and lower records, respectively; hence, replication is required. So, we develop the procedure based on k independent record-breaking samples. Various cases have been studied and in each case, the optimal k and the exact nonparametric confidence intervals are obtained, and exact expressions for the confidence coefficients of these confidence intervals are derived. Finally, the results are illustrated by numerical computations.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric confidence intervals for quantiles and quantile intervals from inversely sampled record breaking data in a multi-sample plan", "paper_id": "WOS:000283066100004"}
