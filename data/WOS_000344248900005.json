In this article, I review this critique and two popular recommendations of resolution. The first is to retire SQL's multivalued logic and replace it with a conventional binary logic. The second is to revise SQL's implementation of multivalued logic so that it can recognize tautological propositions. I argue that underlying this debate is an ontological disagreement about how to properly model missing data and, more generally, social reality. I demonstrate that the relational model provides useful tools for modeling different types of missing data in different ways and, furthermore, offers a useful foundation upon which to conduct social research, one that supports both variable-oriented and case-oriented analysis.", "paper_title": "Ontological Considerations When Modeling Missing Data With Relational Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000344248900005"}
