From this assumption, nonlocality either in space and time follows directly. This is what is called Fourier Ontology. In order to build nonlinear causal and local quantum physics, it is necessary to reject Fourier ontology and accept that in certain cases a finite wave may have a well defined frequency. Now the mathematical tool to describe this new approach is wavelet local analysis. This more general nonlinear local and causal quantum physics, in the limit of the linear approximation, contains formally orthodox quantum mechanics as a particular case.", "paper_title": "Local analysis by wavelets versus nonlocal Fourier analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500012"}
