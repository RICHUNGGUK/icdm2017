The purpose of this study is to develop an online fault diagnosis framework for a dynamical process incorporating multi-scale principal component analysis (MSPCA) for feature extraction and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for learning the fault-symptom correlation from the process historical data. The features extracted from raw measured data sets using MSPCA are partitioned into score space and residual space which are then fed into multiple ANFIS classifiers in order to diagnose different faults. This data-driven based method extracts fault-symptom correlation from the data eliminating the use of process model. The use of multiple ANFIS classifiers for fault diagnosis with each dedicated to one specific fault, reduces the computational load and provides an expandable framework to incorporate new fault identified in the process. Also, the use of MSPCA enables the detection of small changes occurring in the measured variables and the proficiency of the system is improved by monitoring the subspace which is most sensitive to the faults. The proposed MSPCA-ANFIS based framework is tested on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and results for the selected fault cases, particularly those which exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, show improvement over the conventional multivariate PCA as well as the conventional PCA-ANFIS based methods.
