Classification and clustering multimedia contents require extraction and combination of information from these streams. The streams constituting a multimedia content are naturally different in terms of scale, dynamics and temporal patterns. These differences make combining the information sources using classic combination techniques difficult. We propose an asynchronous feature level fusion approach that creates a unified hybrid feature space out of the individual signal measurements. The target space can be used for clustering or classification of the multimedia content. As a representative application, we used the proposed approach to recognize basic affective states from speech prosody and facial expressions. Experimental results over two audiovisual emotion databases with 42 and 12 subjects revealed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly higher than the unimodal face based and speech based systems, as well as synchronous feature level and decision level fusion approaches.", "paper_title": "Multimodal information fusion application to human emotion recognition from face and speech", "paper_id": "WOS:000278287300002"}
