In this paper, a general SAR imaging model used in TOPS and other SAR modes is introduced, where the antenna sweep rate, Doppler centroid rate, illumination time and azimuth resolution are described by a parameter defined as the \"mode factor\". After analyzing the characteristics of TOPS signal, an algorithm based on chirp-z transform is proposed, in which a new de-rotation function is used. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the TOPS mode spaceborne SAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000276598700015"}
