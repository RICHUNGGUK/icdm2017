The constraint resides in that the total longitudinal energy of the emissions in the MC and in the underlying QCD evolution is predefined (constrained). This CIVIC implements exactly the full DGLAP evolution of the parton distributions in the hadron with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale. The algorithm of the CIVIC is referred to as the non-Markovian type. The non-Markovian MC algorithm is defined as the one in which the multiplicity of emissions is chosen randomly as the first variable and not the last one, as in the Markovian MC algorithms. The former case resembles that of the fixed-order matrix element calculations. The CMC algorithm can serve as an alternative to the so-called backward evolution Markovian algorithm of Sjostrand, which is used for modeling the initial-state parton shower in modern QCD MC event generators. We test practical feasibility and efficiency of our CMC implementation in a series of numerical exercises, comparing its results with those from other MC and non-MC programs, in a wide range of Q and x, down to the 0.1% precision level. In particular, satisfactory numerical agreement is found with the results of the Markovian MC program of our own and the other non-MC program, The efficiency of the new constrained MC is found to be quite good.
