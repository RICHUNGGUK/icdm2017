The proposed model displays a complete scheme for the simulation of 3-phase transformers. The new model is mainly based on the transmission line model and the Jiles-Atherton model of a power system, using lumped parameters. Jiles-Atherton model parameters were determined by curve fitting and numerical optimization iteration. The developed model is particularly suitable for fault analysis and protective relaying studies under harmonic conditions where the transformer is driven into the nonlinear regime. The performance of the method was evaluated by both theorical and experimental data.", "paper_title": "A novel three-phase transformer hysteresis model in MATLAB (TM) Simulink", "paper_id": "WOS:000304385400003"}
