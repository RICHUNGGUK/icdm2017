To realize real-time processing of image recognition on such systems we need optimized libraries for embedded processors. OpenCV is one of the most widely used libraries for computer vision applications and has many functions optimized for Intel processors, but no function is optimized for embedded processors. We present a parallel implementation of OpenCV library on the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell), which is one of the most widely used high performance embedded processors. Experimental result shows that most of the functions optimized for the Cell processor are faster than functions optimized for Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 3.00 GHz. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
