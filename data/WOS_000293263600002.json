The method's solutions are assessed at optimal variable settings with respect to bias, quality of predictions and robustness through optimization measures, and the usefulness of those measures to select the compromise solution is evaluated. Three examples with different features in terms of responses variance are used and the performance of various analysis methods is compared. Results show that a less sophisticated desirability-based method can compete with other methods designed to perform well under adverse conditions and that the optimization measures justify its use in real life problems.
