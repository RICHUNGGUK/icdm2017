This issue has been shown by regression indexes in a number of papers. Weather forecasts could be influenced by some variables that have uncertainty, so the deterministic approaches may lead to incorrect predictions. The proposed algorithm can be used when some variables have uncertainty. In this study, a fuzzy-based probabilistic approach has been chosen to show the effect of El Nino and La Nina on the monthly total precipitation in northern coasts of the Oman Gulf.", "paper_title": "ENSO effect investigation on total monthly precipitation in northern coasts of the Oman Gulf based on fuzzy analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100032"}
