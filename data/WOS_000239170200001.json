An optimal O(n) time and space algorithm to compute an upward two-page book embedding of a TTSP-digraph with n vertices is presented. A previous algorithm of Alzohairi and Rival [1] runs in O(n(3)) time and assumes that the input series-parallel digraph does not have transitive edges. An application of this result to a computational geometry problem is also discussed. More precisely, upward two-page book embeddings are used to deal with the upward point-set embeddability problem, i.e., the problem of mapping planar digraphs onto a given set of points in the plane so that all edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction. The equivalence between upward two-page book embeddability and upward point-set embeddability with at most one bend per edge on any given set of points is proved. An O(n log n)-time algorithm for computing an upward point-set embedding with at most one bend per edge for TTSP-digraphs is presented.", "paper_title": "Book embeddability of series-parallel digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239170200001"}
