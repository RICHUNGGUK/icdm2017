We assume that designs are represented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0 and we propose a formal mapping between design changes and a classification of regression test cases into three categories: Reusable, Retestable, and Obsolete. We provide evidence of the feasibility of the methodology and its usefulness by using our prototype tool on an industrial case study and two student projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
