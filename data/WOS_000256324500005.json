If the far field inflow is uniform and the long axis of an elliptical fault of any length-scale is parallel to the far field inflow direction, a complete set of analytical solutions has been presented for the pore-fluid velocity, stream function and excess pore-fluid pressure around the elliptical fault embedded in fluid-saturated porous media. Because the analytical solutions are explicitly expressed in the conventional Cartesian coordinate system, not only can they be used to gain a theoretical insight into the pore-fluid flow patterns around geological faults and large cracks, but also they can be used as valuable benchmark solutions for validating any numerical methods. After a finite element computational model is validated by comparing the numerical solutions with the present analytical solutions, it is used to investigate pore-fluid flow focused heat transfer around geological faults in hydrothermal systems. Some interesting conclusions in relation to the effects of geological faults on pore-fluid flow focused heat transfer have been made through both the theoretical and the numerical analyses.
