Presently, we use an existing method, multi-fidelity Kriging, to reduce the number of simulations required for the UQ analysis of the performance of a sailing yacht hull, considering uncertainties in the tank blockage, mass and centre of gravity. We compare the UQ results with experimental values. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
