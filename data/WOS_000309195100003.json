For such automata the acceptance of an input is quantified with a probability. There are plenty of results in the literature addressing the complexity of checking the equivalence of these automata, that is, checking whether two automata accept all inputs with the same probability. On the other hand, the critical problem of finding the minimal automata equivalent to a given one has been left open [C. Moore, J.R Crutchfield, Quantum automata and quantum grammars, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 237 (2000) 275306, see p. 304, Problem 5]. In this work, we reduce the minimization problem of probabilistic and quantum automata to finding a solution of a system of algebraic polynomial (in)equations. An EXPSPACE upper bound on the complexity of the minimization problem is derived by applying Renegar's algorithm. More specifically, we show that the state minimization of probabilistic automata, measure-once quantum automata, measure-many quantum automata, measure-once generalized quantum automata, and measure-many generalized quantum automata is decidable and in EXPSPACE. Finally, we also solve an open problem concerning minimal covering of stochastic sequential machines [A. Paz, Introduction to Probabilistic Automata, Academic Press, New York, 1971, p. 43].
