Data mining techniques that make it possible for the businesses to incorporate financial considerations will be more meaningful to the decision makers. Decision theoretic framework has been helpful in providing a better understanding of classification models. This study describes a semi-supervised decision theoretic rough set model. The model is based on an extension of decision theoretic model proposed by Yao. The proposal is used to model financial cost/benefit scenarios for a promotional campaign in a real-world retail store.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised Rough Cost/Benefit Decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000270175400009"}
