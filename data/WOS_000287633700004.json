The second part of the work is devoted to the numerical estimation of the tensile blast induced damage evolution law. The set up methodology is then applied to a set of limestone cores which were sampled before and after a real field blast round. The image analysis algorithm which was developed during the present work is based on a segmentation technique that uses a particular thresholding. Petrographic parameters, such as crack number, orientation, extension, centroid position were computed as a first step aiming at a fine characterization of the cracked medium. The most important estimated parameter is the specific crack area which is defined as the ratio between the crack area and the total image area. This parameter was taken as the rock internal damage. A dynamic tensile damage ordinary partial differential equation is numerically solved and calibrated with the obtained data in order to derive a general blast induced damage evaluation law within the muckpile blocks. The application of the numerical algorithm to cores coming from sampled blocks before and after real field blasts allowed the estimation of damage parameter and dynamic stress evolution histories as well as an estimation of the microfracturing activation and growth energies used during the blast.
