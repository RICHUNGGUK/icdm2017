For such nonlinear system, an output tracking control approach based on decomposition is presented and applied to a planar vertical takeoff and landing (PVTOL) aircraft. The external dynamics of the system can be separated into minimum-phase and non-minimum-phase parts. The internal dynamics of the system is separated to linear part and nonlinear part, and the linear part of the internal dynamics is only related with the non-minimum phase part of the external dynamics and the states of itself. Consequently, two low-dimensional controllers are designed separately to stabilize the two subsystems, and make the overall closed-loop system stable in spite of the existence of disturbances. Through this method, the design of the controller parameters is very simple. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Output tracking for nonlinear non-minimum phase systems and application to PVTOL aircraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516400004"}
