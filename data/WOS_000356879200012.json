These thermal-stress related shifts are coupled with other temperature effects on transistor parameters that are seen even in the absence of TSVs. In this paper, analytical models are developed to holistically represent the effect of thermally-induced variations on circuit timing. A biaxial stress model is built, based on a superposition of 2-D axisymmetric and Boussinesq-type elasticity models. The computed stresses and strains are then employed to evaluate transistor mobility, saturation velocity, and threshold voltage. The electrical variations are translated into gate-level delay and leakage power calculations, which are then elevated to circuit-level analysis to thoroughly evaluate the variations in circuit performance-induced by TSV stress.", "paper_title": "A Holistic Analysis of Circuit Performance Variations in 3-D ICs With Thermal and TSV-Induced Stress Considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000356879200012"}
