We derive a joint observation and mixing model and show how it affects endmember identifiability within the geometrical unmixing framework. An analysis of the model reveals that non-negative blurring results in a contraction of both the minimum-volume enclosing and maximum-volume enclosed simplex. We demonstrate this contraction property in the case of a spectrally invariant point-spread function. The benefit of prior deconvolution on the accuracy of the restored sources and abundances is illustrated using simulated and real Raman spectroscopic data.", "paper_title": "Does Deblurring Improve Geometrical Hyperspectral Unmixing?", "paper_id": "WOS:000331551100003"}
