We present a fully distributed algorithm for computing vertex covers of weight at most twice the optimum, in the case of integer weights. Our algorithm runs in an expected number of O(log n + log (W) over cap) communication rounds, where (W) over cap is the average vertex-weight. The previous best algorithm for this problem requires O(log n(log n+ log (W) over cap)) rounds and it is not fully distributed. For a maximal matching M in G, it is a well-known fact that any vertex-cover in G needs to have at least vertical bar M vertical bar vertices. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of this combinatorial lower-bound to the weighted setting.", "paper_title": "Distributed Weighted Vertex Cover via Maximal Matchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882300006"}
