Most of the approaches to face detection have focused on the use of two-dimensional images. We present an innovative method that combines a feature-based approach with a holistic one for three-dimensional (3D) face detection. Salient face features, such as the eyes and nose, are detected through an analysis of the curvature of the surface. Each triplet consisting of a candidate nose and two candidate eyes is processed by a PCA-based classifier trained to discriminate between faces and non-faces. The method has been tested, with good results, on some 150 3D faces acquired by a laser range scanner. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
