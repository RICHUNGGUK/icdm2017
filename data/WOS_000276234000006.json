A 3D model of robot is built by SOLIDWORKS and then exported to ADAMS2007 for simulation. The results of simulation by combining MATLAB / SIMULINK with ADAMS are presented. It is shown experimentally that the behavior of actual model consist well with the prediction of simulation.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Simulation of a Spherical Mobile Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000006"}
