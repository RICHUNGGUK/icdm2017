It catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (PDC) to 4-oxalomesaconate (OMA) and 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate (CHM) in the degradation of lignin. In this paper, a combined quantum mechanics and molecule mechanics (QM/MM) approach was employed to study the reaction mechanism of LigI from Sphingomonas paucimobilis. According to the results of our calculations, the whole catalytic reaction contains three elementary steps, including the nucleophilic attack, the cleavage of C-O of lactone (substrate) and the intramolecular proton transfer. The intermediate has two intramolecular proton transfer pathways, due to which, two final hydrolysis products can be obtained. The energy profile indicates that 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate (CHM) is the main hydrolysis product, therefore, the isomerization between 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate (CHM) and 4-oxalomesaconate (OMA) is suggested to occur in solvent. During the catalytic reaction, residue Asp248 acts as a general base to activate the hydrolytic water molecule. Although His31, His33 and His180 do not directly participate in the chemical process, they play assistant roles by forming electrostatic interactions with the substrate and its involved species in activating the carbonyl group of the substrate and stabilizing the intermediates and transition states.
