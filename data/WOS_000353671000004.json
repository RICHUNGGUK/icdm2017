In this paper, a comprehensive survey on 3D mesh segmentation methods is presented. Analysis of the existing methodologies is addressed taking into account a new categorization along with the performance evaluation frameworks which aim to support meaningful benchmarks not only qualitatively but also in a quantitative manner. This survey aims to capture the essence of current trends in 3D mesh segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
