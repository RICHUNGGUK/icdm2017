In this study, numerical simulations of blood flow in a patient-specific anatomical model of the left ventricle (LV) and the aortic sinus are presented. The realistic 3D geometry of both LV and aortic sinus is extracted from the processing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, motion of inner walls of LV and aortic sinus is obtained from cine-MR image analysis and is used as a constraint to a numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the moving boundary approach. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method formulation is used for the numerical solution of the transient dynamic equations of the fluid domain. Simulation results include detailed flow characteristics such as velocity, pressure and wall shear stress for the whole domain. The aortic outflow is compared with data obtained by phase-contrast MRI. Good agreement was found between simulation results and these measurements.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of blood flow in the left ventricle and aortic sinus using magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000334049900006"}
