Under the open and dynamic environments, some uncertainty factors cause the behavior of software to be uncontrolled, uncertainty and unpredictable. Behavior-aware networked software trustworthiness research methods are proposed in the paper. Firstly, we propose the analysis methods of the consistency between the inferred specification models with component specification model. Then, for analyzing the component interaction behavior, the behavior relativity analyzing method is presented based on Petri net. Finally, aimed to the outer factors, we analyze the behavioral congruence between theoretical composite models with dynamic behavior model based on running logs. Theoretical analysis and the example analysis indicated that this method is benefit to analyze the trustworthiness of networked software.", "paper_title": "Behavior-aware Trustworthiness Study of Networked Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754500004"}
