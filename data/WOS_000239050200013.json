The MEM is applied to a new method incorporating photon scatter for designing compensators for intensity modulated radiation therapy. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to partition data before training commences. A reduction in the size of training sets also allows the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to be implemented. As a result, both training time and validation error are reduced. A 71% reduction in prediction error compared with that of a single neural network is achieved. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
