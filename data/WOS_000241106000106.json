At each equilibrium point, the system is expanded into linear and nonlinear terms. The linear term is identified using one FLSs, while nonlinear term using other FLSs, which compose one system model. Then, all models got at all equilibrium points compose the multiple models set. At each instant, the best model is chosen out according to the switching index. Accordingly, the nonlinear term of the best model is viewed as measurable disturbance and eliminated using the feedforward strategy.", "paper_title": "Multiple models fuzzy decoupling controller for a nonlinear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000106"}
