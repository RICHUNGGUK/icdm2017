(1) We provide an algorithm for testing whether a hypergraph has cutwidth at most that runs in linear time for constant . In terms of parameterized complexity theory, the problem is fixed-parameter linear parameterized by . (2) We show that it is not expressible in monadic second-order logic whether a hypergraph has bounded (fractional, generalized) hypertree width. The proof leads us to conjecture that, in terms of parameterized complexity theory, these problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by the incidence treewidth (the treewidth of the incidence graph). Thus, in the form of the Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs, we obtain a method to derive linear-time algorithms and to obtain indicators for intractability for hypergraph problems parameterized by incidence treewidth.", "paper_title": "Myhill-Nerode Methods for Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000366155100006"}
