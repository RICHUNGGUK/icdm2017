The logical key hierarchy (LKH) is a well-known class of protocols which aims to solve the key management problem and minimize rekeying overhead, using hierarchical structures and taking advantage of multicast communication. In this work we propose a method for obtaining LKH structures by taking into account the topology of the underlying network, leading to a further decrease in rekeying costs, in terms of packet transmissions.", "paper_title": "TALK: Topology Aware LKH Key Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000345753600001"}
