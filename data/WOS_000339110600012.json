Firstly, an immune vaccine operator is introduced to the classical clonal selection algorithm, which can gain a priori knowledge of pending problems so as to accelerate the convergent speed. Secondly, a point symmetry-based similarity measure is used to evaluate the similarity between two samples. Finally, both kd-trees-based approximate nearest neighbor searching and k-nearest-neighbor consistency strategy is used to reduce the computation complexity and improve the clustering accuracy. In the experiments, first of all, four real-life data sets and four synthetic data sets are used to test the performance of PSCSCA. PSCSCA is also compared with multiple existing algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and convergent speed. In addition, PSCSCA is applied to a real-world application, namely natural image compression, with good performance being obtained.", "paper_title": "A point symmetry-based clonal selection clustering algorithm and its application in image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000339110600012"}
