By optimality, we mean an infimum cost as well as a supremum cost. We show that this problem isPSPACE-COMPLETE. Our proof uses techniques of linear programming, and thus exploits an important property of optimal runs: their time-transitions use a time tau which is arbitrarily close to an integer. We then propose an extension of the region graph, the weighted discrete graph, whose structure gives light on the way to solve the cost-optimal reachability problem. We also give an application of the cost-optimal reachability problem in the context of timed games.", "paper_title": "On the optimal reachability problem of weighted timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000249212000002"}
