However, there have also been many critical comments on various aspects of ESO/BESO. To address those criticisms, we have carried out extensive work to improve the original ESO/BESO algorithms in recent years. This paper summarizes latest developments in BESO for stiffness optimization problems and compares BESO with other well-established optimization methods. Through a series of numerical examples, this paper provides answers to those critical comments and shows the validity and effectiveness of the evolutionary structural optimization method.", "paper_title": "A further review of ESO type methods for topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000276075900002"}
