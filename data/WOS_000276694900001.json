In this paper, we propose a generic practical framework that optimizes media streaming in heterogeneous systems by taking advantage of cost and resource characteristic diversity of the integrated access technologies and the buffering capability of streaming applications. The proposed optimization framework represents a means to compromise the tradeoff between different performance metrics including streaming monetary cost, signaling load, and session quality. Additionally, it accommodates different design challenges including mobility randomness, limited processing capacity, and handoff delay requirements. The simulation results provide important insights on the design of pricing profiles in integrated systems. Additionally, the results show that significant cost savings can be realized using the newly proposed streaming management algorithms and optimization framework.", "paper_title": "Threshold-Based Media Streaming Optimization for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276694900001"}
