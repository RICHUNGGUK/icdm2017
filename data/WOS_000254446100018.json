This paper is mainly concerned with the implementation of innovation-oriented knowledge query based on knowledge grid. The architecture of a knowledge query platform based on Ontology is proposed at first. Then we analyze the key techniques: knowledge ontology building, ontology reasoning, semantic register, and semantic parser. At last, a working scenario is employed to illustrate the process of knowledge query on the platform.", "paper_title": "Innovation-oriented knowledge query in knowledge grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000254446100018"}
