In this paper, we propose a new approach that first retrieves and recommends a design pattern that is adequate to a designer's modeling context, it then helps them in its instantiation. Our approach learns past pattern reuse cases and it interacts with the designer through a questionnaire to ensure that the retrieved pattern corresponds to their needs and intentions. It uses the text mining technique Principal Component Analysis on past experiences of design pattern reuses; the choice of this technique was based on an experimental evaluation we conducted to determine the most adequate text representation and mining technique for our problem. In a final assistance step, after retrieving the most appropriate design pattern, our approach transforms the design situation at hand into the pattern constituting the solution.", "paper_title": "An Interactive Design Pattern Selection Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000376441500004"}
