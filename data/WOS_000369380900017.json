Software Network is a general tool in studying fault propagation, but because of the diversification of software's architecture, we can no longer oversimplify the data flow of nodes in the software network which is universal in conventional method to analyze fault propagation. This paper put forward a new structure Class Interactive Network based on the data interaction of classes in software to analyze software's fault propagation in the class hierarchy and simulate software classes' performance in fault propagation with quantitative analysis in Class Interactive Network.", "paper_title": "Fault Analysis in Software with the Data Interaction of Classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000369380900017"}
