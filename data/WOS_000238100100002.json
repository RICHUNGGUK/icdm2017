Finding optimal solution to this problem is computationally intractable. We quantified the number of messages travelling through each network link by a workload function, and developed three heuristic algorithms to find good solutions based on the values of the workload function. The maximum-workload-based heuristic chooses the locations for I/O nodes in order to minimize the maximum value of the workload function. The distance-based heuristic aims to minimize the average distance between the compute nodes and I/O nodes, which is equivalent to minimizing average workload on the network links. The load-balance-based heuristic balances the workload on the links based on a recursive traversal of the routing tree for the network. Our simulation results demonstrate performance advantage of our algorithms over a number of algorithms commonly used in existing parallel systems. In particular, the load-balance-based algorithm is superior to the other algorithms in most cases, with improvement ratio of 10 to 95% in terms of parallel I/O throughput.", "paper_title": "Optimizing I/O server placement for parallel I/O on switch-based irregular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238100100002"}
