This property is equivalent to the appropriately extended to this nonsmooth setting notion of noncriticality of the Lagrange multiplier associated to the primal solution, which is weaker than second-order sufficiency. All this extends several results previously known only for optimization problems with twice differentiable data, or assuming some constraint qualifications. In addition, our results are obtained in the more general variational setting.", "paper_title": "A note on upper Lipschitz stability, error bounds, and critical multipliers for Lipschitz-continuous KKT systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038100021"}
