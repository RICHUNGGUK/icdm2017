Inspired by the progressive selection scheme in images, our interface is designed to select video objects by painting on successive frames as the video plays. The video objects are progressively selected by solving the graph-cut based local optimization according to the strokes drawn by the brush on each painted frame. In order to provide users interactive feedback, we accelerate 3D graph-cut by efficient graph building and multi-level banded graph-cut. Experimental results show that our novel interface is both intuitive and efficient for video cutout.", "paper_title": "Video Brush: A Novel Interface for Efficient Video Cutout", "paper_id": "WOS:000296915400020"}
