Consider Yahoo's recent alliance with Microsoft to use its Bing search engine, yet both companies will compete with each other to sell search ads. In this paper we study dynamic alliance formation among competing firms with a multi-period model. In each period, there is a two-stage game of co-opetition. In Stage 1, two competing firms decide on forming a partnership by negotiating a contractual agreement; and in Stage 2, all firms in the market engage in price competition. We formulate the economic incentives and costs of the cooperation, propose the optimal contract and discuss the reasons for a temporary co-opetition and a delayed co-opetition. The results of the paper shed light on firms' strategic decision on co-opetition and provide implications to public policy makers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
