The conventional PTS technique is highly successful in PAPR reduction for multi-carrier transmission systems signals, but the considerable computational complexity for the required search through a high-dimensional vector space is a potential problem for practical implementation. To reduce the search complexity while still improving the PAPR statistics, stochastic optimization techniques such as the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, genetic algorithm (CA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have recently been proposed to search for a phase factor that reduces both the PAPR statistics and the computational load. In this paper, a novel stochastic optimization approach, that the electromagnetism-like (EM) algorithm is applied in reducing the PAPR of a multicarrier transmission systems signal. From the results, it can be seen that a proposed scheme based-iterative PTS can be easily implemented with low combining complexity, still maintaining a better BER performance, compared to the conventional PTS approach. Simulations have been conducted and the results show that the BER performance of the investigated EM-PTS is increased by minimizing the signal's nonlinear distortion caused by HPA.", "paper_title": "PEAK TO AVERAGE POWER RATIO REDUCTION OF MULTICARRIER TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS USING ELECTROMAGNETISM-LIKE METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100002"}
