It employs statistics feature of pixel block patterns to embed data, and utilizes the HVS characteristics to reduce the introduced visual distortion. The watermarked halftone image can be perfectly recovered if it is intact, only a secret key is required. The method is suitable for the applications where the content accuracy of the original halftone image must be guaranteed, and it is easily extended to the field of halftone image authentication.", "paper_title": "Look-up table based reversible data hiding for error diffused halftone images", "paper_id": "WOS:000252121100008"}
