Let T be a tree with maximum degree Delta >= 4. Let D(Delta)(T) denote the set of integers k for which there exist two distinct vertices of maximum degree of distance at k in T. It was known that Delta + 1 <= lambda(t)(2)(T) <= Delta + 2. In this paper, we prove that if 1 is not an element of D(Delta)(T) or 2 is not an element of D(Delta)(T), then lambda(t)(2)(T) = Delta + 1. The result is best possible in the sense that, for any fixed integer k >= 3, there exist infinitely many trees T with Delta >= 4 and k is not an element of D(Delta)(T) such that lambda(t)(2)(T) = Delta + 2.
