Vegetation variability can be detected by changes in several vegetation parameters defined according to purpose. Estimation of these vegetation parameters has been made possible by calculating various vegetation indices (VIs), usually by ratioing, differencing, ratioing differences and sums, or by forming linear combinations of spectral band data. spectrometers or sensors have been used to acquire visible and infrared spectral properties of vegetation. This paper presents a ground-based hyperspectral imaging system for characterizing vegetation spectral features. The hyperspectral sensor used was a ground-based line sensor, ImSpector (V10-12-102), with a nominal spectral resolution of 1.5-2 nm and a wavelength range of 360-1010 nm. A graphical user interface (GUT) was developed in a MATLAB environment to aid in processing and analysis of acquired multidimensional spectral image data. Issues that arise when applying the imaging system to a particular field include acquiring hyperspectral images, selecting appropriate vegetation features or VIs, and quantifying the selected vegetation features or indices with the GUT developed. Vegetation features extracted by the proposed imaging system contribute not only to monitoring vegetation variability in crop systems, but also provide a potential source of relevant variables that can be used to estimate various vegetation parameters. A study that was set up to investigate the alternate bearing phenomenon of citrus trees illustrates the basic elements of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
