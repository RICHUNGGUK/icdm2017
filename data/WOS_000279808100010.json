For this purpose, fuzzy regions and fuzzy points have been defined in the past, along with a number of suitable operations. For numerical information - such as the surface area of fuzzy regions, or the distance between fuzzy regions and/or fuzzy points - the computation depends on the interpretation given to the fuzzy regions or points. Consequently, it is important to differentiate between the interpretation in order to obtain correct results. This article explains in detail the impact of the interpretation in terms of both the surface area and the distance.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy regions: interpretations of surface area and distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000279808100010"}
