Various monoidal categories with extra structure arise as the categories of (co)modules of bialgebras and Hopf algebras in Rel. In particular, for any group G, we derive a ribbon category of crossed G-sets as the category of modules of a Hopf algebra in Rel that is obtained by the quantum double construction. This category of crossed G-sets serves as a model of the braided variant of propositional linear logic.", "paper_title": "A quantum double construction in Rel", "paper_id": "WOS:000306936800003"}
