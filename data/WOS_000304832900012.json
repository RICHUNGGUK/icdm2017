For certain basic algebraic structures delta, we prove definability theorems of the following form: for every first-order expansion Gamma of delta, either Gamma has a quantifier-free Horn definition in delta, or there is an element d of Gamma such that all non-empty relations in Gamma contain a tuple of the form (d,...,d), or all relations with a first-order definition in delta have a primitive positive definition in Gamma. The results imply that several families of constraint satisfaction problems exhibit a complexity dichotomy: the problems are either polynomial-time solvable or NP-hard depending on the choice of the allowed relations. As concrete examples, we investigate fundamental algebraic constraint satisfaction problems. The first class consists of all relational structures with a first-order definition in (Q;+) that contain the relation {(x, y, z) is an element of Q(3) vertical bar x + y = z}. The second class is the affine variant of the first class. In both cases, we obtain full dichotomies by utilizing our general methods.", "paper_title": "Horn versus full first-order: Complexity dichotomies in algebraic constraint satisfaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000304832900012"}
