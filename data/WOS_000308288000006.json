Many such systems can be modeled as synchronous data flow graphs. In this paper, we address the problem of multi-objective mapping of SDF graphs onto heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms, where we account for the overhead of bus-based inter-processor communication. The primary contributions include (1) an integer linear programming (ILP) model that globally optimizes throughput, latency and cost; (2) low-complexity two-stage heuristics based on a combination of an evolutionary algorithm with an ILP to generate either a single sub-optimal mapping solution or a Pareto front for design space optimization. In our simulations, the proposed heuristic shows up to 12x run-time efficiency compared to the global ILP while maintaining a 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 6) optimality gap in throughput.", "paper_title": "Communication-aware Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Mapping for Real-time Streaming Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308288000006"}
