Attention is modelled using the recent engineering control model (Corollary Discharge of Attention Movement, CODAM), which includes suitable working memory components. We extend this model to take account of various executive functions performed in working memory under attention control, such as rehearsal, substitution and transformation of buffered activity. How these are achieved is specified in suitable extension of CODAM. Further extensions are then made to include emotional values of stimuli. All of these extensions are supported by recent experimental brain imaging data on various working memory tasks, which are simulated with reasonable accuracy. We conclude our analysis by a discussion on the nature of cognition as seen in terms of the resulting extended attention model framework. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
