In a multilingual country like India, a document containing text words in more than one language is a common scenario. A state-of-the-art survey about the techniques available in the area of OSI for Indic scripts would be of a great aid to the researchers. Hence, a sincere attempt is made in this article to discuss the advancements reported in the literature during the last fewdecades. Various feature extraction and classification techniques associated with the OSI of the Indic scripts are discussed in this survey. We hope that this survey will serve as a compendium not only for researchers in India, but also for policymakers and practitioners in India. It will also help to accomplish a target of bringing the researchers working on different Indic scripts together. Taking the recent developments in OSI of Indian regional scripts into consideration, this article will provide a better platform for future research activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
