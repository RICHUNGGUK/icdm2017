Wire width variation is one of the main issues that have a large impact on chip performance and yield loss. Particularly, etching process is the last and most influential process to wire width variation, and hence models for predicting etching induced variation have been proposed. However, they do not consider an effect of global layout variation. This work proposes a prediction model of etching induced wire width variation which takes into account global layout pattern variation. We also present a wire width adjustment method that modifies etching process on the fly according to the critical dimension loss estimated by the proposed prediction model and wire space measurement just before etching process. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved good performance in prediction, and demonstrated that the potential reduction of the gap between the target wire width and actual wire width thanks to the proposed on-the-fly etching process modification was 68.9% on an average.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Effect of Global Layout Pattern on Wire Width Variation for On-the-Fly Etching Process Modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466800011"}
