The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Mathematical and logical development of human society ethical and normative structure. Findings - Existence of relations with positive imperative modality (obligation) would constitute the skeleton of the system. Negative imperative modality (prohibition) would be the immunological system of protection of the system. Modality permission the muscular system, that gives the necessary flexibility. Four theorems have been formulated based on Godel's theorem demonstrating the inconsistency or incompleteness of DISs. For each constructed systemic conception can happen to it one of the two following things: either some allowed responses are not produced or else some forbidden responses are produced. Responses prohibited by the system are defined as nonwished effects. Originality/value -This paper is a continuation of the four previous papers and is developed the theory of deontical impure systems.", "paper_title": "An introduction to alysidal algebra (IV)", "paper_id": "WOS:000327752800008"}
