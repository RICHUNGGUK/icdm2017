Virtual machine (VM) migration has become an important approach to address this issue, particularly; live migration of the VMs across the physical servers facilitates dynamic workload scheduling of the cloud services as per the energy management requirements, and also reduces the downtime by allowing the migration of the running instances. However, migration is a complex process affected by several factors such as bandwidth availability, application workload and operating system configurations, which in turn increases the complications in predicting the migration time in order to negotiate the service-level agreements in a real datacenter. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach named improved MIGration (iMIG), in which we characterize some of the key metrics of the live migration performance, and conduct several experiments to study the impacts of the investigated metrics on the Kernel-based VM (KVM) functionalities, as well as the energy consumed by both the destination and the source hosts. Our results reveal the importance of the configured parameters: speed limit, TCP buffer size and max downtime, along with the VM properties and also their corresponding impacts on the migration process. Improper setting of these parameters may either incur migration failures or causes excess energy consumption. We witness a few bugs in the existing Quick EMUlator (QEMU)/KVM parameter computation framework, which is one of most widely used KVM frameworks based on QEMU. Based on our observations, we develop an analytical model aimed at better predictions of both the migration time and the downtime, during the process of VM deployment. Finally, we implement a suite of profiling tools in the adaptive mechanism based on the qemu-kvm-0.12.5 version, and our experiment results prove the efficiency of our approach in improving the live migration performance. In comparison with the default migration approach, our approach achieves a 40% reduction in the migration latency and a 45% reduction in the energy consumption.", "paper_title": "iMIG: Toward an Adaptive Live Migration Method for KVM Virtual Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700002"}
