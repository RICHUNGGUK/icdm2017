The wireless nature of the medium is captured by the broadcast nature of transmissions as well as the superposition of transmitted signals plus independent Gaussian noise at the received signal at any radio. We propose a scheme that can achieve rate tuples within a constant gap away from the cut-set bound, where the constant is independent of channel coefficients and power constraints. First, for a deterministic broadcast network, we propose a new coding scheme, constructed by adopting a \"receiver-centric\" viewpoint, that uses quantize-and-forward relaying as an inner code concatenated with an outer Marton code for the induced deterministic broadcast channel. This scheme is shown to achieve the cut-set bound evaluated with product form distributions. This result is then lifted to the Gaussian network by using a deterministic network called the discrete superposition network as a formal quantization interface. This two-stage construction circumvents the difficulty involved in working with a vector nonlinear non-Gaussian broadcast channel that arises if we construct a similar scheme directly for the Gaussian network.", "paper_title": "Approximately Optimal Wireless Broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000311359600010"}
