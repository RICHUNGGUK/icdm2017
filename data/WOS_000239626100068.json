Objects that act by a decided scenario cause a motion problem for the objects as well as for the reality of the objects. To solve these problems, a physics engine was presented. We proposed a design and implementation of the physics game maker based a physics engine. We also showed the architecture and demo simulation of the physics game maker. This paper explains the basic data structures that compose the physics game maker. We explained the main component that is working in the physics game maker, and showed demo simulation through car simulation. The current physics game maker only processes a rigid body, and supports one world.", "paper_title": "Research on design and implementation of adaptive physics game agent for 3D physics game", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100068"}
