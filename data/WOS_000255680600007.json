The significance of electronic marketplaces is apparent from the huge number of websites that currently provide services in almost any area one can think of. However, the absence of clear documentation on the similarities that these sites share restricts the reutilization of software for the development of new electronic marketplaces. To improve this situation, we propose a platform independent model (PIM) for the e-marketplace domain that describes both the structural and behavioral properties of a generic electronic marketplace. Specific application PIMs aimed at generating different e-marketplaces can be obtained from our generic domain PIM by adapting it to the requirements of each particular application. In this way, reutilization of our domain PIM contributes to a reduction in the cost and time involved in the development of new electronic marketplaces.", "paper_title": "A platform independent model for the electronic marketplace domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000255680600007"}
