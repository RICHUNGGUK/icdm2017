The fuzzy interconnected system consists of interconnected continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy subsystems. A stability criterion based on fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of fuzzy time-delay interconnected systems. In the derivation process, some free fuzzy weighting matrices are introduced among the terms of the system equation to yield less conservative results. The proposed stability criterion can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method.", "paper_title": "New delay-dependent stability analysis for fuzzy time-delay interconnected systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321690800002"}
