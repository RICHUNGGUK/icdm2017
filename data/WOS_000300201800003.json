Classical DLs are not suitable to represent vague pieces of information. The attempts to achieve a solution have led to the birth of fuzzy DLs and rough DLs. In this work, we provide a simple solution to join these two formalisms and define a fuzzy rough DL This logic is more general than other related approaches, including tight and loose fuzzy rough approximations and being independent of the fuzzy logic operators considered. We show the usefulness of our approach by presenting some uses case, and we also describe how to extend two reasoning algorithms for fuzzy DLs, which are implemented in the fuzzy DL reasoners FUZZYDL and DELOREAN.
