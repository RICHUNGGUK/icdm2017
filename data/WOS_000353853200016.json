For any company it is critical to understand both their own and their competitors' strengths and weaknesses in all locations where they offer a service. With this motivation we created a Customers Acquisition and REtention system based on SOcial MEdia (CARESOME). Our system extracts and separates all social media interactions in a given location by market player and communication purpose and quantifies the impact of each single interaction over a given time period. To model the impact of the social media interactions, CARESOME relies on a set of metrics based on both intrinsic and extrinsic components including Entity Engagement Index, Differential Perception Factor, Tie-Strength and Number of Exposed users. In addition to the definition of our impact quantification metrics, we provide a thorough discussion about the design decisions taken to build our system. To illustrate the behavior of our system, we show-case a real world scenario from the airline industry based on two major airports in Great Britain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
