Because of this and its moderate size it is a major consumer of power. In order to reduce its power consumption, in this paper a small filter structure that exploits the special features of the references to the stack region is proposed. This filter, which acts as a top - non-inclusive - level of the data memory hierarchy, consists of a register set that keeps the data stored in the neighborhood of the top of the stack. Our simulation results show that using a small Stack Filter (SF) of just a few registers, 10-25% data cache power savings can be achieved on average, with a negligible performance penalty.
