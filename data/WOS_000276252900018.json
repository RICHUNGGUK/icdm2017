Source follower in the adaptively biased differential pair (ABDP) linear transconductor circuit is replaced with flipped voltage follower to improve the efficiency of the tail current source, which is connected to a conventional differential pair. The simulation results show the performance of the modified circuit also has better speed, noise performance and common mode rejection ratio compared to the ABDP circuit.", "paper_title": "Linear transconductor with flipped voltage follower in 130 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900018"}
