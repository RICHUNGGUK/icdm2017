We introduce the notion of a degenerate hypergraph, which characterizes hypergraphs that arise in geometry. We use our framework to obtain an efficient randomized online algorithm for conflict-free colouring of any k-degenerate hypergraph with n vertices. Our algorithm uses O(k log n) colours with high probability and this bound is asymptotically optimal. Moreover, our algorithm uses O(k log k log n) random bits with high probability. We introduce algorithms that are allowed to perform a few recolourings of already coloured points. We provide deterministic online conflict-free colouring algorithms for points on the line with respect to intervals and for points on the plane with respect to half-planes (or unit disks) that use O(log n) colours and perform a total of at most O(n) recolourings.", "paper_title": "Online Conflict-Free Colouring for Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000279038700002"}
