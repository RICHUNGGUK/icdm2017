We treat both the case of pure diffusive scaling and the case where kinetic and diffusive scalings coexist. The diffusion equations and their data are derived from asymptotic and layer analysis which allows general scattering kernels and general data. We apply the half-space solver in [20] to resolve the boundary layer equation and obtain the boundary data for the diffusion equation. The algorithms are validated by numerical experiments and also by error analysis for the pure diffusive scaling case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
