However, its model selection, i.e., the selection of components in the Mixture for a given sample data set, has been still a rather difficult task. Recently, the Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) harmony learning has provided a new approach to the Gaussian mixture modeling with a favorite feature that model selection can be made automatically during parameter learning. In this paper, based on the same BYY harmony learning framework for finite mixture, we propose an adaptive gradient BYY learning algorithm for Poisson mixture with automated model selection. It is demonstrated well by the simulation experiments that this adaptive gradient BYY learning algorithm can automatically determine the number of actual Poisson components for a sample data set, with a good estimation of the parameters in the Original or true mixture where the components are separated in a certain degree. Moreover, the adaptive gradient BYY learning algorithm is successfully applied to texture classification. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
