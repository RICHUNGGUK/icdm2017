Especially, we employ proper orthogonal decomposition in combination with the method of snapshots to devise an automated a posteriori algorithm, which helps to reduce significantly the dimensionality for further simulations. The reliability of the surrogate models is tested using a rectangular geometry and we compare the results with two other reduced models, which are given by the approximation using the weighted sum of gray gases and by an frequency averaged version of the so-called SPn model. We present several numerical results underlining the feasibility of our approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
