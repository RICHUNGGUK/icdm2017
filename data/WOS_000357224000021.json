Two reduction properties regarding the problem size and some optimality conditions are derived. Based on these conditions, an exact polynomial algorithm is developed to determine the set of optimal locations for the refueling station. A small tree network example is solved to illustrate the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
