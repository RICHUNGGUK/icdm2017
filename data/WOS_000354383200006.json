A sequence P = ( Pn)(n is an element of N) of consistent record-dependent measures determines a random order on N. In this paper we describe the extreme elements of the convex set of such P. This problem turns out to be related to the study of asymptotic behavior of permutation-valued growth processes, to random extensions of partial orders, and to the measures on the Young-Fibonacci lattice.
