The use of stream processors for the computations and efficient Sparse-Template-based particle filtering allows us to achieve real-time processing even when tracking multiple objects simultaneously in high-resolution video frames. Stream processing is a relatively new computing paradigm that permits the expression and execution of data-parallel algorithms with great efficiency and minimum effort. Using a GPU (graphics processing unit, a consumer-grade stream processor) and the NVIDIA CUDA (TM) technology, we can achieve performance improvements as large as ten times compared to a similar CPU-only tracker. At the same time, the Stream processing approach opens the door to other computing devices, like the Cell/BE (TM) or other multicore CPUs.", "paper_title": "Real-time Visual Tracker by Stream Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000269012400011"}
