The power of two computational requirement makes high-dimensional multivariate volatility modeling very time consuming. In this paper, we propose two simplified specifications in a multivariate autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. The first specification computes an unconditional correlation matrix from standardized residuals of the model. The second specification restricts the sum of the weights in a time-varying conditional correlation equation to be one. Applying a Bayesian sampling scheme allows the number of parameters to be reduced from the power of two of the dimension to the linear order of the dimension only and simultaneously provides us a framework for model comparison. We test our simplified specifications using simulated and real data from three sectoral indices in Hong Kong, three market indices and four exchange rates. The results suggest that our simplified specifications are more effective than the original formulation. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
