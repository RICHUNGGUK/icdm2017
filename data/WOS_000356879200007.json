CACTI-IO enables design space exploration of the OFF-chip IO along with the dynamic random access memory and cache parameters. We describe the models added and four case studies that use CACTI-IO to study the tradeoffs between memory capacity, bandwidth (BW), and power. The case studies show that CACTI-IO helps to: 1) provide IO power numbers that can be fed into a system simulator for accurate power calculations; 2) optimize OFF-chip configurations including the bus width, number of ranks, memory data width, and OFF-chip bus frequency, especially for novel buffer-based topologies; and 3) enable architects to quickly explore new interconnect technologies, including 3-D interconnect. We find that buffers on board and 3-D technologies offer an attractive design space involving power, BW, and capacity when appropriate interconnect parameters are deployed.", "paper_title": "CACTI-IO: CACTI With OFF-chip Power-Area-Timing Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000356879200007"}
