The proposed model improves the accuracy of previous models in two aspects. First, it incorporates the dependence among the nodes within a cluster by defining a DTMC that models the number of active nodes, whereas the previous models considered that nodes were mutually independent. Second, it proposes new methods to calculate packet delay and energy consumption. The analytical model is validated through discrete-event based simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed analytical model and methods yield accurate results under realistic assumptions.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Synchronous Duty-Cycled MAC Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900004"}
