Unlike traditional MIMO systems, complementary codes were designed at chip-level to achieve time and frequency-spreading for each antenna. We analyze the system performance in multipath fading channels. A closed form expression of bit error rate (BER) performance is obtained. Extensive simulations were conducted to verify the analytical results. Our results indicate that a CC coded MIMO system can effectively decrease BER and take advantage of diversity gain.", "paper_title": "A Complete Complementary Coded MIMO System and Its Performance in Multipath Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200016"}
