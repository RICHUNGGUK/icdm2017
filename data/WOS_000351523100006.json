However, due to the diversity of the deployed environments and resource constraints, it is difficult to predict the performance of a topology. Besides the connectivity, coverage, cost, network longevity and service quality should all be considered during the planning procedure. Therefore, efficiently planning a reliable WSN is a challenging task, which requires designers coping with comprehensive and interdisciplinary knowledge. A WSN planning method is proposed in this work to tackle the above mentioned challenges and efficiently deploying reliable WSNs. First of all, the above mentioned metrics are modeled more comprehensively and practically compared with other works. Especially 3D ray tracing method is used to model the radio link and sensing signal, which are sensitive to the obstruction of obstacles; network routing is constructed by using AODV protocol; the network longevity, packet delay and packet drop rate are obtained via simulating practical events in WSNet simulator, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first time that network simulator is involved in a planning algorithm. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is developed to cater for the characteristics of WSNs. Network size is changeable during evolution, meanwhile the crossovers and mutations are limited by certain constraints to eliminate invalid modifications and improve the computation efficiency. The capability of providing multiple optimized solutions simultaneously allows users making their own decisions, and the results are more comprehensive optimized compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Practical WSN deployments are also realized for both indoor and outdoor environments and the measurements coincident well with the generated optimized topologies, which prove the efficiency and reliability of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Modelling and planning reliable wireless sensor networks based on multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm with changeable length", "paper_id": "WOS:000351523100006"}
