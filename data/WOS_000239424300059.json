Such a mechanism will allow reuse of partial UMs in multiple personalization services that may need it. This paper discusses the details of a decentralized mediator for cross-domain and cross-technique translation and aggregation of partial UMs. The mediator facilitates enriching UMs managed by personalization services and improving the quality of the provided personalization.", "paper_title": "Decentralized mediation of user models for a better personalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300059"}
