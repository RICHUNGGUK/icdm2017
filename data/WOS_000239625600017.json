Logical inference is visualized by interval-values. Boolean operators are extended to these values in a natural way. Some other useful operators are also defined. The way of reasoning by Euler/Venn diagrams works by interval-values as well. Moreover based on the length of the intervals probabilistic and fuzzy reasoning is possible.", "paper_title": "Reasoning by intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625600017"}
