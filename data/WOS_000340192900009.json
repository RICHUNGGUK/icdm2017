We consider the problems of estimation and control under two different protocols. In one protocol, the transfer control protocol-like protocol, the estimation/control unit provides acknowledgments to successfully deliver the packets. In the other protocol, the user datagram protocol (UDP)-like protocol, no acknowledgments are permitted. We address the nonlinearity for the UDP protocol using the suboptimal approach. It is shown that there is a critical value at which the system becomes unstable. These unstable properties do not only depend on the rates of the control packets but also on the eigenvalues for the considered system. Simulation of two numerical examples is carried out in detail to illustrate the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "LQG control design over lossy communication links", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900009"}
