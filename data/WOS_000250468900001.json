Assuming knowledge of Grobner basics, the proofs are quite short and elementary. They also hardly resort to any machinery from more classical algebraic geometry. Instead, they are designed to be easily presentable along with the (Grobner basis) techniques likely to be used in applications of the results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
