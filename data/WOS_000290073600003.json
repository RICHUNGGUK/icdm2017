Therefore, to solve the problem, according to Haar wavelet transform theory, the redistributed invariant wavelet domain is constructed and proofed in this paper; a novel image watermarking algorithm, based on the invariant domain, is proposed to eliminate such distortions. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm not only can resist the common image processing operations, but also successfully resist the distortions that result from multiples of 90 rotations of integers and image flipping.
