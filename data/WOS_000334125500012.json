This paper proposes a generic implementation framework for stable semantic ontology measurement. Through this framework, an ontology will be measured according to its semantic enriched representation model (SERM). The SERM model of an ontology can be used for stably measuring the semantics of the ontology. Then ontology metrics are integrated into the framework to measure candidate ontologies according to its SERM model. The related experiments are made to show that the framework can effectively measure the semantics of ontologies.", "paper_title": "A Generic Implementation Framework for Measuring Ontology- Based Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000334125500012"}
