The problem is modeled as a network, where nodes represent customers, leasing companies. harbors and warehouses, while arcs represent transportation routes. The underlying mathematical model operates in stages, first prioritizing and adjusting full containers demands considering available empty containers Supplies, and then statically optimizing costs. Transportation routes are registered and dynamically controlled, cyclically, for a given time horizon. The DSS is flexible, allowing several parameters to be configured. Experimental examples using randomly generated parameters were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
