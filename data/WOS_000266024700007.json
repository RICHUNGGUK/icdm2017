But these techniques are not contributing effectively to restricted domain QA system of classic Chinese literature such as \"Analects of Confucius\". This QA system requires to extract related verses and automatically answer the query in natural Chinese language about Confucius' thought in the \"Analects of Confucius\". Therefore we propose a novel method to integrate the pragmatics information with classical information retrieval technique for QA system so as to improve retrieval efficiency. 171 this paper, we examined the effect of the pragmatics information on QA system of the \"Analects of Confucius\". According to the experiments, the pragmatics information based retrieval results are more accurate than the one without using it.", "paper_title": "EFFECT OF USING PRAGMATICS INFORMATION ON QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM OF ANALECTS OF CONFUCIUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700007"}
