Phase type (PH) distributions can approximate many distributions arising in practice, but their practical applicability has always been limited when they are described by a non-Markovian vector-matrix pair. In this case it is hard to check whether the non-Markovian vector-matrix pair defines a non-negative matrix-exponential function or not. In this paper we propose a numerical procedure for checking if the matrix-exponential function defined by a non-Markovian vector-matrix pair can be represented by a Markovian vector-matrix pair with potentially larger size. If so, then the matrix-exponential function is non-negative. The proposed procedure is based on O'Cinneide's characterization result, which says that a non-Markovian vector-matrix pair with strictly positive density on (0, infinity) and with a real dominant eigenvalue has a Markovian representation. Our method checks the existence of a potential Markovian representation in a computationally efficient way utilizing the structural properties of the applied representation transformation procedure.
