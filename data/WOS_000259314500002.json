We determine via simple formulas the eigenvalues of these matrices and, at each iteration, we construct a positive definite matrix whose inverse can be expressed analytically, without using factorization. Consequently, a direction of negative curvature can be computed immediately by applying the inverse power method. The computation of the trial step is obtained by performing a sequence of inner products and vector summations. Furthermore, it immediately follows that the strong convergence properties of trust region methods are preserved. Numerical results are also presented.", "paper_title": "Solving the quadratic trust-region subproblem in a low-memory BFGS framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000259314500002"}
