Existing published works focus on designing efficient collision resolution protocols for the tag identification problem in RFID systems with passive RFID tags. However. advances in low-cost and low-power sensing technologies will make active RFID tags more popular and affordable in the near future. In multiple object identification systems with active tags. the tags are designed for extremely low-cost large-scale applications Such that battery replacement is not feasible. This imposes a critical energy-constraint on the communication protocols used in these systems. In this paper, we analyze energy consumption and identification times for several protocols. The objective is to decrease energy consumption of tags by reducing both the total identification time and the total active time.
