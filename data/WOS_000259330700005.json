Taking into account that periodic noise leaves peaks in the amplitude spectrum, the proposed approach focuses on their detection and elimination. The detection is performed semiautomatically using a local median whereupon the localized peaks are eliminated by a modified Gaussian notch filter. The proposed approach demonstrates high efficiency for images corrupted by both pure-periodic and quasi-periodic noise. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
