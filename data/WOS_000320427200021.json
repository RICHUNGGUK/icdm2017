However, understanding their physics requires a study at sufficiently large length scales while still resolving the microscopic structure of a large number of particles and of the local hydrodynamics. Due to its high degree of locality, the lattice Boltzmann method, when combined with a molecular dynamics solver and parallelized on modern supercomputers, provides a tool that allows such studies. Still, running simulations on hundreds of thousands of cores is not trivial. We report on our practical experiences when employing large fractions of an IBM Blue Gene/P system for our simulations. Then, we extend our model for spherical particles in multicomponent flows to anisotropic ellipsoidal objects rendering the shape of, e.g., clay particles. The model is applied to a number of test cases including the adsorption of single particles at fluid interfaces and the formation and stabilization of Pickering emulsions or bijels.
