Considering a rational surface Phi in R(4), the envelope surface Psi of the corresponding family of spheres in R(3) is typically non-rational. Using a classical sphere-geometric approach, we prove that the envelope surface Psi and its offset surfaces admit rational parameterizations if and only if Phi is a rational sub-variety of a rational isotropic hyper-surface in R(4). The close relation between the envelope surfaces Psi and rational offset surfaces in R(3) is elaborated in detail. This connection leads to explicit rational parameterizations for all rational surfaces Phi in R(4) whose corresponding two-parameter families of spheres possess envelope surfaces admitting rational parameterizations. Finally we discuss several classes of surfaces sharing this property. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
