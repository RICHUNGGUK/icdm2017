The value of an n-variable interval function specified by interval [a, b] (where a and b are n-bit binary numbers) is true if and only if the input vector viewed as an n-bit number belongs to the interval [a, b]. In this paper we study the problem of deciding whether a given DNF represents an interval function and if so then we also want to output the corresponding interval. For general Boolean functions this problem is co-NP-hard. In our article we present a polynomial time algorithm which works for some restricted classes of functions such as monotone functions. This result is then extended to a \"renamable\" variant of interval functions, i.e. to their variable complementation closure.", "paper_title": "Renamable interval Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800011"}
