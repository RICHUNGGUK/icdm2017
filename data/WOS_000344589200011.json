The model consists of three components. The first component is used to generate complex vascular structures, while the second one provides blood flow characteristics in the generated vascular structures by the lattice Boltzmann method. The third component makes use of the generated vascular structures and flow characteristics to simulate MR flow imaging. To meet computational demands, parallel algorithms are applied in all the components. The proposed approach is verified in three stages. In the first stage, experimental validation is performed by an in vitro phantom. Then, the simulation possibilities of the model are shown. Flow and MR flow imaging in complex vascular structures are presented and evaluated. Finally, the computational performance is tested. Results show that the model is able to reproduce flow behavior in large vascular networks in a relatively short time. Moreover, simulated MR flow images are in accordance with the theoretical considerations and experimental images. The proposed approach is the first such an integrative solution in literature. Moreover, compared to previous works on flow and MR flow imaging, this approach distinguishes itself by its computational efficiency. Such a connection of anatomy, physiology and image formation in a single computer tool could provide an in silico solution to improving our understanding of the processes involved, either considered together or separately.", "paper_title": "In Silico Modeling of Magnetic Resonance Flow Imaging in Complex Vascular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344589200011"}
