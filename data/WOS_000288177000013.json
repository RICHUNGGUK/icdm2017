In this paper, the problem of distortion drift caused by reversible data hiding in compressed video is analyzed, and a lossless drift compensation scheme is proposed to restrain the distortion for the first time. In order to ensure the reversibility, drift compensation signals are merged in the quantized DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients of P-frames and the corresponding recovery mechanism is presented as well. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lossless drift compensation scheme significantly improves the video quality, and the original compressed video can be recovered exactly after the hidden data and compensation signals are removed. In addition, the proposed scheme does not depend on specific reversible data hiding method.", "paper_title": "Issues and solution on distortion drift in reversible video data hiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000288177000013"}
