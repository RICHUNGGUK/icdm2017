The mobile robot model includes the kinematic and dynamic equations of motion and the actuator dynamics. Using the notion of virtual vehicle and the concept of flatness, and applying the backstepping methodology the paper proposes control schemes for trajectory tracking for the considered augmented model of the mobile robot. The resulting controller ensures exponential convergence to a desired trajectory. Applications of the tracking controller for convoy-like vehicles governed by the augmented models are considered as well. Simulation results and lab experiments are demonstrated.
