Another subject on which many researchers have focused their attention is that of video traffic modeling. However, user mobility, combined with the rapidly growing number of \"greedy\" multimedia applications, in terms of bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, form a challenging and yet unresolved problem for third and fourth-generation wireless networks. In recent work, we have built a Discrete Autoregressive (DAR (1)) model to capture the behavior of multiplexed H. 263 videoconference movies from variable bit rate (VBR) coders. Based on this model, we propose in this work a new efficient CAC scheme for wireless cellular networks, which differs from the existing proposals in the literature in that it uses precomputed traffic scenarios combined with online simulation for its decision making. Our scheme is shown, via an extensive simulation study comparison and a conceptual comparison with well-known existing approaches, to clearly excel in terms of QoS provisioning to users receiving videoconference and Web traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the relevant literature where such an approach has been proposed.", "paper_title": "A new call admission control mechanism for multimedia traffic over next-generation wireless cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926900007"}
