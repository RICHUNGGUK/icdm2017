Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of established systemic yoyo models for electrons and positrons, flows of negative yoyo charges are naturally identified with electric currents so that use of the well-developed quantitative methods can be made in electromagnetic theory to investigate the relationship between eddy and meridian fields of the general systemic yoyo model. Findings - A general method is established on how to compute the intensity of the magnetic yoyo fields accompanying a moving yoyo charge or a canal of yoyo flow. A quantitative representation for magnetic yoyo fields is provided. And, the well-known Ampere's law of electricity is generalized to the case of general yoyo flows. Originality/value - By establishing an adequate quantitative method for the general systemic yoyo model, it should be possible to know more about the yoyo model and gain additional potential to successfully employ this model in various areas of learning, as proposed by Lin.", "paper_title": "Quantitative representations of spinning yoyo fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100009"}
