Formulating the problem in the framework of nonlinear optimization, we derive the required updates at end points and links to reach the optimal operating point. The proposed algorithm is a cross layer algorithm considering power control at the physical layer, attempt rate control at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and rate control at the transport layer of the network. The optimization variables are coordinated through two shadow prices. The first one regulates each session rate to the throughput of the links in its path, and the second one controls the attempt rates to meet maximal clique capacity constraint. Considering a model for successful transmission, the excitatory and inhibitory factors affecting each variable are derived. The proposed algorithm can be implemented in distributed fashion by message passing in the network. Simulation results at the link level verify the analytical approach and show that the algorithm converge and reach joint optimal point. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
