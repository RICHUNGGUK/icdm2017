The delays are assumed to be time-varying and differentiable. A notion of very-strict passivity is adopted. The purpose is to design a state-feedback fuzzy controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is very-strictly passive (VSP). Delay-dependent conditions for the solvability of the addressed problem are obtained by applying recently developed techniques for time-delay systems and fuzzy systems. These conditions are expressed by means of strict linear matrix inequalities (wLMIs) that can be easily solved. A numerical example and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
