For a given channel capacity C, it is proven that the designed codes satisfy the stability condition for all channels with capacity C. Our experimental results also verify the strong universal properties of codes designed by the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Design of LDPC Codes with Strong Universal Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200033"}
