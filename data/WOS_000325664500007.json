Meanwhile, the development of mobile and context-aware software is not a simple task, mostly due to the peculiar characteristics of these devices. Although several solutions have been proposed to facilitate their development, reuse is not systematically used throughout the software development life-cycle. In this paper, we discuss an approach for the development of mobile and context-aware software using the Software Product Line (SPL) paradigm. Furthermore, a Nested SPL for the domain of mobile and context-aware applications is presented, lessons learned in the SPL development are discussed and a product for a context-aware visit guide is shown.
