Pawlak proposed rough set theory in 1982. This theory provides a tool to mine knowledge as decision rules from a database, web-based information and so on. Decision rules are also used for data analysis. These decision rules can reason the conclusion of an unknown object using various premises. The objective of this paper is to apply the rough set theory to the analysis of time-series data. Using an example, this paper shows how knowledge is acquired and illustrates the difference among decision rules obtained using different time periods.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION FROM TIME SERIES DATA THROUGH ROUGH SETS ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000015"}
