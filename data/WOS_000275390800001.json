This paper addresses the need for a dynamic GIS capable of managing complex data types. The design relies on a representation of the theoretical spatiotemporal primitive known as the 'geo-atom'. This paper proposes a novel and implemented data structure called the space time point (STP) built on this theory. With the STP representation, spatiotemporal data queries can be posed to return useful results about dynamic geographic phenomena and their interaction. Two key challenges addressed in this research are (1) data structures to represent hybrid (object and field) spatiotemporal phenomena and (2) the design of a dynamic GIS interface. These challenges are addressed by the implementation of the system, referred to as 'Extended Dynamic GIS (EDGIS)', that uses the proposed STPs. The EDGIS system is described from theory to its implementation in Java(TM) and a series of application examples are described followed by performance metrics. The paper concludes with a discussion of areas for further research such as integration of the system with geo-sensor networks, hazards, transportation, and location-based services (LBS).", "paper_title": "EDGIS: a dynamic GIS based on space time points", "paper_id": "WOS:000275390800001"}
