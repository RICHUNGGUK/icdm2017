The proposed method uses the theories and properties of sampling distribution of means to satisfy the requirements of robustness and security. Essentially, our method will not really insert the ownership statement into the host image. Instead, the ownership share will be generated by the sampling method as a key to reveal the ownership statement. Besides, our method allows ownership statements to be of any size and avoids the hidden ownership statement to be destroyed by the latter ones. When the rightful ownership of the image needs to be identified, our method can reveal the ownership statement without resorting to the original image. Finally, several common attacks to the image will be held to verify the robustness and the security is also analyzed.", "paper_title": "A statistical approach for ownership identification of digital images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100061"}
