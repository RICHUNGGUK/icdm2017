The aim of our research is to recognize characteristics of the user's gait and to generate the movement of JARoW accordingly. Specifically, the proposed control enables JARoW to accurately generate the direction and velocity of its movement in a way that corresponds to the user's variable walking behaviors. The algorithm and implementation of the control are explained in detail, and the effectiveness and usability of JARoW are verified through extensive experiments in everyday environments.", "paper_title": "Walking Intent-Based Movement Control for JAIST Active Robotic Walker", "paper_id": "WOS:000335226900013"}
