However, some models have included nonlinearities such as a transducer or nonlinear decision rules to handle intrinsic uncertainty. In addition, masking models used to predict human visual detection of signals superimposed on one of two identical backgrounds (masks) usually include a number of nonlinear components in the channels that reflect properties of the firing of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). The effect of these nonlinearities on the ability of linear model observers to predict human signal detection in real patient structured backgrounds is unknown. We evaluate the effect of including different nonlinear human visual system components into a linear channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) using a signal known exactly but variable (SKEV) task. In particular, we evaluate whether the rank order of two compression algorithms (JPEG versus JPEG 2000) and two compression encoder settings (JPEG 2000 default versus JPEG 2000 optimized) based on model observer signal detection performance in X-ray coronary angiograms is altered by inclusion of nonlinear components. The results show: 1) the simpler linear CHO model observer outperforms CHO model with the nonlinear components; 2) the rank order of model observer performance for the compression algorithms/parameters does not change when the nonlinear components are included. For the present task and images, the results suggest that the addition of the nonlinearities to a channelized Hotelling model may add complexity to the model observers without great impact on rank order evaluation of image processing and/or acquisition algorithms.", "paper_title": "The effect of nonlinear human visual system components on performance of a channelized hotelling observer in structured backgrounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000240960200010"}
