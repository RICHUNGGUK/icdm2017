In this paper, we propose a new feature based on FFT for activity recognition from tri-axial acceleration signals. To improve the classification performance. two fusion methods, minimal distance optimization (MDO) and variance contribution ranking (VCR), are proposed. The new proposed feature achieves a recognition rate of 92.41%, which outperforms six traditional time- or frequency-domain features. Furthermore, the proposed fusion methods effectively improve the recognition rates. In particular, the average accuracy based on class fusion VCR (CFVCR) is 97.01%, which results in an improvement in accuracy of 4.14% compared with the results without any fusion. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the new proposed feature and fusion methods.", "paper_title": "Activity Recognition Based on an Accelerometer in a Smartphone Using an FFT-Based New Feature and Fusion Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500031"}
