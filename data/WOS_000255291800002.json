Using the large deviation principle for the spectral value of large random matrices we obtain the bound K exp (-n(2) 1n 3/4 + n + 1/2 1n(d - 1) for the expected number of minima of such a polynomial (here K is a positive constant). This proves that most normal random polynomials of fixed degree have only saddle points. Finally, we give a closed form expression for the expected number of maxima (resp. minima) of a random univariate polynomial, in terms of hypergeometric functions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
