E model Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) IEEE 802 21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) middleware and two user motion detection services. The proposed AQP algorithm integrates the effect of playout control and lost packet retransmission based on the E model. Besides by using the partial reliable transmission service from SCTP and the handoff notification from MIH services in a cross layer manner AQP can reduce the lateness loss rate and improve speech quality under high frame error rates. In the simulations the performance of AQP is compared with a fixed playout algorithm and four adaptive playout strategies. The simulation results show that the lateness loss rate of AQP is 2% lower than that of existing playout algorithms and the R factor is 16% higher than the compared algorithms when a network has 50 ms wired propagation delay and 2.5% frame error rate.", "paper_title": "A Cross Layer Perceptual Speech Quality Based Wireless VoIP Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800037"}
