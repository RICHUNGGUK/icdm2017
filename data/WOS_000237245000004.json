There exist in the literature several proposals of systems allowing secure remote gaming. Nevertheless, the security requirements of some game families lead to the use of complex and costly cryptographic protocols. A particularly challenging game family is mental poker. In this paper we present a smart card-based e-gaming system for mental poker with a low computational cost.", "paper_title": "A smart card-based mental poker system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237245000004"}
