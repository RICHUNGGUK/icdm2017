In general, energy consumption and delay depend on channel monitoring interval (CMI) and data sensing period at each sensor node. Based on this fact, we propose a new preamble structure to effectively advertise CMI and avoid the overhearing problem. In order to pursue an effective tradeoff between energy consumption and delay, we also develop a CMI determining algorithm that searches for a sub-optimal solution with a low computational complexity in a distributive way. Finally, experimental results are provided to compare the proposed MAC protocol with existing sensor MAC protocols.
