To enable devices to understand and exchange information on the Web, LBS providers use Semantic Web data sources to develop semantics-enabled LBSs. However, there are currently limited solutions for processing spatial queries, the building blocks of most LBSs, on Semantic Web data to support these services. The Geo-Store system evaluates spatial queries on RDF triple stores (Semantic Web data management systems) to provide semantics-enabled LBSs.", "paper_title": "Geo-Store: A Framework for Supporting Semantics-Enabled Location-Based Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000316505700007"}
