In particular, we propose a factored covariance model for the data under study, estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood, and then carry out eigendecompositions of the estimated covariance matrix. We call the resulting method factored principal components analysis. We also develop a method for classification using a likelihood ratio criterion, which has previously been used for evaluating the strength of forensic evidence. The methodology is illustrated with applications in face recognition.", "paper_title": "Factored principal components analysis, with applications to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000267111500002"}
