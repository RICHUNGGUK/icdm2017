Nakao et al. recently reported that independent neural oscillators can be synchronized by applying temporal random impulses to the oscillators [1], [2]. We regard neural oscillators as independent clock sources on LSIs; i.e., clock sources are distributed on LSIs, and they are forced to synchronize through the use of random noises. We designed neuron-based clock generators operating at sub-RF region (< 1 GHz) by modifying the original neuron model to a new model that is suitable for CMOS implementation with 0.25-mu m CMOS parameters. Through circuit simulations, we demonstrate that i) the clock generators are certainly synchronized by pseudo-random noises and ii) clock generators exhibited phase-locked oscillations even if they had small device mismatches.", "paper_title": "Noise-induced synchronization among sub-RF CMOS analog oscillators for skew-free clock distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300028"}
