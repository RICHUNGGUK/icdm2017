The conversion method is based of the replica biasing technique in order to provide balanced output signals to the subsequent stages. The chip was fabricated in a 0.18 mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology. Experimental results show excellent performances such as 11 GHz bandwidth, 75-dB Omega transimpedance, -19.2 dBm sensitivity measured at 10 Gb/s at a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10(-12), 7.81 pA/root Hz input referred noise, and 9.5 ps peak-to-peak jitter which are the best overall performances reported in its category. The photoreceiver chip is expected to dissipate only 120 mW from a single 3.3 V power supply.", "paper_title": "A BiCMOS 120mW 11GHz transimpedance amplifier dedicated for high-speed photoreceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000243117600001"}
