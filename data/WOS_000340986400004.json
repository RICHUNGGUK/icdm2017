In order to quickly estimate the queuing delay in the multimedia over CRN applications without exchanging traffic information among SUs, we are the first group to propose the use of Dirichlet-prior based fully Bayesian model in each individual SU to automatically update its statistical distribution on other SUs' Non-Contiguous (NC)-OFDM subcarrier selection strategy. Such a statistical distribution is used to estimate the probability of queuing delay being less than a threshold. In addition, we introduce a new concept called the Time Window, to accurately determine how many packets can be transmitted simultaneously over multiple subcarriers. Then, we propose a comprehensive, intelligent cross-layer scheduling scheme that can generate the optimal subcarrier selection, power and modulation allocation for each multimedia packet. Our experiments on real video transmission validate our intelligent cross-layer scheduling schemes. The simulation results match with theoretical analysis very well, and the reconstructed video quality using our proposed scheduling scheme is superior to four other popularly used schemes.
