A successful model of computation must be able to handle both control-dominated and data-dominated behaviors, which are most often simultaneously present in complex embedded systems. Besides behavioral heterogeneity, direct support for modeling distributed systems is also desirable, since an increasing number of embedded systems belong to this category. In this paper, we present distributed DFCharts (DDFCharts), a language based on a formal model that targets distributed heterogeneous embedded systems. Its top hierarchical level is made suitable to capture distributed systems. Behavioral heterogeneity is addressed by composing finite-state machines (FSMs) and synchronous dataflow graphs (SDFGs). We illustrate modeling in DDFCharts with practical examples and describe its implementation on heterogeneous target architecture.", "paper_title": "Design of Distributed Heterogeneous Embedded Systems in DDFCharts", "paper_id": "WOS:000285601300009"}
