Several core state-of-the-art technologies used in McWiLL mobile broadband access system are introduced in this paper, such as smart antennas, CS-OFDMA (Code Spreading Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), adaptive modulation, dynamic channel allocation, make-before-break handoff, and fraud protection, etc. These key techniques allow McWiLL to support a large coverage, high spectrum efficiency (up to 3 bit/s/Hz), a homogeneous service quality between high and low rate traffics, low cost terminals, and high mobility applications. McWiLL was designed in particular to suit for its applications in hostile environments due to its superb interference cancelation capability, special frame structure design, and dynamic channel assignment scheme.", "paper_title": "McWiLL-A New Mobile Broadband Access Technology for Supporting Both Voice and Packet Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000284540900011"}
