Firstly, various feature extraction methods are used to quantify the quality of videos. Then, a support vector regression model is trained and adopted to predict unseen samples. Six different regression models are compared with the support vector regression model. The experimental results indicate that the combination of different video quality features with a support vector regression model can outperform other methods for no-reference video quality measurement significantly.", "paper_title": "NO-REFERENCE VIDEO QUALITY MEASUREMENT WITH SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000273174000006"}
