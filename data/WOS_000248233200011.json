Simulation games often include this capability suggesting their use as research and/or educational tools, but this requires a somewhat realistic representation of environmental processes. This paper reviews the hydrology in the simulation game SimCity 4. The components of the hydrologic cycle included in the game relate mainly to drinking water supply, treatment and distribution. Groundwater, the sole source of drinking water, is present in unlimited quantity, but becomes polluted as a result of agricultural and industrial land uses. Water treatment plants are included, but in a somewhat unrealistic manner, in that they rapidly clean up aquifers in situ. The drinking water distribution infrastructure consists of water towers, pumps and pipes, but again, they are included in a somewhat unrealistic manner. Water towers and pumps both extract groundwater and are differentiated solely by their capacity, power usage and cost (rather than function). Besides for entertainment, the game should be valuable for educational purposes in lower level undergraduate courses to illustrate tha/how water supply affects a city and vice versa. The general game architecture is capable of a more realistic representation and inclusion of additional components of the urban hydrologic cycle, which are discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
