Extending the notion of conventional image-based rendering, our framework makes joint use of both light fields and holograms as complementary representations. We demonstrate how light fields can be transformed into holograms, and vice versa. By exploiting the advantages of either representation, our proposed dual representation and processing pipeline is able to overcome the limitations inherent to light fields and holograms alone. We show various examples front synthetic and real light fields to digital holograms demonstrating advantages of either representation, such as speckle-free images, ghosting-free images, aliasing-free recording, natural light recording, aperture-dependent effects and real-time rendering which can all be achieved using the same framework. Capturing holograms tinder white light illumination is one promising application for future work.", "paper_title": "A bidirectional light field - Hologram transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500025"}
