A user profile refers to the user's basic information, such as gender, age, and profession. The generated profile has the potential to significantly improve Digital TV (DTV), making the service smarter and more user friendly. We apply the proposed approach to our previous work that introduced decisional DNA TV, which enables TV broadcasters to suggest program choices based upon the user's past viewing habits. Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, flexible, and standard experiential knowledge repository solution that allows for knowledge to be acquired, reused, evolved, and shared in an easy and portable way. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how fuzzy logic methods can be deployed within DNA TV through an experimental implementation that generates a user profile by capturing viewing habits.", "paper_title": "IMPLEMENTING FUZZY LOGIC TO GENERATE USER PROFILE IN DECISIONAL DNA TELEVISION: THE CONCEPT AND INITIAL CASE STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000316075800013"}
