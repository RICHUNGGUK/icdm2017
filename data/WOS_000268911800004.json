A number of orthotropic laws based on Green strain components and one microstructurally based law have previously been investigated to fit experimental measurements of stress-strain behaviour. Here we extend this investigation to include several recently proposed functional forms, i.e. invariant based orthotropic and transversely isotropic constitutive relations. These laws were compared on the basis of (i) 'goodness of fit': how well they fit a set of six shear deformation tests, (ii) 'variability': how well determined the material parameters are over the range of experiments. These criteria were utilised to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the constitutive laws. It was found that a specific form of the polyconvex type as well as the exponential Fung-type law from the previous study were most suitable for modelling the orthotropic behaviour of myocardium under simple shear.", "paper_title": "Myocardial material parameter estimation: a comparison of invariant based orthotropic constitutive equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000268911800004"}
