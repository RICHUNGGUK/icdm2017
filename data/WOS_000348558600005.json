We obtain a Voronovskaja-type result with quantitative estimate for these operators attached to analytic functions on compact disks. We also study the exact order of approximation. More important, our results show the overconvergence phenomenon for these complex operators.", "paper_title": "Approximation by complex Stancu type Durrmeyer operators in compact disks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558600005"}
