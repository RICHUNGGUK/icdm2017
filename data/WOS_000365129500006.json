May showed that when private exponent d < Nr/(r+1)2 or d < N(r-1/r+1)2, N can be factored in polynomial time in PKC 2004. Later in 2014, Sarkar improved the bound for r <= 5. We propose a new cryptanalytic method to attack this RSA variant when given two pairs of public and private exponents, namely (e(1), d(1)) and (e(2), d(2)) with the same modulus N. Suppose that we know d(1) < N-delta 1 and d(2) < N-delta 2. Our results show that when delta(1)delta(2) < (r-1/r+1)(3), Prime Power RSA is insecure.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of Prime Power RSA with two private exponents", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500006"}
