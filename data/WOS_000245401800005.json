From the simulations of some existing high speed protocols, we observe that these high speed protocols make the round-trip time bias problem and the multiple-bottleneck bias problem more serious than for standard TCP. To address these problems, we apply the population ecology theory to design a novel congestion control algorithm. By analogy, we treat the network flows as the species in nature, the sending rates of the flows as the population number, and the bottleneck bandwidth as the food resources. Then we extend the construction method of population ecology models to design a control model, and implement the corresponding end-to-end protocol with virtual load factor feedback, which is called Explicit Virtual Load Feedback TCP (EVLF-TCP). The virtual load factor is computed based on the information of the bandwidth, the aggregate incoming traffic and the queue length in routers,, and then senders adjust the sending rate based on the virtual load factor. Theoretical analysis and simulation results validate that EVLF-TCP achieves high utilization, fair bandwidth allocation independent of round-trip time, and near-zero packet drops. These characteristics are desirable for high speed networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
