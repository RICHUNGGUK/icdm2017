According to IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, a station may enter a special power-saving (PS) mode. SCPS allows all stations in the PS mode to adjust their wakeup schedules whenever a station enters or exits the PS mode. The adjustment can balance the number of wakeup, stations in each beacon interval so that the contention for transmission medium and the collisions in transmission will be ameliorated, which results in more efficient energy usage. Simulation results show that SCPS successfully balances the number of stations that wake up in each beacon interval, increases the sleep ratio, and reduces the collision probability. The combined effect reduces total energy consumption. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
