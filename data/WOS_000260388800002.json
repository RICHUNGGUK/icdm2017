This type of composite system always includes a skew-product structure and some invaxiant subspaces, which axe associated with different levels of laminax phase. In order for the level of laminax phase be adjustable, we adopt a nonlineax function with saturation characteristic to tune the range of a certain state vaxiable so that the number and position of the laminax phase level can be axbitraxily controlled. We find that there exist many interesting statistical characteristics in this complex system, such as the probability distribution of the laminar lengths with -3/2 exponent in the power law and random jumping of the system trajectories.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF AN ON-OFF INTERMITTENCY SYSTEM WITH ADJUSTABLE STATE LEVELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260388800002"}
