Currently, the nonparametric and computational methods of option valuation are able to construct a model of the pricing formula from historical data. However, these models are generally based on a global leaming paradigm, which may not be able to efficiently and accurately capture the dynamics and time-varying characteristics of the option data. This paper proposes a novel brain-inspired cerebellar associative memory model for pricing American-style option on currency futures. The proposed model, called PSECMAC, constitute a local learning model that is inspired by the neurophysiological aspects of the human cerebellum. The PSECMAC-based option pricing model is subsequently applied in a mis-priced option arbitrage trading system. Simulation results show a return on investment as high as 23.1 % for a relatively risk-free investment.", "paper_title": "A brain-inspired cerebellar associative memory approach to option pricing and arbitrage trading", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000042"}
