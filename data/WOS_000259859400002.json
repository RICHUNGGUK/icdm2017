We present some applications of a Grobner basis of this ideal with respect to a total degree ordering. In the first application we give a decoding method for the code. In the second one, by associating the code with the set of cycles in a graph, we can solve the problem of finding all codewords of minimal length (minimal cycles in a graph), and show how to find a minimal cycle basis. Finally we discuss some results on the computation of the Grobner basis.", "paper_title": "Grobner bases and combinatorics for binary codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000259859400002"}
