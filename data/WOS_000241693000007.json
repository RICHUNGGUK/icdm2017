Recently, some attacks have been proposed against various cryptosystems, which exploit deliberate error injection during the computation process. Several error detection schemes have been proposed in order to counteract these attacks. In this paper, we add a residue-based error detection scheme to an RSA architecture and evaluate the area and latency overheads with respect to the basic architecture.", "paper_title": "Incorporating error detection in an RSA architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000241693000007"}
