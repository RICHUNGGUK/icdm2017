Design/methodology/approach - Using a simulation approach and the agent-based model, this research explores how an incremental technology affects customer migration and changes the market structure. Findings -The authors found that a strategy of disruptive technology innovation not only helps a follower company increase its market share, but it also completely disrupts the market. Originality/value - This study investigates customer migration patterns in the saturated mobile telecommunication market based on service providers' strategies.", "paper_title": "ICT service providers strategies and customer migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000341783700004"}
