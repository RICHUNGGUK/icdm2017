In this paper, we present a new approach for customizing 3D garment models. Our approach can transfer garment models initially dressed on a reference human model onto a target human model. To achieve this goal, firstly a spatial mapping between the two human models is established with the shape constraints of cross-sections. Secondly, the space around the clothed reference human model is tetrahedralized into five tetrahedral meshes each of which either can be worked dependently with its adjacent ones or can be worked independently. The clothed reference human model is parametrically encoded in the tetrahedral meshes. Thirdly, these tetrahedral meshes are deformed by fitting the reference human model onto the target human model by using constrained volumetric graph Laplacian deformation. The updated garment models are finally decoded from the deformed tetrahedral meshes. As a result, the updated garment models are fitted onto the target human model. Experiments show that our approach performs very well and has the potential to be used in the garment design industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
