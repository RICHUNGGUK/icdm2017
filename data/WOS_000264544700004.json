In this work we conduct a series of subjective appearance matching experiments to measure the change in image colorfulness after contrast compression and enhancement. The results indicate that the relation between contrast compression and the color saturation correction that matches color appearance is non-linear and smaller color correction is required for small change of contrast. We demonstrate that the relation cannot be fully explained by color appearance models. We propose color correction formulas that can be used with existing tone mapping algorithms. We extend existing global and local tone mapping operators and show that the proposed color correction formulas can preserve original image colors after tone scale manipulation.", "paper_title": "Color correction for tone mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700004"}
