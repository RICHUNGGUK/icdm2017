However, most proposals use the Euclidean distance as the only error measure. Here we propose a way to introduce Bregman divergences in these models, which is based on stochastic approximation principles, so that more general distortion measures can be employed. A procedure is derived to compare the performance of networks using different divergences. Moreover, a probabilistic interpretation of the model is provided, which enables its use as a Bayesian classifier. Experimental results are presented for classification and data visualization applications, which show the advantages of these divergences with respect to the classical Euclidean distance.", "paper_title": "BREGMAN DIVERGENCES FOR GROWING HIERARCHICAL SELF-ORGANIZING NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000334281800006"}
