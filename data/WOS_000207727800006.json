In the proposed model, a logarithmic transformation is applied to the metric space embedding node identifiers. We show that in this transformed space - similarly to short-range connections in the real metric space - long-range connections have linear properties: connections are uniformly distributed and routing via long-range contacts progresses linearly toward the target. Using this transformation model, we introduce a. long-range connection density parameter to characterize DHT routing and analyze common properties and differences between existing DHT routing mechanisms. For the the two extreme DHT families (\"most random\" and completely deterministic), we also present a detailed stochastic analysis of routing in the transformed space and express analytically the expected value of the number of routing hops.", "paper_title": "DHT routing analysis in a logarithmically transformed space", "paper_id": "WOS:000207727800006"}
