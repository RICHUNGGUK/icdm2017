Users can cut meaningful components from meshes by simply drawing freehand sketches on the mesh. Our system provides instant visual feedback to obtain the cutting results based on an improved region growing algorithm using a feature sensitive metric. The cutting boundary can be automatically optimized or easily edited by users. Extensive experimentation shows that our approach produces good cutting results while requiring little skill or effort from the user and provides a good user experience. Based on the easy mesh cutting framework, we introduce two applications including sketch-based mesh editing and mesh merging for geometry processing.", "paper_title": "Easy mesh cutting", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800007"}
