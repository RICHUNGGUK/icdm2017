The averaging rules may be different in different steps of the algorithm. We review the notion of a symmetric binary averaging rule, and we derive some of its relevant properties. We then provide sufficient conditions on the nonlinear binary averaging rules used in the Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm that ensure the convergence of the algorithm to a continuous function. We also show that, when the averaging rules are C (2) with uniformly bounded second derivatives, then the limit is a C (1) function. A canonical family of nonlinear, symmetric averaging rules, the p-averages, is presented, and the Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm with these averages is investigated.", "paper_title": "Convergence and Smoothness of Nonlinear Lane-Riesenfeld Algorithms in the Functional Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000286104900003"}
