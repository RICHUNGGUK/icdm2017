Each transmitter has an individual message for its paired receiver, and additionally, both transmitters have a common message to deliver to both receivers. In this paper, through explicit inner and outer bounds on the capacity region, we establish the capacity region of the Gaussian IC-CI to within a bounded gap of one bit, independently of the values of all channel parameters. Using this constant-gap characterization, the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region is determined. It is shown that the introduction of the common message leads to an increase in the GDoF over that achievable over the Gaussian interference channel without a common message, and hence, to an unbounded improvement in the achievable rate. A surprising feature of the capacity-within-one-bit result is that most of the available benefit (i.e., to within one bit of capacity) due to the common message is achieved through a simple and explicit coding scheme that involves independent signaling at the two transmitters so that, in effect, this scheme forgoes the opportunity for transmitter cooperation that is inherently available due to shared knowledge of the common message at both transmitters.", "paper_title": "Independent Signaling Achieves the Capacity Region of the Gaussian Interference Channel With Common Information to Within One Bit", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900019"}
