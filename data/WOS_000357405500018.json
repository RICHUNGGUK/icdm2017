In this paper, we generalize this notion to any distance-like function delta and define the delta-VCM. Combining the VCM with the distance to a measure and also with the witnessed-k-distance, we get a provably good tool for normal estimation that is resilient to Hausdorff noise and to outliers. We present experiments showing the robustness of our approach for normal and curvature estimation and sharp feature detection.", "paper_title": "Robust Geometry Estimation Using the Generalized Voronoi Covariance Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000357405500018"}
