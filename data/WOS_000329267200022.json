However, the inherit features of wireless channels (e.g., interference, noise, fading and limited bandwidth) have put forward a severe challenge for network reliability. Conventional fault-tolerant techniques either waste too many bandwidth resources or postpone the recovery speed. This paper proposes a random linear network coding based fault-tolerant routing mechanism to instantaneously recover the native packets omitted by the source. This mechanism couples the multi-path routing and random linear network coding technique by improving the conventional method of coding nodes selection. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed fault-tolerant routing mechanism, which includes Random linear Network Coding in Multi-path with Source Coding (RNCM-SC) and Random linear Network Coding in Multi-path with Source Forwarding (RNCM-SF), perform better in terms of packet delivery ratio, resource redundancy degree, end-to-end delay and useful throughput ratio than the traditional method.
