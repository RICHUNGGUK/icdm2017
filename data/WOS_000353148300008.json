We pose structured visual feature learning as a problem of supervised tensor factorization (STF), which is capable of effectively learning multi-view visual features from structural tensorial multimedia data. In mathematics, STF is formulated as a joint optimization framework of probabilistic inference and epsilon-insensitive support vector regression. As a result, the feature representation obtained by STF not only preserves the intrinsic multi-view structural information on tensorial multimedia data, but also includes the discriminative information derived from the max-margin learning process. Using the learned discriminative visual features, we conduct a set of multimedia classification experiments on several challenging datasets, including images and videos, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Structured Visual Feature Learning for Classification via Supervised Probabilistic Tensor Factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000353148300008"}
