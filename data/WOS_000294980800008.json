Design/methodology/approach - The 40 individuals working in the regional branch libraries of IAU were surveyed by a questionnaire consisting of 34 questions, and the collected data were analysed using SPSS software (version 16). Findings - It was found that the most important difficulties are the lack of suitable equipm ent and untrained personnel (i.e. a lack of sufficient training programmes). Research limitations/implications - Because of the small number of participants, it is suggested that a larger scale study is carried out. It is also proposed that the suggestions made by the participants will be considered and implemented, based on the digital library (DL) developments in academic libraries in different countries. Practical implications - It is expected that with improved library management, and the solving of the problems highlighted, through suitable training programmes, librarians will contribute more actively and effectively in establishing and managing DLs in the surveyed libraries. Originality/value - This research can contribute to existing knowledge in the areas of information technology and digital library management, especially in academic arenas. The paper helps librarians do their best in the new environments.", "paper_title": "Perceptions of library staff regarding challenges of developing digital libraries The case of an Iranian university", "paper_id": "WOS:000294980800008"}
