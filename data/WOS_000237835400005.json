Every node only has to know its 2-hop neighbors to find the edges in this new structure. Our method applies the Yao structure on the local Delatmay graph [1] in an ordering that are computed locally. This new structure has the following attractive properties: (1) it is a planar graph; (2) its node degree is bounded from above by a positive constant 19 + [2 pi/alpha]; (3) it is a t-spanner (given any two nodes u and v, there is a path connecting them in the structure such that its length is no more than t <= max{pi/2, pi sin alpha/2 + 1}. C-del times of the shortest path in the unit disk graph); (4) it can be constructed locally and is easy to maintain when the nodes move around; (5) moreover, we show that the total communication cost is O(n log n) bits, where n is the number of wireless nodes, and the computation cost of each node is at most O(d log d), where d is its 2-hop neighbors in the original unit disk graph. Here C-del is the spanning ratio of the Delaunay triangulation, which is at most 4 root 3/9 pi. And the adjustable parameter alpha satisfies 0 < alpha < pi/3.", "paper_title": "Localized construction of bounded degree and planar spanner for wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237835400005"}
