This setting extends recent work for sampling to learn Tree Substitution Grammars to the case where the tree structure (TSG derived tree) is not fixed. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which corrects for the bias introduced by unbalanced forests, and we present experiments using the algorithm to learn Synchronous Context-Free Grammar rules for machine translation. In this application, the forests being sampled represent the set of Hiero-style rules that are consistent with fixed input word-level alignments. We demonstrate equivalent machine translation performance to standard techniques but with much smaller grammars.", "paper_title": "Sampling Tree Fragments from Forests", "paper_id": "WOS:000332150100007"}
