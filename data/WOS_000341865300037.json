Equilibrium geometries, stabilities, and the electronic properties of O-3 and SO2 adsorptions on the surface of an AIN sheet were explored. The adsorption energies were calculated to be about -17.80 and -21.51 kcal mol(-1) at B3LYP-D level for O-3 and SO2 corresponding to the most stable configurations, respectively. It was shown that the electrical conductance of the AIN sheet may be increased after the SO2 adsorption, being somewhat insensitive to the O-3 adsorption. Thus, the AIN sheet may selectively detect SO2 molecules in the presence of O-3 molecules.", "paper_title": "Theoretical investigation on the selective detection of SO2 molecule by AIN nanosheets", "paper_id": "WOS:000341865300037"}
