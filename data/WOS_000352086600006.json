The proposed multi-bit MER_FBL embedding method hides multi-bit (k-bit, k >= 1) logo/secret data into any adjoining (starting with the ith location) k-bit b(i)b(i-1)...b(i-k+1) of cover data only introduces MEE in the range of 0 to +/-(2(k) - 1) 2(i-k); moreover, its flexible bit location enhances the embedded security as security increases as the embedding location closing to the MSBs of cover data. We thus develop a thresholding mechanic to evaluate the anti-forensics degree of the proposed method. Finally, anti-forensics of the proposed steganography systems are demonstrated using the visual attack and the statistical attack of Chi-square analysis.", "paper_title": "Anti-forensic steganography using multi-bit MER with flexible bit location", "paper_id": "WOS:000352086600006"}
