Using a filter-based approach to strengthen contrast, we avoid making a hard decision about how to assign tones to segmented regions. Our method is inspired by sticks filtering, used to enhance medical images but not previously used in non-photorealistic rendering. We amplify contrast of pixels along the direction of greatest local difference from the mean, strengthening even weak features if they are most prominent. A final thresholding step converts the contrast-enhanced image to black and white. Local smoothing and contrast enhancement balances abstraction and structure preservation; the main advantage of our method is its faithful depiction of image detail. Our method can create a set of effects: line drawing, hatching, and black and white, all having superior details to previous black and white methods.", "paper_title": "Contrast-Enhanced Black and White Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500031"}
