The two representations are coupled through a high-order asymptotic formula that takes into account the function values and the third derivative in the classical turning points. For various examples the convergence is analyzed for various physics problems that use an expansion in a large number of oscillator states. The results show significant improvement over the JM-ECS method [Y. Bidasyuk, W. Vanroose, J. Broeckhove, F. Arickx, V.
