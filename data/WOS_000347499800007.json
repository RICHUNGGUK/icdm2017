Unlike most existing studies, the case of non-fix time impulses is focused on in the present study. By means of B-equivalence method, which was introduced in Akhmet (2003, 2005, 2009, 2010), Akhmet and Perestyuk (1990) and Akhmet and Turan (2009), we reduce these networks to a Fix time impulsive neural networks system. Sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global robust asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point are obtained by employing an appropriate Lyapunov function and linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, we give one illustrative example to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
