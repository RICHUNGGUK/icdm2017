It is shown analytically and numerically that if the non-conservative form of equations (only suitable for incompressible flows) is utilized, a uniform flow field when substituted in the transport equations does not lead to any spurious terms. Therefore, computation of incompressible flows on moving or deforming grids with this methodology would eliminate any consideration like the geometrical conservation law. The results of the bench mark cases show that the procedure is quite robust and yields accurate results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
