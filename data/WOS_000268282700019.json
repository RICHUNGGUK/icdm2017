This charge value will be referred to as SET critical charge (Q(SET)). Our proposed model allows to calculate the Q(SET) of a node as a function of the size of the transistors of the gate driving the node and the fan-out gate(s), with no need for time costly electrical level simulations. This makes our approach suitable to be integrated into a design automation tool for circuit radiation hardening. The proposed model features 96% average accuracy compared to electrical level simulations performed by HSPICE. Additionally, it highlights that Q(SET) has a much stronger dependence on the strength of the gate driving the node, than on the node total capacitance. This property could be considered by robust design techniques in order to improve their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Accurate Linear Model for SET Critical Charge Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268282700019"}
