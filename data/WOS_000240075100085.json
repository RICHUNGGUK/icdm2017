ASD is a fundamental step for segmenting news video into stories that is among key issues for achieving efficient treatment of news-based digital libraries. The proposed algorithm creates a set of audio/video templates of anchorperson shots in an unsupervised way, then classifies shots by comparing them to the templates. Audio similarity is evaluated by means of a new index and helps to achieve better performance than a pure video approach. The method has been tested on a wide database and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness with respect to them.", "paper_title": "A multi-stage approach for anchor shot detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100085"}
