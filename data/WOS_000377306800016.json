In this letter, a joint vector perturbation precoding algorithm is proposed for multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink system in the adaptive modulation scenario where different users apply different modulation types. Compared with conventional block diagonalized vector perturbation (BD-VP) and user grouping VP where the search dimension of the perturbation vector is reduced, the proposed algorithm keeps the search dimension unchanged by applying a simple transformation to the VP operation. Our analysis and results show that the proposed algorithm provides an applicable VP solution to the adaptive modulation scenario, with optimal VP performance.", "paper_title": "A Constellation Scaling Approach to Vector Perturbation for Adaptive Modulation in MU-MIMO", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800016"}
