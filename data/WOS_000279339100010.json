The objective is to minimize the makespan. We prove that the classical List Scheduling algorithm with the competitive ratio s+1/s is optimal for s >= 1+root 5/2, where s is the speed ratio between the two machines. Also, we prove the lower bound root s + 1 for 1 <= s < 1+root 5/2 and design an algorithm that matches the bound. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
