We express and prove the completeness of infinitary first-order logics in the institution-independent setting by using forcing, a powerful method for constructing models. As a consequence of this abstraction, the completeness theorem becomes available for the infinitary versions of many 'first order' logical systems that appear in the area of logic or computer science.", "paper_title": "Completeness by Forcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000284432700002"}
