In this paper, we discuss some basic relationships between the extensions of concepts and the equivalence class in rough set theory. And by introducing the term of anti-chain formal context, we study their relation between the two theories more deeply. Finally, we study the relation between the reduction of formal context in concept lattice and attribute reduction in rough set theory.", "paper_title": "Relationships between concept lattice and rough set", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000057"}
