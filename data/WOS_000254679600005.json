An algorithmic procedure for producing the tension-stiffening curve of RC elements taking into consideration most of effective parameters, e.g.: the rate of steel bar corrosion, bond-slip behavior, concrete cover and amount of reinforcement, is illustrated. This has been established on both experimental and analytical bases. This algorithm is implemented into a nonlinear finite element analysis program. The abilities of the resulted program have been studied by modeling some experimental specimens showing a reasonable agreement between the analytical and experimental findings.", "paper_title": "A new approach for nonlinear finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures with corroded reinforcements", "paper_id": "WOS:000254679600005"}
