The perceivable vision of normal people and dichromats were simulated by confusion lines and co-punctal points on the CIE chromaticity diagram to interpret the concept of multiple interpretations. In addition, the new principle of pixel resonance (PR) was proposed to aid dichromats in recognizing the correct objects from a variegated background. In this study, the principle of PR, which is mainly derived from the stochastic resonance (SR) theory, was slightly introduced as the opening of the research. A Monte Carlo simulation of random walks is a common method used to achieve the SR conception by simulating an experiment of the photon casting process. This process is analogous to how people prioritize and understand certain parts of a scene or an image. The concept of PR applied to intensity imaging was introduced in Section 2. Next, an extension of the theory of PR conception was applied to color imaging in Section 3. In addition, we proposed a creative method to simulate an Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test plate using three procedures: circle pattern construction, color sampling and luminance placement. The visual simulations of dichromats and normal people were realized by confusion lines and co-punctal points to obtain multiple interpretations. Finally, the PR phenomenon on the simulated Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test plates was discussed. The results of the current study showed that the PR phenomenon for the perceivable vision of normal people and tritanopes, but not for protanopes and deuteranopes, can be meaningfully observed. In conclusion, the application of PR presents meaningful results for tritanopes. This research can be applied to clinics to assist people with color vision deficiency in recognizing the correct number.", "paper_title": "An investigation of pixel resonance phenomenon in color imaging: the multiple interpretations of people with color vision deficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000357130400002"}
