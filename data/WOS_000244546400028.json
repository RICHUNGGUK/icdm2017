This measure, named as noise masking probability (NMP), is incorporated into the feature compensation technique to achieve robust speech recognition in noisy environments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the performance of the baseline recognition system in the presence of various background noises.", "paper_title": "Feature compensation with model-based estimation for noise masking", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400028"}
