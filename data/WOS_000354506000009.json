Community health centres can be used as a means of delivering highly accessible, low-cost health service in the developing world. A major strategic issue for planners of such centres is the expected level of uptake of services throughout a region and its effect on sustainability of any facility. In this study of a clinic in rural north India, Monte Carlo simulation is used in modelling the spatio-temporal spread of usage of the service. Trust in the provider is built both through word-of-mouth contacts and previous development activities: our study contributes to the literature with a practical application of trust modelling.", "paper_title": "Can you model growth of trust?
