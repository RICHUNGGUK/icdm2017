The proposed codebook-matching schemes exploit the correlation property between adjacent image blocks so that the process of codebook matching can be speed up. Simulation results show that the time complexity of the proposed schemes is lower than those of PCA, Multipath TSVQ, and DPTSVQ. Moreover, the image quality of the proposed methods is close to those processed by the other methods.", "paper_title": "VQ codebook searching algorithm based on correlation property", "paper_id": "WOS:000245444000004"}
