A special case is that of high pressure flow of real gases in cooling channels where large crosswise gradients of thermophysical properties occur. To solve the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations by a space marching approach, the hyperbolicity of the system of governing equations is obtained, even for very low Mach number flow, by recasting equations such that the streamwise pressure gradient is considered as a source term. For this system of equations an approximate Roe's Riemann solver is developed as the core of a Godunov type finite volume algorithm. The properties of the approximated Riemann solver, which is a modification of Roe's Riemann solver for the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations, are presented and discussed with emphasis given to its original features introduced to handle fluids governed by a generic real gas EoS. Sample solutions are obtained for low Mach number high compressible flows of transcritical methane, heated in straight long channels, to prove the solver ability to describe flows dominated by complex thermodynamic phenomena.
