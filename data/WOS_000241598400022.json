Our method is divided into two procedures: pre-operative and intra-operative procedures. For pre-operative procedures, we generate digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from 3D volume using graphics hardware. In intra-operative procedures, we perform a hierarchical registration that includes in-plane registration using principal axes method and out-plane registration using minimal error searching method in spherical coordinates. This method reduces a degree of freedom from 6-DOF to 2-DOF. Experimental results using 2 cardiac phantoms show that our DRRs generation method is more than 150 times faster than software-based ray casting methods, and our hierarchical registration technique effectively matches DRRs and 2D images.", "paper_title": "Fast 2D-3D point-based registration using GPU-based preprocessing for image-guided surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400022"}
