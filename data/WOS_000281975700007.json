Design/methodology/approach - The equivalent permeances of the air-gap are determined by 2D nonlinear FE computations. The results of the 2D model are used in a 3D analytical model. A spectral decomposition and a nonlinear fitting of the amplitudes of the permeance harmonics are performed to account for both saturation and high order harmonic effects. The nonlinear resolution of the circuit equations is performed with an iterative process. The performances are determined by using the principle of virtual works. Findings - The method is validated with a 2D FE computation and then applied to a 3D hybrid step motor. Originality/value - The proposed method enables fast and efficient computations of the performances of hybrid stepping motor.", "paper_title": "Non linear finite element-circuit model of a hybrid stepping motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700007"}
