In this work, a recently proposed neural network, called K-Contractive Map (K-CM), is presented and its performance in classification is evaluated towards other well-known classification methods. K-CM exploits the non-linear variable relationships provided by the Auto-CM neural network to obtain a fuzzy profiling of the samples and then applies the k-NN classifier to evaluate the class membership of samples. The algorithm Training with Input Selection and Testing (TWIST) is applied prior to K-CM to perform training/test data splitting for model parameter optimization and validation. This novel classification strategy was evaluated on ten different datasets and the obtained results were generally satisfactory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
