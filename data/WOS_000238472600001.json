While linear least-square estimators are optimal in case all observation errors are Gaussian distributed, the GSF offers a better treatment of non-Gaussian distributions of track parameter errors when these are modeled by Gaussian mixtures. The algorithm has been verified and evaluated with simulated data. The results are compared to the Kalman filter and to an adaptive vertex estimator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
