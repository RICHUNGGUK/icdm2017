We consider the constrained minimax problem to find a circle which minimizes the maximal weighted distance to a set of points passing through two given points. The problem is reformulated to a minimization problem in one dimension. We propose an algorithm to find an exact solution to the problem, using Cardano's formula. The algorithm is of computational complexity O(n(3)). The stability of the algorithm comes from the exact formula. Several numerical results are also shown. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
