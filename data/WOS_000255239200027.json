It may be applied in systems that have to recognize position and orientation of complex work pieces during micromechanical device assembly as well as in surface quality inspection systems. The performance of the proposed classifier was tested on a specially created image database with four texture types corresponding to metal surfaces after milling, polishing with sandpaper, turning with lathe and polishing with file. The promising recognition rate of 99.8% was obtained. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
