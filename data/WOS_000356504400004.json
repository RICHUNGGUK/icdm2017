More sophisticated models able to enrich first-gradient kinematics as well as to activate rod-bending mechanisms are needed, in particular to explain the mild elasticity observed experimentally. In this paper we propose a second-gradient theory for dilute suspensions of flexible rods in a Newtonian fluid that is indeed able to activate rod bending and predict viscoelastic behaviour.", "paper_title": "A Second-Gradient Theory of Dilute Suspensions of Flexible Rods in a Newtonian Fluid", "paper_id": "WOS:000356504400004"}
