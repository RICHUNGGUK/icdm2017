The proposed LNTA uses double cross-coupling technique to reduce noise figure (NF), complementary derivative superposition, and resistive feedback to achieve high linearity and enhance input matching. The analysis of both NF and IIP3 using Volterra series is described in detail and verified by SpectreRF (A (R)) circuit simulation showing NF < 2 dB and IIP3 = 18 dBm at 3 GHz. The amplifier performance is demonstrated in a two-stage highly selective receiver front-end implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology. In measurements the front-end achieves blocker rejection competitive to SAW filters with noise figure 3.2-5.2 dB, out of band IIP3 >+17 dBm and blocker P-1dB >+5 dBm over frequency range of 0.5-3 GHz.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of low noise transconductance amplifier for selective receiver front-end", "paper_id": "WOS:000361984600014"}
