Extraction of data embedded with halftone orientation modulation is accomplished by computing, from the scanned hardcopy image, detection statistics that uniquely identify the embedded orientation. From a communications perspective, this data hiding setup forms an interesting class of channels with dot orientation as input and a vector of statistics as the output. This paper derives capacity expressions for these channels that allow for numerical evaluation of the capacity. Results provide significant insight for orientation modulation based print-scan resilient data hiding: the capacity varies significantly as a function of the image graylevel and experimentally observed error free data rates closely mirror the variation in capacity.", "paper_title": "Capacity Analysis For Orthogonal Halftone Orientation Modulation Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500036"}
