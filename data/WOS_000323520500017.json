The natural uncertainty exists in these data because sensors are not precise enough. Hence, the intuitive method to store this kind of data is using uncertain database. Finding the top-k entities according to one or more attributes is a powerful technique when the uncertain database contains large quantity of data. However, compared to top-k in traditional databases, queries over uncertain database are more complicated because of the existence of exponential possible worlds. We propose a method to process entity-based global top-k aggregate queries in uncertain database, which returns the top-k entities that have the highest aggregate value. Our method has two levels, entity state generation and G-topk-E query processing. In the former level, entity states, which satisfy the properties of x-tuple, are generated one after the other according to their aggregate values, while in the latter level, dynamic programming-based global top-k entity query processing is employed to return the answers. Comprehensive experiments on different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.", "paper_title": "Top-k entities query processing on uncertainly fused multi-sensory data", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500017"}
