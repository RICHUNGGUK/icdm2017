This paper addresses two key issues in robot motion planning; path continuity and maximum curvature constraint for nonholonomic robots. The advantage of this new method is that it allows robots to account for their constraints in an efficient manner that facilitates real-time planning. B-spline curves are leveraged for their robustness and practical synthesis to model the vehicle's path. Comparative navigational-based analyses are presented to selected appropriate curve and nominate its parameters. Path continuity is achieved by utilizing a single path, to represent the trajectory, with no limitations on path, or orientation. The path parameters are formulated with respect to the robot's constraints. Maximum curvature is satisfied locally, in every segment using a smoothing algorithm, if needed. It is demonstrated that any local modifications of single sections have minimal effect on the entire path. Rigorous simulations are presented, to highlight the benefits of the proposed method, in comparison to existing approaches with regards to continuity, curvature control, path length and resulting acceleration. Experimental results validate that our approach mimics human steering with high accuracy. Accordingly, efficiently formulated continuous paths ultimately contribute towards passenger comfort improvement. Using presented approach, autonomous vehicles generate and follow paths that humans are accustomed to, with minimum disturbances.", "paper_title": "Continuous Path Smoothing for Car-Like Robots Using B-Spline Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000368189000004"}
