In its (standard) parameterized version, max -vertex cover can be stated as follows: \"given and parameter does contain vertices that cover at least edges?\". We first devise moderately exponential exact algorithms for max -vertex cover, with time-complexity exponential in but with polynomial space-complexity by developing a branch and reduce method based upon the measure-and-conquer technique. We then prove that, there exists an exact algorithm for max -vertex cover with complexity bounded above by the maximum among and for some where is the cardinality of a minimum vertex cover of (note that k with respect to parameter unless ), using polynomial space. We finally study approximation of max -vertex cover by moderately exponential algorithms. The general goal of the issue of moderately exponential approximation is to catch-up on polynomial inapproximability, by providing algorithms achieving, with worst-case running times importantly smaller than those needed for exact computation, approximation ratios unachievable in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for the max vertex cover problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000341498700013"}
