The tool assesses scenarios that represent potential designs and their operational behavior, as well as how the designs perform in a range of environmental conditions. Designs are optimized for three objective functions: 1) reliability 2) performance time; and 3) costs. Use of the tool is illustrated in a systems engineering case study to derive optimal design for a naval command and control system that includes human operator roles as well as technology components.", "paper_title": "Applying evolutionary computing to complex systems design", "paper_id": "WOS:000249024900015"}
