It is crucial to effectively discover users' concept patterns through an acquired understanding of the subjective role played by humans in the retrieval process for such systems. A learning and retrieval framework is used to achieve this. It seamlessly incorporates multiple instance learning for relevant feedback to discover users concept patterns - especially in the region of greatest user interest. It also maps the local feature vector of that region to the high-level concept pattern. This underlying mapping can be progressively discovered through feedback and learning. The user guides the retrieval systems learning process using his/her focus of attention. Retrieval performance is tested to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed learning and retrieval framework.", "paper_title": "A dynamic user concept pattern learning framework for content-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438200006"}
