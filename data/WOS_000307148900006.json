MS provide benchmark solutions for direct evaluation of the solution errors. The method of manufactured solutions (MMS) is a straight forward and general procedure for generating exact analytical solutions with a sufficiently rich structure to ensure that all terms of the differential equations are exercised in the simulations. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, the MMS provides strong code verification with a theorem-like quality. Manufactured solutions for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with large displacements are presented with sample results from grid convergence studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
