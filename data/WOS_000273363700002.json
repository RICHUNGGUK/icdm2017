We apply the approach to a linear problem which involves a parameter c and cannot be solved by other analytical methods for large values of c, and obtain convergent series solutions which agree very well with the exact solution, no matter how large the value of c is. Consequently, we give an affirmative answer to the open problem proposed by Momani and Noor in 2007 [S. Momani, M.A. Noor, Numerical comparison of methods for solving a special fourth-order boundary value problem, Appl. Math. Comput. 191 (2007) 218-224]. We also apply the approach to a nonlinear problem, and obtain convergent series solutions which agree very well with the numerical solution given by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4-5 technique.
