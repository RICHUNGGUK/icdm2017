We then observe that those same design forces now are bearing down on the architects of contemporary general-purpose processors, who consequently are producing general-purpose processors whose architectural features are increasingly similar to those of systolic arrays. We then describe some economic and technological forces that are changing the landscape of architectural research. At base, they are the increasing complexity of technology and applications, the fragmenting of the general-purpose processor market, and the judicious use hardware configurability. We describe a 2D architectural taxonomy, identifying what, we believe, to be a \"sweet spot\" for architectural research.", "paper_title": "Application-specific processor architecture: Then and now", "paper_id": "WOS:000259734000014"}
