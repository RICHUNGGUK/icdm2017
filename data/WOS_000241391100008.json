This paper describes a fast algorithm for isotropic complex Gabor filtering that outperforms existing implementations. The main computational improvement arises from the decomposition of Gabor filtering into more efficient Gaussian filtering and sinusoidal modulations. Appropriate filter initial conditions are derived to avoid boundary transients, without requiring explicit image border extension. Our proposal reduces up to 39% the number of required operations with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. A full C++ implementation of the method is publicly available.", "paper_title": "Fast IIR isotropic 2-D complex Gabor filters with boundary initialization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100008"}
