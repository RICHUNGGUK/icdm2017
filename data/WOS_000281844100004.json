Nonlinear stability and numerical implementation of the methods are investigated. It is proven under the suitable conditions that the extended Pouzet-Runge-Kutta methods are globally and asymptotically stable for problems of the class NRI(alpha, beta, gamma, nu). Numerical examples further illustrate the theoretical results and the methods' effectiveness.", "paper_title": "The extended Pouzet-Runge-Kutta methods for nonlinear neutral delay-integro-differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000281844100004"}
