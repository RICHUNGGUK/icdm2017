With the aid of the representative patch of C-74 (D (3h)), we studied the interaction between C-74 (D (3h)) and M (M = Ca, Yb) atom and obtained the interaction potential. Optimized structures show that there are three equivalent stable isomers and there is one transition state between every two stable isomers. According to the minimum energy pathway, the possible movement trajectory of M (M = Ca, Yb) atom in the C-74 (D (3h)) cage is explored. The calculated energy barrier for Yb atoms moving from the stable isomer to the transition state is 10.4 kcal mol(-1) and the energy barrier for Ca atoms is 6.1 kcal mol(-1). The calculated NMR spectra of M@C-74 (M = Ca, Yb) are in good agreement with the experimental data. There are nine lines in the spectra: one 1/6 intensity signal, four half intensity signals and four full intensity signals.", "paper_title": "The dynamic motion of a M (M = Ca, Yb) atom inside the C-74 (D (3h)) cage: a relativistic DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000324644000043"}
