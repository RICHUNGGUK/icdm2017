A mathematical model was developed to describe the behavior of the system and to derive the optimal cycle length and order-up-to levels for the two parties. An analysis of the obtained results revealed that the methods were able to determine the optimal control parameters for each party in a short time frame. A coordination mechanism based on the optimal policies was ultimately proposed so that each party benefits more than if they use their own optimal control policy.", "paper_title": "A Coordination Model Under an Order-Up-To Policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000306154900004"}
