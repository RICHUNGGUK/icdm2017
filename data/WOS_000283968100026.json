Then the cross-entropy of IvIFSs is presented and the relationship between the proposed entropy measures and the existing information measures of IvIFSs is discussed. Additionally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the applications of the proposed entropy and cross-entropy of IvIFSs to pattern recognition and decision-making. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
