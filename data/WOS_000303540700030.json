A computational strategy based on molecular docking studies, followed by docking-based comparative molecular fields analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA), has been used to elucidate the atomic details of the RT/TP interactions and to identify the most important features impacting the TP antiretroviral activity. The final CoMSIA model resulted to be the more predictive, showing r(ncv)(2)=0.97, r(cv)(2)=0.723, SEE=0.248, F=240.291, and r(pred)(2)=0.77. The results allowed us to obtain useful information for the design of new compounds with improved potency toward WT HIV-1 and also against clinically relevant resistant mutants.", "paper_title": "Docking-based 3D-QSAR analyses of pyrazole derivatives as HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000303540700030"}
