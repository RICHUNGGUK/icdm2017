This system is composed by two coordinated subsystems: a robotic image-based visual servoing path tracker and a safety system for human-robot interaction. The path tracker based on visual Servoing solves the problems of previous computer vision systems proposed to guide robots in situations where the robot interacts with the workspace. On the one hand, this path tracker always completes the planned trajectory due to its time-independent behaviour. On the other hand, this path tracker is adaptive because the camera is calibrated on-line by using virtual visual servoing during the visual servoing task. The stability of this path tracker has been analyzed with the Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the human safety during the cooperation, a new collision avoidance system is presented. This safety system implements a multi-sensorial fusion approach to precisely determine the distance between all the links of the robot and all the limbs of the human operator during the task. Both subsystems have been evaluated in a real task which involves the change of a blown light bulb of a streetlamp.", "paper_title": "SAFE HUMAN-ROBOT COOPERATION BASED ON AN ADAPTIVE TIME-INDEPENDENT IMAGE PATH TRACKER", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700002"}
