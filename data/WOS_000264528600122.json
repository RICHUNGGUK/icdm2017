This research focuses on the design and the development of a Group Awareness Knowledge based System (GAKS) whose aim is to provide elaborated and innovative awareness functions to enhance coauthoring of documents on the World Wide Web. The developed advanced awareness functionalities follow and take advantages of the knowledge based system principles to provide: (1) a synchronous/asynchronous contextual communication tool (related to coauthors' productions and interests), and (2) a detector of physical/logical work proximity that allows users to efficiently produce and coordinate their actions.
