The complex geometry is represented by Lagrangian markers and forces are exerted at the Lagrangian markers in order to satisfy the prescribed velocity of the boundary. This force at the Lagrangian markers is then distributed to the Eulerian grid by a well-chosen discretized delta function. With the known force field in the Eulerian grid to mimic the boundary, the lattice Boltzmann method is used to compute the flow field where the complex geometry is immersed inside the Cartesian computational domain. Numerical experiments show that the second-order accuracy of the adopted numerical scheme is degraded to 1.8 order. The proposed method is examined by computing decaying vortex, lid driven cavity flow and 2D and 3D flows over asymmetrically placed cylinder. All the numerical results are compatible with the benchmark solutions.", "paper_title": "Immersed boundary method based lattice Boltzmann method to simulate 2D and 3D complex geometry flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000019"}
