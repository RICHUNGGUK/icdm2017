The proposed model examines different types of switching predictors such as push and pull factors, intervening obstacles, and individual differences, as well as interdependencies between these factors as moderating effects. Empirical data from a longitudinal field survey of users' switching from traditional hard copy books to eBooks validates most of the hypothesized associations. This study alerts publishers, academics, and educational institutions to the challenges and opportunities of artifact switching in general and suggests strategies that can help these stakeholders enable artifact switching within their target populations.", "paper_title": "An Artifact Switching Model for User Acceptance of eBooks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335163200002"}
