Therefore, considering personalization and interactivity will increase the quality of learning. In the other side, among numerous components of e-learning, assessment is an important part. Generally, the process of instruction completes with the assessment and it is used to evaluate learners' learning efficiency, skill and knowledge. But in web-based educational systems there is less attention on adaptive and personalized assessment. Having considered the importance of tests, this paper proposes a personalized multi-agent e-learning system based on item response theory (IRT) and artificial neural network (ANN) which presents adaptive tests (based on IRT) and personalized recommendations (based on ANN). These agents add adaptivity and interactivity to the learning environment and act as a human instructor which guides the learners in a friendly and personalized teaching environment.
