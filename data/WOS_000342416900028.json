Compared to other works on joint source-channel coding, we consider the fundamental problem of the minimum transmission energy, where the source and channel bandwidths are not naturally matched. Different models of correlated sources are studied. We first treat lossy transmission of Gaussian sources, including multiterminal sources and CEO sources. We then consider lossless transmission of correlated binary sources. In all cases, we lower bound the minimum energy using a cut-set argument that couples transmission energy and the distortions for the Gaussian cases (or source entropy for the discrete case). For the achievable schemes, separate source and channel coding and uncoded transmission are studied as benchmarks. In addition, we show that hybrid digital/analog transmission achieves the best known energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "On the Minimum Energy of Sending Correlated Sources Over the Gaussian MAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900028"}
