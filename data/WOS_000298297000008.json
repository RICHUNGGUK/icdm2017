A possible solution is to utilize the processing power of multi-core processors that nowadays are available as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. In this paper, we introduce a software solution for wire-speed packet capturing and transmission for TCP/IP networks under Linux operating system, called DashCap. The results of our experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution causes more than two times performance boost for packet capturing in comparison to the existing software solutions under Linux. We have proposed a scalable software architecture for network monitoring tools called DashNMon, which is based on DashCap. Multi-core awareness is a distinguished property of this architecture. Comparing to the existing cluster-based solutions, DashNMon can be used with COTS multi-core processors. In order to evaluate the proposed solutions, we have developed several prototype tools. The results of the experiments carried out using these tools show the scalability and high performance of the network monitoring tools that are based on the proposed architecture. Using the proposed architecture, it is possible to design and implement high-performance multi-threaded network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) or application-layer firewalls, completely in the user space and with better utilization of the computational resources of multi-processor/multi-core systems.", "paper_title": "A high-performance and scalable multi-core aware software solution for network monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297000008"}
