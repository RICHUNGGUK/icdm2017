DP-CPLNN has the capability of representing any continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function, hence its identification performance can be expected. Another attractive feature of DP-CPLNN is the geometrical property of its parameters. Applying this property, this paper proposes an identification method including domain partition and parameter training. In numerical experiments, DP-CPLNN with this method outperforms hinging hyperplanes and high-level canonical piecewise linear representation, which are two widely used CPWL models, showing the flexibility of DP-CPLNN and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in nonlinear identification.
