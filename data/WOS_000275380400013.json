Due to recent advances in control functions for wavelength switching in optical networks, network service providers envision the same level of automated connection provisioning and restoration capabilities at the wavelength layer as offered by time division multiplexing (TDM) or packet switched networks. Implementing Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS), transparent networks can offer a high level of reliability with automatic restoration as well as reduced resources compared to legacy 1 + 1 protection mechanisms. Based on pre-planned path computation, selection, signaling, and allocation of optical, resources, three recovery schemes are described in the context of the wavelength connections: protection, dynamic restoration, and a combination of protection and restoration. Through the use of network simulations, we analyze the impact of transparency constraints such as optical switch activation delay and sequential light path establishment on the recovery time. This analysis includes the trade-off between different recovery strategies and transmission system reach.
