The device structure is ITO/NPB 45 nm/DCJTB 0.15 nm/NPB nm/DCJTB 0.15 nm/BCP 10 nm/AlQ 50 nm/LiF 0.3 nm/Al 150 nm. This device exhibited a pure white-light emission having Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.324, 0.336), a current efficiency of 2.9 Cd/A and a maximum brightness of 7016 cd/m(2). When the current density increased from 2 mA/cm(2) to 100 mA/cm(2), We observed only a slight shifting in the CIE coordinates from (0.324, 0.336) to (0.320, 0.326). Moreover. the efficiency of the device with double thin emitting layers of DCJTB is two times higher than the device with only one DCJTB layer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
