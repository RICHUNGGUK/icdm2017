Data extraction and data annotation, which are important for many applications, extracts and annotates the record from the HTML pages. We proposed an domain-specific ontology based data extraction and annotation technique; we first construct mini-ontology for specific domain according to information of query interface and query result pages; then, use constructed mini-ontology for identifying data areas and mapping data annotations in data extraction; in order to adapt to new sample set, mini-ontology will evolve dynamically based on data extraction and data annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has higher precision and recall in data extraction and data annotation.", "paper_title": "Data Extraction and Annotation Based on Domain-specific Ontology Evolution for Deep Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500009"}
