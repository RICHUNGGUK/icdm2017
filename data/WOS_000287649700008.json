The stability result for general discrete-time switched systems with average dwell time is first presented. A mode-dependent full-order parameterised filter is then designed and the corresponding existence conditions of such filters are derived via LMI formulation. The desired filter gains and the admissible switching signals are obtained for a given system decay degree such that the resulting filter error system is exponentially stable and has a guaranteed H-infinity performance. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the developed theoretical results.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering for a class of switched linear parameter varying systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700008"}
