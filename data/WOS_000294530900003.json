Similarly, the maximum is called the \"remoteness\" and denoted by rho = rho(G). In this article we first prove upper and lower bounds on pi and rho as a function of the order n of G. A comparison between these two invariants follows and then each one is compared to the diameter, radius, average eccentricity, average distance, independence number and matching number. Most bounds so obtained are proved, but a few of them remain conjectures. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
