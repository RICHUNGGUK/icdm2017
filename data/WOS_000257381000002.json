Particularly the analysis of concurrent and multidimensional sequences poses new challenges in finding clusters of arbitrary length and varying number of attributes. We present a novel algorithm capable of finding parallel clusters in different subspaces and demonstrate our results for temporal and spatial applications. Our analysis of structural quality parameters in rivers is successfully used by hydrologists to develop measures for river quality improvements.", "paper_title": "Clustering multidimensional sequences in spatial and temporal databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381000002"}
