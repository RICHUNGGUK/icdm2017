Applications include the no-slip boundary conditions with prescribed temperature or temperature gradient and the first order slip-flow boundary conditions. The formulation is uniform and the transitions between different boundary conditions are done by a change of parameters. We give different sharp energy estimates depending on the choice of parameters. The discretization is done using finite differences on Summation-By-Parts form with weak boundary conditions using the Simultaneous Approximation Term. We verify convergence by the method of manufactured solutions and show computations of flows ranging from no-slip to almost full slip. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
