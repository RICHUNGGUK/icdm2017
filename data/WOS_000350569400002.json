This new motor driven system avoids the traditional input power transformer and only single-phase power network is needed. It has a modular structure and consists of series H-bridges rectifier, output-parallel dual active bridge converters and a three-phase voltage source inverter. In the input stage, a new control strategy is proposed to balance the dc voltages among the series H-bridges and regulate the current. This new control algorithm determines the minimal reactive current to stabilize the converter when the loads are seriously unbalanced. In order to verify the new driven system, a 3 kV/462 V/180 kW EPT driving an induction motor is constructed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulations results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed unbalanced control algorithm and good dynamic behavior of the integrated control system for this new driven system.", "paper_title": "Extended Unbalanced Operation of Induction Motor Driven System Based on a Single-Phase Electronic Power Transformer", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569400002"}
