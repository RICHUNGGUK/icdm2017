In a voting setting, the agents decide among a set of alternatives by having each agent rank all the alternatives. Many of the key research issues in these two domains are similar. The aim of this paper is to give a convenient side-by-side comparison that will clarify the relation between the domains, and serve as a guide to future research.", "paper_title": "Comparing multiagent systems research in combinatorial auctions and voting", "paper_id": "WOS:000284543300005"}
