In this paper, we generalize this method to other systems, adapting it to discrete symmetry systems by using group theory arguments. The result is a new technique that incorporates symmetry concepts into the iterative procedure of the self-consistency method, that helps the search of symmetric stationary Solutions. An efficient implementation of this technique is also presented, which restricts the computational work to a reduced section of the entire domain and is able to find different types of solutions by specifying their symmetry properties. As a practical application, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a discrete symmetry potential, (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
