Based on a case study, it shows how to bridge any gaps between those information systems used within the design, prefabrication, and on-site construction processes. The information requirements of the aforementioned three key processes are analysed regarding an industrialized construction project, and any gaps identified between their three sets of requirements. A theoretical model for information mapping is proposed using these requirements. The solution is then verified through a case study, performed within the operational environment of a construction company. This case study represents one approach for applying the proposed information mapping model, and possible benefits for the industry. The information analysis highlights significant distinctions among particular views on the information required for supporting the tasks during the three above-mentioned processes. The main difference lies in the levels of data granularity important for particular tasks. Building Information Modelling based construction (BIM-based construction) proved itself to be an adequate context for bridging the information gaps. BIM-based construction can accommodate the proposed model for information mapping across the processes. Within this context it is possible to separate the identities of physical building elements from those of designed building elements, which is required when mapping. This study shows that it is feasible to automate the proposed information mapping in the form of a computer algorithm. It explains the value and necessity of building information model (BIM) usage, in order to provide the context for information mapping. The integration of design, manufacturing, and construction processes, and a transparency of information about material resources across these processes, would bring significant benefits for all stakeholders within the supply-chain. In the case study, the architecture and a prototype of the software system were developed in order to implement the proposed idea. Specifically, the case study showed that the proposed information mapping improved the project's progress monitoring, detailed planning, and management of material flows, across the construction supply-chain.
