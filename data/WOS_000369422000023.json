Conventional approaches via the Monte-Carlo scheme attempt to provide viable solutions, yet at the expense of prohibitively elongated simulations and system overhead, due to the large amount of statistical implementations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a 3-D stochastic finite-difference time-domain (S-FDTD) technique for the accurate modelling of generalised EMC applications with highly random media properties, while concurrently offering fast and economical single-run realisations. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method establishes the concept of covariant/contravariant metrics for robust tessellations of arbitrarily curved structures and derives the mean value and standard deviation of the generated fields in a single-run. Also, the critical case of geometrical and physical uncertainties is handled via an optimal parameterisation, which locally reforms the curvilinear grid. In order to pursue extra speed efficiency, code implementation is conducted through contemporary graphics processor units and parallel programming. Findings - The curvilinear S-FDTD algorithm is proven very precise and stable, compared to existing multiple-realisation approaches, in the analysis of statistically-varying problems. Moreover, its generalised formulation allows the effective treatment of realistic structures with arbitrarily curved geometries, unlike staircase schemes. Finally, the GPU-based enhancements accomplish notably accelerated simulations that may exceed the level of 120 times. Conclusively, the featured technique can successfully attain highly accurate results with very limited system requirements. Originality/value - Development of a generalised curvilinear S-FDTD methodology, based on a covariant/contravariant algorithm. Incorporation of the important geometric/physical uncertainties through a locally adaptive curved mesh. Speed advancement via modern GPU and CUDA programming which leads to reliable estimations, even for abrupt statistical media parameter fluctuations.", "paper_title": "A curvilinear stochastic-FDTD algorithm for 3-D EMC problems with media uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000369422000023"}
