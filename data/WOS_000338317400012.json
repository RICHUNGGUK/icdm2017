In such context, securing the access rights to some objects such as data, apparatus, and contents, is still a challenge. This paper introduces a risk-based authentication technique based on behavioral biometrics as solution approach to tackle this challenge. Risk-based authentication is an increasingly popular component in the security architecture deployed by many organizations to mitigate online identity fraud. Risk-based authentication uses contextual and historical information extracted from online communications to build a risk profile for the user that can be used accordingly to make authentication and authorization decisions. Existing risk-based authentication systems rely on basic web communication information such as the source IP address or the velocity of transactions performed by a specific account, or originating from a certain IP address. Such information can easily be spoofed, and as such, put in question the robustness and reliability of the proposed systems. In this paper, we propose a new online risk-based authentication system that provides more robust user identity information by combining mouse dynamics and keystroke dynamics biometrics in a multimodal framework. We propose a Bayesian network model for analyzing free keystrokes and free mouse movements involved in web sessions. Experimental evaluation of our proposed model with 24 participants yields an Equal Error Rate of 8.21 %. This is very encouraging considering that we are dealing with free text and free mouse movements, and the fact that many web sessions tend to be very short.", "paper_title": "Online risk-based authentication using behavioral biometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400012"}
