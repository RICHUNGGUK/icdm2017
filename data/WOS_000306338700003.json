A static priority policy that assigns priorities to server pools based on their service time distributions is proposed. This policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in the many-server heavy-traffic regime in minimizing the total number of customers.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal control of many-server heterogeneous service systems with H-2(*) service times", "paper_id": "WOS:000306338700003"}
