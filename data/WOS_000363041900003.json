In this paper, we point out that instead of utilizing the Mandarin lexical database, it's necessary to construct a particular lexical database for Cantonese. Besides, we explore some Cantonese special written-tradition rules and incorporate them into the feature-based opinion summarization system framework. The experimental results show that our framework significantly outperform the traditional Mandarin sentiment analysis method using ICTCLAS.", "paper_title": "An opinion mining framework for Cantonese reviews", "paper_id": "WOS:000363041900003"}
