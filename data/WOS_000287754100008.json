The characteristics of mobile UWSNs, such as low communication bandwidth, large propagation delay, floating node mobility, and high error probability, are significantly different from terrestrial wireless sensor networks. Energy-efficient communication protocols are thus urgently demanded in mobile UWSNs. In this paper, we develop a novel clustering algorithm that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and application-specific data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system lifetime, and application-perceived quality. The proposed clustering technique organizes sensor nodes into direction-sensitive clusters, with one node acting as the head of each cluster, in order to fit the unique characteristic of up/down transmission direction in UWSNs. Meanwhile, the concept of self-healing is adopted to avoid excessively frequent re-clustering owing to the disruption of individual clusters. The self-healing mechanism significantly enhances the robustness of clustered UWSNs. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A self-healing clustering algorithm for underwater sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287754100008"}
