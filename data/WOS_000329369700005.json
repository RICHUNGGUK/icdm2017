However, the LISP was originally designed for fixed network environment, rather than for mobile network environment. In particular, the existing LISP mobility control schemes use a centralized map server to process all the control traffics, and thus they are intrinsically subject to some limitations in mobile environment, such as large overhead of mapping control traffics at central map server and degradation of handover performance. To overcome these problems, we propose a distributed mobility control scheme in LISP networks. In the proposed scheme, we assume that a mobile host has a hierarchical endpoint identifier which contains the information of its home network domain. Each domain has a distributed map server (DMS) for distributed mapping management of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Locators (LOCs). For roaming support, each DMS maintains a home EID register and a visiting EID register which are used to keep the EID-LOC mappings for mobile hosts in the distributed manner. For performance analysis, we compare the control traffic overhead (CTO) at map servers, the signaling delay required for EID-LOC mapping management, and the handover delay for the existing and proposed schemes. From numerical results, it is shown that the proposed distributed scheme can give better performance than the existing centralized schemes in terms of CTO, total signaling delay for EID-LOC mapping management, and handover delay.", "paper_title": "A distributed mobility control scheme in LISP networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329369700005"}
