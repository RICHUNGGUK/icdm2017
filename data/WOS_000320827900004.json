The structure makes the posterior distribution complicated in the Bayes method. Then, the prediction including construction of the posterior is not tractable though advantages of the method are empirically well known. The variational Bayes method is widely used as an approximation method for application; it has the tractable posterior on the basis of the variational free energy function. The asymptotic behavior has been studied in many hierarchical models and a phase transition is observed. The exact form of the asymptotic variational Bayes energy is derived in Bernoulli mixture models and the phase diagram shows that there are three types of parameter learning. However, the approximation accuracy or interpretation of the transition point has not been clarified yet. The present paper precisely analyzes the Bayes free energy function of the Bernoulli mixtures. Comparing free energy functions in these two Bayes methods, we can determine the approximation accuracy and elucidate behavior of the parameter learning. Our results claim that the Bayes free energy has the same learning types while the transition points are different. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
