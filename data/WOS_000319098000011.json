A large number of algorithms have been proposed to solve single-objective formulations of this problem, including meta-heuristic approaches, which provide high quality solutions in reasonable runtimes. Nevertheless, in recent years some authors have analyzed multi-objective variants that consider additional objectives to the distance travelled. This paper considers not only the minimum distance required to deliver goods, but also the workload imbalance in terms of the distances travelled by the used vehicles and their loads. Thus, MMOEASA, a Pareto-based hybrid algorithm that combines evolutionary computation and simulated annealing, is here proposed and analyzed for solving these multi-objective formulations of the VRPTW. The results obtained when solving a subset of Solomon's benchmark problems show the good performance of this hybrid approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
