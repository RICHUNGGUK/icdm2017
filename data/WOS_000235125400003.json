Backtracking games are essentially parity games with an additional rule allowing players, under certain conditions, to return to an earlier position in the play and revise a choice or to force a countback of the number of moves. This new feature makes backtracking games more powerful than parity games. As a consequence, winning strategies become more complex objects and computationally harder. The corresponding increase in expressiveness allows us to use backtracking games as model-checking games for inflationary fixed-point logics such as IFP or MIC. We identify a natural subclass of backtracking games, the simple games, and show that these are the \"right\" model-checking games for IFP by (a) giving a translation of formulae phi and structures 21 into simple games such that 21 =phi if, and only if, Player 0 wins the corresponding game and (b) showing that the winner of simple backtracking games can again be defined in IFP.
