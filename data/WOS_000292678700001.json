These methods allow for distinct features to be computed, which in turn reflect properties of fibrous tissue in the brain and in other organs. A practical consideration is that to choose among these approaches requires very specialized knowledge. In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice in dMRI reconstruction and analysis we present a detailed review of the dMRI modeling literature. We place an emphasis on the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of the subject, categorizing existing methods according to how they treat the angular and radial sampling of the diffusion signal. We describe the features that can be computed with each method and discuss its advantages and limitations. We also provide a detailed bibliography to guide the reader. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
