We present an algorithm for 2D simulations of the fluid inside an IFE chamber between fueling repetitions. Our finite-volume discretization for the Navier-Stokes equations incorporates a Cartesian grid treatment for irregularly-shaped domain boundaries. The discrete conservative update is based on a time-explicit Godunov method for advection, and a two-stage Runge-Kutta update for diffusion accommodating state-dependent transport properties. Conservation is enforced on cut cells along the embedded boundary interface using a local redistribution scheme so that the explicit time step for the combined approach is governed by the mesh spacing in the uniform grid. The test problems demonstrate second-order convergence of the algorithm on smooth solution profiles, and the robust treatment of discontinuous initial data in an IFE-relevant vessel geometry.
