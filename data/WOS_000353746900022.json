Although one may employ previous methods in this research area to indirectly construct utility-based episode rules, they typically lack efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology to directly generate high utility episode rules during the mining process, which is the first work addressing the issue of utility-based episode rule mining. Our goal is to simultaneously resolve the difficulty of the previous reported methods for frequent episode mining and utility-based episode mining. An algorithm called UBER-Mine (Utility-Based Episode Rules) and a structure named UR-Tree (Utility Rule Tree) are proposed to mine efficiently the complete set of high utility episode rules in complex event sequences. In short, UBER-Mine is based on an extended downward closure property, which can efficiently discover utility-based episode rules. On the other hand, UR-Tree can maintain important event information without producing candidate episodes to further accelerate the mining process. Results on both real and synthetic datasets show that UBER-Mine with UR-Tree has good scalability on large datasets and runs faster than the basic UBER-Mine and the current best high utility episode mining algorithm over 100 times. Furthermore, by proposing a high-utility episode-rule model called IV-UBER (InVestment by Utility-Based Episode Rules), we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for mining high utility-based episode rules on a real-world application for stock investment. The experimental results show that our proposed IV-UBER method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both precision and annualized return for investment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
