Based on the analysis of these demands, this paper introduces an integration framework based on Semantic Web services. A task-oriented semantic representation model is built in the framework. This paper also discusses the handling processes of service requests for application tasks. The framework can improve the flexibility and maintainability of integration of collaborating systems and provide support for dynamic alliance oriented integrated product development.", "paper_title": "SWSAIF: A semantic application integration framework to support collaborative design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800018"}
