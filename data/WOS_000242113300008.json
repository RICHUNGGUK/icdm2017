In this paper, an implemented system called DartGrid is presented. DartGrid is intended to provide a semantic infrastructure for building database grid applications. We explore the essential and fundamental roles played by Resource Description Framework (RDF) semantics for database grids and implement a set of semantically enabled tools and grid services such as semantic browser, semantic mapping tools, ontology service, semantic query service and semantic registration service. We propose an RDF-View-based approach for relational schema mediation and describe the view-based semantic query rewriting algorithm implemented in DartGrid. DartGrid has been used to build a real database grid application for Traditional Chinese Medicine in China.
