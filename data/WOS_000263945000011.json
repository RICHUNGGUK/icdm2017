In this paper, adopting the conditional fault model in which each node is assumed to be incident with two or more fault-free links, we show that an n-dimensional star network can tolerate up to 2n - 7 link faults, and be strongly (fault-free) Hamiltonian laceable, where n >= 4. In other words, we can embed a fault-free linear array of length n! - 1 (n! - 2) in an n-dimensional star network with up to 2n - 7 link faults. if the two end nodes belong to different partite sets (the same partite set). The result is optimal with respect to the number of link faults tolerated. It is already known that under the random fault model, an n-dimensional star network can tolerate up to n - 3 faulty links and be strongly Hamiltonian laceable, for n >= 3. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
