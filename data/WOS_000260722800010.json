Grid computing is one of several emerging networked computing paradigms promising to meet the requirements of heterogeneous, large-scale, and distributed data mining applications. Despite this promise, there are still too many issues to be resolved before grid technology is commonly applied to large-scale data mining tasks. To address some of these issues, the authors developed the DataMiningGrid system. It integrates a diverse set of programs and application scenarios within a single framework, and features scalability, flexible extensibility, sophisticated support for relevant standards and different users.", "paper_title": "Digging Deep into the Data Mine with DataMiningGrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000260722800010"}
