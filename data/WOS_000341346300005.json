To design these studies, the use of the expected Fisher information matrix (M-F) is a good alternative to clinical trial simulation. Presently, M-F in NLMEM is mostly evaluated with first-order linearisation. The adequacy of this approximation is, however, influenced by model nonlinearity. Alternatives for the evaluation of M-F without linearisation are proposed, based on Gaussian quadratures. The M-F, expressed as the expectation of the derivatives of the log-likelihood, can be obtained by stochastic integration. The likelihood for each simulated vector of observations is approximated by Gaussian quadrature centred at 0 (standard quadrature) or at the simulated random effects (adaptive quadrature). These approaches have been implemented in R. Their relevance was compared with clinical trial simulation and linearisation, using dose-response models, with various nonlinearity levels and different number of doses per patient. When the nonlinearity was mild, three approaches based on M-F gave correct predictions of standard errors, when compared with the simulation. When the nonlinearity increased, linearisation correctly predicted standard errors of fixed effects, but over-predicted, with sparse designs, standard errors of some variability terms. Meanwhile, quadrature approaches gave correct predictions of standard errors overall, but standard Gaussian quadrature was very time-consuming when there were more than two random effects. To conclude, adaptive Gaussian quadrature is a relevant alternative for the evaluation of M-F for models with stronger nonlinearity, while being more computationally efficient than standard quadrature.
