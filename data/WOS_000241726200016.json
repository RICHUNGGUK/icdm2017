We propose a framework for measuring the invalidity of XML documents and compactly representing minimal repairing scenarios. Furthermore, we present a validity-sensitive method of querying XML documents, which extracts more information from invalid XML documents than does the standard query evaluation. Finally, we provide experimental results which validate our approach.", "paper_title": "Validity-sensitive querying of XML databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200016"}
