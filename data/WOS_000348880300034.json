By the new approach proposed in this paper, the image points of the SOR cross sections are fitted under the two geometric constraints which are derived from the configuration characteristics of SOR. It is demonstrated by comparison with other previous methods that our method can fit the elliptical projections of SOR cross sections more accurately and robustly. In this paper, we also describe the applications of the algorithm in Euclidean reconstruction of SOR and pose estimation for SOR-shaped object, such as spacecraft. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
