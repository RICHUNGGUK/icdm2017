Ten males performed a sub-maximal gripping task (no grip, 5% and 10% of maximum) while a perturbation forced wrist flexion or extension. Wrist joint angles and activity from 11 muscles were used to determine forearm co-contraction and muscle contributions to wrist joint stiffness. Co-contraction increased in all pairs as grip force increased (from no grip to 10% grip), corresponding to a 36% increase in overall wrist joint stiffness. Inclusion of individual muscle contributions to wrist joint stiffness enhanced the understanding of forearm co-contraction. The extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and brevis had the largest stiffness contributions (34.5 +/- 1.3% and 20.5 +/- 2.3%, respectively), yet muscle pairs including ECRL produced the lowest co-contraction. The muscles contributing most to wrist stiffness were consistent across conditions (ECRL for extensors; Flexor Digitorum Superficialis for flexors), suggesting enhanced contributions rather than muscular redistribution. This work provides investigation of the neuromuscular response to wrist perturbations and gripping demands by considering both co-contraction and muscle contributions to joint stiffness. Individual muscle stiffness contributions can be used to enhance the understanding of forearm muscle control during complex tasks.", "paper_title": "Neuromechanical control of the forearm muscles during gripping with sudden flexion and extension wrist perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000349447600011"}
