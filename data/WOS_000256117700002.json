This has raised questions about the security of data in the servers. Firms outsourcing their XML databases to untrusted parties started to look for new ways to securely store data and efficiently query them. In this paper, encrypted XML documents, their crypto index structures and query processing using these structures are investigated. A comparison of various algorithms in the literature is given.", "paper_title": "A survey on querying encrypted XML documents for databases as a service", "paper_id": "WOS:000256117700002"}
