Then we focus on IP address autoconfiguration, identifying the specific requirements for community mesh networks and analysing the applicability of existing solutions. As a result of that analysis, we select PACMAN, an efficient distributed address autoconfiguration mechanism originally designed for ad-hoc networks. and we perform an experimental study - using off-the-shelf routers and assuming worst-case scenarios - analysing its behaviour as an IP address autoconfiguration mechanism for community wireless mesh networks The results of the conducted assessment show that PACMAN meets all the identified requirements of the community scenario (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Building an IP-based community wireless mesh network: Assessment of PACMAN as an IP address autoconfiguration protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000274944300010"}
