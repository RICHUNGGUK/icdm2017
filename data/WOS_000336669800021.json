The Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter, which aims to recursively propagate the intensity associated with the multi-target posterior density, can overcome the difficulty caused by the data association. This paper develops a multi-target visual tracking system that combines the GM-PHD filter with object detection. First, a new birth intensity estimation algorithm based on entropy distribution and coverage rate is proposed to automatically and accurately track the newborn targets in a noisy video. Then, a robust game-theoretical mutual occlusion handling algorithm with an improved spatial color appearance model is proposed to effectively track the targets in mutual occlusion. The spatial color appearance model is improved by incorporating interferences of other targets within the occlusion region. Finally, the experiments conducted on publicly available videos demonstrate the good performance of the proposed visual tracking system.", "paper_title": "GM-PHD-Based Multi-Target Visual Tracking Using Entropy Distribution and Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800021"}
