The nonlinear mapping is determined concurrently along with the codebook vectors. The adaptation rule for codebook positions in the projection space minimizes a cost function that favors the trustworthy preservation of the local topology. The proposed visualization method, called OVI-NG, is an enhancement over curvilinear component analysis (CCA). The results show that the mapping quality obtained with OVI-NG outperforms the original CCA, in terms of the trustworthiness, continuity, topographic function and topology preservation measures.
