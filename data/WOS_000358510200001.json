This type of isolated unknown nodes cannot directly communicate with enough beacons in their neighborhoods, which makes localizations for them disabled or the localization error unbearable. To this end, a multihops fitting localization approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, some intermediate nodes between beacons and unknown nodes are set as routers to construct paths via a greedy method; then, the multihop paths are approximately fitted into straight lines; finally, the positions of unknown nodes can be estimated by trilateration. The proposed algorithm is analyzed and simulated in terms of localization error and error variance, and the results are proven preferable.", "paper_title": "Multihops Fitting Approach for Node Localization in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358510200001"}
