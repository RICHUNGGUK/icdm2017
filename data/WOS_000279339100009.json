The main issue is how to add a set of edges with the smallest possible cardinality so that the resulting graph is 2-edge-connected, i.e., bridge-connected, while maintaining the original partition constraint. To solve the problem, we propose a simple linear-time algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the most efficient sequential algorithm runs in O(n(m+n log n) log n) time. However, we show that it can also run in 0(log n) parallel time on an EREW PRAM using a linear number of processors, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph. If a simple graph exists, our main algorithm ensures that it is as simple as possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
