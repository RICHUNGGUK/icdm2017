It presents a retrospective review of solving the code profiling problem, which reduces essentially to the frequency analysis of the sequential program code execution (SPCE). A new approach to solving this problem is proposed. It is based on the Monte Carlo method, which makes it possible to assess the number of program runs required for the estimation of the frequency of execution of its commands with a given accuracy.", "paper_title": "On frequency analysis of sequential program code execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000290942300003"}
