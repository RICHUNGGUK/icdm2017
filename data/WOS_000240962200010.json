As the fundamental principles to guide the developing direction of Internet, the study of Internet architecture is always a focus in the research community. To address the core issue of network scalability, we propose multi-dimension scalable architecture of next-generation Internet, the main idea of which is to extend the single-dimension scalability of traditional Internet on interconnection to multi-dimension scalability of next-generation Internet. The multi-dimension scalability is composed of scale-scalability, p erformance-scalability, security-scalability, function-scalability, and service-scalability. We suggest five elements, namely, IPv6, authentic IPv6 addressing, scalable processing capacity of routers, end-to-end connectionless Quality-of-Service control, and 4over6 mechanism to realize the multi-dimension scalability. The current research results show that the multi-dimension scalable architecture composed of these five elements will bring great influence on next-generation Internet.", "paper_title": "Research on next-generation Internet architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000240962200010"}
