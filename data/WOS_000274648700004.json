Design/methodology/approach - Literature research, internal consistency and reliability computed with Cronbach's Alpha (a), Factor Analyses with Varimax rotation, and item response theory form the approach to examining the subject. Findings - Four scales were found within a 46-item survey on information-seeking behaviour: a ten-item scale for applying search strategies (alpha = 0.68), a 14-item scale for evaluating information (alpha = 0.74), a six-item scale for referring to information (alpha = 0.81) and a 12-itern scale for regulation activities when seeking information (alpha = 0.75). Originality/value - The four scales for information-seeking behaviour can be used to monitor and evaluate this behaviour of students in higher education.", "paper_title": "Developing scales for information-seeking behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000274648700004"}
