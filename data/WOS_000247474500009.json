The techniques determine, for any given conflict tolerance c, the smallest ensemble that allows one to store any n-node data structure \"of type X\" in such a way that no more than c nodes of a structure are stored on the same module. This goal is achieved by determining the smallest c-perfect universal graphs for data structures \"of type X.\" Such a graph is the smallest graph that contains a homomorphic image of each n-node structure \"of type X,\" with each node of the image holding <= c nodes of the structure. In the current paper,\"type X\" refers to rooted binary trees and three array-like structures: chaotic arrays, ragged arrays, and rectangular arrays. For each of these families of data structures, the number of memory modules needed to achieve conflict tolerance c is determined to within constant factors.", "paper_title": "Bounded-collision memory-mapping schemes for data structures with applications to parallel memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000247474500009"}
