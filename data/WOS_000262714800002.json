In addition to the abundant video content, the social web provides rich sets of context information associated with web videos, such as thumbnail image, time duration and so on. At the same time, the popularity of Web 2.0 demands for timely response to user queries. To balance the speed and accuracy aspects, in this paper, we combine the contextual information from time duration, number of views, and thumbnail images with the content analysis derived from color and local points to achieve real-time near-duplicate elimination. The results of 24 popular queries retrieved from You Tube show that the proposed approach integrating content and context can reach real-time novelty re-ranking of web videos with extremely high efficiency, where the majority of duplicates can be rapidly detected and removed from the top rankings. The speedup of the proposed approach can reach 164 times faster than the effective hierarchical method proposed in [31], with just a slight loss of performance.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Near-Duplicate Elimination for Web Video Search With Content and Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000262714800002"}
