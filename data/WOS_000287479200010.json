The problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is proposed to handle economic environmental dispatch of fixed head hydrothermal power systems as a true multiobjective optimization problem with competing and noncommensurable objectives. Numerical results of two test systems demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. Results obtained from the proposed approach have been compared with those obtained from strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2, multiobjective differential evolution and previously obtained results.
