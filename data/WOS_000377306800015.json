The proposed algorithm iteratively updates the phases of the phase-shifters in the RF precoder (or RF combiner) to minimize the weighted sum of squared residuals between the optimal full-baseband design and the hybrid design, and is guaranteed to converge to at least a local optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed iterative design can achieve almost the same performance as the optimal full-baseband design, in spite of using a much smaller number of RF chains.", "paper_title": "An Iterative Hybrid Transceiver Design Algorithm for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800015"}
