Mixed delays include discrete time-varying delays and unbounded distributed delays. By establishing a simple Lyapunov function, using impulsive differential inequality techniques and LMI techniques, some new sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of stationary oscillation of interval FCNNs. The obtained results can be checked easily by the LMI control toolbox in MATLAB. Moreover, the results obtained in this paper are useful in the application and design of FCNNs, since the sufficient criteria are simple and easy to check in practice. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.", "paper_title": "Stationary oscillation of interval fuzzy cellular neural networks with mixed delays under impulsive perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000319769300039"}
