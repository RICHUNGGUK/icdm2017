In this paper, we investigate the construction and existence of splitting t-designs t-(v, u x k, 1) splitting designs and, show that there exists a 3-(v, 3 x 2, 1) splitting design if and only if v =2 (mod 8). As its application, we obtain a new infinite class of optimal 2-fold secure splitting authentication codes.", "paper_title": "A new class of splitting 3-designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290806300006"}
