In this article we study the performance of supporting telemedicine traffic in a CRN. We first introduce an infrastructure-based CRN for telemedicine, where cognitive base stations sense available spectrum and forward data for associated healthcare stations. We then present strategies and performance for supporting urgent and real-time periodic telemonitoring traffic in the network. Our results show that satisfactory real-time performance can be achieved for telemedicine traffic.", "paper_title": "PROVIDING TELEMEDICINE SERVICES IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE-BASED COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000274816900016"}
