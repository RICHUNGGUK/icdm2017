Many researchers have discussed about an improvement of performance of a background model, and a reduction of memory usage or computational cost. To adapt to background changes, a background model has been enhanced by introducing various information including a spatial consistency, a temporal tendency, etc. with a large memory allocation. Meanwhile, an approach to reduce a memory cost cannot provide better accuracy of a background subtraction. To tackle the trade-off problem, this paper proposes a novel framework named \"case-based background modeling\". The characteristics of the proposed method are (1) a background model is created, or removed when necessary, (2) case-by-case model sharing by some of the pixels, (3) pixel features are divided into two groups, one for model selection and the other for modeling. These approaches realize a low-cost and high accurate background model. The memory usage and the computational cost could be reduced by half of a traditional method and the accuracy was superior to the method.", "paper_title": "Case-based background modeling: associative background database towards low-cost and high-performance change detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000337091200003"}
