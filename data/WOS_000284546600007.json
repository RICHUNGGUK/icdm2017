They guide not only the pure judgement about a new artefact but also the generation itself, as creators constantly evaluate their own work. This paper proposes a model for automatic story generation based on the evaluation of stories. A model of how quality in stories is evaluated is presented, and two possible implementations of the generation guided by this evaluation are shown: exhaustive space exploration and constrained exploration. A theoretical model and its implementation are explained and validation of the evaluation function through comparison with human criteria is described.", "paper_title": "The Role of Evaluation-Driven Rejection in the Successful Exploration of a Conceptual Space of Stories", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546600007"}
