The framework consists of three functional blocks (monitoring, optimization and implementation) to make the outbound traffic engineering adaptive to network condition changes such as inter-domain traffic demand variation, inter-domain routing changes and link failures. The objective is to keep the inter-domain link utilization balanced under any of these changes while reducing service disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better load balancing with less service disruptions and re-configuration overheads in comparison to alternative approaches.", "paper_title": "An integrated network management framework for inter-domain outbound traffic engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000242560000021"}
