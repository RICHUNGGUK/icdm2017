In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-player tracking system. The tracking system takes the detection responses of a human detector as inputs. To realize real-time player detection, we generate a spatial proposal to minimize the scanning scope of the detector. The tracking system utilizes the discriminative appearance models trained using the online Boosting method to reduce data-association ambiguity caused by the appearance similarity of the players. We also propose to build an online learned player recognition model which can be embedded in the tracking system to approach online player recognition and labeling in tracking applications for long-shot scenes by two stages. At the first stage, to build the model, we utilize the fast k-means clustering method instead of classic k-means clustering to build and update a visual word vocabulary in an efficient online manner, using the informative descriptors extracted from the training samples drawn at each time step of multi-player tracking. The first stage finishes when the vocabulary is ready. At the second stage, given the obtained visual word vocabulary, an incremental vector quantization strategy is used to recognize and label each tracked player. We also perform importance recognition validation to avoid mistakenly recognizing an outlier, namely, people we do not need to recognize, as a player. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the long-shot video clips of a real soccer game video demonstrate that, the proposed player recognition model performs much better than some state-of-the-art online learned models, and our tracking system also performs quite effectively even under very complicated situations.", "paper_title": "Online Learned Player Recognition Model Based Soccer Player Tracking and Labeling for Long-Shot Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553700012"}
