This paper presents an architectural solution to design a quadrature band-pass Sigma Delta modulator in presence of interference signals. These interferences are rejected by using the built-in signal transfer function (STF) filtering action inside the quadrature modulator. The implementation of the STF filtering is achieved by means of feed-forward paths and does not require any additional active blocks. Simulations at the behavioral level on different design examples verify the architecture implementation and the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Interference rejection in quadrature band-pass Sigma Delta modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400010"}
