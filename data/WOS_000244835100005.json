We show how to find instances of the parameters that satisfy a given property and instances that either maximize or minimize the probability of reaching a certain state. As an application, we model a probabilistic non-repudiation protocol with a PPTS. The theory we develop allows us to find instances that maximize the probability that the protocol ends in a fair state (no participant has an advantage over the others).", "paper_title": "Parametric probabilistic transition systems for system design and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000244835100005"}
