Mass customization is one of the key technologies in PLM to provide tailored product to end customers with the cost of mass production. Characterized by short production lead-time and dynamic customer requirements with low batch size and high variety, tooling product families are facing the challenge of high production cost. New technology with modular feature-based design to manufacturing collaboration to satisfy the needs of mass production with low cost in tooling industry is developed in this study. A corresponding prototype system is demonstrated to show the efficiency of the technology developed.", "paper_title": "Mass production of tooling product families via modular feature-based design to manufacturing collaboration in PLM", "paper_id": "WOS:000248171700013"}
