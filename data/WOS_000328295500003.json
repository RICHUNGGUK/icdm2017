Here we review the basic theory, special techniques, and potential applications of transformation optics in waveguide design. Three major design strategies of transformation optics and their limitations in waveguide applications are discussed. The recent new trends of transformation techniques by imposing specific restrictions from materials are emphasized for practical implementation. Plasmonic waveguide is used as an example to compare these transformation strategies. Applications beyond waveguides but with great practical value such as super-resolution hyperlens design are also discussed in the context of waveguiding phenomena from the perspective of transformation optics.", "paper_title": "Waveguide design and application with transformation optics", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500003"}
