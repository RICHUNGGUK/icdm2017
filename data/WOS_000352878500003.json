Currently available IP protection solutions are usually limited to protect single FPGA configurations and require permanent secret key storage in the FPGA. In addition, they cannot provide a commercially popular pay-per-device licensing solution. In this paper, we propose a novel IP protection mechanism to restrict IP's execution only on specific FPGA devices in order to efficiently protect IPs from being cloned, copied, or used with unauthorized integration. This mechanism can also enforce the pay-per-device licensing, which enables the system developers to purchase IPs from the core vendors at the low price based on usage instead of paying the expensive unlimited IP license fees. In our proposed binding-based mechanism, FPGA vendors embed into each enrolled FPGA device with a physical unclonable function (PUF) customized for FPGAs; IP vendors embed augmented finite-state machines (FSM) into the original IPs such that the FSM can be activated by the PUF responses from the FPGA device. We propose protocols to lock and unlock FPGA IPs, demonstrate how PUF can be embedded onto FPGA devices, and analyze the security vulnerabilities of our PUF-FSM binding method. We implement a 128-bit delay-based PUF on 28-nm FPGAs with only 258 RAM-lookup tables and 256 flipflops. The PUF responses are unique and reliable against environment changes. We also synthesize a variety of FSM benchmark circuits. On large benchmarks, the average timing overhead is 0.64% and power overhead in 0.01%.", "paper_title": "A PUF-FSM Binding Scheme for FPGA IP Protection and Pay-Per-Device Licensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000352878500003"}
