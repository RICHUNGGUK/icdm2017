In this paper, one of the most promising of such approaches, known as probabilistic relational model (PRM), has been investigated and extended in order to measure and include semantic relationships for addressing web page classification problems. Experimental results show the potential of the proposed method of capturing the \"strength\" of existing relationships (links) and the capacity of including this information into the probability model.", "paper_title": "WEB PAGE CLASSIFICATION THROUGH PROBABILISTIC RELATIONAL MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000322395100005"}
