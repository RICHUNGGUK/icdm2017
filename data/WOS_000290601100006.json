A novel robust sliding mode controller based on Euler parameters and Lagrange-like model is proposed to solve this problem in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. This controller can guarantee globally fast reachability of target spacecraft attitude trajectory by using a globally fast sliding mode model, which combines the advantages of linear-hyperplane-based sliding mode control and terminal sliding mode control and then provides globally fast convergence of attitude tracking errors. The convergence and stability of the closed loop system are proven theoretically. Numerical simulation is finally presented to validate the analysis.", "paper_title": "ROBUST SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR GLOBALLY FAST ATTITUDE TRACKING OF TARGET SPACECRAFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100006"}
