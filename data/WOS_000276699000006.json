The front-end is composed of a single-to-differential low-noise amplifier (LNA), using high-Q differential transformers and inductors and a coupled switching mixer stage. The mixer transconductor and LNA share the same DC current. Measurements of performance show a conversion gain of 28.5 dB, noise figure of 6.6 dB, 1 dB compression point of -32.8 dBm and IIP3 of -23.3 dBm at a 250 kHz intermediate frequency, while dissipating 1.45 mA from a 1.2 V supply.
