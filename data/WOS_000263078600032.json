The system architecture which is proposed in this paper consists of two parts, the learning and the detection part of road sign images. The proposed system has the standard architecture with adaboost algorithm. Adaboost is a popular algorithm which used to detect an object in real time. To improve the detection rate of adaboost algorithm, this paper proposes a new combination method of classifiers in every stage. In the case of detecting road signs in real environment, it can be ambiguous to decide to which class input images belong. To overcome this problem, we propose a method that applies fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral which use the importance and the evaluated values of classifiers within one stage. It is called fuzzy-boosting in this paper. Also, to improve the speed of a road sign detection algorithm using adaboost at the detection step, we propose a method which chooses several candidates by using MC generator. In this paper, as the sub-windows of chosen candidates pass classifiers which are made from fuzzy-boosting, we decide whether a road sign is detected or not. Using experiment result, we analyze and compare the detection speed and the classification error rate of the proposed algorithm applied to various environment and condition.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Road Sign Detection Using Fuzzy-Boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600032"}
