Sequence motifs in proteins are some subsequences which appear frequently. Motifs often denote important functional regions in proteins and can be used to characterize a protein family or discover the function of proteins. The SP-index algorithm was proposed to find sequence motifs containing gaps of arbitrary size. To find motifs, it constructs B-trees for indexing the occurring positions of short segments. Then, to check whether a long pattern composed of short segments appears frequently, the SP-index algorithm needs to test a large number of nodes of those B-trees, which may not be efficient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Bit-Pattern-based (BP) algorithm to improve the efficiency of the SP-index algorithm. First, the BP algorithm transforms the protein sequences into bit patterns. Then, instead of testing a large number of nodes in the SP-index algorithm, the BP algorithm utilizes bit operations, i.e., AND, OR, shifting and masking, to efficiently find sequence motifs. The BP algorithm also performs a pruning step to reduce the processing time. From the experimental results on biological and synthetic data sets, we show that the BP algorithm needs shorter processing time than the SP-index algorithm.", "paper_title": "MINING SEQUENCE MOTIFS FROM PROTEIN DATABASES BASED ON A BIT PATTERN APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400010"}
