It is proven that, in the presence of an infinite set of actions, bisimulation equivalence has no finite, sound, ground-complete equational axiomatization over that language. This negative result applies even if the syntax is extended with an arbitrary collection of auxiliary operators, and motivates the study of axiomatizations using conditional equations. In the presence of an infinite set of actions, it is shown that, in general, bisimulation equivalence has no finite, sound, ground-complete axiornatization consisting of conditional equations over BCCSP. Sufficient conditions on the priority structure over actions are identified that lead to a finite, ground-complete axioniatization of bisimulation equivalence using conditional equations.", "paper_title": "On the axiomatizability of priority", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900041"}
