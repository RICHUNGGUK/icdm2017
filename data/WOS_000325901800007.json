This paper proposes a formal approach for modeling detailed design knowledge for effective reuse. An extended structure-behavior-function model is developed for representing the structural, behavioral, and functional information in various life cycle periods of a detailed design. Based on the extended structure-behavior-function model, an issue-and solution-based approach is then developed to model the detailed knowledge of a mechanical design. The proposed approach is implemented in a detailed design knowledge modeling system, with a fixture design knowledge modeling as a brief example.", "paper_title": "Modeling detailed design knowledge with the extended structure-behavior-function model", "paper_id": "WOS:000325901800007"}
