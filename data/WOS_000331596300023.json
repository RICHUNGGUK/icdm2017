The iteration begins with initial estimation of the projection of the prescribed test point. For each iteration, we construct a biarc that locally approximates a segment on the original curve starting from the current projective point. Then we compute the projective point for the next iteration, as well as the parameter corresponding to it, by projecting the test point onto this biarc. The iterative process terminates when the projective point satisfies the required precision. Examples demonstrate that our algorithm converges faster and is less dependent on the choice of the initial value compared to the traditional geometric iteration algorithms based on single-point approximation.
