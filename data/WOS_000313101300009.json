This study proposes a novel three-stage nonlinear ensemble model. In the proposed model, three different types of neural-network based models, i.e. Elman network, generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and wavelet neural network (WNN) are constructed by three non-overlapping training sets and are further optimized by improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). Finally, a neural-network-based nonlinear meta-model is generated by learning three neural-network based models through support vector machines (SVM) neural network. The superiority of the proposed approach lies in its flexibility to account for potentially complex nonlinear relationships. Three daily stock indices time series are used for validating the forecasting model. Empirical results suggest the ensemble ANNs-PSO-GA approach can significantly improve the prediction performance over other individual models and linear combination models listed in this study.", "paper_title": "Ensemble ANNs-PSO-GA Approach for Day-ahead Stock E-exchange Prices Forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000313101300009"}
