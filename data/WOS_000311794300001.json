However, this new environment could bring irretrievable losses to the clients due to a lack of integrity verification mechanism for distributed data outsourcing. To support scalable service and data migration, in this paper we address the construction of a collaborative integrity verification mechanism in hybrid clouds where we consider the existence of multiple cloud service providers to collaboratively store and maintain the clients' data. We propose a collaborative provable data possession scheme adopting the techniques of homomorphic verifiable responses and hash index hierarchy. In addition, we articulate the performance optimization mechanisms for our scheme and prove the security of our scheme based on multi-prover zero-knowledge proof system, which can satisfy the properties of completeness, knowledge soundness, and zero-knowledge. Our experiments also show that our proposed solution only incurs a small constant amount of communications overhead.", "paper_title": "SECURE COLLABORATIVE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION FOR HYBRID CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311794300001"}
