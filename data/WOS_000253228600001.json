The article constructs several hypotheses based on the transaction-cost and resource-dependence approaches and tests these hypotheses by data from these suppliers. Our study showed. (1) U.S. firms were more EDI-integrated with their customers, while Japanese firms adopted more EDI with their suppliers; (2) the resource-dependence approach seemed more effective in explaining EDI adoption, while the transaction-cost approach seemed more effective in explaining EDI integration; (3) the transaction-cost approach seemed more suited to the U.S. context, while the resource-dependence approach seemed more suited to the Japanese context; (4) EDI adoption had a positive impact on EDI performance in the U.S., suggesting the higher validity of our framework in the U.S.", "paper_title": "Determinants of EDI adoption and integration by US and Japanese automobile suppliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000253228600001"}
