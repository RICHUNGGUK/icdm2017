R&D projects constitute the building blocks of the innovation process, hence the importance of searching for funding for these projects. As ontologies and semantic technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable means to represent and aggregate knowledge from different sources. The present work explores the use of ontologies to model R&D grant funding calls and the application of semantic technologies to the development of an enhanced funding management system. Our experiments confirm the success of the proposed approach, and reveal that it may bring considerable benefits to R&D funding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
