The motor is based on an electrostatic film motor composed of two thin plastic films containing fine pitch three-phase electrodes, which face each other across a short gap. The motor requires three-phase high voltages on the electrodes in both films to obtain thrust force. Our proposal in this paper is to utilize piezoelectric transducers to realize the high voltage on one of the films: the slider film, by using the transducers as inductive elements that resonate with the electrostatic motor. We describe specific design method of the piezoelectric transducers for this application, and analyze the influences of their properties on the performance of the motor. A working prototype was constructed with piezoelectric length-extensional bars as the transducers. The prototype demonstrated a maximum thrust force of 0.24 N with 500 Vo-p three-phase excitation. When driven at high voltages, we observed a step-like motion caused by a non-linear behavior of the piezoelectrics, i.e., the jump resonance. The observation indicates a problem in optimal design of the piezoelectric transducers for this specific application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
