However, nowadays data is being produced in streaming fashion and distributed locations, turning most classical methods obsolete. This thesis addresses two different clustering problems in ubiquitous and streaming scenarios, presenting evidence of the advantages produced by applying distributed and streaming machine learning algorithms, and proposing new ones to solve the addressed problems.", "paper_title": "Learning from ubiquitous data streams: Clustering data and data sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000301371300005"}
