The theory postulates that in practical dialogues every transaction has a component in the obligations and the common ground planes of expression, and contributions made by dialogue acts making a \"charge\" in the transaction should be \"balanced\" by contributions making the corresponding \"credit\", and a complete transaction is balanced in both of these planes. In addition, transactions have a structure which constraints strongly the realization of dialogue acts. A dialogue act tagging methodology based on the theory is also presented, The theory and its related methodology have been applied to the analysis of a multimodal corpus in a design task, and the figures of the agreement reached in the preliminary experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Balancing transactions in practical dialogues", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700035"}
