We employ a continuous optical frequency sweeper at the optical line terminal (OLT) and an interferometric (IF) device at each optical network unit (ONU). By analyzing the spectrum of the returned combined signals at the OLT, we can obtain the status of all branches. This detection method not only uses a small optical frequency band for surveillance monitoring, but is also simple to operate. Furthermore, a modified architecture is proposed to relax the specifications of IF devices. The tolerance of the IF device length was analyzed using the Monte-Carlo simulation method.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of fault-branch detection in TDM passive optical networks by spectral analysis of interferometric signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000281986700007"}
