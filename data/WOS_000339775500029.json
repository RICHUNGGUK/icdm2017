A new overlapping domain technique is proposed that couples spectral and finite elements. This technique aims to efficiently capture the pressure jump and deformation rates of thin solids moving in a fluid. The solid object is fully embedded in a finite element fluid mesh and the coupling interface is situated in the fluid domain. The technique is particularly suited for simulation of cardiovascular fluid structure interaction problems, such as flow through heart valves. In this paper the overlapping domain technique will be explained and several numerical benchmarks will be presented to test the fluid fluid coupling between spectral and finite elements. The results obtained demonstrate that the technique is accurate and stable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
