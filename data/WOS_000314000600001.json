It is shown that the problem is solvable under the assumption of weak regularizability, a newly introduced concept that can be viewed as a generalization of the regularizability of square systems. Necessary conditions of solvability for the problem of pole assignment are established. It is also shown that sufficient conditions can be derived in some special cases. Some conclusions and prospects for further studies are drawn in the last section.", "paper_title": "WEAK REGULARIZABILITY AND POLE ASSIGNMENT FOR NON-SQUARE LINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000314000600001"}
