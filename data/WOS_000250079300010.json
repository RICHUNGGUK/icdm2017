In this paper, we analyze whether preferences embedded in such models are actually reflected in the behavior of negotiators and negotiation outcomes. Empirical results indicate that elements of negotiator behavior, like initial offers or the extent of concessions made during the negotiation, closely correspond to individual preferences. The same holds for the structure of the compromise. In contrast, the impact of negotiator preferences on reaching an agreement or the efficiency of the compromise is rather weak.
