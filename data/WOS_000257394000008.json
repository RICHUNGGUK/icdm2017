By the criterions, we classify signature models into 5 basic types and 69 general classes. Theoretically, 21141 kinds of signature models can be derived by appropriately combining different general classes. The result comprises almost existing signature models. It will be helpful for exploring new signature models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time for investigation of the problem of classification of signature-only signature models.", "paper_title": "Classification of signature-only signature models", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000008"}
