In fact, we consider the modular computation of Grobner bases (resp. standard bases) and the modular computation of the associated primes of a zero-dimensional ideal and describe their parallel implementation in SINGULAR. Our modular algorithms for solving problems over Q mainly consist of three parts: solving the problem modulo p for several primes p, lifting the result to Q by applying the Chinese remainder algorithm (resp. rational reconstruction), and verification. Arnold proved using the Hilbert function that the verification part in the modular algorithm for computing Grobner bases can be simplified for homogeneous ideals (cf. Arnold, 2003). The idea of the proof could easily be adapted to the local case, i.e. for local orderings and not necessarily homogeneous ideals, using the Hilbert-Samuel function (cf. Pfister, 2007). In this paper we prove the corresponding theorem for non-homogeneous ideals in the case of a global ordering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
