Some conceptual data models, being the tool of design databases, have been proposed. Information in real world application is often vague or ambiguous. Currently few researches have been done in modeling fuzziness in conceptual data model and design of fuzzy databases. In this paper, based on fuzzy set theory, different levels of fuzziness are introduced into the EER (enhanced/extended entity-relationship) model and the corresponding representations are given. The EER model is then extended to fuzzy EER model. The formal mapping of the fuzzy EER model into the fuzzy relational database schema is proposed in the paper.", "paper_title": "Modeling fuzzy information in fuzzy extended entity-relationship model and fuzzy relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424500027"}
