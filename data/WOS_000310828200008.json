This paper presents a convenient methodology based on harmonic fields, to construct volumetric finite element mesh integrated with complete orthotropic material. The basic idea is taking advantage of the fact that the longitudinal axis direction indicated by the shape configuration of most bone tissues is compatible with the trajectory of the maximum material stiffness. First, surface harmonic fields of the longitudinal axis direction for individual bone models were generated, whose scalar distribution pattern tends to conform very well to the object shape. The scalar iso-contours were extracted and sampled adaptively to construct volumetric meshes of high quality. Following, the surface harmonic fields were expanded over the whole volumetric domain to create longitudinal and radial volumetric harmonic fields, from which the gradient vector fields were calculated and employed as the orthotropic principal axes vector fields. Contrastive finite element analyses demonstrated that elastic orthotropy has significant effect on simulating stresses and strains, including the value as well as distribution pattern, which underlines the relevance of our orthotropic modeling scheme.
