ISSVR is based on the e-insensitive smooth support vector regression (epsilon-SSVR), a smoothing strategy for solving epsilon-SVR, and incremental reduced support vector machine (RSVM). The ISSVR incrementally selects representative samples from the given dataset as support vectors. We show that TS fuzzy modeling is equivalent to the ISSVR problem under certain assumptions. A TS fuzzy system can be generated from the given training data based on the ISSVR learning with each fuzzy rule given by a support vector. Compared with other fuzzy modeling methods, more forms of membership functions can be used in our model, and the number of fuzzy rules of our model is much smaller. The performance of our model is illustrated by extensive experiments and comparisons. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
