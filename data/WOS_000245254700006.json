Much less has been done regarding the modeling of the patterns of arrival of IP packets. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether the ON-OFF packet-level model is an adequate model. As shown in this paper, at the aggregate level the answer is yes, to great accuracy. Further, it compares favorably to other models such as modulated Poisson arrivals. At the IP-flow level, the ON-OFF model is not adequate; rather, an active-inactive model is appropriate. The reason is that the rate in the ON state greatly varies from an ON period to the other. We further argue experimentally that it is only necessary to consider a small number of hosts and host pairs to account for the impact on a queuing system and on the long-term variability of the traffic. The starting point of the approach is to analyze and model traffic along the dimensions of packet size and packet inter-arrival processes. The method is applied to well-known and publicly available traces from the ITA and NLANR repositories, as well as traces of traffic captured in our institution premises. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
