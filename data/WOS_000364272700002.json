The recorded gestures were analyzed according to multiple gesture features. We found (1) pen and index finger gestures were different in features like size ratio but similar in features like angle difference; (2) implement (pen vs. index finger vs. thumb) interacted with gesture complexity and size in features like articulation time; (3) features like time and shape distance, were different between the pen and index finger on mobile devices (walking) but similar on stationary devices; (4) one-handed thumb gestures had worse performances than index finger gestures by time and accuracy in sitting but similar performances in walking; and (5) for the three implements, gesture drawing time and accuracy on mobile devices reduced from sitting to walking condition. We discuss these findings with implications for future gesture design and research.", "paper_title": "Differences and Similarities between Finger and Pen Stroke Gestures on Stationary and Mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000364272700002"}
