Pharmacophore analysis indicates that the best inhibitor model consists of (1) two hydrogen bond acceptors, (2) one hydrogen bond donor, and (3) one hydrophobic feature. The HypoRefine pharmacophore model gave an enrichment factor of 1.31 and goodness of fit score of 0.76. Docking studies were carried out to explore the structural requirements for the CDK2-cyclin A inhibitors and to construct highly predictive models for the design of new inhibitors. Docking studies demonstrate the important role of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions in determining the inhibitor-receptor binding affinity. The validated pharmacophore model is further used for retrieving the most active hits/lead from a virtual library of molecules. Subsequently, docking studies were performed on the hits, and novel series of potent leads were suggested based on the interaction energy between CDK2-cyclin A and the putative inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Virtual screening studies to design potent CDK2-cyclin A inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000248192200024"}
