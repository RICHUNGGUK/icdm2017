There are three kinds of security criteria for the key distilled by privacy amplification: the normalized divergence criterion, which is also known as the weak security criterion, the variational distance criterion, and the divergence criterion, which is also known as the strong security criterion. As a technique to distill a secret key, it is known that the encoder of a Slepian-Wolf (the source coding with full side-information at the decoder) code can be used as a function for privacy amplification if we employ the weak security criterion. In this paper, we show that the encoder of a Slepian-Wolf code cannot be used as a function for privacy amplification if we employ the criteria other than the weak one.", "paper_title": "Strongly Secure Privacy Amplification Cannot Be Obtained by Encoder of Slepian-Wolf Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245600008"}
