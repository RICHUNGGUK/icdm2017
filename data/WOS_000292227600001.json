In this paper, we propose a novel automatic generation algorithm of social network data - the Biclustering Algorithm for Social Network Data algorithm. The algorithm introduces biclustering to social network analysis for automatic identification of associations among a group of actors and entities. The algorithm is different from existing ones in that it employs a combination of min-max and pattern searching procedures to construct hierarchical biclusters and discover the relationships among these actors, in order to easily interpret social network data. The algorithm is not subject to convexity limitations, and does not need to use derivatives information. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
