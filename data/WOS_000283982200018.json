The test floor had a resolution of 9 x 16. The shape, size, and magnitude of the patterns are used for classification. A test including 650 events and ten people yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%.", "paper_title": "Detection of Falls Among the Elderly by a Floor Sensor Using the Electric Near Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000283982200018"}
