A comprehensive model is first developed in this paper to cover these features for a class of NCS nonlinear systems. This model has removed some limitations of similar models in the published literature. Then, the Lyapunov functional and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) are applied to develop two new stability conditions (Theorems 1 and 2). These conditions and an algorithm are used to design a controller to achieve robust mean square stability of the system. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the application of the modeling and the controller design method developed.", "paper_title": "T-S Fuzzy Model-Based Robust Stabilization for Networked Control Systems With Probabilistic Sensor and Actuator Failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317000012"}
