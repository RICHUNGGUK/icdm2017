They are used as semantic models in different engineering contexts ranging from ultramodern satellite designs to industrial system-on-chip manufacturing. Different approximation algorithms have been proposed for model checking of IMCs, with. time bounded reachability probabilities playing a pivotal role. This paper addresses the accuracy and efficiency of approximating time bounded reachability probabilities in IMCs, improving over the state-of-the-art in both efficiency of computation and tightness of approximation. Moreover, a stable numerical approach, which provides an effective framework for implementation of the theory, is proposed. Experimental evidence demonstrates the efficiency of the new approach.
