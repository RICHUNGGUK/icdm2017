Although multi-view constraints are provided by this setup, it still exhibits great challenges to robustly reconstruct dynamic human performances due to inherent complexity and self-occlusion of human motion. In the insight that the semantics of human motion will supply strong prior in motion reconstruction, we therefore propose a SCAPE-based motion reconstruction algorithm. As the building blocks of this main algorithm, we (1) re-train a SCAPE model based on an expanded human pose database containing human poses collected from different databases to enlarge the tracking space, (2) develop a correspondence estimation method based on articulated ICP to improve the robustness of SCAPE tracking. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show that our system is able to capture and reconstruct accurate human motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
