The system takes as input a hand-drawn sketch and generates a surface whose silhouette approximately matches the input sketch. The input sketch typically consists of a set of curves connected at their endpoints, forming T-junctions and cusps. Our system is able to identify the skewed-mirror and translational symmetry between the hand-drawn curves and uses this information to reconstruct the occluded parts of the surface and its 3D shape.", "paper_title": "Sketching of Mirror-Symmetric Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294556000010"}
