Applying an evolutionary algorithm for solving such an optimization problem reveals the effect of audible convergence, when iterations of the optimization process, which represent sub-optimal melody lines, are combined to a musical piece. An example is provided to evaluate the algorithm, and to point out differences, when different musical genres, represented by different interval distance classification schemes, are applied.", "paper_title": "Audible convergence for optimal base melody extension with statistical genre-specific interval distance evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900068"}
