Cartographers emphasize the need to standardize any raw count data by an area-based total before displaying the data in a choropleth map. The standardization process converts the raw data from an absolute measure into a relative measure. However, there is recognition that the standardizing process does not enable the map reader to distinguish between low-low and high-high numerator/denominator differences. This research uses concentration-based classification schemes using Lorenz curves to address some of these issues. A test data set of nonwhite birth rate by county in North Carolina is used to demonstrate how this approach differs from traditional mean-variance-based systems such as the Jenks' optimal classification scheme.", "paper_title": "A concentration-based approach to data classification for choropleth mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000361190600007"}
