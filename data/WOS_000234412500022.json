This correspondence presents an algorithm for counting the number of cycles of length g, g + 2, and g + 4 incident upon every vertex in U boolean OR W. The proposed cycle counting algorithm consists of integer matrix operations and its complexity grows as O(gn(3)) where n. = max(vertical bar U vertical bar, vertical bar W vertical bar).", "paper_title": "An algorithm for counting short cycles in bipartite graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000234412500022"}
