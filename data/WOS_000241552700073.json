Most of them provide a good solution, while the amount of missing and noisy data is within an acceptable ratio. Focussing on this problem, we propose to use an incremenal multiresolution scheme, with classical factorization techniques. Information recovered following a coarse-to-fine strategy is used for both, filling in the missing entries of the input matrix and denoising original data. An evaluation study, by using two different factorization techniques-the Alternation and the Damped Newton-is presented for both synthetic data and real video sequences.(1)", "paper_title": "An iterative multiresolution scheme for SFM", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700073"}
