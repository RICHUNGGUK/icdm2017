Extending the results, of [Smith, Renes. and Smolin, Physical Review Letters. 100: 170,502] pertaining to BB84. we improve the best-known lower bound on the error rate for the 6-state protocol From 14.11% for local randomization alone to at, least 14.59%. Additionally, we also study the effects of iterating the combined preprocessing scheme and find further improvements to the BB84 protocol already at. small block lengths.", "paper_title": "Improved one-way rates for BB84 and 6-state protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000258699300006"}
