Cumulating inputs and outputs over the time periods provide an unnecessary compensating impact, making the efficiency appraisal unrealistic. To avoid this negative impact of data accumulation, a two-stage approach on the basis of Chebyshev inequality bounds is proposed to find interval efficiency of decision making units (henceforth DMUs). The proposed method is applied in a real case encompassing 115 bank branches over 6 periods of time. This application indicated the significant cautious approach of the proposed method in multi-period data envelopment analysis (hereafter DEA). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
