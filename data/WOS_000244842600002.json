The different models of the scheme to be estimated are obtained from a set of different discretizations of a continuous-time unknown transfer function under a fractional order hold of correcting gain (beta-FROH) which leads to distinct associate discrete-time models for the given continuous-time plant. The objective is to design a scheme being able to find the most appropriate value for the gain beta to enhance the identification and tracking performances. The scheme chooses online the value of beta with the best reference tracking performance by implementing eventually switches through time among a prefixed set of values characterizing the discrete models of the plant in a parallel multiestimation scheme. The switching rule is subjected to a minimum residence time in order to guarantee the closed loop stability. Simulations for two different practical cases, a controlled DC motor and a resonant circuit, are presented.", "paper_title": "Multimodel discrete control with online updating of the fractional order hold gains", "paper_id": "WOS:000244842600002"}
