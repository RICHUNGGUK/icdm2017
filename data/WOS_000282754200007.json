Turkey has a great renewable energy potential with its natural resources such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind. Selection among energy alternatives is a multicriteria decision-making problem with conflicting and interactive criteria. In this paper, the best energy alternative of Turkey is determined by taking into interactions among criteria by using Choquet integral methodology.", "paper_title": "Renewable Energy System Selection Based On Computing With Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754200007"}
