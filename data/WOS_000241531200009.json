Quantifying an effect can be achieved by estimating the difference in center of location between a treated and a control sample. In unpaired experiments, a shift in scale is also of interest. Non-normal data distributions can thereby impose a serious challenge for obtaining accurate confidence intervals for treatment effects. To study the effects of non-normality we analyzed robust and non-robust measures of treatment effects: differences of averages, medians, standard deviations, and normalized median absolute deviations in case of unpaired experiments, and average of differences and median of differences in case of paired experiments. A Monte Carlo study using bivariate lognormal distributions was carried out to evaluate coverage performances and lengths of four types of nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals, namely normal, Student's t, percentile, and BCa for the estimated measures. The robust measures produced smaller coverage errors than their non-robust counterparts. On the other hand, the robust versions gave average confidence interval lengths approximately 1.5 times larger. In unpaired experiments, BCa confidence intervals performed best, while in paired experiments, Student's t was as good as BCa intervals. Monte Carlo results are discussed and recommendations on data sizes are presented. In an application to physiological source-sink manipulation experiments with sunflower, we quantify the effect of an increased or decreased source-sink ratio on the percentage of unfilled grains and the dry mass of a grain. In an application to laboratory experiments with wastewater, we quantify the disinfection effect of predatory microorganisms. The presented bootstrap method to compare two samples is broadly applicable to measured or modeled data from the entire range of environmental research and beyond. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
