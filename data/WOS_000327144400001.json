An important goal of this workshop was to identify challenges related to the development and evaluation of computational models of affective processes. These challenges were approached from a psychological and a computational modeling perspective. In this introduction we present a summary of the results of this week- long workshop. In addition to that, we are proud to present an invited contribution that proposes solutions to several of these challenges.", "paper_title": "Challenges in Computational Modeling of Affective Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000327144400001"}
