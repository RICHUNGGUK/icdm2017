We show that the traffic state estimation plays an important role in traffic prediction and control. Two approaches are presented for the estimation of the main traffic variables (traffic density and mean speed). The state constructors obtained are then used for traffic flow control. Several numerical simulations show very promising results for both traffic state estimation and control.", "paper_title": "Macroscopic Traffic Flow Control via State Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367473800002"}
