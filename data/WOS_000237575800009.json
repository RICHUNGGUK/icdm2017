In this, paper we show that a plane graph G has an inner rectangular drawing D if and only if a new bipartite graph constructed from G has a perfect matching. We also show that D can be found in time O(n(1.5)/log n) if G has n vertices and a sketch of the outer face is prescribed, that is, all the convex outer vertices and concave ones are prescribed.", "paper_title": "Inner rectangular drawings of plane graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237575800009"}
