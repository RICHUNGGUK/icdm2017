Optimal minimum-compliance structures are subject to the limit of a predetermined amount o fmaterial in traditional calculation methods, and often fail to meet practical stress and displacement constraints, or become unnecessarily strong. Without displacement sensitivities, the AVC algorithm iteratively adjusts allowable material usage basedon the difference between the acutal displacement, and the allowable displacement limit. In this way, topology optimization can efficiently construct a minimum-compliance structure that meets the allowable displacement limit. The regular volume constraint algorithm (RVC), which slightly changes the volume constraint each time at the end of FVC, is also executed in order to demonstrate the advantages of the AVC algorithm. The effectiveness of the AVC algorithm is demonstrated by two illustrative 2-D design problems: a cantilever beam and a simple beam. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
