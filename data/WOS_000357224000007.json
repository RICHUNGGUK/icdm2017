It is assumed that a set of corridors defining a rough a priori geometric configuration is provided by the planners. The proposed algorithm consists of fine tuning the location of single alignments within each corridor. This is achieved by means of a bicriteria methodology that generates sets of non-dominated paths. These alignments are then combined to form a metro network by solving a bicriteria integer linear program. Extensive computational experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed methodology.
