In line with this, they need to have almost two special abilities: firstly, to have a lot of earlier experiences with sports training and secondly, to know the capability of their athletes very well. New ways in planning sports training have emerged with development of pervasive and mobile technologies. Recently, a GPS receiver is one of the most useful parts of each standard sports watch that enables athletes to track the duration of their sports activities and analyze them later on digital computers using GPS viewers. Most sport's watches are also capable of measuring an athlete's heart rate during activities. Both measures represent reliable data sources that can be used for planning the sports trainings by coaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel intelligent planning method for sports training sessions, where the training plans are generated on digital computers using the bat algorithm according to reliable data obtained from sports watches. Real-world experiments showed promising results that encouraged us to proceed with this research also in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
