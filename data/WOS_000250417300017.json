We present an approximation algorithm for this problem and show that it achieves a factor of 8/3 for general graphs and a factor of 2 for bipartite graphs. Moreover, we discuss the relationships of the edge dominating set problem and the vertex cover problem. The results show that improving the approximation factor beyond 8/3 using our approach of adding valid inequalities to a natural linear programming relaxation is as hard as improving the approximation factor for vertex cover beyond 2.
