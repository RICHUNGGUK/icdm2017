In order to improve classification accuracy of SVM, this paper hybridizes chaotic search and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) with SVM and presents a new chaos embedded GSA-SVM (CGSA-SVM) hybrid system. In this system, input feature subsets and the SVM parameters are optimized simultaneously, while GSA is used to optimize the parameters of SVM and chaotic search is embedded in the searching iterations of GSA to optimize the feature subsets. Fourteen UCI datasets are employed to calculate the classification accuracy rate in order to evaluate the developed CGSA-SVM approach. The developed approach is compared with grid search and some other hybrid systems such as GA-SVM, PSO-SVM and GSA-SVM. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy and efficiency compared with well-known similar classifier systems.", "paper_title": "A chaos embedded GSA-SVM hybrid system for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000351364300021"}
