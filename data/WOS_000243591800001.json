Both methods use an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine attribute weights a priori. The first method uses a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The second method incorporates a fuzzy-based logic that uses linguistic variable representation, fuzzy operation, and fuzzy defuzzification. The TOPSIS uses deterministic performance ratings and attribute weights, whilst the fuzzy-based is a linguistic method. An applied case study drawn from existing literature is used to demonstrate and test findings. The proposed methods systematically evaluate alternative scenarios, with the result indicating promise for solving an operator allocation decision problem. (c) 2006 IMACS.
