In this article, we propose a novel approach to virtual camera control, which builds upon camera control and player modelling to provide the user with an adaptive point-of-view. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to model the player's preferences on virtual camera movements and we employ the resulting models to tailor the viewpoint movements to the player type and her game-play style. Ultimately, the methodology is applied to a 3D platform game and is evaluated through a controlled experiment; the results suggest that the resulting adaptive cinematographic experience is favoured by some player types and it can generate a positive impact on the game performance.", "paper_title": "Adapting virtual camera behaviour through player modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000352779000002"}
