The first part addresses system design problems for spreading and plowing operations. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of optimization models and solution methodologies for the design of systems for snow disposal operations. These problems include partitioning a region or road network into sectors, locating snow disposal sites, allocating sectors to snow disposal sites, and allocating sectors to private companies or governmental agencies. The two last parts of the survey mainly concentrate on vehicle routing for winter road maintenance. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
