The SWE are important for the study of the dynamics of large-scale flows. as well for the development of new numerical schemes that are applied to more complex models. In this paper we present a finite difference p-adaptive method based oil high order finite differences that is applied using an error indicator for solving the SWE on the sphere. A standard test set is used to evaluate the accuracy of the new method. The results obtained are compared with the pseudo-spectral method. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
