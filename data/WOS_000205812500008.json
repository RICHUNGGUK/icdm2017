Skeleton programming is a high level method for specifying the parallel structure of a program. We describe a full-fledged application of domain decomposition to a three-dimensional flow simulation problem and we express its parallel coordination code with skeleton programming in the purely functional setting of OCamlP31. We detail the OCamlP31 skeletons (including the new parfun and pardo), their typing, informal semantics, and definition as stream processors. To summarize, functional programming and skeleton programming appear to be an efficient and convenient framework to develop such parallel numerical applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
