By using absolute variograms on a validated number of component scores, it is possible to make a combined multivariate chemometrics-variogram characterization of heterogeneous processes and materials as well as 1-D transects, no longer restricted to a one-variable-at-a-time framework. The usefulness and information on variographic modeling based on scores are illustrated. A new test for randomness of a variogram is presented. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
