A recently proposed band-limited DPD scheme uses a band-limited modeling technique to eliminate the bandwidth constraints and reduce DPD implementation cost. However, time consuming convolution operations are involved for model extraction in this time domain data based band-limited modeling method. In this article, band-limited model extraction is formulated as a generalized least squares problem and investigated from a frequency domain perspective. A frequency domain data based model extraction method is proposed, which greatly reduces the computational complexity for extracting band-limited DPD model parameters. A 10 W GaN HEMT inverse class-F PA excited by a 20 MHz four-carrier WCDMA signal and a 40 MHz two-carrier LTE signal is tested to validate the method. Experimental results show that the computationally efficient frequency domain data based model extraction method for band-limited DPD provides as good linearization performance as the time domain data based method.
