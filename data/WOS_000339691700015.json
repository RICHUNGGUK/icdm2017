We derive and empirically validate measures of quality for both derivatives and difference estimates. Using these measures, we quantify the accuracy of derivatives and differences in terms of the noise level of the function. An interesting observation based on these results is that the derivative of a function is not likely to have working precision accuracy for functions with modest levels of noise.
