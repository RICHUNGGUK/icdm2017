Adaptation of the quantizer to the signal variance is performed for each particular frame. Each frame is classified as high or low correlated, based on the value of the correlation coefficient, then the selection of the appropriate predictor coefficient and bitrate is performed. Low correlated frames are encoded with a higher bitrate, while high correlated frames are encoded with a lower bitrate without the objectionable loss in quality. Theoretical model and experimental results are provided for the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "DPCM with Forward Gain-Adaptive Quantizer and Simple Switched Predictor for High Quality Speech Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000284782700015"}
