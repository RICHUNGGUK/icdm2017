However, the existing state of the art multisignatures often suffers from the following problems: impractical key setup assumptions, loose security reductions and inefficient signature verification. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive multisignature scheme with tight security reduction in the random oracle model. Our proposed multisignatures address the above three problems by achieving: provable security in the plain public key model; tight security reduction under the standard Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption and O(1) computational time for signature verification through pre-computation. Hence, our non-interactive multisignatures are of great use in routing authentication of networks.", "paper_title": "Tightly Secure Non-Interactive Multisignatures in the Plain Public Key Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000309638100007"}
