It is required to find a minmax regret solution, which minimizes the worst-case loss in the objective function. Averbakh and Berman had an O(mn(2)log n)-time algorithm for the problem on a general graph, and had an O(nlog(2)n)-time algorithm on a tree. In this paper, we improve these two bounds to O(mn(2)+n(3)log n) and O(nlog n), respectively.", "paper_title": "Improved algorithms for the minmax regret 1-median problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300008"}
