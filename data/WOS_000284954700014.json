In particular, we are using controlled stimuli to reverse engineer the networks of ideas and concepts in order to answer the following questions. (1) Are the networks of ideas and concepts in the human brain invoked by verbal and visual stimuli distinct from each other? The answer appears to be no for the network of ideas and inconclusive for the network of concepts. (2) What is the topology of these networks? Our experimental results show that both are small-world networks, with the network of ideas being random and the network of concepts scale-free.", "paper_title": "Networks of Concepts and Ideas", "paper_id": "WOS:000284954700014"}
