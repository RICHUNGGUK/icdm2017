Graphical and computer executable models of people competences and behaviours are created which are qualitatively and quantitatively matched to equivalent models of process networks, decomposed into roles and dependencies between roles. To enable model creation and reuse, coherent sets of role, competence and dynamic producer unit (DPU) modelling concepts have been defined and instrumented using enterprise modelling (EM), simulation modelling (SM) and causal loop modelling (CLM) techniques. This paper reports on an application of the modelling approach to create related models of 'process oriented roles' and 'candidate human systems' so as to systemise matching of role requirements to resource systems attributes and to inform aspects of strategic and tactical decision making in an SME making composite bearings.", "paper_title": "Integrated approach to modelling human systems as reuseable components of manufacturing workplaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000274977900001"}
