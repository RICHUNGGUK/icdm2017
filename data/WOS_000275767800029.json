However, cheaters can easily counterfeit a fake stego-image in Lin and Tsai's scheme. In order to overcome this problem, Yang et al. proposed an improved scheme to prevent the users from making a fake stego-image. While Yang et als scheme embeds just one pixel of secret image into each block, it doesnt meet the property of high-capacity. Furthermore, the modular number in their scheme is 28 rather than a prime number. Thus, the secret image cannot be successfully reconstructed from t stego-images in their scheme. In this paper, we will propose an improved scheme which can not only embed t pixels of secret image into each block but also the reconstructed secret image can be established. Moreover, we apply the Data Signature Algorithm (DSA) for cheater identification.", "paper_title": "IMAGE SHARING WITH STEGANOGRAPHY AND CHEATER IDENTIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800029"}
