Tile model firstly applies fuzzy subjection. degree functions of the observed information to establish the posterior probabilities of the prior assumptions in Bayesian optimal classifier, the classified results based on. each fault information are then worked out, tile best diagnostic result is acquired after all these results are weighted average. At the Same time, according to probabilistic rough model of Bayesian risk decision, the diagnostic results are identified to constitute possible maintenance strategies. In the end, a practical application in transformer insulation faults diagnosis shows that tile proposed model can tackle the \"bottle neck\" of fuzzy information acquisition in Bayesian optimal classifier and possesses stronger self-learning abilities, and is an ideal deterministic model.", "paper_title": "An ensemble deterministic model based on rough set and fuzzy set and Bayesian optimal classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000248669500016"}
