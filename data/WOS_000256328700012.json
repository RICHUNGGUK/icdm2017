Firstly, the fingerprint image is captured and performed noise canceling by a binary low-pass filter. Secondly, the displacement of the fingerprint pattern is estimated by means of directional image matching, and then circular profile features of the fingerprint are extracted for verification matching. Finally, the proposed method is implemented in an 8-bits microcontroller run at 25MHz, equipped only with 12 Kbytes program code memory and 35 Kbytes data memory. It is very favorable for prototyping the low-cost fingerprint verification SoC (System-On-Chip).", "paper_title": "A low complexity fingerprint verification algorithm with reduced hardware resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000256328700012"}
