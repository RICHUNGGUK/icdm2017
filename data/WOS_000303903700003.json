Problem RNV was introduced and studied very recently by Crochemore et al. [Maxime Crochemore, Costas S. Iliopoulos, M. Sohel Rahman, Finding patterns in given intervals, in: Antonin Kucera, Ludek Kucera (Eds.), MFCS, 22 in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4708, Springer, 2007, pp. 645-656]. In this paper, we present improved algorithms for problem RNV and algorithms for extended versions of the RNV problem. We also show how this problem can be used to achieve optimal query time for a number of interesting variants of the classic pattern matching problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
