Identified problems with paper diaries include suboptimal compliance and questionable data validity and quality. The effects of an electronic data recording system, Advoy, on data quality, patient adherence, and satisfaction were examined. An exploratory approach was used to examine the sequential use of paper diaries and e-diaries by 38 patients. Data were obtained from paper records for the 6 months preceding the introduction of the electronic record and from the first 6 months of use of Advoy. Completion of mandatory and additional treatment details was also compared. More mandatory information (27.57%) was recorded with the e-diary. As well, the amount of completed additional fields nearly doubled (19.9%-36.5%). Patients tended to complete a greater variety of additional fields with the e-diary than with paper records. Finally, a higher percentage of survey respondents (29.4%) indicated that they were \"very satisfied\" with Advoy compared with paper records (6.7%). Most survey respondents (94.4%) had a previous experience with electronic programs. The use of the e-diary significantly improved patient adherence in recording mandatory treatment information; the increase in additional data provided by the patients was also found to be an added benefit of this technology.", "paper_title": "Recording Practices and Satisfaction of Hemophiliac Patients Using Two Different Data Entry Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271605400004"}
