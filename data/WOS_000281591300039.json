The input structure of the ANN was determined based on an analysis of the discretized form of the kinematic wave equations, and the physical parameters were obtained through a back calculation of the weights and biases of the ANN. Two cases were considered; using ANNs trained on datasets derived from: (1) effective rain of entire events and (2) total rain of wet portion of events only. For Case (1), the parameters Delta t and alpha (= root S/n) were determined with excellent accuracy. For Case (2), in addition to Delta t and alpha, the constant loss rate Phi, was also determined with excellent accuracy. Further, the use of total rain of entire events (a common practice in ANN applications in rainfall-runoff modeling) was also investigated, and it was found that the results from this analysis are less realistic compared to those of Case (2).
