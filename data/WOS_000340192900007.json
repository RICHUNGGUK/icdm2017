Conventional DEA evaluates the performance of each DMU using a set of most favourable weights. As a result, traditional DEA models can be considered methods for the analysis of the best relative efficiency or analysis of the optimistic efficiency. DEA efficient DMUs obtained from conventional DEA models create an efficient production frontier. Traditional DEA can be used to identify units with good performance in the most desirable scenarios. There is a similar approach that evaluates the performance indicators of each DMU using a set of most unfavourable weights. Accordingly, such models can be considered models for analysing the worst relative efficiency or pessimistic efficiency. This approach uses the inefficient production frontier for determining the worst relative efficiency that can be assigned to each DMU. DMUs lying on the inefficient production frontier are referred to as DEA inefficient while those neither on the efficient frontier nor on the inefficient frontier are declared DEA inefficient. It can be argued that both relative efficiencies should be considered simultaneously and any approach with only one of them would be biased. This paper proposed the integration of both efficiencies as an interval so that the overall performance score would belong to this interval. It was shown that efficiency interval provided more information than either of the two efficiencies, which was illustrated using two numerical examples.", "paper_title": "DEA efficiency analysis: A DEA approach with double frontiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900007"}
