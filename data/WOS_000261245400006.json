Let x = (x(1), ..., x(m)) is an element of G(m). Gao's theorem states that there is a reordering (x(j1), ..., x(jm)) of x such that Sigma(1 <= i <= n) x(ji) = 0. Let w = (x(1), ..., w(m)) is an element of Z(m). As it corollary of the main result, we show that there are reorderings (x(j1), ..., x(jm)) of x and (w(k1), ..., w(km)) of w, such that Sigma(1 <= i <= n) w(ki)x(kj) = (Sigma(1 <= i <= n) w(ki))x(j1), where x(j1) is the most repeated value in x. For w = (1, ..., 1). this result reduces to Gan's theorem.", "paper_title": "A Weighted Generalization of Gao's n plus D-1 Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000261245400006"}
