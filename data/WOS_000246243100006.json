The derivation involves a local Taylor expansion of the convection-diffusion equation. The numerical model used was originally designed to simulate the dispersion of pollutants in the open sea and has now been reconfigured to simulate the dispersion of the thermal outflow of some power plants which may be constructed in Huelva estuary in the near future. Numerical results obtained are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
