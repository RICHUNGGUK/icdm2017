By employing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, applying the theory of Kronecker product of matrices and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, several delay-dependent sufficient conditions in LMI form are obtained for global exponential synchronization of such systems. Moreover, the decay rate is estimated. The proposed LMI approach has the advantage of considering the difference of neuronal excitatory and inhibitory efforts, which is also computationally efficient as it can be solved numerically using efficient Matlab LMI toolbox, and no tuning of parameters is required. in addition, the proposed results generalize and improve the earlier publications. An example with simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
