Strains can cause excessive angular distortion. This results in a welded product that does not meet acceptable tolerances. The geometry of the weld bead (height and width) depends on the input parameters (speed, voltage and current), and provides the welded joint with strength and quality. As welded products become increasingly complex, deformations become more difficult to predict as they depend greatly on the welding sequence. This paper shows how a combination of the Finite Element Method, Genetic Algorithms and Regression Trees may be used to design and optimize complex welded products. Initially, Artificial Neural Networks and Regression Trees that are based on heuristic methods and evolutionary algorithms were used in predicting the weld bead geometry according to the input parameters. Then, thermo-mechanical Finite Element models were created to obtain the temperature field and the angular distortion using the weld bead geometry that the best predictive models generated. Finally, optimization techniques that are based on Genetic Algorithms were used to validate these Finite Element models against experimental results, and to subsequently find the optimal welding sequence to use in the manufacture of complex welded products.", "paper_title": "Combining soft computing techniques and the finite element method to design and optimize complex welded products", "paper_id": "WOS:000351737700004"}
