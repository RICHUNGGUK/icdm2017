This survey addresses methodologies for 3D mesh video facial expression recognition. Recognition is, actually, a special case of intra-class retrieval. The approaches are analyzed and compared in detail. They are primarily categorized according to the 3D dynamic face analysis technique used. In addition, currently available datasets, used for 3D video facial expression analysis, are presented. Finally, future challenges that can be addressed in order for 3D video facial expression recognition field to be further improved, are extensively discussed.", "paper_title": "A survey on facial expression recognition in 3D video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100010"}
