In this paper we model cache cooperation under a game theoretical framework and show how cache cooperation policy can allow the system to converge to a Pareto optimal configuration. Our work shows how cooperation impacts network caching performance and how it takes advantage of the structural properties of the underlying network.", "paper_title": "Cooperation Policies for Efficient In-Network Caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900083"}
