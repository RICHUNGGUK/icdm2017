They both have the: same equidifferent form, which composes a weighting vector of nonnegative arithmetic progression and zeros. This equidifferent OWA weighting vector generating method can also be seen as an improved solution method for the minimum variance and minimax dispersion problems respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
