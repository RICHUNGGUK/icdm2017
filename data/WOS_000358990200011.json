The framework has the following novel features. First, the resource management system is distributed using resource content information that is characterized by system properties. We argue that a distributed system based on resource content is sufficient to satisfy specific scheduling requests for global Quality of Service (QoS) considering workload balance across a grid. Second, the distributed system constructs a hierarchical peer-to-peer network. This peered network provides an efficient message routing mechanism. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is proficient to satisfy QoS in distributed environment.", "paper_title": "An efficient peer-to-peer and distributed scheduling for cloud and grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358990200011"}
