Networks in discrete time can directly provide algorithms for efficient implementation in digital hardware. Continuous attractors of neural networks have been used to store and manipulate continuous stimuli for animals. A continuous attractor is defined as a connected set of stable equilibrium points. It forms a lower dimensional manifold in the original state space. Under some conditions, the complete analytical expressions for the continuous attractors of discrete-time linear recurrent neural networks as well as discrete-time linear-threshold recurrent neural networks are derived. Examples are employed to illustrate the theory.", "paper_title": "Continuous attractors of discrete-time recurrent neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100010"}
