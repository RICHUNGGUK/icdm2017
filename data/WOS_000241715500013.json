We suggest TRIDENT, a procedure whose main goal is to dynamically provide the bandwidth required to transport through an ASON the MPLS-LSPs already established at the IP/MPLS client network. TRIDENT relies on automatically triggering demands to set up or tear down the ASON switched connections, and it is based on monitoring and predicting the offered traffic at the interfaces between the IP (MPLS) and the ASON layers. TRIDENT allows providing automatic Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) and it counteracts potential congestion at the client network. Its merits are evaluated by simulation results and it has also been experimentally tested. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
