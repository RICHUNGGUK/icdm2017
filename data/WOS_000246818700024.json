However, they suffer from two main shortcomings - the memory required for storing intermediate data and the long latency of computing wavelet coefficients. This work presents a new block-based architecture for computing lifting-based 2-D DWT coefficients. This architecture yields a significantly lower buffer size. Additionally, the latency is reduced from N-2 down to 3N as compared to the line-based architectures. The proposed architecture supports the JPEG2000 default filters and has been realized in ARM-based ALTERA EPXA10 Development Board at a frequency of 44.33 MHz.", "paper_title": "A block-based architecture for lifting scheme discrete wavelet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000246818700024"}
