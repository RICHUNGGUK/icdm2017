For example, Cross-ISA system-mode emulation helps computer architects and OS developers trace and debug kernel execution-flow efficiently by emulating a slower platform (such as ARM) on a more powerful platform (such as an x86 machine). Cross-ISA system-mode emulation also enables workload consolidation in data centers with platforms of different instruction-set architectures (ISAs). However, system-mode emulation is much slower. One major overhead in system-mode emulation is the multi-level memory address translation that maps guest virtual address to host physical address. Shadow page tables (SPT) have been used to reduce such overheads, but primarily for same-ISA virtualization. In this paper we propose a novel approach called embedded shadow page tables (ESPT). EPST embeds a shadow page table into the address space of a cross-ISA dynamic binary translation (DBT) and uses hardware memory management unit in the CPU to translate memory addresses, instead of software translation in a current DBT emulator like QEMU. We also use the larger address space on modern 64-bit CPUs to accommodate our DBT emulator so that it will not interfere with the guest operating system. We incorporate our new scheme into QEMU, a popular, retargetable cross-ISA system emulator. SPEC CINT2006 benchmark results indicate that our technique achieves an average speedup of 1.51 times in system mode when emulating ARM on x86, and a 1.59 times speedup for emulating IA32 on x86_64.", "paper_title": "Efficient Memory Virtualization for Cross-ISA System Mode Emulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344456400013"}
