Firstly two hybrid resolution methods in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic are proposed by combining alpha-lock resolution with generalized deleting strategy and alpha-linear resolution. alpha-Lock resolution for first-order linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic LV(nx2)F(X) is equivalently transformed into that for propositional logic LnP(X) which reduce much the complexity of the resolution procedure. Then the compatibilities of alpha-lock resolution with generalized deleting strategy and alpha-linear resolution are discussed. We finally contrive an algorithm for alpha-linear semi-lock resolution and some examples are provided to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithm. This work provides effective support for automated reasoning scheme in linguistic truth-valued logic based on lattice-valued algebra with the aim at establishing formal tools for symbolic natural language processing.", "paper_title": "On compatibilities of alpha-lock resolution method in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000301479400011"}
