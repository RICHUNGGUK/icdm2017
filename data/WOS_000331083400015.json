Recently increasing use of resources from the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud has been made to annotate text documents thanks to the network of machine-understandable, interlinked data. While existing approaches to semantic annotation in the LOD context have been proven to be well performing with the English language, many other languages in general and the Korean language in particular are still underrepresented. We investigate the applicability of existing semantic annotation approaches to the Korean language by adapting two popular approaches in the semantic annotation field and evaluating those approaches on an English-Korean bilingual sense-tagged corpus. Further, general challenges in internationalization of annotation approaches are summarized.", "paper_title": "Annotating korean text documents with linked data resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000331083400015"}
