Conventional approaches based on manual qualitative evaluations (e. g., artifacts inspection) are deficient in the sense that (i) they are time-consuming, (ii) they usually suffer from the authority constraints, and (iii) they are often subjective. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel semi-automated approach to software process evaluation using machine learning techniques. In this study, we mainly focus on the procedure aspect of software processes, and formulate the problem as a sequence (with additional information, e. g., time, roles, etc.) classification task, which is solved by applying machine learning algorithms. Based on the framework, we define a new quantitative indicator to evaluate the execution of a software process more objectively. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to evaluate the execution of a defect management (DM) process in nine real industrial software projects. Our empirical results show that our approach is effective and promising in providing a more objective and quantitative measurement for the DM process evaluation task. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to compare our proposed machine learning approach with an existing conventional approach (i. e., artifacts inspection). Finally, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches in detail.", "paper_title": "Software process evaluation: a machine learning framework with application to defect management process", "paper_id": "WOS:000343910700001"}
