It identifies situations in the journey's three phases, pre-, on- and post-trip that have the potential to change travel patterns and also transport choices that the individual makes in order to perform activities in their daily life. Requirements on a traveler information system were derived from these situations and choices. The identified requirements are then transferred into functionalities in a travel information system that has potentials to encourage decisions that could lead to lower energy usage. Nine traveler information systems for multimodal and public transport travel are systematically investigated to find out if they include the proposed functionality. The investigated systems are in operation primarily in Sweden, Germany, the UK and one has global coverage. The investigation results in a discussion about future opportunities with proposal to encourage sustainability oriented travel decisions in the next generation travel information system.
