Recently, spotty byte errors called s-spotty byte errors are newly defined as t or fewer bits errors in a byte having length b bits, where 1 <= t < b. This paper proposes another type of spotty byte errors, i.e., m-spotty byte errors, where more than t bits errors in a byte may occur due to hit by high energetic particles. For these errors, this paper presents generalized m-spotty byte error control codes with minimum m-spotty distance d.", "paper_title": "A general class of m-spotty byte error control codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400018"}
