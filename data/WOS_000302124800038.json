Modern routers use general purpose programmable processors, and the software used for packet processing on these systems is potentially vulnerable to remote exploits. We describe a specific attack that can launch a devastating denial-of-service attack by sending just a single packet. We also show that there are effective defense techniques, based on processor monitoring, that can help in detecting and avoiding such attacks.", "paper_title": "Roto-Rooting your Router: Solution against New Potential DoS Attacks on Modern Routers", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800038"}
