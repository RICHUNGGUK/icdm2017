The Voronoi diagram for graphs (VDG) offers an efficient way to cluster the members of a network based on their distance to a subset of input nodes. We study the distance-based decomposition of the human erythrocyte interactome provided by VDG, seeking to elucidate the influence of sickle cell anemia on the function of the erythrocyte proteins. We also provide an efficient open-source Java package that computes VDG. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
