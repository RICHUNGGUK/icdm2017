This work is based on a custom built embedded Java Virtual Machine (JVM) simulator specifically designed for embedded JVM modeling and embodies domain specific details such as thread scheduling, algorithms used for native CLDC APIs and runtime data structures optimized for use in embedded systems. The results presented include dynamic execution characteristics, dynamic bytecode instruction mix, application and API workload distribution, Object allocation statistics, instruction-set coverage, memory usage statistics and method code and stack frame characteristics.", "paper_title": "Architecture Independent Characterization of Embedded Java Workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000207924700008"}
