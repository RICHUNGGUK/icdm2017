V, the neighbors of v are consecutive in W. We describe both a sequential and a BSP/CGM algorithm to find a maximum independent set in a convex bipartite graph. The sequential algorithm improves over the running time of the previously known algorithm and the BSP/CGM algorithm is a parallel version of the sequential one. The complexity of the algorithms does not depend on |W|.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set in Convex Bipartite Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262308900003"}
