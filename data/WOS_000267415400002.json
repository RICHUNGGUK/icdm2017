The proposed model can transform an imbalanced classification problem into a set of symmetrical two-class problems, each of which is solved by single neural network with a simple structure. The results of all neural networks are then combined by averaging or GA method to form a final classification decision. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the time consumption for training and improves the classification performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
