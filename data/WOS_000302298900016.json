The optimal extension can vary depending on experimental and technical conditions. Improper extension of sequence tags can obscure or mislead the interpretation of NGS results. We present an algorithm, ArchTEx (Architectural Tag Extender), which identifies the optimal extension of sequence tags based on the maximum correlation between forward and reverse tags and extracts and visualizes sites of interest using the predicted extension.", "paper_title": "ArchTEx: accurate extraction and visualization of next-generation sequence data", "paper_id": "WOS:000302298900016"}
