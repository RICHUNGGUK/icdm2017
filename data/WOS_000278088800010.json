The simulations show that four different system states, i.e. zero state (no dynamic vehicle chooses route A), periodic oscillation state (mean velocity on route A is in periodic oscillations), alternation state (alternation of zero state and oscillation state), and equal velocity state (mean velocities on the two routes are equal), are identified. Complex nonlinear changing behavior of critical vehicle arrival probability lambda(c) depending on bottleneck length and location as well as dynamic vehicle ratio is revealed. Our work is expected to be useful for designing Advanced Traveller Information Systems.", "paper_title": "INFLUENCE OF TRAFFIC BOTTLENECK ON TWO-ROUTE SCENARIO WITH MEAN VELOCITY INFORMATION FEEDBACK", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088800010"}
