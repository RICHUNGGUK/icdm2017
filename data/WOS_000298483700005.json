In this paper, by using a 'double-ring' concept to describe M2M non-isotropic scattering environments, we propose new deterministic and stochastic sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) based simulation models. The proposed simulation models extensively consider the distributions of the angle of arrival (AoA) and the angle of departure (AoD), and thus provide a good approximation to the desired statistical properties of the reference model.
