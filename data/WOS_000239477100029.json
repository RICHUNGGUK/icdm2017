At first knowledge about individual learners was used to produce adaptive educational hypermedia. Then, the deployment of web based learning management systems put the need to exchange learner data between systems in the forefront. Nowadays, specifications for describing learner information in a standardized way are being developed. So far most existing systems have processed learner data. Yet the processed data are neither the same nor are they used for the same purposes, even if they are data about the learners. We argue that it is time to bridge the gap between the many sets of data about a learner processed within different learning environments. We propose a set of categories for describing learner information that goes beyond IMS LIP and could bring a link with ITS learner models.", "paper_title": "From learner information packages to student models: Which continuum?", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100029"}
