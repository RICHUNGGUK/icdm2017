The interaction between the [Au-3] cluster and L (C6F6, Ag+) was analyzed. Grimme's dispersion correction is used for those functionals. Weak pi-interactions (Au-C6F6) were found to be the main contribution short-range stability in the models; while in the models with Ag+, an ionic interaction is obtained. The absorption spectra of these models at the PBE level agree with the experimental spectra.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study on electronic spectra and interaction in [Au-3]-L-[Au-3] (L = C6F6,Ag+) complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000318274700006"}
