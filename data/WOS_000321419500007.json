The theoretical formulation as well as numerical implementation are presented such as to meet the following requirements: simplicity, reliability and practical applicability to make the resulting software product available for a direct use on the construction site. To that end a recently introduced 2D3D modeling of tunnel excavation incorporating the in situ measurements is effectively combined with a fully three-dimensional (3D) beam-like representation of a typical urban structure made of masonry or precast concrete. Both standard and advanced non-linear constitutive models can be adopted to account for a potential shear failure of a subsoil material during excavation consequently triggering the evolution of damage of an above-ground (upper) structure. A simple example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
