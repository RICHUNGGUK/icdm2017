A finite difference method was used to solve a system of coupled partial differential equations. A comparison was carried out between the numerical results obtained in the present work and the experimental data reported in the literature. It was found that the investigated model reasonably predicts the mean flow properties of the flow field. The present investigation suggests that the potential core length increases as the velocity ratio rises. Analyses of the mean and turbulent parameters showed that, when using a momentum length scale, parameters can reach an asymptotic curve, at different velocity ratios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
