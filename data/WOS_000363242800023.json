Through the design of a new nonlinear controller, algebraic criteria based on M-matrix are established for the finite-time stabilizability of DMNNs, and the upper bound of the settling time for stabilization is estimated. In addition, finite-time instabilizability algebraic criteria are also established by choosing different parameters of the same nonlinear controller. The effectiveness and the superiority of the obtained results are supported by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Finite-Time Stabilizability and Instabilizability of Delayed Memristive Neural Networks with Nonlinear Discontinuous Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800023"}
