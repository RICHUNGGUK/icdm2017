The correlation of the average Nussel number and average friction factor were proposed considering the frequency and the inlet velocity. The oscillating flow heat transfer problems are influenced by many factors. Hence we need an easy way to reduce the numbers of simulation or experiment. Therefore, the method of uniform design was adopted and the feasibility of this method was verified. The field synergy principle was used to explain the heat transfer enhancement of oscillating flow in helically coiled tube heat-exchanger. The result shows that the smaller the volume average field synergy angle in the helically coiled tube, the better the rate of heat transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
