The length-scale parameter is introduced to the strain energy of the system and the equations of motion are obtained via Hamilton's principle based on the modified couple stress theory; these equations are discretized into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations through use of the Galerkin scheme. The possibility of the occurrence of modal interactions and internal energy transfers is verified by obtaining the ratios of the linear natural frequencies of the system. The nonlinear response of the system is obtained for the cases with the modal interactions and internal energy transfer.
