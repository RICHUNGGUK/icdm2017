The degradation is mainly caused by the residual crosstalk components derived from the reverberation of the interference signal. A post-processing method is proposed in this paper which uses a approximated Wiener filter using short-time magnitude spectra in the spectral domain. The speech signals have a sparse characteristic in the spectral domain, hence the approximated Wiener filtering can be applied by endowing the difference weights to the other signal components. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method improves the noise reduction ratio(NRR) by about 3dB over conventional FDICA. In addition, the proposed method is compared to the other post-processing algorithm using NLMS algorithm for post-processor [6], and show the better performances of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Post-processing for enhancing target signal in frequency domain blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800062"}
