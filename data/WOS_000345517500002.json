The system of non-adjacent coupled map lattices has more outstanding cryptography features in dynamics than the logistic map or coupled map lattices does. In the proposed image encryption, we employ a bit-level pixel permutation strategy which enables bit planes of pixels permute mutually without any extra storage space. Simulations have been carried out and the results demonstrate the superior security and high efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
