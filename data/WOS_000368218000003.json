Due to the fact that piracy is rampant, the issue of how to provide public transport passengers with a protected copyright multimedia entertainment service has become important. In this paper, a secure public transport multimedia on demand (MoD) system is proposed for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) that not only protects the transmission of copyrighted multimedia data, but also provides passengers with a more enjoyable set of multimedia services during long travel. The proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements, such as defends against known attacks, authenticity, confidentiality and integrity issues. Our scheme is realistic and can enhance the competitiveness of the public transport companies.", "paper_title": "A Secure Public Transport Multimedia on Demand System for VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000368218000003"}
