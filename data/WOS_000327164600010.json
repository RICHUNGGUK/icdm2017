In the context of a shock moving into a semi-infinite wall, this problem describes the interaction between the reflected part of the shock and the part that is transmitted beyond the wall. We formulate the equations in self-similar variables, and obtain numerical solutions using high resolution finite difference schemes. Our solutions appear to show that the shock dies out at the sonic line, rather than forms at an interior point of the supersonic region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
