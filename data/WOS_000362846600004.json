However, assembly algorithms have to catch up with experimental innovations to benefit from them and to produce high-quality assemblies. Results: We present a new algorithm that extends recently described EXSPANDER universal repeat resolution approach to enable its applications to several challenging data types, including jumping libraries generated by the recently developed Illumina Nextera Mate Pair protocol. We demonstrate that, with these improvements, bacterial genomes often can be assembled in a few contigs using only a single Nextera Mate Pair library of short reads.", "paper_title": "Assembling short reads from jumping libraries with large insert sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362846600004"}
