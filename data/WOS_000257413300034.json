The proposed method uses correlation between two signals in each DFT bin to solve the permutation problem. One of the signals is partially separated by a time domain blind source separation method and the other is obtained by the frequency domain blind source separation method. Two different ways of configuring the time and frequency domain blocks, i.e., in parallel or cascade, have been studied. The cascaded configuration not only achieves a better separation performance but also reduces the computational cost as compared to the parallel configuration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
