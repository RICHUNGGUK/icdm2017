As an alternative to force plates, instrumented force shoes (IFSs) can be used to measure ground reaction forces. This study evaluated the influence of IFS on gait pattern in patients with knee OA. Twenty patients with knee OA walked in a gait laboratory on IFS and control shoes (CSs). An optoelectronic system and force plate were used to perform 3D gait analyses. A comparison of temporal-spatial gait parameters, kinematics, and kinetics was made between IFS and CS. Patients wearing IFS showed a decrease in walking velocity and cadence (8%), unchanged stride length, an increase in stance time (13%), stride time (11%) and step width (14%). No differences were found in knee adduction moment or knee kinematics. Small differences were found in foot and ankle kinematics (2-5A degrees), knee transverse moments (5%), ankle frontal (3%) and sagittal moments (1%) and ground reaction force (1-6%). The gait of patients with knee OA was only mildly influenced by the IFS, due to increased shoe height and weight and a change in sole stiffness. The changes were small compared to normal variation and clinically relevant differences. Importantly, in OA patients no effect was found on the knee adduction moment.", "paper_title": "Influence of the instrumented force shoe on gait pattern in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee", "paper_id": "WOS:000297550600005"}
