In particular, transactional business processes need more attention in stages of modeling and verification because of their additional complexities in managing the specific behavior of transactions. This contribution proposes an approach to model and validate transactional business processes by means of compositing workflow patterns constructed using Concurrent Object-Oriented algebraic Petri Nets. Moreover, a concrete framework for business process validation, prototyping and integration is proposed.", "paper_title": "Towards service-based business process modeling, prototyping and integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079700015"}
