We use the method of maximum likelihood to derive the point estimators of the parameters. The main purpose of this article is to construct the exact confidence interval and region for the parameters. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the methods developed here.", "paper_title": "Statistical inference based on progressively censored samples with random removals from the Burr type XII distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000242209300002"}
