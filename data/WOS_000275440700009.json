Learning environments offer an ideal case study because they require customization and must adapt to life-long learning needs in a rapidly changing environment. Consequently, researchers are already starting to define the latest wave of next-generation e-learning systems. The authors analyze current trends in e-learning architecture evolution and identify merits and limitations. They also describe a new architecture that captures the needs of both formal (instructor-led) and informal (student-led) learning environments.", "paper_title": "Personalized Service-Oriented E-Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000275440700009"}
