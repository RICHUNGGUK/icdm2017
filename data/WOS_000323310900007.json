The proposed method will calculate the gain of the back-calculation based on the input and output status of the PI regulator without the requirement of motor parameters, such as the inertial and torque-current coefficient, and the back-calculation gain will vary with the speed command in order to obtain the optimal dynamic performance. The proposed method avoids the problem caused by the fixed back-calculation gain in the classical AW strategy, and prevents the system from untimely saturation withdrawing or an unexpected overshoot due to the inappropriate back-calculation gain, respectively. The proposed AW strategy is compared with the classical AW design by simulation and experiment on an application platform of a permanent magnet synchronous motor servo system. A PI controller with the proposed AW design will decrease the overshoot with a small settling time of the system's step-response, which can be observed obviously in wide dynamic variation. It reduces the difficulty of the parameter tuning for the PI controller.", "paper_title": "Antiwindup design for the speed loop PI controller of a PMSM servo system", "paper_id": "WOS:000323310900007"}
