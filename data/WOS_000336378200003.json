It has recently been suggested that intradural placement of the electrodes in direct contact with the pial surface could greatly enhance the specificity and efficiency of stimulation. The present computational study aims at quantifying and comparing the electrical current distributions as well as the spatial recruitment profiles resulting from extra- and intra-dural electrode arrangements. The electrical potential distribution is calculated using a 3D finite element model of the human thoracic spinal canal. The likely recruitment areas are then obtained using the potential as input to an equivalent circuit model of the pre-threshold axonal response. The results show that the current threshold to recruitment of axons in the dorsal column is more than an order of magnitude smaller for intradural than extradural stimulation. Intradural placement of the electrodes also leads to much higher contrast between the stimulation thresholds for the dorsal root entry zone and the dorsal column, allowing better focusing of the stimulus.", "paper_title": "Comparison of spinal cord stimulation profiles from intra- and extradural electrode arrangements by finite element modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000336378200003"}
