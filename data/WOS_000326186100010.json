A quasi-Monte Carlo (e. g., number theoretic net method (NT-net)) with better computation efficiency over MC has recently attracted interests in application. In spite of a comprehensive case study (Huang et al., 2004, \"Tolerance Analysis for Design of Multistage Manufacturing Processes Using Number-Theoretical Net Method (NT-net),\" Int. J. Flexible Manuf. Syst., 16, pp. 65-90 and Zhou et al., 2001, \" Sequential Algorithm Based on Number Theoretic Method for Tolerance Analysis and Synthesis,\" ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 123(3), pp. 490-493) for comparison between NT-net and MC, a method for sample size determination of NT-net is still not available. Combinatorial theory and the solution of occupancy problem are used for estimating equivalent sample sizes of MC and NT-net, allowing the NT-net sample size determination in application. A multivariate Chebyshev polynomial with variant coefficients is used to represent generic design functions for validation. The results are verified by case studies.", "paper_title": "Sample Size Determination in NT-Net Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326186100010"}
