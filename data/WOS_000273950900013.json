In particular, the framework can provide multidimensional information to benchmark various R&D efficiency indexes (i.e., technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency) as well as the total factor R&D productivity change (determined by three components: \"catch-up\" of R&D efficiency, \"frontier shift\" of R&D technology as well as \"exploitation\" of R&D scale economics effect) at a comparable production frontier. It can be used to not only investigate the potential and sustainable capacity of innovation but also screen and finance R&D projects at the regional or national level. We have applied the framework to a province-level panel dataset on R&D activities of 30 selected Chinese provinces.", "paper_title": "Modeling macro-R&D production frontier performance: an application to Chinese province-level R&D", "paper_id": "WOS:000273950900013"}
