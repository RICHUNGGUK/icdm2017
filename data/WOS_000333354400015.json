Programmable interconnects are the dominant part of FPGA. We use RRAMs to build programmable interconnects, and optimize their structures by exploiting opportunities that emerge in RRAM-based circuits. FPGA-RPI can be fabricated by the existing CMOS-compatible RRAM process. Using an advanced placement and routing tool named VPR-RPI which was developed to deal with the novel architecture, a customized CAD flow is provided for FPGA-RPI. Results show that the programmable interconnects of FPGA-RR have a 96% smaller footprint, 55% higher performance, and 79% lower power consumptions compared to other FPGA counterparts.", "paper_title": "FPGA-RPI: A Novel FPGA Architecture With RRAM-Based Programmable Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000333354400015"}
