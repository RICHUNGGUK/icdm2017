Capacitive and inductive coupling effects are investigated and formulated in terms of the effective single-transmission-line model and effective transmission line parameters for fundamental switching modes. Arbitrary switching multicoupled lines are readily decomposed with the fundamental modes by using a symbolic operation, followed by the signal transients and crosstalk noise of multicoupled lines with the closed-form expressions that are derived by using a waveform approximation technique. It is shown that the models have excellent agreement with SPICE simulation.", "paper_title": "Analytical CAD models for the signal transients and crosstalk noise of inductance-effect-prominent multicoupled RLC interconnect lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000257239100005"}
