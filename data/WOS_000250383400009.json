Owing to the relevant information managed by these systems, they should provide strong security and confidentiality measures from the early stages of a DW project in the MD modeling and enforce them. In the last years, there have been some proposals to accomplish the MD modeling at the conceptual level. Nevertheless, none of them considers security measures as an important element in their models, and therefore, they do not allow us to specify confidentiality constraints to be enforced by the applications that will use these MD models. In this paper, we present an Access Control and Audit (ACA) model for the conceptual MD modeling. Then, we extend the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with this ACA model, representing the security information (gathered in the ACA model) in the conceptual MD modeling, thereby allowing us to obtain secure MD models. Moreover, we use the OSCL (Object Security Constraint Language) to specify our ACA model constraints, avoiding in this way an arbitrary use of them. Furthermore, we align our approach with the Model-Driven Architecture, the Model-Driven Security and the Model-Driven Data Warehouse, offering a proposal highly compatible with the more recent technologies.", "paper_title": "Model-driven multidimensional modeling of secure data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000250383400009"}
