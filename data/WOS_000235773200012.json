We adopt a hybrid approach for such text extraction by exploiting a number of characteristics of text blocks in color images and video frames. Our system detects both caption text as well as scene text of different font, size, color and intensity. We have developed an application for on-line extraction and recognition of texts from videos. Such texts are used for retrieval of video clips based on any given keyword. The application is available on the web for the readers to repeat our experiments and also to try text extraction and retrieval from their own videos.", "paper_title": "Content based image and video retrieval using embedded text", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200012"}
