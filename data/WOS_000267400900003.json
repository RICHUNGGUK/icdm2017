However, the adaptation of grid technology to ad-hoc networks is not straight forward, and exhibits numerous difficulties (resource discovery, security, power consumption, QoS, etc.). This paper is focussed on the problem of resource discovery in ad-hoc grids, we Study the existing resource and service discovery architectures, analyzing the main limitations of these systems (scalability, discovery delay, adaptation to changing conditions, etc.), and we propose a hybrid mechanism that overcomes these limitations.
