The optimization problem of the so-called minimum within-class variance multiclass classifiers (MWCVMC) is formulated and solved in arbitrary Hilbert spaces, defined by Mercer's kernels, in order to find multiclass decision hyperplanes/surfaces. Afterwards, MWCVMCs are solved using indefinite kernels and dissimilarity measures via pseudo-Euclidean embedding. The power of the proposed approach is first demonstrated in the facial expression recognition of the seven basic facial expressions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise plus the neutral state) problem in the presence of partial facial occlusion by using a pseudo-Euclidean embedding of Hausdorff distances and the MWCVMC. The experiments indicated a recognition accuracy rate achieved up to 99%. The MWCVMC classifiers are also applied to face recognition and other classification problems using Mercer's kernels.", "paper_title": "Novel Multiclass Classifiers Based on the Minimization of the Within-Class Variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429700002"}
