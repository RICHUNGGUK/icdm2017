M. Schroder and A. Simpson have obtained a similar result for lower semicontinuous linear functionals on the cone of all Scott-continuous valuations on a topological space endowed with the weak* upper topology, an asymmetric version of the weak* topology. This result has given rise to several proofs, originally by Schroder and Simpson themselves and, more recently, by the author of these Notes and by J. Goubault-Larrecq. The proofs developed from very technical arguments to more and more conceptual ones. The present Note continues on this line, presenting a conceptual approach inspired by classical functional analysis which may prove useful in other situations.", "paper_title": "WEAK UPPER TOPOLOGIES AND DUALITY FOR CONES", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600021"}
