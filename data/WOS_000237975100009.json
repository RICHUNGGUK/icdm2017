In order to demonstrate the suitability of this approach, the on-chip communication structure of two examples featuring typical system-on-chip (SoC) communication conflicts like competition for common communication resources have been studied. A state-of-the-art heterogeneous digital signal processor (DSP) and a design example with an on-chip bus have been examined. The results show that sufficient modeling accuracy can be achieved with low modeling effort in terms of computation and implementation time.", "paper_title": "A case study for the application of deterministic and stochastic Petri nets in the SoC communication domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000237975100009"}
