The 1D problem on a chain of qubits has heuristics which work well, while the 13-state qudit case has been shown to be QMA-complete. We show that this problem remains QMA-complete when the dimensionality of the qudits is brought down to 8.", "paper_title": "THE LOCAL HAMILTONIAN PROBLEM ON A LINE WITH EIGHT STATES IS QMA-COMPLETE", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004400001"}
