Due to its complexity, dependability and performance studies of mobile clouds may require composite modeling techniques, using distinct models for each subsystem and combining state-based and non-state-based formalisms. This paper uses hierarchical modeling and four different sensitivity analysis techniques to determine the parameters that cause the greatest impact on the availability of a mobile cloud. The results show that distinct approaches provide similar results regarding the sensitivity ranking, with specific exceptions. A combined evaluation indicates that system availability may be improved effectively by focusing on a reduced set of factors that produce large variation on the measure of interest. The time needed to replace a fully discharged battery in the mobile device is a parameter with high impact on steady-state availability, as well as the coverage factor for the failures of some cloud servers. This paper also shows that a sensitivity analysis through partial derivatives may not capture the real level of impact for some parameters in a discrete domain, such as the number of active servers. The analysis through percentage differences, or the factorial design of experiments, fulfills such a gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
