In this paper, a combination of fixed worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) at 5.8 GHz and Ethernet LAN is proposed for monitoring and control of energy meters in a smart grid. Communication signal quality is an important factor to consider as it directly affects the reliability of the whole monitoring and control system of a smart grid. In this paper, the signal quality in terms of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the WiMAX system is investigated with a laboratory-scale smart grid prototype. Real-time RSSI is recorded and analyzed to develop an analytical model for the WiMAX RSSI transmitting at 5.8 GHz. It was found that in order to achieve reliable communication for a coverage area of 2 km, the base station has to transmit at a total power of 28.08 dBm for a receiver height of 1.875 m. Similarly, a receiver height of 2.766 m is required for a transmitted power of 25 dBm. The performance of the proposed WiMAX-LAN communication system for advanced metering infrastructure in smart grids is analyzed. On average, the proposed system completes the data collection of 3705 meter units in less than 997 s.", "paper_title": "Performance Measurement and Analysis of WiMAX-LAN Communication Operating at 5.8 GHz", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900030"}
