This enables the formulation of weak form equations governing the warping from shear and torsion. These weak form equations are solved numerically by introducing a cubic-linear two-dimensional isoparametric element. The cubic interpolation of this element accurately represents quadratic shear stress variations along cross-section walls, and thus moderately thin-walled cross-sections are effectively discretized by these elements. The ability of this element to represent curved geometries, and to accurately determine cross-section parameters and shear stress distributions is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
