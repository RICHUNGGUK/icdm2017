A detailed model of the gearbox with main shaft has been created using MSC. Adams. Special focus has been put on modeling the planet carrier (PLC) in the gearbox. For this purpose experimental data from a drive train test set up has been analyzed using parameter identification to quantify misalignments. Based on the measurements a combination of main shaft misalignment and planet carrier deflection has been identified. A purely numerical model has been developed and it shows good accordance with the experimental data.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Parameter Identification of Deflections in Planetary Stage of Wind Turbine Gearbox", "paper_id": "WOS:000306954300001"}
