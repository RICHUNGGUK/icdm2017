Using quantum communication, we can build oblivious transfer protocols with security provably better than any protocol built using classical communication. However, with imperfect apparatus, one needs to consider other attacks. In this paper, we present an oblivious transfer protocol which is impervious to lost messages.", "paper_title": "ON THE EXISTENCE OF LOSS-TOLERANT QUANTUM OBLIVIOUS TRANSFER PROTOCOLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318822000006"}
