The central idea is to study the dynamical behavior of a cellular automaton through the conjoint action of its global rule (temporal action) and the shift map (spacial action): qualitative behaviors inherited from topological dynamics (equicontinuity, sensitivity, expansivity) are thus considered along arbitrary curves in space-time. The main contributions of the paper concern equicontinuous dynamics which can be connected to the notion of consequences of a word. We show that there is a cellular automaton with an equicontinuous dynamics along a parabola, but which is sensitive along any linear direction. We also show that real numbers that occur as the slope of a limit linear direction with equicontinuous dynamics in some cellular automaton are exactly the computably enumerable numbers.
