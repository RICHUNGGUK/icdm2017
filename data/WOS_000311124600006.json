We present an image-based remodeling methodology that allows real-time photorealistic visualization during both the modeling and remodeling process of a home interior. Large-scale edits, like removing a wall or enlarging a window, are performed easily and in real time, with realistic results. Our interface supports the creation of concise, parameterized, and constrained geometry, as well as remodeling directly from within the photographs. Real-time texturing of modified geometry is made possible by precomputing view-dependent textures for all faces that are potentially visible to each original camera viewpoint, blending multiple viewpoints and hole-filling when necessary. The resulting textures are stored and accessed efficiently enabling intuitive real-time realistic visualization, modeling, and editing of the building interior.", "paper_title": "Image-Based Remodeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000311124600006"}
