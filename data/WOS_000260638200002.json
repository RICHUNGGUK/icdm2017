Constructors are identified not only modulo beta, but also eta. We give a direct proof of completeness, without constructing a model or establishing a strong normalisation theorem. Inductive and coinductive types are enriched with a notion of size and the subtyping calculus is extended to account for the inclusions arising between the sized types.", "paper_title": "Polarised subtyping for sized types", "paper_id": "WOS:000260638200002"}
