The key challenge is how to balance security and collaboration. A novel approach is proposed in this paper to support the trusted interoperation. It introduces the notions of effect scope and life condition into role based access control model to restrict permission to be active only in proper environment. Partial inheritance of role hierarchy is presented to support the finely granular access rights as well as the verification algorithms are proposed to maintain security constraints consistent. As an example, XACMLbased platform is provided to combine the existent systems for secure interoperation. Without compromising the collaboration, this approach can effectively enforce a layered security policy and can reduce the complexity of security management.", "paper_title": "An approach for trusted interoperation in a multidomain environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800034"}
