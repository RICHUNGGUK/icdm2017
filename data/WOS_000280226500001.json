Sometimes, while employing such search algorithms, problem solvers may prove to be inefficient and take too great an effort so as to showing that the problem has no solution. For such cases, in this paper we explain a technique which provides a quick proof that finding a solution is actually impossible. This technique results in reducing the number and simplifying the topology of the states which shape a problem space. Hence, we show and prove efficient new techniques intended to find such reductions which may result to be very useful for many problems.", "paper_title": "New methods for proving the impossibility to solve problems through reduction of problem spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000280226500001"}
