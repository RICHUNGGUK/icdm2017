The thermodynamic parameters of the complex formations were calculated in order to estimate the exact stability of the supersystems. It was proven that the calculated energy barriers of the alcohol-assisted proton transfers are about 60% lower than those of the intramolecular proton transfers in adenine found earlier.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the intermolecular proton transfer in the supersystems adenine-methanol/ethanol/i-propanol: MP2 and DFT levels study", "paper_id": "WOS:000248302100007"}
