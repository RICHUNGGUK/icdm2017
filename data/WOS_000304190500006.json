To that end, we define a two-step procedure which first (i) computes implications whose premise is a key in the context K vertical bar(K) over tilde representing the apposition of the context K and its complementary (K) over tilde with attributes in (M) over tilde (negative attributes), and then (ii) uses an inference axiom we have defined to produce the whole set of implications.", "paper_title": "Computing Implications with Negation from a Formal Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000304190500006"}
