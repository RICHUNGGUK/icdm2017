This scheme is suitable for simultaneous nonlinear and linear impairment mitigation in multilevel coded-modulation schemes with coherent detection. The proposed scheme employs large-girth quasi-cyclic LDPC codes as channel codes. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with fiber nonlinearities by performing Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we provide the experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with polarization mode dispersion. We also study the ultimate channel capacity limits, assuming an independent identically distributed source.", "paper_title": "Suppression of Fiber Nonlinearities and PMD in Coded-Modulation Schemes With Coherent Detection by Using Turbo Equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000271374100004"}
