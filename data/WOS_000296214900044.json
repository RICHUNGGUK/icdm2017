Constrained optimization problems consist of an objective function subjected to both linear and nonlinear constraints. Here a constraint handling procedure based on the fitness priority-based ranking method (FPBRM) is proposed. It is embedded into a harmony search (HS) algorithm that allows it to satisfy constraints. The HS algorithm is conceptualized using the musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony. Here, the original heuristic HS was improved by combining both improved and global-best methods along with the FPBRM. The resulting modified harmony search (MHS) was then compared with the original HS technique and other optimization methods for several test problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
