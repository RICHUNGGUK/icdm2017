The main purpose of this algorithm is to increase efficiency, i.e. increasing the number of correctly matched lines while avoiding the increase of mismatches. In this regard, the reasons for the elimination of correct matches as well as the existence of the erroneous ones in some existing algorithms have been investigated. An attempt was also made to make efficient uses of the photometric, geometric and structural information through the introduction of new constraints, criteria, and procedures. Hence, in the candidate determination stage of the designed algorithm two new constraints, in addition to the reliable epipolar, maximum and minimum disparity and orientation similarity constraints were employed. In the process of disambiguation and final matches selection, being the main problem of the matching issue, regarding the employed constraints, criterion function and its optimization, it is a completely new development. The algorithm was applied to the images of several indoor scenes and its high efficiency illustrated by correct matching of 96% of the line segments with no mismatches.", "paper_title": "A new efficient stereo line segment matching algorithm based on more effective usage of the photometric, geometric and structural information", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900005"}
