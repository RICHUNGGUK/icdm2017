The derivation is done by erasing. a prefix or a suffix and then adding a prefix or a suffix. This can be naturally viewed as two stacks communicating with each other according to a fixed protocol. The paper systematically considers different cases of these systems and determines their expressiveness. Several cases are identified where very limited communication surprisingly yields universal computation power.", "paper_title": "Communication of two stacks and rewriting", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900040"}
