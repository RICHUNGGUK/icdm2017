Providing security for server client communication over the Internet is a critical issue due to open world digital eavesdroppers. Generally, password authentication is required for establishing a connection between server and client environment. The client password is verified by the server ends to establish a valid connection. Successful password verification initiates the client and server to perform further secured request and response mechanisms. The problem of password authentication over insecure networks presents in many application areas, such as web login, remote logins of computer networks. Hence the significance of confidential password transmission over insecure Internet becomes the necessity of secure authentication. In this paper, we proposed a secure password transmission over the Internet for authentication of server/client environment using encryption and image steganography. Client password is first encrypted and embedded in an image using steganographic algorithm at client side and transmitted over unsecured network to the web server. On the other side server extract safely password from image steganography decoding algorithm, decrypt and verified it's with SQL database server. In case if the intruder steals the image over network he/she will be unable to decode the password from the image. The prototype of the proposed method is implemented using JavaScript, Html, and ASP.net for verification purpose.", "paper_title": "Secure Password Transmission for Web Applications over Internet using Cryptography and Image Steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000361373100018"}
