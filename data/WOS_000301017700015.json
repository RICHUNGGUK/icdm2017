The color information is especially important in textures of natural scenes, such as leaves surfaces, terrains models, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the fractal dimension for color texture analysis. The proposed approach investigates the complexity in R, G and B color channels to characterize a texture sample. We also propose to study all channels in combination, taking into consideration the correlations between them. Both these approaches use the volumetric version of the Bouligand-Minkowski Fractal Dimension method. The results show a advantage of the proposed method over other color texture analysis methods.
