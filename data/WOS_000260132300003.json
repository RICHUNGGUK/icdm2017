The notion of finitary formal topology is defined from the perspective of the Basic Picture (introduced by the second author) and thus it is endowed with a binary positivity relation. As an application, we prove a constructive version of Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices. We work within the framework of a minimalist foundation (as proposed by Maria Emilia Maietti and the second author). Both inductive and co-inductive methods are Used in most proofs.
