That selection should be context-dependent and take into account several aspects, at very different abstraction layers, from application-specific bandwidth requirements to expected client mobility, from user preferences to energy consumption. We claim the suitability of mobility-aware middlewares to relieve the application logic from the burden of determining the most suitable interface and connectivity provider for each client/application at service provisioning time. In particular, the paper motivates the need for novel context indicators, e.g., client/connector relative mobility, and describes effective lightweight solutions to estimate them flexibly, depending on dynamically introduced evaluation metrics. The paper presents primary architecture and implementation guidelines to build such a novel middleware solution. The proposed middleware has been experimentally validated and the reported performance results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach: it achieves accurate estimations of node mobility and consequently performs connection establishment/selection with very limited overhead.", "paper_title": "Mobility-aware Management of Internet Connectivity in Always Best Served Wireless Scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000262484100003"}
