When there are hundreds or thousands of alternatives to be compared, the pair-wise comparison manner provided by the traditional AHP is obviously infeasible. In this paper we propose an integrated AHP-DEA methodology to evaluate bridge risks of hundreds or thousands of bridge structures, based on which the maintenance priorities of the bridge structures can be decided. The proposed AHP-DEA methodology uses the AHP to determine the weights of criteria, linguistic terms such as High, Medium, Low and None to assess bridge risks under each criterion, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to determine the values of the linguistic terms, and the simple additive weighting (SAW) method to aggregate bridge risks under different criteria into an overall risk score for each bridge structure. The integrated AHP-DEA methodology is applicable to any number of decision alternatives and is illustrated with a numerical example. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
