Current research on performance evaluation of resource scheduling in MAG is based on simulation techniques, which can only consider a limited range of scenarios. In this paper, we propose a centralized resource scheduling model in a MAG and give a formal framework via Stochastic Process Algebras (SPA) to deal with this problem. Within this framework, we model and analyze the performance of resource scheduling, allowing for a wide variety of job and data scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we can evaluate the combined effectiveness of job and data scheduling algorithms, rather than study them separately.", "paper_title": "Performance Modeling and analysis for centralized resource scheduling in metropolitan-area grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100076"}
