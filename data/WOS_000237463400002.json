In the past decade, more sophisticated testing criteria have been advocated. In particular, compliance of the MC/DC criterion has been mandated in the commercial aviation industry for the approval of airborne software. Recently, the MUMCUT criterion has been proposed as it guarantees the detection of certain faults in logical decisions in disjunctive normal form in which no variable is redundant. This paper compares MC/DC, MUMCUT and several other related coverage criteria for logical decisions by both formal and empirical analysis, focusing on the fault-detecting ability of test sets satisfying these testing criteria. Our results show that MC/DC test sets are effective, but they may still miss some faults that can almost always be detected by test sets satisfying the MUMCUT criterion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
