This constraint is reasonable only when the classes of k-valued grammars correspond to a real hierarchy of generated languages. Such a hierarchy has been established earlier for the classical categorial grammars. In this paper the hierarchy by the k-valued constraint is established in the class of categorial grammars extended with iterated types adapted to express the so called projective dependency structures.
