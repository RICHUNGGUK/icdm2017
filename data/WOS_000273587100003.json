So far this problem was shown to be NP-complete in the case of k = 1 and polynomially solvable in the case of k = 2. In this paper, we show that the problem for k >= 3 can be solved in O(m + n(k(3) + n(2))(p + kn + n log n)log k + pkn(3) log (n/k)) time, where n = vertical bar V vertical bar, m = vertical bar{{u, v}vertical bar(u, v) is an element of E}vertical bar, and p = vertical bar W vertical bar.", "paper_title": "Minimum Augmentation of Edge-Connectivity between Vertices and Sets of Vertices in Undirected Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273587100003"}
