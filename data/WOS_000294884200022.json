Design/methodology/approach - The robust optimization formulation introduces a small number of auxiliary variables and additional constraints into the original mixed integer linear programming problem, generating a deterministic robust counterpart problem which provides the optimal solution given the magnitude of the uncertain data, a feasibility tolerance, and a reliability level. Findings - Developed robust optimization approaches produce robust solutions for uncertainties in both the coefficients and right-hand-side parameters of the linear inequality constraints and can be applied to address the problem of production scheduling with uncertain parameters. Research limitations/implications - The choice of the magnitude of the uncertain data, a feasibility tolerance, and a reliability level are the main limitation of the model. Practical implications - Very useful. advice for short-term scheduling of batch plants under demand uncertainty. Originality/value - The paper proposes a robust optimization approach for short-term scheduling of batch plants under demand uncertainty. Computational results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A robust optimization approach for short-term scheduling of batch plants under demand uncertainty?", "paper_id": "WOS:000294884200022"}
