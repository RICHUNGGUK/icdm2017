In the systems under study, each action has a bounded delay where the bounds are either constants or parameters. Given a safety property, the analysis computes automatically a set of constraints on the parameters that is sufficient to guarantee the property. The main contribution is an innovative representation of the parametric timed state space based on bit-vectors. Experimental results from the domain of timed circuits show that this representation improves the efficiency of the verification significantly with a small impact on the accuracy of the derived constraints.", "paper_title": "Verification of concurrent systems with parametric delays using octahedra", "paper_id": "WOS:000248389400002"}
