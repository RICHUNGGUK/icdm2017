The study includes simulated and experimental results that allow us to identify effects produced by the introduction of particular biasing and matching networks in the power amplifier design. The influence of the bias point, as well as of biasing and matching network topologies on the nonlinear, short- and long-term memory behavior has been studied by means of simulations and measurements, using different power amplifier prototypes.
