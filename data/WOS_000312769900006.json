The circuit features a low noise amplifier (LNA), quadrature passive mixers, and a frequency divider generating 25 % duty cycle quadrature local oscillator (LO) signals. A complementary common-gate LNA is used, and to meet the stringent linearity requirements it employs positive feedback with transistors biased in the sub-threshold region, resulting in cancellation of the third order non-linearity. The mixers are also linearized, using a baseband to LO bootstrap circuit. Measurements of the front-end show about 3.5 dB improvement in out-of-band IIP3 at optimum bias of the positive feedback devices in the LNA, resulting in an out-of-band IIP3 of 10 dBm. With a frequency range from 0.7 to 3 GHz the receiver front-end covers most important cellular bands, with an input return loss above 9 dB and a voltage gain exceeding 16 dB for all bias settings. The circuit consumes 4.38 mA from a 1.5 V supply.", "paper_title": "A 0.7 to 3 GHz wireless receiver front end in 65-nm CMOS with an LNA linearized by positive feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900006"}
