Process intensification as part of process synthesis has the potential to find truly innovative and more sustainable solutions. In this paper, a computer-aided, multi-level, multi-scale framework for synthesis, design and intensification of processes, for identifying more sustainable alternatives is presented. Within the framework, a three stage work-flow has been implemented where, in the first \"synthesis\" stage an optimal processing route is synthesized through a network superstructure optimization approach and related synthesis tools. In the second, \"design\" stage, the processing route from the first stage is further developed and a base case design is established and analyzed. In the third, \"innovation\" stage, more sustainable innovative solutions are determined. The application of the framework is illustrated through a case study related to the production of di-methyl carbonate, which is an important bulk chemical due to its multiplicity of uses.
