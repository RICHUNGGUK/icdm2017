A partition includes the number of fuzzy sets (classes) per variable and the membership function of each class. The resulting GFS is applied to two real problems, i.e. the estimation of the maintenance cost of medium voltage lines in Spanish towns and the prediction of ozone levels in Austria. The results obtained in each application are compared with some of the most popular classical statistical modeling methods, neural networks and other hybrid evolutionary data analysis techniques.", "paper_title": "Learning fuzzy partitions in FIR methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000251144200005"}
