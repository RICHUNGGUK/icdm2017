The advantage of considering the generalized Hessian approach for our modified UMPs reduces to solving just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving two quadratic programming problems in TWSVM and TBSVM, which leads to extremely simple and fast algorithm. Unlike the classical TWSVM and least square TWSVM (LSTWSVM), the structural risk minimization principle is implemented by adding regularization term in the primal problems of our proposed algorithm. This embodies the essence of statistical learning theory. Computational comparisons of our proposed method against GEPSVM, TWSVM, STWSVM and LSTWSVM have been made on both synthetic and well-known real world benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method yields significantly better generalization performance in both computational time and classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Newton method for implicit Lagrangian twin support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000364150100012"}
