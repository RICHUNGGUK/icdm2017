Flexibility was incorporated by providing various code rates and modulation schemes to adjust to varying channel conditions. Based on previous trade-off studies, flexible building blocks were carefully designed to cause as little area penalty as possible. The chip runs down to a minimal core supply of 0.8 V. It turns out that striving for more modulation schemes is beneficial in terms of power consumption once the price is paid for accepting different code rates viz, radices in the trellis and survivor path units.
