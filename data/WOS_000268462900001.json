The research work we present is part of a broader investigation into the capabilities of the FPM to deal with 3D applications concerning real compressible fluid flow problems. In the first part of this work, the upwind-biased scheme employed for solving the flow equations is described. Secondly, with the aim of exploiting the meshless capabilities, an h-adaptive methodology for 2D and 3D compressible flow calculations is developed. This adaptive technique applies a solution-based indicator in order to identify local clouds where new points should be inserted in or existing points could be safely removed from the computational domain. The flow solver and the adaptive procedure have been evaluated and the results are encouraging. Several numerical examples are provided in order to illustrate the good performance of the numerical methods presented.
