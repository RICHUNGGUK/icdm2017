The method is based on storage Quality of Service (SQoS) provisioning. SQoS provisioning uses the semantic based storage monitoring based on a storage resources model and a storage performance management. Test results show the gain for the execution time when using the QStorMan toolkit which implements the presented method. Taking into account the SQoS provisioning opportunity on the one hand, and the increasingly growing user demands on the other hand, we believe that the execution programming of data-intensive applications can bring a new quality into the application execution.", "paper_title": "Storage QoS provisioning for execution programming of data-intensive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000302459700006"}
