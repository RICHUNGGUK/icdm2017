In this paper, a model to support optimal decisions in a network of cooperative grids is formalized as an original discrete and centralized problem here defined as cooperative network of smart power grids (CNSPG) problem. In the CNSPG problem, the control variables are the instantaneous flows of power in the network of grids, which can be obtained from the solution of a linear quadratic Gaussian problem on a fixed time horizon. A simple case study showing the enhancement which may be obtained from the introduction of direct connections among microgrids according to a lattice network is shown and finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Optimal Control in a Cooperative Network of Smart Power Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400015"}
