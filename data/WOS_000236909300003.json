The method is based on homomorphic encryption and does not use random oracles. It only requires that a private/public key pair is set up for the verifier. The method applies to all known discrete-log based Sigma-protocols. As applications, we obtain non-interactive threshold RSA without random oracles, and non-interactive zero-knowledge for NP more efficiently than by previous methods.", "paper_title": "Non-interactive zero-knowledge from homomorphic encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000236909300003"}
