Specifically, it was proved that the capacity region of a two-user MAC with independent states, each known strictly causally to one encoder, can be enlarged by letting the encoders send compressed past state information to the decoder. In this study, a generalization of the said strategy is proposed whereby the encoders compress also the past transmitted codewords along with the past state sequences. The proposed scheme uses a combination of long-message encoding, compression of the past state sequences and codewords without binning, and joint decoding over all transmission blocks. The proposed strategy has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg to strictly improve upon the original one. Capacity results are then derived for a class of channels that include two-user modulo-additive state-dependent MACs. Moreover, the proposed scheme is extended to state-dependent MACs with an arbitrary number of users. Finally, output feedback is introduced and an example is provided to illustrate the interplay between feedback and availability of strictly causal state information in enlarging the capacity region.", "paper_title": "Multiple Access Channels With States Causally Known at Transmitters", "paper_id": "WOS:000315120400012"}
