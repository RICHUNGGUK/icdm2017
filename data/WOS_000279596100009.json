This lack of trustworthiness is the main reason why e-voting is not widespread even though e-voting is expected to be more efficient than the current plain paper voting. Many experts believe that the only way to assure voters that their intended votes are casted is to use paper receipts. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for issuing receipts to voters in an e-voting environment using the well-known divide-and-choose method. Our scheme requires neither special printers or scanners, nor frequent observations of voting machines. In addition, our scheme is more secure than the previous schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
