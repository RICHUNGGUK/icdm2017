We instead develop a metric for automatically predicting the perceptual quality of images produced by state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms. The metric is learned based on a massive user study, incorporates features that capture common deblurring artifacts, and does not require access to the original images (i.e., is \"no-reference\"). We show that it better matches user-supplied rankings than previous approaches to measuring quality, and that in most cases it outperforms conventional full-reference image-similarity measures. We demonstrate applications of this metric to automatic selection of optimal algorithms and parameters, and to generation of fused images that combine multiple deblurring results.", "paper_title": "A No-Reference Metric for Evaluating the Quality of Motion Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200019"}
