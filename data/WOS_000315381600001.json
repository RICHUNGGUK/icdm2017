In particular, we axiomatize the notion of an environment, which together with the earlier introduced axiomatic notion of classical structure enables us to define classical channels, quantum measurements and classical control. If we moreover adjoin the earlier introduced axiomatic notion of complementarity, we obtain sufficient structural power for constructive representation and correctness derivation of typical quantum informatic protocols.", "paper_title": "ENVIRONMENT AND CLASSICAL CHANNELS IN CATEGORICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315381600001"}
