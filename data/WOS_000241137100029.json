The aim is to assist process modellers in structuring collaborative interactions between parties, including their internal processes, to ensure contract-compliant behaviour. The methodology requires a formal model of contracts to facilitate process derivations and to form a basis for contract analysis tools and run-time process execution.", "paper_title": "Towards a methodology for deriving contract-compliant business processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100029"}
