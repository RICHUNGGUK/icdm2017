The visual detection of weed, crop and soil is an arduous task due to physical similarities between weeds and crop and to the natural and therefore complex environments (with non-controlled illumination) encountered. The image processing was divided in three different stages at which each different agricultural element is extracted: (1) segmentation of vegetation against non-vegetation (soil), (2) crop row elimination (crop) and (3) weed extraction (weed). For each stage, different and interchangeable methods are proposed, each one using a series of input parameters which value can be changed for further refining the processing, A genetic algorithm was then used to find the best value of parameters and method combination for different sets of images. The whole system was tested on several images from different years and fields, resulting in an average correlation coefficient with real data (bio-mass) of 84%, with up to 96% correlation using the best methods on winter cereal images and of up to 84% on maize images. Moreover, the method's low computational complexity leads to the possibility, as future work, of adapting them to real-time processing.
