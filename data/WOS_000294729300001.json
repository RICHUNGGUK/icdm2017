For a given positive integer k, a k-comma code is a set L over an alphabet Sigma with the property that L Sigma(k) L boolean AND Sigma(+) L Sigma(+) = empty set. Informally, in a k-comma code, no codeword can be a subword of the catenation of two other codewords separated by a \"comma\" of length k. A k-comma code is indeed a code, that is, any sequence of codewords is uniquely decipherable. We extend this notion to that of k-spacer codes, with commas of length less than or equal to a given k. We obtain several basic properties of k-comma codes and their generalizations, k-comma intercodes, and some relationships between the families of k-comma intercodes and other classical families of codes, such as infix codes and bifix codes. Moreover, we introduce the notion of n-k-comma intercodes, and obtain, for each k >= 0, several hierarchical relationships among the families of n-k-comma intercodes, as well as a characterization of the family of 1-k-comma intercodes.", "paper_title": "K-Comma Codes and Their Generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294729300001"}
