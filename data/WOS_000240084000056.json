Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) allow multiple orthogonal channels to be used simultaneously in the system and the throughput can be greatly improved because transmissions on different orthogonal channels do not interfere with each other. However, due to the limited number of available orthogonal channels, interference is still a factor in WMNs. In this paper an H-hop interference model in WMNs is proposed, where the transmission is successfully received if no other nodes that are within H hops from the receiver are transmitting on the same channel simultaneously. Based on this model, the interference-free property in the TDMA WMNs is analyzed. A heuristic algorithm with max-min time slots reservation strategy is developed to get the maximum bandwidth of a given path. And it is used in the bandwidth guaranteed routing protocol to find the shortest path for a connection with bandwidth requirement. Extensive simulations show that our routing protocol decreases the blocking ratios significantly compared with the shortest path routing.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth guaranteed routing in wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000056"}
