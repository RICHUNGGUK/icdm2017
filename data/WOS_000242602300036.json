The measure, based on the calculation of the number of neighbour examples that differ in their output value, can be simply computed from the definition of the functions, independently of their implementation. Numerical simulations performed on different architectures show a good agreement between the estimated complexity and the generalization ability and training times obtained. The proposed measure could help as a useful tool for carrying a systematic Study of the computational capabilities of network architectures by classifying in an easy and reliable way the Boolean functions. Also, based on the fact that the average generalization ability computed over the whole set of Boolean functions is 0.5, a very complex set of functions was found for which the generalization ability is lower than for random functions.
