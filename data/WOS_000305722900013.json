In a dynamic computing environment, (1) the number of transacting entities is not fixed; (2) the relationship between these entities are very dynamic; (3) transacting entities may not necessarily have previous knowledge of each other; (4) the surrounding context may possibly constantly change; and, (5) it is possible that the transaction is conducted in fully a automatic approach. Based on these unique feature in a dynamic environment, we claim that two important challenges need to be resolved: one is transacting entities should be able to establish trusted interactions between each other, and another is transacting entities should be able to select the most suitable transacting entities by pre-programmed business rules and current context. Based on our previous research work on MobiPass, this paper proposes a technique which successfully solves the above two important research issues by using Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) on top of the MobiPass framework, to help transacting entities select the most suitable transacting partners under a trusted interaction in dynamic environments in real time.
