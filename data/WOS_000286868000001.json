This macroscopic entanglement, as it can exhibit singular behavior, is capable of tracking quantum phase transitions. The entanglement between up and down spins has been analytically calculated for the one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. As the coupling strength is varied, the first derivative of the entanglement shows a jump discontinuity and the second derivative diverges near the quantum critical point,", "paper_title": "MACROSCOPIC MULTI-SPECIES ENTANGLEMENT NEAR QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000001"}
