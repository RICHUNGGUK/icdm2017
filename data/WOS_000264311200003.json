This study extends an efficient density-based algorithm for pairwise coverage to generate t-way interaction test suites and shows that it guarantees a logarithmic upper bound on the size of the test suites as a function of the number of factors. To complement this theoretical guarantee, an implementation is outlined and some practical improvements are made. Computational comparisons with other published methods are reported. Many of the results improve upon those in the literature. However, limitations on the ability of one-test-at-a-time algorithms are also identified.
