TSVs occupy significant silicon area due to their sheer size, which has a great effect on the quality of 3-D integrated chips (ICs). Whereas well-managed TSVs alleviate routing congestion and reduce wirelength, excessive or ill-managed TSVs increase the die area and wirelength. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the TSV on the quality of 3-D IC layouts. Two design schemes, namely TSV co-placement (irregular TSV placement) and TSV site (regular TSV placement), and accompanying algorithms to find and optimize locations of gates and TSVs are proposed for the design of 3-D ICs. Two TSV assignment algorithms are also proposed to enable the regular TSV placement. Simulation results show that the wirelength of 3-D ICs is shorter than that of 2-D ICs by up to 25%.", "paper_title": "Study of Through-Silicon-Via Impact on the 3-D Stacked IC Layout", "paper_id": "WOS:000318172500006"}
