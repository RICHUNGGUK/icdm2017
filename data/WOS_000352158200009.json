Particularly, in this work, we focus on spatial ranking service, which can retrieve a set of relevant resources with a certain tag. This paper designs ranking algorithm in order to find out a list of locations which are collected from geotagged resources on SNSs. As extending HITS algorithm [13], we propose a novel method (called GeoHITS) that can analyze an undirected 2-mode graph composed with a set of tags and a set of locations. Thereby, meaningful relationships between the locations and a set of tags are discovered by integrating several weighting schemes and HITS algorithm. To evaluate the proposed spatial ranking approach, we have shows the experimental results from the recommendation applications.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Geotagged Resources to Spatial Ranking by Extending HITS Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158200009"}
