An extension of this result to flow-shop settings has not been published since then. In this note we provide this result: we show that the Browne-Yechiali sequence remains optimal for flow-shops, i.e. we present a polynomial time (O(n log n)) solution for minimum makespan on an m-machine flow-shop with linear job deterioration.
