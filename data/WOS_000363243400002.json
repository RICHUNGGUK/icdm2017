This includes new bounds for the -adic and -adic precisions required to obtain provably correct results and gains in the efficiency of the individual steps of the method. The algorithm that we thus obtain has lower time and space complexities than existing methods. Moreover, our implementation is more practical and can be applied more generally, which we illustrate with examples of generic quintic curves and quartic surfaces.", "paper_title": "Improvements to the Deformation Method for Counting Points on Smooth Projective Hypersurfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000363243400002"}
