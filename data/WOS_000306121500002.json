The power amplifier model assesses the impact of linear memory effects within the system using a Wiener representation, and employs a linear novel parametric estimation technique using Hilbert space. In addition, in order to model the nonlinear memory effects the previous topology is generalized by inserting the truncated Volterra filter before the static nonlinearity. Predistortion based on the Hammerstein model is introduced to deal with the nonlinear response. The new general algorithm is proposed to evaluate the Hammerstein model parameters for an OFDM system. A representative test bed was designed and implemented. The assessment of the new methods for PA and PD modeling are confirmed by experimental measurements. The measurement results reveal the preference of the new techniques over the existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Quantifying and cancelation memory effects in high power amplifier for OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121500002"}
