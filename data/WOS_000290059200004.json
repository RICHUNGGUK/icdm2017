This paper presents three heuristic optimization methods: the multi-start global best descent local search (MGB), the meta-simulated annealing (SA) and the meta-threshold acceptance (TA). Penalty functions are used for unfeasible solutions. The structure is defined by 49 discrete design variables and the objective function is the cost of the structure. All methods are applied to a vault of 12.40 m of horizontal free span, 3.00 m of vertical height of the lateral walls and 1.00 m of earth cover. This paper presents two original moves of neighborhood search and an algorithm for the calibration of SA-TA algorithms. The MGB algorithm appears to be more efficient than the SA and the TA algorithms in terms of mean results. However, the SA outperforms MGB and TA in terms of best results. The optimization method indicates savings of about 10% with respect to a traditional design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
