Recently, several authentication schemes have been proposed. This short paper shows some security problems and design weaknesses in those schemes. Furthermore, an enhanced two-factor user authentication protocol is presented. The proposed scheme only uses hash function, and a successful user authentication just requires three message exchanges. Security and performance analyses demonstrate that compared to the well-known authentication schemes, our proposal is more secure and efficient.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Two-factor User Authentication Scheme in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282866600006"}
