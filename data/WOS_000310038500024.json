To control the motion of traffic for visualization and animation purposes, we utilize the popular follow-the-leader method to simulate various vehicle types and intelligent driving styles. We also introduce a continuous lane-changing model to imitate the vehicle's decision-making process and dynamic interactions with neighboring vehicles. By applying our approach in several typical urban traffic scenarios, we demonstrate that our system can well visualize vehicles' behaviors in a realistic manner on complex road networks and generate immersive traffic flow animations with smooth accelerating strategies and flexible lane changes.
