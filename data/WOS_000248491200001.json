We develop a technique that can be used to model the behavioral characteristics from the captured data using artificial neural networks. In addition, we present an architecture and implementation for the detector, which cover all the phases of the biometric data flow including the detection process. Experimental data illustrating the experiments conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed detection technique are presented and analyzed. Specifically, three series of experiments are conducted. The main experiment, in which 22 participants are involved, reproduces real operating conditions in computing systems by giving participants an individual choice of operating environments and applications; 284 hours of raw mouse data are collected over 998 sessions, with an average of 45 sessions per user. The two other experiments, involving seven participants, provided a basis for studying the confounding factors arising from the main experiment by fixing the environment variables. In the main experiment, the performance results presented using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and a confusion matrix yield at the crossover point ( that is, the threshold set for an equal error rate) a false acceptance rate ( FAR) of 2.4649 percent and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 2.4614 percent.", "paper_title": "A new biometric technology based on mouse dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000248491200001"}
