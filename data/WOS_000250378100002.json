The results presented and discussed were obtained through analyses performed using the finite element code ABAQUS and discretising the columns by means of fine 4-node shell element meshes. The columns analysed (i) are simply supported (end sections locally/globally pinned and free-to-warp), (ii) have cross-section dimensions that ensure equal local-plate and distortional critical buckling stresses, thus maximising the local-plate/distortional mode interaction effects, and (iii) contain critical-mode initial geometrical imperfections that exhibit different shapes but share the same combined amplitude. The numerical post-buckling results reported consist of (i) elastic and elastic-plastic non-linear equilibrium paths, (ii) curves and figures describing how the column deformed configuration (expressed as a linear combination of its local-plate and distortional components) evolves along the elastic post-buckling equilibrium paths and (iii) figures providing a clear visualisation of the (iii(1)) evolution of the elastic-plastic column deformed configurations, (iii(2)) the growth of the plastic strains and (iii(3)) failure mechanisms exhibited by a fairly large portion of the elastic-plastic columns that were analysed in this work.
