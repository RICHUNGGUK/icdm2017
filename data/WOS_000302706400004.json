In a practical system the shutter of the camera is not synchronised with the vibrations it is subjected to. So, we propose a novel method for frame selection according to their degree of blurring and we combine a tracker with the sequence of selected frames to identify the subimages containing the region of interest. The extracted subimages are subsequently co-registered using a state of the art sub-pixel registration algorithm. Further selection of the co-registered subimages takes place, according to the confidence in the registration result. Finally, the subimage of interest is super-resolved using a state of the art super-resolution algorithm. The proposed frame selection method is of generic applicability and it is validated with the help of manual frame quality assessment.", "paper_title": "Super-resolution in practice: the complete pipeline from image capture to super-resolved subimage creation using a novel frame selection method", "paper_id": "WOS:000302706400004"}
