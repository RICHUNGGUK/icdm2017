In this paper we examined these three citation databases through the citations of the book \"Introduction to informetrics\" by Leo Egghe and Ronald Rousseau. Scopus citations are comparable to Web of Science citations when limiting the citation period to 1996 and onwards (the citation coverage of Scopus)-each database covered about 90% of the citations located by the other. Google Scholar missed about 30% of the citations covered by Scopus and Web of Science (90 citations), but another 108 citations located by Google Scholar were not covered either by Scopus or by Web of Science. Google Scholar performed considerably better than reported in previous studies, however Google Scholar is not very \"user-friendly\" as a bibliometric data collection tool at this point in time. Such \"microscopic\" analysis of the citing documents retrieved by each of the citation databases allows us a deeper understanding of the similarities and the differences between the databases.", "paper_title": "Citations to the \"Introduction to informetrics\" indexed by WOS, Scopus and Google Scholar", "paper_id": "WOS:000275124700005"}
