Evidently, this multi-constraint problem renders it difficult to solve. To overcome this difficulty, we firstly transform it into its equivalent formulation with a single constraint. Then by utilizing BC-MAC duality, the problem of BC transmitter design can be solved by focusing on a dual MAC problem, which is easier to deal with due to its convexity property. Finally we propose an efficient two-level iterative algorithm to search the optimal solution. Our simulation results are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that this proposed CR MMSE-based scheme achieves a suboptimal sum-rate performance compared to the optimal DPC-based algorithm with less computational complexity.", "paper_title": "MMSE Transmit Optimization for Multiuser Multiple-Input Single-Output Broadcasting Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326743500003"}
