The subtle changes in amplitude and duration of these waves indicate various pathological conditions. It is very difficult to decipher minute changes in the ECG wave by naked eye. Hence a computer aided diagnosis tool to classify various cardiac diseases will assist the doctors in their ECG reading. In this paper, five types of ECG beats (ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998 standard) of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database were automatically classified. Our proposed methodology involves computation of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients from the segmented beats of ECG, which were then subjected for principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. Then the clinically significant principal components were fed to (i) feed forward neural network, (ii) least square support vector machine with different kernel functions, and (iii) Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) for automatic classification. We have obtained the highest average sensitivity of 98.69%, specificity of 99.91%, and classification accuracy of 99.52% with the developed knowledge based system. The developed system is clinically ready to deploy for mass screening programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
