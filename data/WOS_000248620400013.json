The formal representation of other aspects of canonical anatomy, such as connectedness and adjacency relations between anatomical parts, their shape and size as well as the spatial arrangement of anatomical parts within larger anatomical structures are, however, much less well understood and represented in existing computational anatomical and bio-medical ontologies only insufficiently. Results: In this article, we provide a methodology of how to incorporate this kind of information into anatomical and bio-medical ontologies by applying techniques of representing qualitative spatial information from Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we focus on how to explicitly take into account the qualitative and time-dependent character of these relations. As a running example, we use the human temporomandibular joint (TMJ).", "paper_title": "The qualitative and time-dependent character of spatial relations in biomedical ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400013"}
