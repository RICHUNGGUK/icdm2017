For instance, alert messages transmitted by vehicles in poor traffic conditions allow receivers to avoid congested roads and reduce travel time. Such systems are of great practical interest and may provide excellent results in urban conditions due to the presence of numerous potential partners for most vehicles. Unfortunately, many applications already use the wireless transmission medium in cities, leading to frequent problems with saturation. In order to avoid such issues, FDTIS must generate as few transmissions as possible, while remaining effective. In the specific context of congestion avoidance, we present a method that improves the efficiency of traffic alert messages by directing them to the geographic regions where they are most useful. This method uses past trajectory data from the vehicles involved in a traffic jam, thus decreasing the number of messages. We compared the performance of our method in simulation to a reference implementation and showed that, in the case of intensive traffic, this method prevents saturation of the wireless medium which would have resulted in a general degradation in performance. From a macroscopic point of view, we also showed that the improvement in medium usage obtained had no impact on the ability of our system to ease traffic jams. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
