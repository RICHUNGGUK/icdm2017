The growing awareness on the opaque data management operated by many providers reveals that a privacy-aware service that protects user information from privacy leaks would be very attractive for a consistent portion of users. In order to meet this need we propose LotusNet, a framework for the development of social network services relying on a peer-to-peer paradigm which supports strong user authentication. We tackle the trade-off problem between security, privacy and services in distributed social networks by providing the users the possibility to tune their privacy settings through a very flexible and fine-grained access control system. Moreover, our architecture is provided with a powerful suite of high-level services that greatly facilitates custom application development and mash up. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
