The problem can be solved using dynamic graph connectivity. We obtain the running time by using offline graph connectivity which assumes that the deletion time of every arc inserted is known at the time of insertion. The algorithm is implemented and experimental results are given. In addition, we reduce the offline graph connectivity problem to computing the Reeb graph.", "paper_title": "A Deterministic Time Algorithm for the Reeb Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000320672400007"}
