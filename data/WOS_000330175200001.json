Under the FCFS discipline, the result on the waiting time is proved for the more general queue with subexponential service times and lighter interarrival times. Using the well-known Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) expressions for the probability distribution of the busy period of the queue, we decompose the busy period into a sum of a random number of independent random variables. The result is used to obtain the tail asymptotics for the waiting time distributions under the LCFS and ROS disciplines.", "paper_title": "Tail asymptotics of the waiting time and the busy period for the queues with subexponential service times", "paper_id": "WOS:000330175200001"}
