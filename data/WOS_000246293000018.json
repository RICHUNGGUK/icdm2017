A first version (v1.0) of this web service focuses on the interaction of DNA, RNA and hybrid base pairs linked by two or three hydrogen bonds with water, cations and/or anions. Data provided by SwS are updated on a weekly basis and can be used by: (i) those involved in molecular dynamics simulation studies for validation purposes; (ii) crystallographers for help in the interpretation of solvent density maps; and all those involved in (iii) drug design and, more generally, in (iv) nucleic acid structural studies. SwS provides also statistical data related to the frequency of occurrence of different types of base pairs in crystallographic structures and the conformation of the involved nucleotides. This web service has been designed to allow a maximum of flexibility in terms of queries and has also been developed with didactic considerations in mind.", "paper_title": "SwS: a solvation web service for nucleic acids", "paper_id": "WOS:000246293000018"}
