It can be used to trace temperature time series, computing the peak temperature, and evaluating organic-matter maturation in a contact aureole. The theoretical basis of the program is a complete one-dimensional heat transfer model, and, hence, the program can allow for numerous potential influencing factors on the heat transfer, involving magma crystallization, volatilization and the supercritical state of pore water, dehydration and decarbonation reactions of host rock matrix, instantaneous and finite-time magma intrusion mechanisms, and hydrothermal convection in host rocks. This ensures that the program can be applicable to study different igneous intrusions in various geological conditions. MagmaHeatNS1D features a graphical user interface for controlling program execution, displaying real-time results, outputting final results, and opening secondary windows which serve to input the model parameters. MagmaHeatNS1D can be used in an intuitive framework for educational and research purposes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
