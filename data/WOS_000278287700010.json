Most of the existing keyword query approaches adopt the subtrees rooted at the smallest lowest common ancestors of the keyword matching nodes as the basic result units. The structural relationships among XML nodes are excessively emphasized but the semantic relevance is not fully exploited. To change this situation, we propose the concept of entity subtree and emphasis the semantic relevance among different nodes as querying information from XML. In our approach, keyword query cases are improved to a new keyword-based query language, Grouping and Categorization Keyword Expression (GCKE) and the core query algorithm, finding entity subtrees (FEST) is proposed to return high quality results by fully using the keyword semantic meanings exposed by GCKE. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach through extensive experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
