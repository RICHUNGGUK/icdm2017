Both uniform undrained shear strength and linearly increasing with depth shear strength profiles are considered. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are presented, which are used to identify the predominant failure modes and to calculate the reduction in lateral resistance due to group effects. A limited number of two-dimensional analyses are also presented in order to examine the behaviour of very closely spaced piles. It is shown that, contrary to current practice, group effects vary with depth; they are insignificant close to the ground surface, increase to a maximum value at intermediate depths and finally reduce to a constant value at great depth. The effect of pile spacing and pile soil adhesion are investigated and equations are developed for the calculation of a depth dependent reduction factor, which when multiplied by the limiting lateral pressure along a single pile, provides the corresponding variation of soil pressure along a pile in a pile row. This reduction factor is used to perform p-y analyses, which show that, due to this variation of group effects on the lateral soil pressures with depth, the overall group interaction effects depend on the pile length. Comparisons are also made with approaches used in practice that assume constant with depth reduction factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
