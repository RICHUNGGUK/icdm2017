In computer-to-computer protocols, it has long been accepted that assurances of freshness such as random nonces are required to prevent replay attacks. Typically, no such assurance of freshness is presented to a human in a human-and-computer protocol. A Computer-HUman Recognisable Nonce (CHURN) is a computer-aided random sequence that the human has a measure of control over and input into. Our approach overcomes limitations such as 'humans cannot do random' and that humans will follow the easiest path. Our findings show that CHURNs are significantly more random than values produced by unaided humans; that humans may be used as a second source of randomness, and we give measurements as to how much randomness can be gained from humans using our approach; and that our CHURN-generator makes the user feel more in control, thus removing the need for complete trust in devices and underlying protocols. We give an example of how a CHURN may be used to provide assurances of freshness and authentication for humans in a widely used protocol.", "paper_title": "CHURNs: Freshness Assurance for Humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000014"}
