This work is extended from our original ideas [5],[4], in which a document is represented by a set of fuzzy concepts. The importance degree of these fuzzy concepts characterize the semantics of documents and can be calculated by a specified aggregation function of index terms. Based on this representation, a general framework is proposed and applied to text categorization problem. An algorithm is given in detail for choosing fuzzy concepts. Experiments on the real-world data set show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional method for text representation in text categorization.", "paper_title": "A general fuzzy-based framework for text representation and its application to text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000073"}
