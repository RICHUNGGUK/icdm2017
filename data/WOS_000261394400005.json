Combined with a novel microarchitecture approach, these new technologies allow for implementation of a combined inputcrosspoint queuing (CICQ), single-chip 32 x 32 switch as the core for a future fabric on a chip (FoC). This switch operates directly on variable-size packets, reducing overall data path complexity and increasing effective bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Building an FoC Using Large, Buffered Crossbar Cores", "paper_id": "WOS:000261394400005"}
