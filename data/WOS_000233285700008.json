The procedure is based on visualization techniques such as slicing by parallel planes.. Scan Line Segment and Z-buffer methods. By these procedures, the fitness of the part geometric design for manufacturing process is evaluated. Part demoldability and parting line are defined, with an outstanding improvement of the traditional methods used for mold design purposes. Therefore, this approach focuses on Design for Manufacturing research area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
