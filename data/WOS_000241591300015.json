This effect is even worsened by the usage of hierarchical data and - if implemented in a naive way - leads to both increased storage requirements (neighbourhoodrelations possibly modified difference stencils) and a less efficient data access (worse locality of data and additional data dependencies), in addition. Our approach to overcome this quandary between numerical and hardware-efficiency relies on structured but still highly flexible adaptive grids, the so-called space-partitioning grids, cell-oriented operator evaluations, and the construction of very efficient data structures based on the concept of space-filling curves. The focus of this paper is in particular on the technical and algorithmical details concerning the interplay between data structures, space-partitioning grids and space-filling curves.", "paper_title": "Cache-optimal data-structures for hierarchical methods on adaptively refined space-partitioning grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300015"}
