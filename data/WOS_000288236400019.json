This unusually fast reactivity has been the subject of much investigation. In order to suggest an explanatory mechanism for the enhanced polymerization rates we have conducted quantitative structure-activity relationship investigations of these novel monomers. These studies have resulted in statistically sound models with coefficients of multiple determination of R(2) > 0.93. Principal component and k nearest neighbor similarity analysis were also conducted on the multiple regression models. These results are discussed in light of published experimental investigations of the photopolymerization reactivity of the novel monomers.
