We consider simplification of the key establishment logic and enhancement of the connectivity via plat polynomial assignment on a three-dimensional grid for node allocation and keying material assignment. We demonstrate that our scheme results in improvements via a detailed discussion on the connectivity, resource usage, security features and resiliency. A comparison with other relevant works from the literature along with a demonstrated implementation on typical sensor nodes shows the feasibility of the introduced scheme and its applicability for large networks.", "paper_title": "Grid-Based Key Pre-Distribution in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933800005"}
