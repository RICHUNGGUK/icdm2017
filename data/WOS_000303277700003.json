An axiomatic system of the Owen value for fuzzy games with a coalition structure is obtained by extending the corresponding characterizations given by Owen. The relationship between the Owen value and the fuzzy core of fuzzy games with a coalition structure is shown. In order to better understand the Owen value for fuzzy games with a coalition structure, we further research the Owen values for four special kinds of fuzzy games with a coalition structure, and give their explicit forms.", "paper_title": "The Owen Value for Fuzzy Games with a Coalition Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000303277700003"}
