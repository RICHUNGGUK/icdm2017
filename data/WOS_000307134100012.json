In such a case. multiple secret images can be shared among a group of participants, and each secret image is associated with a (potentially different) access structure. We employ Hsu et al.'s multi-secret sharing scheme based on monotone span programs (MSP) to propose a multi-threshold secret image sharing scheme. In our scheme, according to the real situation, we pre-defined the corresponding access structures. Using Hsu et al.'s method, we can achieve shadow data from multiple secret images according to these access structures. Then, we utilize the least significant bits (LSB) replacement to embed these shadow data into the cover image. Each secret image can be reconstructed losslessly by collecting a corresponding qualified subset of the shadow images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is feasible and efficient. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
