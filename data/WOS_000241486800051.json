A novel system which consists on a hierarchical architecture is proposed. Each level is devoted to one of the main tracking functionalities: target detection, low-level tracking, and high-level tasks such as target-appearance representation, or event management. Secondly, tracking performances are enhanced by on-line building and updating multiple appearance models. Successful experimental results are accomplished on sequences with significant illumination changes, grouping, splitting and occlusion events.", "paper_title": "Unconstrained multiple-people tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800051"}
