In this work a new compressed sampling method of miniature microphone array is proposed, which compresses information in the internal of ADC by means of mixture system of hardware circuit and software program in order to remove the redundancy of the different array element signals. The architecture of the method is developed using the Verilog language and has already been tested in the FPGA chip. Experiments of compressed sampling and reconstruction show the successful sparseness and reconstruction for speech sources. Owing to having avoided singularity problem of the correlation matrix of the miniature microphone array, when used in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in digital hearing aids, the proposed method has the advantage of higher resolution compared with the traditional GCC and MUSIC algorithms.", "paper_title": "Compressed Sampling and Source Localization of Miniature Microphone Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000342783900011"}
