The fuzzy models were formed as simple rules using only linguistic variables. A fuzzy logic algorithm was devised for estimating the elastic modulus of SFRC from compressive strength. Fibers used in all of the mixes were made of steel, and they were in different volume fractions and aspect ratios. Fiber volume fractions of the concrete mixtures have changed between 0.25%-6%. The results of the proposed approach in this study were compared with the results of equations in standards and codes for elastic modulus of SFRC. Error estimation was also carried out for each approach. In the study, the lowest error deviation was obtained in proposed fuzzy logic approach. The fuzzy logic approach was rather useful to quickly and easily predict the elastic modulus of SFRC.", "paper_title": "Prediction of elastic modulus of steel-fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) using fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000305589400005"}
