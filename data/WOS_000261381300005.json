Three main features of SPICESoft are described, namely Sensitivity Analysis, Circuit Performance Analysis, and Inverse Circuit Performance Analysis. A new methodology called Binary Differential Expansion used for data interpolation is also described in this paper. The relationship between device and process parameters is covered. The simulation results obtained using the proposed automated tool are compared with those of conventional computation.", "paper_title": "SPICESoft: AUTOMATED TOOL FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS, AND INVERSE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261381300005"}
