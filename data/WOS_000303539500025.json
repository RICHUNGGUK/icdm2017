In this study, we explore the mechanism directing the structure variation from alpha/4 beta-fold protein to 3 alpha-fold protein after mutation by conducting REMD simulation on 42 replicas with temperatures ranging from 270 K to 710 K. The simulation began from a protein possessing the primary structure of GA88 but the tertiary structure of GB88, two G proteins with \"high sequence identity.\" Albeit the large C alpha-root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the folded protein (4.34 angstrom at 270 K and 4.75 angstrom at 304 K), a variation in tertiary structure was observed. Together with the analysis of secondary structure assignment, cluster analysis and principal component, it provides insights to the folding and unfolding pathway of 3 alpha-fold protein and alpha/4 beta-fold protein respectively paving the way toward the understanding of the ongoings during conformational variation.", "paper_title": "Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation of structure variation from alpha/4 beta-fold to 3 alpha-fold protein", "paper_id": "WOS:000303539500025"}
