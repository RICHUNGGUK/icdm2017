If this is done for a group of authors (e. g. from the same institute) then we can again list these authors in decreasing order of their h-indices and from this, one can calculate the h-index of (part of) this institute. One can go even further by listing institutes in a country in decreasing order of their h-indices and calculate again the h-index as described above. Such h-indices are called by SCHUBERT [2007] \"successive\" h-indices. In this paper we present a model for such successive h-indices based on our existing theory on the distribution of the h-index in Lotkaian informetrics. We show that, each step, involves the multiplication of the exponent of the previous h-index by 1/alpha where alpha > 1 is a Lotka exponent. We explain why, in general, successive h-indices are decreasing. We also introduce a global h-index for which tables of individuals (authors, institutes,.) are merged. We calculate successive and global h-indices for the (still active) D. De Solla Price awardees.", "paper_title": "Modelling successive h-indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000261950000001"}
