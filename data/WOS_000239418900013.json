In order to guarantee high end-to-end quality of service and security, Beyond-3G networks will cope with some issues such as session security in wireless environments and seamless mobility among different coverage domains and, possibly, access technologies. In this paper we analyze the security threats emerging from some mechanisms for mobility management, and we propose a solution to improve the security level under the assumption that both communicating terminals are attached to a 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem that supports both the Session Initiation Protocol and the Mobile IP version 6 protocol.", "paper_title": "MIPv6 binding authentication for B3G networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239418900013"}
