In this paper, we propose a new physical layer air-link technology, which combines the advantages of CDMA and OFDM technologies. More specifically, we apply the column-wise complementary codes to the original OFDM-based physical layer design, which can effectively mitigate the Doppler effect under high-speed communication scenarios. The superiority of the new architecture is demonstrated by mathematical analysis and extensive computer simulations. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, the presented analysis provides a more deep insight into the key performance bottleneck in the emerging short-range communications (DSRC) technology. Second, the proposed air link architecture can be implemented with a relatively low implementation complexity, which is desirable for practical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
