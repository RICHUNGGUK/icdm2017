ICT provide new representation languages that allow the development of new learning scenarios, and the educative institutions must know and use such new technologies for improving their processes. In this sense, ontologies and semantic web technologies constitute appropriate technologies for knowledge management in educational settings as it has been demonstrated in recent years. In this paper, we present a system that has been developed with teachers of a Secondary School that uses ontologies to support the development and management of the educative curriculum. We will describe both the functionality of the system and how the semantic technologies have been smoothly included into the Gescur platform. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
