First, this information was limited to simple binary states such as online, offline or busy. However, this is, currently, evolving towards a much more generic, flexible concept to include all context that allows users or applications to adapt and control communications in a more efficient and personalized manner. Presence paves the way for the deployment of advanced communication services and is therefore a key component in the Next-Generation Networks (NGNs). These networks aim to unify fixed and mobile networks in order to provide users with global connectivity to always-on multimedia services. The main barrier to the implantation of next-generation presence-based services is the great amount of traffic involved in the distribution of presence information across domains. We study two strategies described in IETF drafts and one novel solution for reducing inter-domain presence traffic. We present the analytical formulas that calculate the traffic for the three strategies. Building on the analytical results, we analyze the factors that have impact on these strategies and study the suitability of each one under different conditions.", "paper_title": "STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING INTER-DOMAIN PRESENCE TRAFFIC: AN ANALYTICAL STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000285686600003"}
