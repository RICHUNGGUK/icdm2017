Original PAROLE/SIMPLE lexicons contain morphological, syntactic and semantic information, organized according to a common model and to common linguistic specifications for 12 European languages. The data set we describe includes the PAROLE/SIMPLE model mapped to lemon and LexInfo ontology and the Spanish & Catalan lexicons. All data are published in the Data Hub and are distributed under CC Attribution 3.0 Unported license. The Spanish lexicon contains 199466 triples and 7572 lexical entries fully annotated with syntactic and semantic information. The Catalan lexicon contains 343714 triples and 20545 lexical entries annotated with syntactic information half of which are also annotated with semantic information. In this paper we describe the resulting data, the mapping process and the benefits obtained. We demonstrate that the Linked Open Data principles prove essential for datasets such as original PAROLE/SIMPLE lexicons where harmonization and interoperability were crucial. The resulting data is lighter and better suited for exploitation. In addition, it facilitates further extensions and linking to external resources such as WordNet, lemonUby, DBpedia etc.", "paper_title": "PAROLE/SIMPLE 'lemon' ontology and lexicons", "paper_id": "WOS:000357876600006"}
