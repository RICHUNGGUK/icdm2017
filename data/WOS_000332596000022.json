In this scheme, the SSLs oriented in a linear chain mutually couple with the adjacent SSLs and they are subjected to identical unidirectional injections from the CSL which is a chaotic external cavity semiconductor laser. We theoretically analyze the conditions for different types of chaos synchronization based on the symmetry operation mechanism and injection-locking mechanism, and numerically investigate the influences of operation parameters, parameter mismatch robustness, chaos pass filtering effects and communication performance of the hybrid coupling semiconductor laser system. The simulation results demonstrate that with proper selection of the unidirectional and mutual coupling conditions, the SSLs can synchronize with each other isochronally and simultaneously synchronize to the CSL completely or laggardly, which enables the proposed system to achieve a unidirectional broadcasting communication from the CSL to the SSLs and a bidirectional communication among the SSLs simultaneously. The proposed scheme is beneficial to the implementation of optical chaos communication networks.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous unidirectional and bidirectional chaos-based optical communication using hybrid coupling semiconductor lasers", "paper_id": "WOS:000332596000022"}
