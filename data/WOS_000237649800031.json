These days, some kinds of clothes are often required to perform the multiple images by transforming the shapes of clothes. In this case, reconfigurable clothes - that is, clothes that can be reconfigured by an electronic device - can be very useful way. In this study, an embedded controller using wireless sensor network (WSN) is proposed to change the shape of the clothes and also collect the information on the show-stage and clothes configuration. To perform reconfigurable clothes, remote operator based on WSN is mounted on a jacket or a trouser and control clothes. The structure of the controller, mounting method, networking method, and the configuration method are discussed in detail. To verify our design, a fashion-show example is provided. By real performance with fashion model wearing these reconfigurable clothes, the usefulness of this method and validness of a WSN application to reconfigurable clothes is verified.", "paper_title": "Design of the configurable clothes using mobile actuator-sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800031"}
