In addition, the various steady state solutions are likely to differ in terms of stability and phase behaviors, which is an important consideration for practical applications. A chemical process is used in this paper to demonstrate how to analyze process stability and controllability. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that overall system stability and phase behaviors should be considered because the individual unit operations or subsystems differ from the total system in terms of these features. Therefore, the analysis of stability and controllability of process systems is important in terms of the design of inherently safer processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
