We obtain capacity of block-memoryless and asymptotically block-memoryless channels with block-memoryless or weakly decorrelating side information. Our coding theorems rely on causal generation of the codewords relative to the causal transmitter CSI. The CSI need not be perfect, and we consider the case where the transmitter and receiver have the same causal CSI as well as the case where the transmitter CSI is a deterministic function of the receiver CSI. For block-memoryless an asymptotically block-memoryless channels, our coding strategy averages mutual information density over multiple transmission blocks to achieve the maximum average mutual information. We apply the coding theorem associated with the block-memoryless channel to determine the capacity and optimal input distribution of intersymbol interference (ISI) time-varying channels with causal perfect CSI about the time-varying channel. The capacity of this channel cannot be found through traditional decomposition methods.", "paper_title": "Capacity of time-varying channels with causal channel side information", "paper_id": "WOS:000244497100002"}
