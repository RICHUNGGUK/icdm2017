Previous versions of this software built up a quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPR/QSAR) based on representation of the molecular structure by the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). The present study has shown that the novel 'hybrid' representation of molecular structure by combination of SMILES and the molecular graph can improve the predictive potential of CORAL models. The evaluation of this approach has been performed for a large (n = 460) set of heterogeneous organic compounds. The tested endpoint represent rate constants of hydroxyl radical reaction of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and (benzo-)triazoles. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
