We discuss the limitations of current mutation rate heuristic, showing that any fixed mutation rate can be expected to be suboptimal in terms of balancing exploration and exploitation. We then develop a mutation rate heuristic that offers a better balance by assigning different mutation rates to different subpopulations. When the mutation rate is assigned through a ranking of the population, according to fitness for example, we call the resulting algorithm a Rank GA. We show how this Rank GA overcomes the limitations of other heuristics on a set of model problems showing under what circumstances it might be expected to outperform a SGA with any choice of mutation rate.", "paper_title": "Limitations of Existing Mutation Rate Heuristics and How a Rank GA Overcomes Them", "paper_id": "WOS:000265091900011"}
