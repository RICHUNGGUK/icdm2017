In this paper, we investigate their security against related-key attacks. Our investigation shows that the full 16-round Cobra-F64a can be broken by our related-key rectangle attack and that the full 20-round Cobra-F64b can be broken by our related-key differential attack.", "paper_title": "Related-key attacks on the full-round Cobra-F64a and Cobra-F64b", "paper_id": "WOS:000240537600007"}
