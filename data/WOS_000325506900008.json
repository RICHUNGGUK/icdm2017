But, their model is not applicable for situation in which the production possibility set satisfies free disposability property. In this paper, we propose a new approach to this end in FDH model which improves the application potential of the Least-Distance Measure and overcomes the mentioned shortcoming. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated with two numerical examples and proves to be persuasive and acceptable to real-world problem.", "paper_title": "FINDING TARGET UNITS IN FDH MODEL BY LEAST-DISTANCE MEASURE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000325506900008"}
