It presents a study of an active power distribution law between stator and rotor sides. The DFIM is supplied by two voltages PWM inverters in stator and rotor. The power distribution law imposes a relation between rotoric and statoric pulsations. Due to this relation, a new variation structure of the DFIM speed control is presented. The four quadrants working are considered. Simulation results under Matlab-Simulink illustrate the performances of the power distribution law. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
