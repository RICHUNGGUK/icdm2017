Model transformation is a critical part of the use of MDE. It has been argued that transformations must be engineered systematically, particularly when the languages to which they are applied are large and complicated-e.g., UML 2.x and profiles such as MARTE-and when the transformation logic itself is complex. We present an approach to designing large model transformations for large languages, based on the principle of separation of concerns. Specifically, we define a notion of localized transformations that are restricted to apply to a subset of a modelling language; a composition of localized transformations is then used to satisfy particular MDE objectives, such as the design of very large transformations. We illustrate the use of localized transformations in a concrete example applied to large transformations for system-on-chip co-design.", "paper_title": "Localized model transformations for building large-scale transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000360764200008"}
