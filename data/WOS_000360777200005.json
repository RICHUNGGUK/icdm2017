Nevertheless, the potential of this resulting ecosystem may be threatened if security and privacy concerns are not properly addressed. In this work, we propose an ARM-compliant IoT security framework and its application on smart buildings scenarios, integrating contextual data as fundamental component in order to drive the building management and security behavior of indoor services accordingly. This framework is instantiated on a holistic platform called City explorer, which is extended with discovery and security mechanisms. Such platform has been validated in a reference smart building, where reasonable results of energy savings, services discovery and authorization are achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
