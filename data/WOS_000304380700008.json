In this work we combine geometrical and probabilistic aspects of the ensemble in order to obtain meaningful bounds for chi. This is done by constructing various correlation matrices involving fidelities between every pair of states from the ensemble. For K = 3 quantum states we design a matrix of root fidelities that is positive and the entropy of which is conjectured to upper bound chi. Slightly weaker bounds are established for arbitrary ensembles. Finally, we investigate correlation matrices involving multi-state correlations in relation to the Holevo quantity.", "paper_title": "MATRICES OF FIDELITIES FOR ENSEMBLES OF QUANTUM STATES AND THE HOLEVO QUANTITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000304380700008"}
