Error diffusion and image clustering techniques are adopted to achieve our objective. Experimental results and discussions show that the proposed scheme, with its smaller shadow size and lower computational complexity, obviously Outperforms previous VSS schemes designed either with or without the cheating prevention mechanism. Moreover, the use of a halftone logo gives an efficient solution to verifying whether the restored secret image is correct by using a halftone logo. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
