The market-based resources allocation model is considered as a good one. In this paper, a resources allocation model, based on reverse auction, was proposed, and its mechanism and related pricing algorithms were designed. In this model, a resources consumer invites a public bidding on the basis of his deadline and budget, then a resources provider bids according to his load, and the bidder who bids the cheapest price will win the auction. Numerous simulating experiments based on our proposed model was conducted, the experiments showed that our model can satisfy a user's QoS demand on deadline and budget, and have better performance in user utility, society utility, load-balance, job-completed rate than a commodity market-based resources allocation model.", "paper_title": "Reverse auction-based grid resources allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100017"}
