A new kind of graph, hexaMplot, is constructed to illustrate the meaningful expression patterns of normal-disease-drug in three-color experiment. The therapeutic and side effect of drugs can be understood and indicated by the different regions of hexaMplot. And the testing of correlation coefficient is explored as a statistical tool of the assessment. Such a methodology may prove useful in shortening the cycle, reducing the cost, and improving the efficiency of drug discovery and development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
