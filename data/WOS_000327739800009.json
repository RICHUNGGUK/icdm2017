We demonstrate this synergy through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) via backprojection, an image reconstruction method that can require hundreds of TFLOPS. Computation cost is significantly reduced by our new algorithm of approximate strength reduction; data movement cost is economized by software locality optimizations facilitated by advanced architecture support; parallelism is fully harnessed in various patterns and granularities. We deliver over 35 billion backprojections per second throughput per compute node on an Intel (R) Xeon (R) processor E5-2670-based cluster, equipped with Intel (R) Xeon Phi (TM) coprocessors. This corresponds to processing a 3Kx3K image within a second using a single node. Our study can be extended to other settings: backprojection is applicable elsewhere including medical imaging, approximate strength reduction is a general code transformation technique, and many-core processors are emerging as a solution to energy-efficient computing.", "paper_title": "Efficient backprojection-based synthetic aperture radar computation with many-core processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000327739800009"}
