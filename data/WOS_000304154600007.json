(i) If there is a problem in NP that requires 2(n Omega(1)) time at almost all lengths, then every many-one NP-complete set is complete under length-increasing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits. (ii) If there is a problem in co-NP that cannot be solved by polynomial-size nondeterministic circuits, then every many-one NP-complete set is complete under length-increasing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits. (iii) If there exist a one-way permutation that is secure against subexponential-size circuits and there is a hard tally language in NP boolean AND co-NP, then there is a Turing complete language for NP that is not many-one complete.", "paper_title": "Collapsing and Separating Completeness Notions Under Average-Case and Worst-Case Hypotheses", "paper_id": "WOS:000304154600007"}
