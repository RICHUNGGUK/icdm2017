Using Laplace transform techniques, we show that the method is first order accurate at the nth time level t(n), but the error bound includes a factor t(n)(-1) if we assume no smoothness of the initial data. We also show that for smoother initial data the growth in the error bound as t(n) decreases is milder, and in some cases absent altogether. Our error bounds generalize known results for the classical heat equation and are illustrated for a model problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
