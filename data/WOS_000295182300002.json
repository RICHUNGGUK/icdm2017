After giving an overview on related work this paper presents the adapted design methodology proposed by Wobbrock et al. (2009) for the development of a gesture-based user interface to a smart-home system. The findings for the new domain, device and gesture space are presented and compared to findings by Wobbrock et al. (2009). Three additional steps are described: A small pre-test survey, a mapping and a memory test and a performance test of the implemented system. This paper shows the adaptability of the approach described by Wobbrock et al. (2009) for three-dimensional gestures in the smart-home domain. Elicited gestures are described and a first implementation of a user interface based on these gestures is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
