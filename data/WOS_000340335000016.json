There are two main attributes of PVC pipes: diameter and color. Each attribute has a corresponding attribute setup time and usually has several different levels. Each extruder produces different PVC pipe products based on the diameters as large, middle and small. The alternatives exist between these extruders, where the large and the middle type extruders can be used to produce the PVC pipes with the other diameters; the small type extruders can be used to produce the PVC pipes with middle diameters but cannot produce those with large diameters. The processing times are longer in all of the alternatives among different types of extruders. The objective is to minimize the total completion time for the unrelated parallel machine problem. Three dedicated machine heuristics are proposed herein for the problem and have been evaluated by comparing with the current scheduling method used in the case plant. The computational results show that the proposed constructive heuristics outperform the current scheduling method with significant improvements and can be used to solve large-size problems in reasonable computational times.
