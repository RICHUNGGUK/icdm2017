In the existing literature, the harmonic mean is generally considered as a fusion technique of numerical data information. In this paper, we investigate the situations in which the input data are expressed in fuzzy values and develop Sortie fuzzy harmonic mean operators. such as fuzzy weighted harmonic mean operator, fuzzy ordered weighted harmonic mean operator, fuzzy hybrid harmonic mean operator, and so on. Especially all these operators can be reduced to aggregate interval or real numbers. Then based on the developed operators. we present an approach to multiple attribute group decision making and illustrate it with a practical example.
