This is the same as solving the TSEP problem for the highest satisfaction level of the decision maker. The proposed approach models the transmission expansion problem considering practical ambiguities as a fuzzy integer programming problem. It uses the branch and bound method that utilizes a network flow approach and the maximum flow-minimum cut set theorem. The resulting optimal strategy is a reasonable and flexible plan that would not significantly change due to changes in the surrounding situation. Test results indicate viability and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Transmission expansion planning considering ambiguities using fuzzy modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400011"}
