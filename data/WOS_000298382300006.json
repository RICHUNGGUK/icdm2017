Therefore, energy-efficient communications have been paid increasing attention under the background of limited energy resource and environmental-friendly transmission behaviors. In this article, basic concepts of energy-efficient communications are first introduced and then existing fundamental works and advanced techniques for energy efficiency are summarized, including information-theoretic analysis, OFDMA networks, MIMO techniques, relay transmission, and resource allocation for signaling. Some valuable topics in energy-efficient design are also identified for future research.", "paper_title": "ENERGY-EFFICIENT WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS: TUTORIAL, SURVEY, AND OPEN ISSUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000298382300006"}
