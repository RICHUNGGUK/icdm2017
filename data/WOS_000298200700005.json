Tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) analysis provides a means of assessing alterations in WM tracts. In this paper, both voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and TBSS are examined using DTI data of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and nonepileptic subjects. In addition to fractional anisotropy (FA), ellipsoidal area ratio (EAR) is used in this study. Significant reductions of FA and EAR are identified by TBSS in the parahippocampal white matter. Because of methodological differences, TBSS detects more localized abnormalities than VBM, while the EAR is more sensitive to WM alteration than FA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
