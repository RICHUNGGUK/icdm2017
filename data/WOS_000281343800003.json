Our results indicated that the organizational culture had an influence on SPI deployment, primarily made possible by a hierarchic culture with its emphasis on procedures, order, and stability. Clan culture, with its emphasis on human development, commitment to others, and participation, appears to be a necessary condition in creating skills development and sharing SPI knowledge in the process of its deployment. Software Engineering Program Group leaders should ensure that internal values are in place to enhance SPI deployment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
