Thus, it is necessary to perform an assessment at the initial stage of an ERP implementation program to identify weaknesses or problems which may lead to project failure. No definite practical solution could be found for these kinds of problems in the literature. In this paper, a new look at the determinants of a firm's readiness to implement an ERP project is presented and using fuzzy analytic network process a practical framework is developed. The firm's current conditions regarding ERP project can be determined and necessary changes prior to implementation of ERP system can be specified. The readiness for ERP implementation is decomposed into project management, organizational, and change management areas and the assessment factors are identified after comprehensive study of critical success factors on ERP implementation. The proposed framework is applied to a real case and the advantages are illustrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
