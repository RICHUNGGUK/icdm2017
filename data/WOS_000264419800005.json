Each packet transmission can be overheard by a subset of receiver nodes, with a transmission success probability that may vary from receiver to receiver and may also vary with time. We develop a simple backpressure routing algorithm that maximizes network throughput and expends an average power that can be pushed arbitrarily close to the minimum average power required for network stability, with a corresponding tradeoff in network delay. When channels are orthogonal, the algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner using only local link error probability information, and Supports a \"blind transmission\" mode (where error probabilities are not required) in special cases when the power metric is neglected and when there is only a single destination for all traffic streams. For networks with general inter-channel interference, we present a distributed algorithm with constant-factor optimality guarantees.
