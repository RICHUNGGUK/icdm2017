MSCTs and SSTs capture the motion and static characteristic of gait. These templates would be computed from the silhouette sequence directly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated experimentally using the SOTON data set and the USF data set. We compared our proposed algorithm with other research works on these two data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed templates are efficient for human identification in indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed algorithm has a recognition rate of around 85% on the SOTON data set. The recognition rate is around 80% in intrinsic difference group (probes A-C) of USF data set.
