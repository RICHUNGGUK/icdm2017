In this paper, a combination of a three-dimensional trochoidal tooth trajectory model (3D3T) and engagement-boundary chip model is developed to determine instantaneous chip thickness in 5-axis ball-end finish milling. In comparison with the chip volume measured in a commercial software package (Unigraphics) the accuracy of the proposed model has been numerically validated with various process parameters including cutting depth, tool-workpiece inclination and cutter runout. The differences in time-varying delay and dynamic chip thickness as well as stability are compared with different models to show the impact of using 3D3T mechanism for chip thickness modeling in 5-axis ball-end finish.
