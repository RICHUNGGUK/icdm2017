When there is insuf.cient space to store all intermediate results in high-speed memory (e.g. cache) existing approaches store selected stages of the computation, and recompute missing values from these checkpoints on an as-needed basis. Results: Here we present an optimal checkpointing strategy, and demonstrate its utility with pairwise local sequence alignment of sequences of length 10 000.", "paper_title": "Memory-efficient dynamic programming backtrace and pairwise local sequence alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258471500042"}
