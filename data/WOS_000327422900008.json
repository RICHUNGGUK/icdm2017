Statist. Data Anal. 55 (2011), pp. 1379-1393]. Our goal is to derive an adjusted likelihood ratio statistic that is approximately distributed as (2) with a high degree of accuracy. Although the adjusted statistic requires more computational effort than its unadjusted counterpart, it is shown that the adjustment term has a simple compact form that can be easily implemented in standard statistical software. Further, we compare the finite-sample performance of the three classical tests (likelihood ratio, Wald, and score), the gradient test that has been recently proposed by Terrell [The gradient statistic, Comput. Sci. Stat. 34 (2002), pp. 206-215], and the adjusted likelihood ratio test obtained in this article. Our simulations favour the latter. Applications of our results are presented.", "paper_title": "Small-sample likelihood inference in extreme-value regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900008"}
