It is commonly believed that an inter-frame method could achieve higher coding efficiency compared with an intra-frame one, due to the exploitation of video temporal redundancy. However, Motion JPEG 2000 has been selected as the digital cinema compression standard, and some existing work has demonstrated that JPEG 2000 is more suitable at HR situations. In this paper, we compare the rate-distortion (R-D) performance of these two different schemes and give more insight from both theoretical and experimental point of view. We derive an entropy-based R-D model to analyze the test results and the impact of residual entropy and quantization for inter-frame coding. Several extensions are introduced into H.264/AVC FRExt for HR video content for better performance. Experimental results show that these extensions lead to significantly higher coding efficiency and make our extended version more suitable for HR video coding (C) 2011 Elsevier inc.
