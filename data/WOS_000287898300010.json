According to traditional trajectory designs, a prescribed profile in a work space is first decomposed into independent joint positions such that the success in a contouring task lies with good tracking capability of individual joints. To advance trajectory control precision without relying on high tracking performance, a contour control strategy for a robot manipulator is presented in this paper. Different from the traditional concept of trajectory control, a contour following control strategy is developed via a coordinate transformation scheme. The main advantage of the proposed control architecture is that the final contouring accuracy will not be degraded in case the tracking performance of the robot manipulator is not good enough. Moreover, using a concept of variable structure control theory, a smooth robust control algorithm is realized in the form of proportional control plus an integration term. The robustness of the control algorithm is also demonstrated. A number of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the trajectories following control framework and validate the feasibility of the proposed controller. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
