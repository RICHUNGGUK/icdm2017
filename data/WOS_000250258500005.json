The formalism is characterized by the use of state transitions with guarded commands and timing constraints, the adoption of a few distilled statecharts constructs, and the modular specification of timing constraints along a state hierarchy. This paper proposes a translation of H-CRSM into UPPAAL which enables model checking. Translation rests on unfolding a hierarchical model on a flat representation. The resultant approach is demonstrated by means of a case study.
