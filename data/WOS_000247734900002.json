Each descriptor is applied on several clusters of objects or symbols. For each cluster and for any descriptor a pertinent map is directly carried out from the learning database. Then existing conflicts are assessed and integrated in such a map. At last, we show that the use of combination of descriptors enables to improve the recognition using real data.", "paper_title": "Improving the recognition by integrating the combination of descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000247734900002"}
