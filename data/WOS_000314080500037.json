Since the DCT and DST precodings concentrate energy into a few components, the hybrid application of the precodings to the real and imaginary parts of mapping symbols can significantly reduce the PAPR. Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly low PAPR without degrading the bit error rate (BER) compared to existing precoding schemes.", "paper_title": "Hybrid DCT/DST Precoding Scheme for the PAPR Reduction of OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500037"}
