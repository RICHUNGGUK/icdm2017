However, the generation of MA of complicated models is computation intensive since it is always generated from scratch even if a tiny modification is imposed. A novel local adaptation-based approach to generating the MA for efficient engineering analysis is proposed in this study. With this method, the MA of a resultant model constructed from two other models via a Boolean operation or parameter modification is generated by adapting the MAs of the operand models in a certain way, instead of regenerating the MA from scratch. First, several new properties of the MA which are the fundamental basis of the proposed method are investigated. Then, the boundaries that will vanish from or be added into the resultant model during the Boolean operation or parameter modification are found, and the region in which the MA segments (MASs) need to be regenerated is determined. Finally, the new MASs are generated for the region using an improved tracing method. The final MA of the resultant model is thus constructed by combining the newly generated MASs with the reserved MASs of the operated model(s). Some examples are given to illustrate the high computational efficiency of the proposed method for engineering analysis.", "paper_title": "A local adaptation-based generation method of medial axis for efficient engineering analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000316214500007"}
