In a within-subjects experiment, 44 participants were asked to play a touch-based game as quickly and accurately as possible across combinations Of the two independent variables. After finishing tasks in each condition, they filled out an evaluation questionnaire regarding tactile satisfaction, which addressed perceived feeling of pressing down on the surface, pleasantness, helpfulness, finger fatigue, and degree of elasticity. The results of this experiment show a main effect of touchscreen type on task performance, whereas input device type shows main effects on both task performance and satisfaction. Measures of five key sub-factors of subjective satisfaction are explained, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
