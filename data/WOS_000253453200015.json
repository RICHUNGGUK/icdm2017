Many kinds of electronic services have been developed. The most successful are the electronic payment systems such as the electronic cash/check and wallet. Most electronic payment systems are based on an elaborate discrete logarithm that raises an important issue regarding efficiency. Therefore, Hsien et al. proposed an electronic traveler's check system in 2001 using a discrete logarithm. In this paper, we propose a new electronic traveler's check system based on one-way hash function to improve efficiency and cost. Furthermore, our proposed scheme supports an on-line and off-line electronic traveler's check system of practical flexibility for use in the real world. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
