These deformations are realistic and give the user the impression of manipulating real-world objects. We also allow the user to specify the deformations using either sets of points or line segments, the later useful for controlling curves and profiles present in the image. For each of these techniques, we provide simple closed-form solutions that yield fast deformations, which can be performed in real-time.", "paper_title": "Image deformation using moving least squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000239817400009"}
