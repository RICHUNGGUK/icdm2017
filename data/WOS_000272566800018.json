We first formulate the logical problem. as \"All-Solution\" problems that is composed of logical expressions such as FOL, DL, and Horn Clauses. We then propose a method to solve the problem. including Skolem function based on a new theory of meaning-preserving Skolemization and also generate ET N rules from the logical problem. Finally, we show that we can acquire a sound answer front logical problems by transforming from ET rules to C programs, and executing the C programs.", "paper_title": "SOLVING \"ALL-SOLUTION\" PROBLEMS BY ET-BASED GENERATION OF PROGRAMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800018"}
