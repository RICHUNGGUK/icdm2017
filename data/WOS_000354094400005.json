This dynamic-programming-based algorithm, which is able to handle general n-ary constraints in an integrated manner, collects statistical data from the underlying EMF model and uses this information for optimization purposes. Additionally, the search plan generation algorithm itself and its runtime effects on the pattern matching engine have been evaluated by complexity analysis techniques and by quantitative performance measurements, respectively.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for generating model-sensitive search plans for pattern matching on EMF models", "paper_id": "WOS:000354094400005"}
