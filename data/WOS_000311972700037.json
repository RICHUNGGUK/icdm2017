This paper addresses two computational issues related to such a hyperbolic CVT framework: (1) efficient reduction of unnecessary site copies in neighbor domains on the universal covering space, based on two special rules; (2) GPU-based parallel algorithms to compute a discrete version of the hyperbolic CVT. Our experiments show that with the dramatically reduced number of unnecessary site copies in neighbor domains and the GPU-based parallel algorithms, we significantly speed up the computation of CVT for high-genus surfaces. The proposed discrete hyperbolic CVT guarantees to converge and produces high-quality results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
