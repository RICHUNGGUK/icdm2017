The knowledge is acquired and learned through the combination of NLP techniques for analyzing text fragments, the ontological technology for representing knowledge and MCRDR, a case-based reasoning methodology. This approach has been applied in the oncology domain and the results of this application are discussed in this work.", "paper_title": "A methodology for extracting ontological knowledge from Spanish documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700008"}
