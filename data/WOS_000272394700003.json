Having this vision in mind, Community Context-attribute-oriented Collaborative Information Environment (CCCIE) based Autonomous Decentralized Community System (ADCS) is proposed to enable provision of services to specific users if specific place at specific time considering various context-attributes. This paper presents autonomous community construction technology that share service discovered by one member among others in flexible way to improve timeliness and reduce network cost. In order to meet crucial goal of real-time and context-aware community construction (provision of service/service information to users with common interests), and defining flexible service area in highly dynamic operating environment of ADCS, proposed progressive ripple based service discovery technique introduces novel idea of snail's pace and steady, advancing search followed by swift boundary confining mechanism while service area construction shares the discovered service among members in defined area to further improve timeliness and reduce network cost. Analysis and empirical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Pull-Push Community Construction Technology for High-Assurance", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700003"}
