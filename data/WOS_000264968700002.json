Koblitz curves are a family of curves defined over F(2m). allowing notably faster computation. We discuss implementation of point multiplication on Koblitz curves with parallel field multipliers. We present a novel parallelization method utilizing point operation interleaving. FPGA implementations are described showing the practical feasibility of our method. They compute point multiplications on average in 4.9 mu s, 8.1 mu s, and 12.1 mu s on the standardized curves NIST K-163, K-233, and K-283, respectively, in an Altera Stratix II FPGA.
