The process of input delay is governed by a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain. By invoking an appropriate augmented state, the system is transformed into a standard structured uncertain time-delay Markov jump linear system (MJLS). For the resulting system, a multi-step feedback control law is utilised to minimise an upper bound on the expected value of performance objective. The proposed design has been proved to stabilise the closed-loop system in the mean square sense and to guarantee constraints on control inputs and system states. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Probability-based constrained MPC for structured uncertain systems with state and random input delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000318351900016"}
