In this paper, we introduce cognitive concepts to deal with the complexity in developing management software, and an interactive intelligent agency framework, called iSMAcy (intelligent System Management Agency), is developed as an integrated solution to realize adaptive system management. The cognitive concepts are applied at two levels. At micro level, the intentional agent kernel of functional agent use mental states such as beliefs, goals and intentions to realize integration of goal-directed behavior with situated reactive action. At macro level, high-level cognitive semantics such as goals, requests and commitments are interchanged among agents. An example of applying iSMAcy system on a simulated network management environment is described, and the efficiency of the intentional agent kernel is analyzed to ensure the reactivity of iSMAcy system.", "paper_title": "Intentional agency framework based on cognitive concepts to realize adaptive system management", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100122"}
