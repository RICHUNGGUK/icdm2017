The formation problem is firstly converted into a stability control problem, and then a distributed iterative learning scheme is developed for networks with switching topology. Based on the 2-D analysis approach, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the boundedness of formation errors during the whole motion process, and feedback matrix of the proposed iterative scheme can be further determined by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust formation control of discrete-time multi-agent systems by iterative learning approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200005"}
