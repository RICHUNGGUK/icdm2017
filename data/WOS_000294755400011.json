An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a 'splicing code' that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers. Methods: We formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features. Results: Using data for 3665 cassette exons, 1014 RNA features and 4 tissue types derived from 27 mouse tissues (http://genes.toronto.edu/wasp), we benchmarked several methods. Our method outperforms all others, and achieves relative improvements of 52% in splicing code quality and up to 22% in classification error, compared with the state of the art. Novel combinations of regulatory features and novel combinations of tissues that share feature subgroups were identified using our method.", "paper_title": "Bayesian prediction of tissue-regulated splicing using RNA sequence and cellular context", "paper_id": "WOS:000294755400011"}
