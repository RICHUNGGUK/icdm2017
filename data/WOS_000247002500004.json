Unfortunately, in real world applications, these assumptions may not hold. This paper deals with the problem of training a classifier when prior probabilities cannot be reliably induced from training data. Some strategies based on optimizing the worst possible case ( conventional minimax) have been proposed previously in the literature, but they may achieve a robust classification at the expense of a severe performance degradation. In this paper we propose a minimax regret ( minimax deviation) approach, that seeks to minimize the maximum deviation from the performance of the optimal risk classifier. A neural-based minimax regret classifier for general multi-class decision problems is presented. Experimental results show its robustness and the advantages in relation to other approaches.", "paper_title": "Minimax regret classifier for imprecise class distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000247002500004"}
