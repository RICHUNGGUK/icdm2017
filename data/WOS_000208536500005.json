To improve the communication of embodied conversational agent (ECA) systems with their human users, the importance of their capability to cover cultural differences emerged. Various excellent ECA systems are developed and proposed previously, however, the cross-culture communication issues are seldom addressed by researchers. This paper describes a short-term project aiming to explore the possibility of rapidly building multicultural and the multimodal ECA interfaces for a tour guide system by using a generic framework connecting their functional blocks.", "paper_title": "AN AGENT BASED MULTICULTURAL TOUR GUIDE SYSTEM WITH NONVERBAL USER INTERFACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536500005"}
