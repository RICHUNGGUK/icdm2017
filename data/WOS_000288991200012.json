Tadmor and P. Athavale, Inverse Probl. Imaging, 3 (2009), pp. 693-710]. These IDEs, which stem naturally from multiscale (BV, L-2) hierarchical decompositions, yield inverse scale representations of images in the sense that the BV-dual norms of their residuals are inversely proportional to the scaling parameters. Motivated by the fact that (BV, L-1) decomposition is more suitable for extracting local scale-space features than (BV, L-2), we introduce here the IDEs which arise from multiscale (BV, L-1) hierarchical decompositions. We study several variants of this (BV, L-1)-based IDE model, depending on modifications to the curvature term.", "paper_title": "Integro-Differential Equations Based on (BV, L-1) Image Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000288991200012"}
