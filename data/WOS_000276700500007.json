At first, a source image, which wears the most similar appearance to the damaged image, is searched from the image database by comparing with the features like texture, color and structural information. Then, scene filling in damaged region is completed by selecting appropriate object from the source image. After that, a cost function is employed to tackle the boundary line of the inpainted region and a color transfer algorithm is finally used to make the color appearance of the inpainted region be in harmony with that of its surroundings. Experimental results demonstrate that our developed algorithm is comparable with the state-of-art scene-completion algorithm proposed by Hays. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
