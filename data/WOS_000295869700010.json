In this paper, we propose a service selection approach based on the decomposition of global QoS constraints for ubiquitous web environment. The proposed approach consists of three steps. First, it adopts fuzzy logic control to adaptively decompose global QoS constraints into quality control lines. Second, mean particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to search optimal quality control lines. Finally, it uses local selection to find the best services according to optimal quality control lines obtained. Simulation results show our proposed approach is effective and efficient for web service selection in ubiquitous web environment.", "paper_title": "Web Service Selection Based on Adaptive Decomposition of Global QoS Constraints in Ubiquitous Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000295869700010"}
