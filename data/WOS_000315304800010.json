The plasmon field produced in the MNP excited by the external field can play the platform of Forster energy transfer between two SQDs which gives rise to the generation of entangled states. The Fano effect can be shown in the energy absorption spectrum of MNP, which originates from constructive or destructive interference between two competing optical pathways. Since the generated entangled state is in one pathway, the steady-state concurrence of entanglement can be evaluated by the observation of Fano profile. Because the concurrence of two SQDs is determined by both the pump intensity and the energy difference, one can properly choose these two parameters for detecting the non-negligible entanglement. When the pump intensity is very strong, there is no entanglement. The method to observe entanglement with the Fano profile, so, has a limited range of applicability. The optical observation is a novel approach to reveal entanglement. It may be used to optically detect quantum entanglement in many solid-state systems.", "paper_title": "OPTICAL DETECTION OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN TWO QUANTUM DOTS NEAR A METAL NANOPARTICLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304800010"}
