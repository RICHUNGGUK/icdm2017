In this paper, we invest the combination of the routing and rate control in a united convex optimization formulation and propose a distributed joint solution based on cross-layer design. We first develop a distortion model which captures both the impact of encoder quantization and packet loss due to network congestion on the overall video quality. Then, the optimal joint rate control and routing scheme is realized by adapting its rate to the time-varying traffic and minimizing the overall network congestion. Furthermore, simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint routing and rate control scheme in the context of wireless home networks.", "paper_title": "Joint Routing and Rate Control Scheme for Multi-Stream High-Definition Video Transmission over Wireless Home Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300010"}
