In this paper results from the weekly QC procedure are given. It seems that the homogeneity test as described in the addendum to the European protocol is able to detect detector problems and flat field calibration problems. However, visual inspection remains necessary. For the CR system in the trials the homogeneity test did not find many problems. Either the homogeneity test is not effective and other tests might be more appropriate or this CR system does not have relevant image quality variations and therefore might not require weekly quality control.", "paper_title": "Using a homogeneity test as weekly quality control on digital mammography units", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900036"}
