This paper proposes a type of wormhole attack model and its corresponding detection scheme. In this scheme, the combination of a number of techniques, such as distributed voting, watch-nodes-based detection and identity-based cryptosystem are used. The simulation results and qualitative analysis demonstrate the performance and cost of the proposed scheme are more advantageous over the some of the previous schemes.", "paper_title": "Watch-Nodes-Based Wormhole Attacks Detection in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000010"}
