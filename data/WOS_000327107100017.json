In this paper we present two skeletal representations of orthogonal shapes: the cube skeleton and a family of skeletal representations provided by the scale cube skeleton. Both skeletal representations rely on the L-infinity. metric. We show that the cube skeleton is homotopically equivalent to its original shape, reduces its dimension, and it is composed of line segments or planar polygons with restricted orientation. We also present an algorithm to compute the scale cube skeleton of orthogonal polygons and compare the presented skeletons with other skeletal representations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
