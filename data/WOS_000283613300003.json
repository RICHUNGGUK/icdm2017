We now begin the analytical study of circular FCA dynamics by considering a particular class of FCA (Weighted Average rules) which includes rules displaying most of the observed dynamics, and we precisely derive their behaviours. We confirm the empirical observations proving that all weighted average rules are periodic in time and space, and we derive their periods.", "paper_title": "On the Asymptotic Behaviour of Circular Fuzzy Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000283613300003"}
