The problem has been studied in a large number of papers, from both a theoretical and a computational point of view. In this paper, we conjecture that the problem possesses a so-called funneling landscape, a feature that is commonly found in molecular conformation problems. Based on this conjecture, we develop a stochastic search algorithm that displays excellent numerical performance. Thanks to this algorithm, we could improve over previously known putative optima in the range n <= 130 in as many as 32 instances, the smallest of which is n = 53.", "paper_title": "Disk Packing in a Square: A New Global Optimization Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000259912700004"}
