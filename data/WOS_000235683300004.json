However, due to their special spatio-temporal query conditions, trajectory queries are different from existing GIS queries, and there is still a lack of efficient data-access methods to support queries about trajectories. In view of this, we develop a data-access method, named a Topology-based Mixed Index Structure (TMIS), to index network-constrained trajectories for connectivity-based queries. The TMIS indeed is not a novel index structure but a novel combination of simple and classical index structures linked by the topology of a network. The TMIS can support more query types through different combinations of simple and classical index structures and can be applied to a large network. Existing database management systems can be employed to implement the TMIS. In this paper, we first define network-constrained trajectories and connectivity-based queries, and then introduce the principles, architecture, algorithms, and query processing of the TMIS. Finally, we implement the TMIS and validate it through a series of analyses and experiments.", "paper_title": "Indexing network-constrained trajectories for connectivity-based queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000235683300004"}
