Folded-concave penalization methods have demonstrated surprising developments in sparse learning problems due to their nice practical and theoretical properties. To share the same light of folded-concave penalization methods, we propose a new tensor completion model via folded-concave penalty for estimating missing values in tensor data. Two typical folded-concave penalties, the minmax concave plus (MCP) penalty and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, are employed in the new model. To solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop a local linear approximation augmented Lagrange multiplier (LLA-ALM) algorithm which combines a two-step LLA strategy to search a local optimum of the proposed model efficiently. Finally, we provide numerical experiments with phase transitions, synthetic data sets, real image and video data sets to exhibit the superiority of the proposed model over the nuclear norm penalization method in terms of the accuracy and robustness.
