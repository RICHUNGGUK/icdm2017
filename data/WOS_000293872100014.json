An example of those methods is the use of permeable coverings, but there are other important parameters like thermal inertia. To understand and predict these energy saving procedures, one may employ different software resources. In the present paper a review of existing software resources is carried out, and, as a consequence of this review, HAM tools were selected to simulate the indoor environment of school buildings. Results show that parameters like thermal inertia can interfere in the solar heat gains, changing the building time constant. Other parameters, like air changes per hour or the use of permeable coverings, present a clear enhancement of indoor environment conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
