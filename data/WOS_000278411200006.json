The critical temperature, as well as the critical point exponents are obtained. For the undirected case this random system belongs to the same universality class as the regular two-dimensional model. However, for the directed random lattice one has a second-order phase transition for q < q(c) and a first-order phase transition for q > q(c), where q(c) is the critical rewiring probability. The critical exponents for q < q(c) were calculated and they do not belong to the same universality class as the regular two-dimensional ferromagnetic model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
