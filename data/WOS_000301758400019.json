Among of its techniques, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has received considerable attention due to producing a parts-based representation of the data. Recent research has shown that not only the observed data are found to lie on a nonlinear low dimensional manifold, namely data manifold, but also the features lie on a manifold, namely feature manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called graph dual regularization non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF), which simultaneously considers the geometric structures of both the data manifold and the feature manifold. We also present a graph dual regularization non-negative matrix tri-factorization algorithm (DNMTF) as an extension of DNMF. Moreover, we develop two iterative updating optimization schemes for DNMF and DNMTF, respectively, and provide the convergence proofs of our two optimization schemes. Experimental results on UCI benchmark data sets, several image data sets and a radar HRRP data set demonstrate the effectiveness of both DNMF and DNMTF. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
