For a sequence of n k-bit integers, k <= O(log n), our data structures require asymptotically the same amount of storage as the compressed sequence if compressed using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. The basic structure supports range sum queries in O(log n) time. With an increase by a constant factor in the storage Complexity, the query time can be improved to O(log log n+k).", "paper_title": "Opportunistic data structures for range queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000236792900003"}
