Some of these gates may become faulty in the field due to natural causes or malicious attacks, which may lead to the generation of erroneous outputs by the multiplier. In this paper, we propose new architectures to detect erroneous outputs caused by certain types of faults in bit-parallel and bit-serial polynomial basis multipliers over finite fields of characteristic two. In particular, parity prediction schemes are developed for detecting errors due to single and certain multiple stuck-at faults. Although the issue of detecting soft errors in registers is not considered, the proposed schemes have the advantage that they can be used with any irreducible binary polynomial chosen to define the finite field.", "paper_title": "Fault detection architectures for field multiplication using polynomial bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000239159700004"}
