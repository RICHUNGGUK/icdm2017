The number of plausible mechanisms can be very large, even for systems with a small number of reactions and components. Usually, only a restricted number of models are investigated in detail, since the evaluation of a large number of complex models is extremely time-consuming. In this work, a methodology is described, which allows performing efficiently a global search within all plausible models and parameter sets using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The developed methodology is applied to the parameter estimation and model optimization of the partial oxidation of ethane reaction network. The present approach allows the reliable investigation of a considerable number of models mechanisms in an automatic manner and in a short computational time. It appears to be a very effective way to optimize complex reaction mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
