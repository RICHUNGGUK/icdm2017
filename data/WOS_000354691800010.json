In order to contribute to the development of design guidelines in this design space, we conducted an exploratory, mixed methods study. We investigated three top-down approaches to designing intuitive interaction mappings for a whole body system implemented with camera vision. These were metaphoric, isomorphic and 'everyday' or conventional. In order to identify some of the benefits and limitations of each approach, we compared the designs based on measures of usability, intuitiveness and engagement with the material represented in the system. From our study, we found that while the metaphoric design enhanced users' performance at completing tasks, the lack of discoverability of the interaction model left them feeling incompetent and dissatisfied. We found that the isomorphic design enabled users to focus on tasks rather than learning how to use the system. Conversely, designs based on previous conventions had to be learned, had a time cost for the learning and negatively impacted users' engagement with content. For tasks and controls that can be designed based on an image schematic input action, users performed most accurately with the metaphoric design. There are benefits and limitations to each approach to designing to support intuitive interaction. We conclude with preliminary design considerations, suggest ways to balance performance with high user satisfaction depending on contextual design goals and question a single definition of intuitive intuition within whole body interface design.", "paper_title": "What is Intuitive Interaction?
