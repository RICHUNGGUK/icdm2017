The decentralized architecture that we use is composed of a set of sites communicating their diagnosis information with a coordinator that is responsible for detecting the occurrence of failures in the system. In particular, we define three protocols that differ in the amount of information exchanged between the local sites and the coordinator and the rules adopted by the coordinator to compute the global diagnosis states. Finally, we prove that, as in the case of automata, diagnosability is strictly related to the presence of failure ambiguous strings.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Diagnosis of Discrete-Event Systems Using Labeled Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000326499800017"}
