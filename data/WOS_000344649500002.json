In this paper, we focus our attention on PCGs for which the witness tree is a caterpillar. We first give some properties of graphs that are PCGs of a caterpillar. We formulate this problem as an integer linear programming problem and we exploit this formulation to show that for the wheels on n vertices W-n, n=7, aEuro broken vertical bar, 11, the witness tree cannot be a caterpillar. Related to this result, we conjecture that no wheel is PCG of a caterpillar. Finally, we state a more general result proving that any PCG admits a full binary tree as witness tree T.", "paper_title": "Pairwise Compatibility Graphs of Caterpillars", "paper_id": "WOS:000344649500002"}
