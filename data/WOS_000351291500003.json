To this end, each individual nanoparticle is approximated by a macrospin. Vinamax numerically solves the Landau-Lifshitz equation by adopting a dipole approximation method, while temperature effects can be taken into account with two stochastic methods. It describes the influence of demagnetizing and anisotropy fields on magnetic nanoparticles at finite temperatures in a space- and time-dependent externally applied field. Vinamax can be used in biomedical research where nanoparticle imaging techniques are under development, e.g., to validate other higher-level models and study their limitations.", "paper_title": "Vinamax: a macrospin simulation tool for magnetic nanoparticles", "paper_id": "WOS:000351291500003"}
