We replace the logical aspect of fuzzy reasoning by DNA chemistry. To achieve this goal, we first fuzzify the synthetic DNA sequence which is called fuzzy DNA and which handles the vague concept of human reasoning. We adopt the basic notion of DNA computing based on standard DNA operations. In the present model, we consider double stranded DNA sequences with a specific aim of measuring similarity between two DNA sequences. The present wet lab procedure can exploit massive parallelism of DNA computing. The end result of the wet lab algorithm produces multivalued status which can be linguistically interpreted to match the perception of human expert.", "paper_title": "Similarity-based fuzzy reasoning by DNA computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000308614300004"}
