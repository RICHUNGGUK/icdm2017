The development of programs that use these capabilities is one of the challenging issues for grid computing. In this article, an effort has been made to solve this problem by presenting mobile-agent-based parallel programming on the grid. The presentation of this model which has been realized by extending AlcheMi (TM) grid system with adding agent properties and navigational commands that let user to develop his program by using mobile agents. To evaluate the system, algorithms of matrix multiplication and convex hull have been implemented in the mentioned system.", "paper_title": "Alchemi+: An agent-based approach to grid programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100024"}
