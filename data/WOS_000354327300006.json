In this paper, we combine geometric Bonferroni mean (GBM) with the power geometric average (PGA) operator under intuitionistic fuzzy environment and present the intuitionistic fuzzy geometric power Bonferroni mean (IFPGBM) and the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy power geometric Bonferroni mean (WIFPGBM). The desirable properties of these new extensions of Bonferroni mean and their special cases are investigated. We list the detailed steps of multiple attribute group decision making with the developed IFPGBM or WIFPGBM, and give a comparison of the new extensions of Bonferroni mean by this paper with the corresponding existing intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni means. Finally, examples are illustrated to show the validity and feasibility of the new approaches.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic Fuzzy Power Geometric Bonferroni Means and Their Application to Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000354327300006"}
