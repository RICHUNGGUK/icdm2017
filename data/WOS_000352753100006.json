This paper presents an optimization approach for utilizing cloud services for mobile client in mobile cloud, which considers the benefit of both mobile device users and cloud datacenters. The mobile cloud service provisioning optimization is conducted in parallel under the deadline, budget and energy expenditure constraint. Mobile cloud provider runs multiple VMs to execute the jobs for mobile device users, the cloud providers want to maximize the revenue and minimize the electrical cost. The mobile device user gives the suitable payment to the cloud datacenter provider for available cloud resources for optimize the benefit. The paper proposes a distributed optimization algorithm for utilizing cloud services for mobile devices. The experiment is to test convergence of the proposed algorithm and also compare it with other related work. The experiments study the impacts of job arrival rate, deadline and mobility speeds on energy consumption ratio, execution success ratio, resource allocation efficiency and cost. The experiment shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms other related work in terms of some performance metrics such as allocation efficiency.", "paper_title": "An Optimization Approach for Utilizing Cloud Services for Mobile Devices in Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000352753100006"}
