Decal parameterizations are generated with a novel O (N log N) discrete approximation to the exponential map which requires only a single additional step in Dijkstra's graph-distance algorithm. Decals are dynamically composited in an interface that addresses many limitations of previous work. Tools for image processing, deformation/feature-matching, and vector graphics are implemented using direct surface interaction. Exponential map decals can contain holes and can also be combined with conformal parameterization to reduce distortion. The exponential map approximation can be computed on any point set, including meshes and sampled implicit surfaces, and is relatively stable under resampling. The decals stick to the surface as it is interactively deformed, allowing the texture to be preserved even if the surface changes topology. These properties make exponential map decals a suitable approach for texturing animated implicit surfaces.", "paper_title": "Interactive decal compositing with discrete exponential maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000239817400017"}
