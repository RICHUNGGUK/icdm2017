By using OSAP, processes trying to gain access to the protected TPM objects need to prove their knowledge of relevant authorization data before access to the objects can be granted. Chen and Ryan's 2009 analysis has demonstrated OSAP's authentication vulnerability in sessions with shared authorization data. They also proposed the Session Key Authorization Protocol (SKAP) with fewer stages as an alternative to OSAP. Chen and Ryan's analysis of SKAP using ProVerif proves the authentication property. The purpose of this paper was to examine the usefulness of Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and CPN Tools for security analysis. Using OSAP and SKAP as case studies, we construct intruder and authentication property models in CPN. CPN Tools is used to verify the authentication property using a Dolev-Yao-based model. Verification of the authentication property in both models using the state space tool produces results consistent with those of Chen and Ryan.", "paper_title": "Analysis of two authorization protocols using Colored Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000354294100002"}
