Since the decision commonly involves evaluating different criteria or attributes, supplier selection process is a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This study integrates the Taguchi loss function, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) model for solving the supplier selection problem. The advantage of this proposed method is that it allows decision makers to set multiple aspiration levels for the decision criteria. A numerical example of application is also presented.
