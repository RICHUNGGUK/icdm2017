The model will result from the integration of a decision tool called the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and a data analysis model called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This research demonstrates that by eliminating flaws and taking advantage of each methodology's specific characteristics in identifying and solving problems, the new integrated AHP/DEA model appears to be a logical and sensible solution in multi-criteria decision-making problem.", "paper_title": "The integration of analytical hierarchy process and data envelopment analysis in a multi-criteria decision-making problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238919200002"}
