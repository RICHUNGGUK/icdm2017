However, for some specific combinations of midsurface geometry and boundary conditions, the MITC6a element features some non-physical displacement modes with vanishing membrane strain energy. This phenomenon is thoroughly analyzed, and a remedy based on a stabilized bilinear form is proposed. Detailed numerical tests are included and the results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method both for membrane and bending dominated problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
