Since classical set theory is used in conventional GIS softwares to model uncertain real world, the natural variability in the environmental phenomena cannot be modeled appropriately. Because, pervasive imprecision of the real world is unavoidably reduced to artificially precise spatial entities when the conventional crisp logic is used for modeling. An alternative approach is the fuzzy set theory, which provides a formal framework to represent and reason with uncertain information. In addition, linguistic variable concept in a fuzzy logic system is useful for Communicating concepts and knowledge with human beings. FuzzyCell is a system designed and implemented to enhance commercial GIS software, namely ArcMap(R) with fuzzy set theory. FuzzyCell allows users to (a) incorporate human knowledge and experience in the form Of linguistically defined variables into GIS-based spatial analyses, (b) handle imprecision in the decision-making processes, and (c) approximate complex ill-defined problems in decision-making processes and classification. It provides eight membership functions, inference methods, methods for rule aggregation, operators for set operations and methods for defuzzification. The operation of FuzzyCell is presented through case studies, which demonstrate its application for classification and decision-making processes. This paper shows how fuzzy logic approach may contribute to a better representation and reasoning with imprecise concepts, which are inherent characteristics of geographic data stored and processed in GIS.
