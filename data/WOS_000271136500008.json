The axi-symmetric static limit analysis formulation in combination with finite elements proposed recently by the authors has been employed. The variation of the uplift factor (F,) with changes in the embedment ratio (H/B) has been computed for several rates of increases of soil cohesion with depth. It is noted that in all the cases, the magnitude of F(c) increases continuously with depth up to a certain value of H(cr)/B beyond which the uplift factor becomes essentially constant. The proposed static limit analysis formulation is seen to provide acceptable results even for the two other simple chosen axi-symmetric problems.
