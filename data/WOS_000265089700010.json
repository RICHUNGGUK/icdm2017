Then we and Cao and Ying investigated the supervisory control of FDESs independently. In this paper, we are concerned with another important issue of FDESs, the failure diagnosis. More specifically: 1) we propose a \"fuzzy diagnosability\" approach by introducing a fuzzy diagnosability function to characterize the diagnosability degree, which takes values in the interval [0, 1] rather than {0, 1}; 2) based on the observabitity of events, we formalize the construction of the diagnosers that are used to perform fuzzy diagnosis; 3) a number of basic properties of the diagnosers are investigated. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for failure diagnosis of FDESs. Our results generalize the important consequences of the diagnosability for crisp discrete-event systems (DESs) introduced by Sampath et al. The newly proposed approach allows us to deal with the problem of diagnosability for both crisp DESs and FDESs; 4) in addition, a method for checking the fuzzy diagnosability for FDESs is proposed. Also, some examples are provided to illustrate the application of the diagnosability of FDESs.", "paper_title": "Diagnosability of Fuzzy Discrete-Event Systems: A Fuzzy Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700010"}
