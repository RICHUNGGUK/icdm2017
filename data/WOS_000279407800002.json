It is an extension of the GOWA operator for uncertain situations where the available information is given in the form of fuzzy numbers. This generalization includes a wide range of mean operators such as the fuzzy average (FA), the fuzzy OWA (FOWA), and the fuzzy generalized mean (FGM). We also develop a further generalization by using quasi-arithmetic means that we call the quasi-FOWA operator. The article ends with an illustrative example where we apply the new approach in the selection of strategies.", "paper_title": "The Fuzzy Generalized OWA Operator and Its Application in Strategic Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000279407800002"}
