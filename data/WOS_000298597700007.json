As an extension of the work by Chen et al. (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 2009), we attempt to obtain a reduced order model of the above inverse problem, based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), referred to as POD 4D-Var for a finite volume global shallow water equation model based on the LinRood flux-form semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit time integration scheme. Different approaches of POD implementation for the reduced inverse problem are compared, including a dual-weighted method for snapshot selection coupled with a trust-region POD adaptivity approach. Numerical results with various observational densities and background error covariance operator are also presented. The POD 4-D Var model results combined with the trust-region adaptivity exhibit similarity in terms of various error metrics to the full 4D Var results, but are obtained using a significantly lesser number of minimization iterations and require lesser CPU time. Based on our previous and current work, we conclude that POD 4-D Var certainly warrants further studies, with promising potential of its extension to operational 3-D numerical weather prediction models.
