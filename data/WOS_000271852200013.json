Conventional column-based matrix decomposition (CX) computes the columns by randomly sampling columns of the data matrix. Instead, the newly proposed method (termed as CX_D) selects columns in a deterministic manner, which well approximates singular value decomposition. The experimental results well demonstrate the power and the advantages of the proposed method upon three real-world data sets.", "paper_title": "Deterministic Column-Based Matrix Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852200013"}
