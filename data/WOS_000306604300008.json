The objective is to design distributed feedback controllers to achieve plant-wide stability. Extensions of classical results on the stability of large-scale interconnected systems lead to input-output dissipativity constraints for each subsystems, encoded as supply rates from input to output interconnecting ports. For each subsystem, a parameterized nonlinear feedback controller is designed using nonlinear dissipative inequalities to ensure that the aforementioned dissipativity constraints are met in closed-loop. One focus of this paper is the design of domination-based nonlinear feedback controllers to meet the above interconnection constraints. This paper also presents new results on the construction of storage functions for control affine systems, as a generalization of physics-based approaches to dissipative systems theory. Control of interconnected chemical reactors with a recycle stream is presented throughout the paper to demonstrate the proposed construction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
