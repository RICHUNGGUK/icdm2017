During the last 15 years, Petri nets have attracted more and more attention to help to solve this key problem. Regarding the published papers, it seems clear that hybrid functional Petri nets are the adequate method to model complex biological networks. Today, a Petri net model of biological networks is built manually by drawing places, transitions and arcs with mouse events. Therefore, based on relevant molecular database and information systems biological data integration is an essential step in constructing biological networks. In this paper, we will motivate the application of Petri nets for modeling and simulation of biological networks. Furthermore, we will present a type of access to relevant metabolic databases such as KEGG, BRENDA, etc. Based on this integration process, the system supports semi-automatic generation of the correlated hybrid Petri net model. A case study of the cardio-disease related gene-regulated biological network is also presented.
