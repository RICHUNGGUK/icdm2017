Some language operations are identified which are feasible for regular expressions in the sense that the result of the operation call be represented as a regular expression of size polynomial in that of the operands. We prove that taking language quotients, in particular the prefix and suffix closures, of a regular set can incur at most a quadratic blow-up on the required expression size. The circular shift operation can cause only a cubic increase ill size and at least a quadratic bloat can be necessary in the worst case. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
