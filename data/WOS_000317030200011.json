This paper develops an approach to solve consensus problems when expert preference information is in the form of uncertain linguistic preference relations. First, definitions for aggregation operators and group consensus level based on a 2-tuple linguistic representation model are provided. Then, in order to obtain the weights of the experts under the assumption of incomplete weights information, an optimization model is developed which seeks maximum consensus from the current expert preferences in the group. If the consensus level reached does not meet predefined requirements, a consensus reaching algorithm is presented which can automatically achieve the goal. To determine the parameters for the proposed algorithm, a simulation procedure is presented. Finally, an investment company optimal selection example is provided to show the properties of the proposed approach. A comparative study and discussion of the proposed approach are also conducted.
