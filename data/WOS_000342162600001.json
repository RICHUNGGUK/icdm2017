Because it is infeasible to employ a common control channel in a licensed spectrum, blind rendezvous is an expected solution and generally estimated by the criteria of asynchronous rendezvous support, guaranteed rendezvous, asymmetric model support, heterogeneity of roles, and short time-to-rendezvous (TTR). Most existing blind rendezvous methods fail to fully satisfy these criteria or have considerable TTR significantly increased with the number of channels. This paper presents a new alternate hop-and-wait channel hopping method, called E-AHW, which can support fast blind rendezvous. By assigning each secondary user a unique alternate channel hopping sequence composed of HOP/WAIT-mode subsequences, all blind rendezvous criteria can be satisfied with shorter TTR. According to simulation results, the performance of E-AHW is better than existing methods. Moreover, using E-AHW, the average value and standard deviation of time intervals between two rendezvous are also less than other methods. Thus, E-AHW can provide an efficient and stable communication environment.", "paper_title": "A Fast Blind Rendezvous Method by Alternate Hop-and-Wait Channel Hopping in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162600001"}
