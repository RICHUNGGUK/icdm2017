Selectivity for each of the three subtypes is an important consideration in drug design in order to minimise the possibility of side effects. Using Catalyst lot we developed ligand-based pharmacophores from alpha(1a,b,d)-selective antagonists available in the literature using three separate training sets. Four-feature pharmacophores were developed for the alpha(1a) and alpha(1b) subtype-selective antagonists and a five-feature pharmacophore was developed for the alpha(1d) subtype-selective antagonists. The alpha(1a) pharmacophore represents both class I and II compounds with good predictivity for other compounds outside the training set as well. The alpha(1b) pharmacophore best predicts the activity of prazosin analogues as these make up the majority of alpha(1b)-selective antagonists. Unexpectedly, no positive ionisable feature was incorporated in the alpha(1b) pharmacophore. The alpha(1d) pharmacophore was based primarily on one structural class of compounds, but has good predictivity for a heterogeneous test set. Preliminary docking studies using AutoDock and optimised alpha(1)-adrenoceptor homology models, conducted with the antagonists prazosin (32) and 66, showed good agreement with the findings from the pharmacophores.
