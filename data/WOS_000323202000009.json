This method calculates the bit metric recursively by the symmetry of Gray code. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational complexity and maintain similar performance compared to ML and Max-Log bit metric. Additionally, this method generates bit metrics of PSK signals with different modulation order in the same way, so it can be applied to adaptive modulation system.", "paper_title": "A simplified bit metric calculation method for high-order PSK", "paper_id": "WOS:000323202000009"}
