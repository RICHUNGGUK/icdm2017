Interactive applications typically use local lighting models to render such surfaces. This work introduces a method to precompute or lazily compute global illumination to improve interactive isosurface renderings. The precomputed illumination resides in a separate volume and includes direct light, shadows, and interreflections. Using this volume, interactive globally illuminated renderings of isosurfaces become feasible while still allowing dynamic manipulation of lighting, viewpoint and isovalue.", "paper_title": "Interactive display of isosurfaces with global illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000234430200007"}
