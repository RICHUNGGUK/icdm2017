The wind actions on the bridge and the trains, including both buffeting and self-excited forces, are generated in time domain using computer simulation techniques and the given aerodynamic coefficients and flutter derivatives. The proposed formulations are applied to a schemed long span suspension bridge. The whole histories of the train passing through the bridge under wind actions are simulated to obtain the dynamic response of the bridge, and the running safety and stability indices of the train vehicles. The results show that wind has great influences on the train-bridge system. When the wind velocity is higher than 25 m/s, the running safety indices of the train vehicles exceed the allowances, to which great attention should be paid. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
