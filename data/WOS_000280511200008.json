The SoC consists of a parameterized Digital Fuzzy Logic Controller (DFLC) core and a flow control algorithm that runs under the Minx Microblaze soft processor core The fuzzy controller supports a fuzzy path tracking algorithm introduced by the authors The FPGA board hosting the SoC was attached to an actual differential-drive Pioneer 3-DX8 robot, which was used in field experiments in order to assess the overall performance of the tracking scheme. Moreover, quantization problems and limitations imposed by the system configuration are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
