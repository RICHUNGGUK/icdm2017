Despite advances in routing and media access control technologies, little progress has been made towards large-scale deployment of services and applications in pervasive and ubiquitous environments. The lack of a fixed infrastructure, coupled with the time-varying characteristics of the underlying network topology, makes service delivery challenging. This paper addresses these challenges and presents SARA, a unified, overlay-based service architecture to support large-scale service and application deployment in pervasive and ubiquitous environments. We discuss the main functionalities of SARA and present the algorithms for object registration and discovery. SARA also considers the mobility of the nodes in the network and provides a mechanism by which this can be incorporated into the framework. Finally, the proposed architecture was evaluated using simulations and the results show that the architecture performs well under different network conditions.
