A survey of existing work, organized by application area, forms the main body of the review, following an introduction to the key concepts in multiobjective optimization. An original contribution of the review is the identification of five distinct \"contexts,\" giving rise to multiple objectives: These are used to explain the reasons behind the use of multiobjective optimization in each application area and also to point the way to potential future uses of the technique.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective optimization in bioinformatics and computational biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000246071500011"}
