It is easy to show that NQ(+)(3, q) is a partial linear space of order (q, q(q-1)/2). If q is odd, then moreover NQ(+)(3, q) satisfies the property that for each non-incident point line pair (x,L), there are either (q-1)/2 or (q+1)/2 points incident with L that are collinear with x. A partial linear space of order (s, t) satisfying this property is called a ((q-1)/2,(q+1)/2)-geometry. In this paper, we will prove the following characterization of NQ(+)(3,q). Let S be a ((q-1)/2,(q+1)/2)-geometry fully embedded in PG(n, q), for q odd and q > 3. Then S = NQ(+)(3, q).", "paper_title": "A characterization of the complement of a hyperbolic quadric in PG (3, q), for q odd", "paper_id": "WOS:000234602200003"}
