However, user requests are currently treated statically. In this paper, we propose Userware, a new framework separating the application and user services. Our proposal covers usage integration and service personalization. It provides functionalities and capabilities necessary to enable a transparent end-to-end usage-oriented service access and personalization. We propose a functional model to specify the personalization services offered by Userware and to illustrate how these services will be implemented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
