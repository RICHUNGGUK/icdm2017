In the former, the feedback is applied to the input bit of the shift register only. In the latter, the feedback can potentially be applied to every bit. The sufficient conditions for equivalence of NLFSRs in the Fibonacci and the Galois configurations have been formulated previously. The equivalent NLFSRs in different configurations normally have to be initialized to different states to generate the same output sequences. The mapping between the initial states of two equivalent NLFSRs in the Fibonacci and the Galois configurations is derived in this paper.", "paper_title": "Finding Matching Initial States for Equivalent NLFSRs in the Fibonacci and the Galois Configurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200037"}
