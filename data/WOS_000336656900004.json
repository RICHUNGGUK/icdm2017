After ensuring conditions for the existence of it, such a decomposition is then constructed for the concrete space L-2[0, 1], on which the two unilateral shifts are parts of the dilation-by-2 and the translation-by-1 on L-2(R). Using multiresolution analysis (MRA) of wavelet theory it is shown the existence of a Haar-system-type orthonormal basis for L-2[0, 1], which is combined with the dual-shift decomposition to yield a refined decomposition for L-2[0, 1].", "paper_title": "DUAL-SHIFT DECOMPOSITION AND WAVELETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000336656900004"}
