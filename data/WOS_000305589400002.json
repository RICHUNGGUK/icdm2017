Using the commercial finite element package ABAQUS, the Drucker-Prager criterion and the yield surface are adopted for damaged plasticity concrete. The proposed finite element models are compared with the published experimental data. Parametric studies on concrete grades, confinement arrangement, diameter and spacing of hoops and eccentricity of load are followed. Numerical results have shown good agreements with experimental values, and indicated a proper constitutive law and model for concrete. Cross-sectional areas and spacing of the hoops have significant effect on the bearing capacity. It can be concluded that rectangular RC columns confined by multi-spiral hoops show better performance than the conventional ones.", "paper_title": "Compressive behavior of reinforced concrete columns confined by multi-spiral hoops", "paper_id": "WOS:000305589400002"}
