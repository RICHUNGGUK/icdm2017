Therefore, generating shapes of side actions requires solving a complex geometric optimization problem. Different objective functions may be needed depending upon different molding scenarios (e.g., prototyping versus large production runs). Manually designing side actions is a challenging task and requires considerable expertise. Automated design of side actions will significantly reduce mold design lead times. This paper describes algorithms for generating shapes of side actions to minimize a customizable molding cost function.", "paper_title": "A step towards automated design of side actions in injection molding of complex parts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900035"}
