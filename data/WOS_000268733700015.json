The proposed TDRNN model has special advantages such as simple structure, deeper depth and higher resolution ratio in memory. Thereafter, we develop the dynamic recurrent back-propagation algorithm for the TDRNN. To guarantee the fast convergence, the optimal adaptive learning rates are also derived in the sense of discrete-type Lyapunov stability. More specifically, a TDRNN identifier and a TDRNN controller are constructed to perform the identification and control of the nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments show that the TDRNN model has good effectiveness in the identification and control for dynamic systems.
