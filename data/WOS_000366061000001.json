Accordingly, real-time experiment live video streaming is an essential part of remote experimentation operation. Nevertheless, in the development of real-time experiment video transmission, it is a key and difficult issue that the video is transferred across the network firewall in most of the current remote laboratory solutions. To address the network firewall issue, we developed a complete novel solution via HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol and FFMPEG that is a powerful cross-platform command line video transcode/encoding software package on the server side. In this paper, a novel, real-time video streaming transmission approach based on HLS for the remote laboratory development is presented. With this new solution, the terminal users can view the real-time experiment live video streaming on any portable device without any firewall issues or the need for a third party plug-in., This new solution also significantly benefits remote laboratory development in the future.", "paper_title": "A Novel Real-time Video Transmission Approach for Remote Laboratory Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000366061000001"}
