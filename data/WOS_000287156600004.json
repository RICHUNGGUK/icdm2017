Discussions are focused on the collocated scheme of Schneider and Karimian (Computational Mechanics 1994; 14: 1-16) in the context of a control-volume finite-element Method. In this scheme, variables at the control volume surface are evaluated based on the physics of their governing equations, and the fully coupled system obtained is solved using a direct sparse solver. A special test problem has been defined to check the pressure-velocity coupling for all of the formulations. Other test cases, including Taylor problem, inviscid converging-diverging nozzle and the lid-driven cavity, have been conducted for different Reynolds numbers, mesh sizes and time steps to investigate the accuracy and the performance of the formulations. Finally, a reliable and efficient scheme for the evaluation of cell-face velocities is proposed, which can be easily extended to three dimensions.
