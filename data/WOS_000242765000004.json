The hierarchy induced by the size of the state alphabet is proved to collapse to the fourth level. The corresponding language families are related to the families of languages generated by Lindenmayer systems and Chomsky grammars. Finally, some results on deterministic and extended iterated finite state transducers are established. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
