Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow based on patient-individual data are performed to better understand aneurysm initiation and progression and more recently, for predicting treatment success. In virtual stenting, a flow-diverting mesh tube (stent) is modeled inside the reconstructed vasculature and integrated in the simulation. We focus on steady-state simulation and the resulting complex multiparameter data. The blood flow pattern captured therein is assumed to be related to the success of stenting. It is often visualized by a dense and cluttered set of streamlines. We present a fully automatic approach for reducing visual clutter and exposing characteristic flow structures by clustering streamlines and computing cluster representatives. While individual clustering techniques have been applied before to streamlines in 3D flow fields, we contribute a general quantitative and a domain-specific qualitative evaluation of three state-of-the-art techniques. We show that clustering based on streamline geometry as well as on domain-specific streamline attributes contributes to comparing and evaluating different virtual stenting strategies. With our work, we aim at supporting CFD engineers and interventional neuroradiologists.", "paper_title": "Blood Flow Clustering and Applications in Virtual Stenting of Intracranial Aneurysms", "paper_id": "WOS:000338120800003"}
