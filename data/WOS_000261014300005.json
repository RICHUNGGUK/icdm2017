These methods are based on the original Numerov-type sixth order method with fifth internal stages motivated by Tsitouras (see [Ch. Tsitouras, Explicit Numerov type methods with reduced number of stages, Comput. Math. Appl. 45 (2003) 37-42]). Some parameters are added to these methods so that they can integrate exactly the combination of trigonometrically functions With two frequencies. Numerical stability and phase properties of the new methods are analyzed. Numerical experiments are carried Out to show the efficiency and robustness of our new methods in comparison with the well known codes proposed in the scientific literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
