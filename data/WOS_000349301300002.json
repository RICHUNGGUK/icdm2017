We reexamine the classical maximum parsimony (MP) optimization problem for the general (asymmetric) scoring matrix case, where rooted phylogenies are implied, and analyze the worst case bounds of three approaches to MP: The approach of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, the approach of Hendy and Penny, and a new agglomerative, \"bottom-up\" approach we present in this article. We show that the second and third approaches are faster than the first one by a factor of Theta(root n) and Theta(n), respectively, where n is the number of species.", "paper_title": "The Worst Case Complexity of Maximum Parsimony", "paper_id": "WOS:000349301300002"}
