To this end, the method we propose utilises representative points to both incrementally cluster new data and to selectively retain important cluster information within a knowledge repository. The repository can then be subsequently used to assist in the processing of new data, the archival of critical features for off-line analysis, and in the identification of recurrent patterns.
