As the underlying databases grow into the multi-terabyte range, however, single CPU OLAP servers are being stretched beyond their limits. In this paper, we present a comprehensive model for a fully parallelized OLAP server. Our multi-node platform actually consists of a series of largely independent sibling servers that are \"glued\" together with a lightweight MPI-based Parallel Service Interface (PSI). Physically, we target the commodity-oriented, \"shared nothing\" Linux cluster, an architecture that provides an extremely cost effective alternative to the \"shared everything\" commercial platforms often used in high-end database environments. Experimental results demonstrate both the viability and robustness of the design. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
