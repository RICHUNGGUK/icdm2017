Although DBT has many benefits, its run-time performance overhead can be relatively high. The run-time overhead is important in embedded systems due to their slow processor clock speeds, simple microarchitectures, and small caches. This paper addresses how to implement efficient DBT for ARM-based embedded systems, taking into account instruction set and cache/TLB nuances. We develop several techniques that reduce DBT overhead for the ARM. Our techniques focus on cache and TLB behavior. We tested the techniques on an ARM-based embedded device and found that DBT overhead was reduced by 54% in comparison to a general-purpose DBT configuration that is known to perform well, thus further enabling DBT for a wide range of purposes.", "paper_title": "Addressing the Challenges of DBT for the ARM Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000268471100017"}
