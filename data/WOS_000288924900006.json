Today, massive computer power available with a desktop PC offers the necessary resources to account for these spatial autocorrelation effects within spatial interaction. Simple gravity model respecifications have been analyzed by Griffith (2007) and by Fischer and Griffith (2008). These results have been extended to a doubly-constrained gravity model respecification by Griffith (2009a, 2009b). This paper summarizes results from a further refinement of this doubly-constrained respecification, namely differentiating within and between areal unit flows. In doing so, an eigenfunction-based spatial filter description of spatial autocorrelation is constructed, which lends itself to visualization of analytical spatial autocorrelation components. Results are illustrated with the 2000 journey-to-work dataset for the extended state of Pennsylvania, USA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
