In formal terms, we replace the rule (Hyp): F is an element of Gamma/Gamma proves F(Hyp) by the rule (P-Hyp): F is an element of Gamma proves sigma . Gamma/Gamma proves F(P-Hyp) where sigma denotes a substitution which replaces all variables of Gamma with an example. This substitution is called the motivation of Gamma. These systems are in essence negationless. In the present paper, we study second order propositional calculus, since it is a simple non-trivial natural deduction system in which negation can be defined. We present a Curry-Howard version of pedagogical second-order propositional calculus, i.e. lambda-calculus bearing the pedagogical constraint. We establish that this system has the usual properties of typed calculi (subject reduction and strong normalization) and that it can type all second-order terms of lambda mu-calculus using a CPS translation. Furthermore, the main novelty is that all functions are useful: each polymorphic function has an instance which can be applied to a closed term. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
