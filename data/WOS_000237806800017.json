The traditional approach requires signal processing (SP) skills, constraining it to be used only by expert users. The Extractor Discovery System (EDS) [1] is a recent approach, which can also be useful for non expert users, since it intends to discover such descriptors automatically. This work compares the results from a classic approach for chord recognition, namely the use of KNN-learners over Pitch Class Profiles (PCP), with the results from EDS when operated by a non SP expert.", "paper_title": "Recognizing chords with EDS: Part one", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800017"}
