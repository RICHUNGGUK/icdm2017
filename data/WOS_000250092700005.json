Arigatoni provides fully decentralized, asynchronous and scalable resource discovery; it also provides mechanisms for dealing with an overlay with a dynamic topology. This paper introduces a nontrivial improvement of the resource discovery protocol by allowing the registration and request of multiple instances of the same service, service conjunctions, and multiple services. Adding multiple instances is a nontrivial task since the discovery protocol must keep track (when routing requests) of peers that accept to serve and peers that deny the service. Adding service conjunctions allows a single peer to offer different services at the same time. Simulations show that it is efficient and scalable. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
