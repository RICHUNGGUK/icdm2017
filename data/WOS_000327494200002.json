We put forward an alternative criteria for analysis of integrity constraints in Web ontology language (OWL) ontology under the closed world assumption. According to this criteria, grounded circumscription is applied to define integrity constraints in OWL ontology and the satisfaction of the integrity constraints by minimizing extensions of the predicates in integrity constraints. According to the semantics of integrity constraints, we provide a modified tableau algorithm which is sound and complete for deciding the consistency of an extended ontology. Finally, the integrity constraint validation is converted into the corresponding consistency of the extended ontology. Comparing our approach with existing integrity constraint validation approaches, we show that the results of our approach are more in accordance with user requirements than other approaches in certain cases.", "paper_title": "Integrity constraints in OWL ontologies based on grounded circumscription", "paper_id": "WOS:000327494200002"}
