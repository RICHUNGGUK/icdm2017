Juhn and L-M. Tseng, 1998 [4]), abbreviated the FBR scheme, is also suitable for heterogeneous clients of different communication capabilities although it is originally designed for homogeneous clients of the same bandwidth. Given alpha channels of total bandwidth alpha . b Mbps to deliver a video of the consumption rate b Mbps, we first show that the FBR scheme can be employed to serve clients with communication capabilities ranging from b to alpha . b Mbps. Furthermore, we propose a simple way to determine the minimum bandwidth required at any given time slot. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
