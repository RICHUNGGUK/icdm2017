In the detection and prediction of incipient faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis (DGA), the problem of missing values is significant and has resulted in inconclusive decision-making. This study proposes an efficient nonparametric iterative imputation method named FINNIM, which comprises of three components: 1) the imputation ordering; 2) the imputation estimator; and 3) the iterative imputation. The relationship between gases and faults, and the percentage of missing values in an instance are used as a basis for the imputation ordering; whereas the plausible values for the missing values are estimated from k-nearest neighbor instances in the imputation estimator, and the iterative imputation allows complete and incomplete instances in a DGA dataset to be utilized iteratively for imputing all the missing values. Experimental results on both artificially inserted and actual missing values found in a few DGA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in imputation accuracy, classification performance, and convergence criteria at different missing percentages.", "paper_title": "FINNIM: Iterative Imputation of Missing Values in Dissolved Gas Analysis Dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800012"}
