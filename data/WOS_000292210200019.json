In the present study, the notion of core documents is extended to the combination of citation-based and textual links. It is shown that core documents defined this way can be used to represent and describe document clusters and topics at different levels of aggregation. Methodology is illustrated using the example of two ISI Subject Categories selected from applied and social sciences.", "paper_title": "Using 'core documents' for the representation of clusters and topics", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210200019"}
