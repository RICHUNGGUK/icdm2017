Design/methodology/approach - As a theoretical framework for this analysis an elaborated version of Luhmann's systems theory is used which discusses the relationship between systems and media. The method is defined as a third-order cybernetics which entails first-order observations, second-order observation of observers, and finally their mutual observations as being observed. Findings - Identifies the east-west ideological conflict as a conflict within the world system of society by which the system is at war with itself. This \"self' is considered as comprising two parts: self and other. The one is identified as an autopoietic system and the other as an allopoietic system, each struggling for the status of system and for the transformation of the other into its medium. The traditional understanding of the history of the European civilization as having one single ancestor is challenged. Research limitations/implications - It is not an exhaustive analysis but rather an outline of a theory whose purpose is to define the source of international and intranational confrontations. Practical implications - The approach can be developed further and used for the analysis of the war on terrorism and the relationship between political system and social movements. Originality/value - The paper offers an innovative systems perspective on world wars with a special focus on the cold war which promises to overcome the difficulties which their analysis with traditional sociological theories at present encounters.", "paper_title": "The cold war within a sociological systems perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000238081100003"}
