In this work we have studied the properties of two flavonols, quercetin and myricetin, using semi-empirical methods in order to validate the application of the recent Parametric Model 6 and to understand the fundamental difference between the two molecules. Their geometries have been optimized and important molecular properties have been calculated. The energetic of the possible antioxidant mechanisms have also been analyzed. The two studied flavonols do not differ significantly in their molecular properties, but the antioxidant mechanisms by which they may act in solution can be rather different. Moreover, we also show that the Parametric Model 6 can produce reliable information for this type of compounds.", "paper_title": "Antioxidant mechanisms of Quercetin and Myricetin in the gas phase and in solution - a comparison and validation of semi-empirical methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000276061300005"}
