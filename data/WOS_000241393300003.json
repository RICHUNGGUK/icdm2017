Troubleshooting is especially challenging in multi-hop wireless networks because the behavior of such networks depends on complicated interactions between many factors such as RF noise, signal propagation, node interference, and traffic flows. In this paper we propose a new direction for research on fault diagnosis in wireless mesh networks. Specifically, we present a diagnostic system that employs trace-driven simulations to detect faults and perform root cause analysis. We apply this approach to diagnose performance problems caused by packet dropping, link congestion, external noise, and MAC misbehavior. In a 25 node mesh network, we are able to diagnose over 10 simultaneous faults of multiple types with more than 80% coverage.", "paper_title": "Troubleshooting wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241393300003"}
