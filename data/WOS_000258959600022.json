Manual validation of identified peaks is typically required. We have integrated a peak confidence scoring algorithm into existing tools which are compatible with analysis pipelines based on the standards from the Institute for Systems Biology. This algorithm automatically excludes incorrectly identified peaks, improving the accuracy of the final protein expression ratio calculation.", "paper_title": "An integrated approach for automating validation of extracted ion chromatographic peaks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258959600022"}
