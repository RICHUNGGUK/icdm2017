In this paper, an end-to-end QoS guarantee framework and its handoff flows are revised first. An end-to-end QoS adjustment algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the L2 bandwidth allocated in the WiMAX PMP and mesh networks and the L3 data rate in the Internet after the handoff. A CBQ + RED QoS adaptation algorithm is further proposed to adapt queue lengths among different service types and provide efficient queue and traffic management mechanisms as each packet arrives. Finally, simulation results indicate that this framework with these two algorithms outperform three QoS management schemes by supporting higher throughputs, lower packet loss ratios and smaller delays on the end-to-end path under different parameter combinations and two handoff scenarios.
