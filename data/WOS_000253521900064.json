Selecting relevant and enough features to effectively represent and index the given dataset is an important task to solve the classification and clustering problems intelligently. This task is, however, quite difficult to carry out since it usually needs a very time-consuming search to get the features desired. This paper proposes a bit-based feature selection method to find the smallest feature set to represent the indexes of a given dataset. The proposed approach originates from the bitmap indexing and rough set techniques. It consists of two-phases. In the first phase, the given dataset is transformed into a bitmap indexing matrix with some additional data information. In the second phase, a set of relevant and enough features are selected and used to represent the classification indexes of the given dataset. After the relevant and enough features are selected, they can be judged by the domain expertise and the final feature set of the given dataset is thus proposed. Finally, the experimental results on different data sets also show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
