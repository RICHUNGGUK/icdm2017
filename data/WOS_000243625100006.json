The system consists of a wavelet-based module as the feature extractor of speech signals and a neural-network-based module as the signal classifier. The Daubechies wavelet is employed to filter and compress the speech signals. The fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network is used to classify the processed signals. A series of experiments on text-dependent gender and speaker recognition are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system using a collection of vowel signals from 100 speakers. A variety of operating strategies for improving the FAM performance are examined and compared. The experimental results are analyzed and discussed.", "paper_title": "Text-dependent speaker recognition using wavelets and neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243625100006"}
