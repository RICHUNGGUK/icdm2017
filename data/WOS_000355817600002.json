Some mathematical models for multi-effect evaporators are reported in previous studies. But most of them are steady-state models, and there are no extensive studies on the dynamic behaviour of these evaporators. In this paper, two types of dynamic model, lumped and distributed, are developed for an industrial four-effect falling-film evaporator which is used to concentrate whole milk. These models are validated with data from an industrial unit. The results show that the distributed model has slightly better predictions than the lumped model, but the lumped model has comparable performance because its structure is simple and the needed simulation time is short in comparison with the distributed model.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modelling and dynamic simulation of multi-effect falling-film evaporator for milk powder production", "paper_id": "WOS:000355817600002"}
