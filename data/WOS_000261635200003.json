An interpretive case-study approach is employed using multiple data gathering methods. The research reveals that factors such as conscientiousness, cultural assumptions and beliefs, and social conditions affect university staff behaviour and attitude towards work, in general, and information security awareness, in particular. A number of recommendations are provided to initiate and promote IS security awareness in the studied environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
