However, in applications with strict energy and size constraints, an alternative MIMO scheme with reduced hardware complexity would be attractive. Towards this direction, parasitic antennas with a single feeding port have been proposed to emulate MIMO transmission with PSK signaling. In order to support higher order constellations, this letter presents a smart loading scheme that enables the multiplexing of two 16-QAM signals over the air. Accompanying simulations show that this can be achieved by using a single feeding port and parasitic antennas.", "paper_title": "MIMO over ESPAR with 16-QAM Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100028"}
