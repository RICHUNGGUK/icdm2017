Many nondestructive methods have limited capabilities in monitoring of the rubber aging in a continuous manner. In this study, the feasibility of the EMI sensing technique for the online aging monitoring of rubber is investigated. The finite element method (FEM) is employed to analyze the impedance of piezoelectric patch which is bonded on the aging rubber. The results show that the EMI signatures not only can detect the aging of rubber but also can evaluate the aging extent, and the EMI signatures are more sensitive to the early aging rubber with increasing excites frequency.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IMPEDANCE SENSING TECHNIQUE FOR ONLINE AGING MONITORING OF RUBBER", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578200011"}
