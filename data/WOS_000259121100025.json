By using kepstrum (known elsewhere as complex cepstrum) analysis, we will show that the kepstrum method is reliable and applicable to real-time processing by providing an efficient kepstrum processing technique with a fast processing time using fast Fourier-trans forms (FFTs). Furthermore, it will be shown that its application to speech enhancement methods gives several favourable effects such as: (I) application flexibility by enabling invertibility, which gives a stable minimum phase transfer function on application of the inverse of a room impulse response, (2) processing robustness by using it as building blocks and (3) computational simplicity by highly reduced weights in an adaptive algorithm when it is used with a cascaded adaptive filter. Accordingly, we will show that the kepstrum approach contributes to speech enhancement and noise cancellation with an improved performance in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using only two microphones with a small physical dimension in size. Experiments on a 20cm broadside two-microphone acoustic beamformer configuration are implemented in realtime in an indoor office. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
