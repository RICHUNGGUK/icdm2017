We study a limit of the product v(k)w(k), where the sequences v(k) and w(k) belong to L(2)(Omega). In Theorem 2.1 we assume that del x v(k) is bounded in the L(p)-norm and del . w(k) is controlled in the L(r)-norm. In Theorem 2.2 we suppose that del x w(k) is bounded in the L(p)-norm and del . w(k) is controlled in the L(r)-norm. The time derivative of w(k) is bounded in both cases in the norm of H(-1)(Omega). The convergence (in the sense of distributions) of v(k)w(k) to the product vw of weak limits of v(k) and w(k) is shown.", "paper_title": "DIV-CURL LEMMA REVISITED: APPLICATIONS IN ELECTROMAGNETISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000280236400008"}
