Given two nodes s, t in the Delaunay triangulation of a point set S, we look for a new point p is not an element of S that can be added, such that the shortest path from s to t, in the Delaunay triangulation of S boolean OR {p}, improves as much as possible. We study several properties of the problem, and give efficient algorithms to find such a point when the graph-distance used is Euclidean and for the link-distance. Several other variations of the problem are also discussed.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING SHORTEST PATHS IN THE DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317142700004"}
