A user model is defined as an incremental decision tree for a specific user. A drawing style modeling process is designed to model user's temporal drawing performances among inputting strokes, and to predict the possible shape in term of fuzzy matching. A user mediation process is proposed based on relevance feedback to capture users' drawing intentions and refine the recognition results. Experiments prove efficiency of the method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic user modeling for sketch-based user interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300153"}
