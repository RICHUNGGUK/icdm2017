Poly-silicon solar cell wafers were inspected for chemical stains, and the inspection was rapid and stable. The system used a laser-reflection-point-based AOI method for solar wafer chemical stain inspection. Based on the fuzzy theory, the image binarization algorithm could efficiently filter irrelevant image information, and the back-propagation method was also utilized to determine if the image was stained. The inspection algorithm integrated fuzzy theory and the back-propagation method in order to shorten the comparison time and quickly find the target. The experiment proved that the validity of the proposed method could achieve a recognition rate of 98% from among 1000 images.", "paper_title": "THE CHEMICAL STAIN INSPECTION OF POLYSILICON SOLAR CELL WAFER BY THE FUZZY THEORY METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000326140200016"}
