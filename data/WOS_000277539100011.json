Design/methodology/approach - The general field structures of systemic yoyos, combined with some of the well-known laboratory observation of physics, are employed as the basic methodology for the current paper. Findings - Owing to the co-existence of magnetic fields and ring-shaped negative electric fields, all possible ways for an electromagneton to be fired into a stable, uniform-intensity magnetic field are investigated. How such an electromagneton could be traveling under the mutual influence of the fields is described with details. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies on the fact that it points out a brand new and practically applicable theory for looking at some of the well-recorded phenomena of electromagnetism.", "paper_title": "A new theory for modern electrical marbles", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100011"}
