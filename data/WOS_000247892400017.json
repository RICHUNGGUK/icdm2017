We treat the center and the four vertexes of the original image as the reference points and embed the same quadruple watermarks by means of polar coordinates, which is geometrically invariant. The center of an image is assumed to not to be removed after rotating, scaling and local distortions according to the general practical image processing. In the watermark extraction process, the vertexes of the image are found by a searching method. Thus watermark synchronization is obtained. Experimental results show that the scheme is robust to the geometrical distortions including rotation, scaling, cropping and local distortions.", "paper_title": "Qyuadruple watermarking against geometrical attacks based on searching for vertexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892400017"}
