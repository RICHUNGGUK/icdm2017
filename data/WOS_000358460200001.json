We generalize this notion to arbitrary L systems via the concept of prefix languages. A prefix language is a language L such that for all x, y is an element of L, x is a prefix of y or y is a prefix of x. Every infinite prefix language determines a single infinite word. Where C is a class of L systems (e.g. 0L, DT0L), we denote by omega(C) the class of infinite words determined by the prefix languages in C. This allows us to speak of infinite 0L words, infinite DT0L words, etc. We categorize the infinite words determined by a variety of L systems, showing that the whole hierarchy collapses to just three distinct classes of infinite words: omega(PDOL), omega(DOL), and omega(CDOL). Our results are obtained with the help of a pumping lemma which we prove for T0L systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
