Especially, damage due to internal information leakage by insiders is more serious than that by outsiders because insiders have considerable knowledge of the system's identification and password (ID&P/W), the security system, and the main location of sensitive data. Therefore, many security companies are developing internal data leakage prevention techniques such as data leakage protection (DLP), digital right management (DRM), and system access control, etc. However, these techniques cannot effectively block the leakage of internal information by insiders who have a legitimate access authorization. The security system does not easily detect cases which a legitimate insider changes, deletes, and leaks data stored on the server. Therefore, we focused on the insider as the detection target to address this security weakness. In other words, we switched the detection target from objects (internal information) to subjects (insiders). We concentrated on biometrics signals change when an insider conducts abnormal behavior. When insiders attempt to leak internal information, they appear to display abnormal emotional conditions due to tension, agitation, and anxiety, etc. These conditions can be detected by the changes of biometrics signals such as pulse, temperature, and skin conductivity, etc. We carried out experiments in two ways in order to verify the effectiveness of the emotional recognition technology based on biometrics signals. We analyzed the possibility of internal information leakage detection using an emotional recognition technology based on biometrics signals through experiments.", "paper_title": "New Approach for Detecting Leakage of Internal Information; Using Emotional Recognition Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500023"}
