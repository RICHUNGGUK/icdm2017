Recent work has demonstrated that both for deterministic and probabilistic models imposed on the signal, this extra information can be successfully exploited to enhance recovery performance. In particular, weighted l(1)-minimization with suitable choice of weights has been shown to improve performance in the so-called non-uniform sparse model of signals. In this paper, we consider a full generalization of the non-uniform sparse model with very mild assumptions. We prove that when the measurements are obtained using a matrix with independent identically distributed Gaussian entries, weighted l(1)-minimization successfully recovers the sparse signal from its measurements with overwhelming probability. We also provide a method to choose these weights for any general signal model from the non-uniform sparse class of signal models.", "paper_title": "Weighted l(1)-Minimization for Generalized Non-Uniform Sparse Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400021"}
