In this paper, we develop a novel shape modeling framework to reconstruct a closed surface of arbitrary topology based on this new spline scheme. Our framework takes a triangulated set of points, and by solving a linear least-square problem and iteratively refining parameter domains with newly added knots, we can finally obtain a continuous spline surface satisfying the requirement of a user-specified error tolerance. Unlike existing surface reconstruction methods based on triangular B-splines (or DMS splines), in which auxiliary knots must be explicitly added in advance to form a knot sequence for construction of each basis function, our new algorithm completely avoids this less-intuitive and labor-intensive knot generating procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our algorithm on real-world, scattered datasets for shape representation and computing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
