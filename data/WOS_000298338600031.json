Web Services offer several advantages over other communication technologies. However, they have high latency and often suffer from congestion and bottlenecks due to the massive load generated by web service requests from large numbers of end users. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the basic XML-based communication protocol of Web services. XML is a verbose encoding language in comparison with other technologies such CORBA and RMI. In this paper, two new redundancy-aware SOAP Web message aggregation models - Two-bit and One-bit XML status tree - are proposed to enable the Web servers to aggregate SOAP responses and send them back as one compact aggregated message in order to reduce the required bandwidth, latency, and improve the overall performance of Web services. XML message compressibility, the jaccard based clustering technique, and the vector space model are three similarity measurements that are proposed to cluster SOAP messages as groups based on their similarity degree. The clustering based similarity measurements enable the aggregation techniques to potentially reduce the required network traffic by minimizing the overall size of the messages. The experiments show significant performance for both aggregation techniques achieving compression ratios as high as 25 for aggregated SOAP messages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
