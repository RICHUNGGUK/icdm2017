In Dynamic Geometry systems, it is often the case that locus determination is purely graphical, producing an output that is not robust enough and not reusable by the given software. Parts of the true locus may be missing, and extraneous objects can be appended to it as side products of the locus determination process. In this paper, we propose a new method for the computation, in dynamic geometry, of a locus defined by algebraic conditions. It provides an analytic, exact description of the sought locus, making possible a subsequent precise manipulation of this object by the system. Moreover, a complete taxonomy, cataloging the potentially different kinds of geometric objects arising from the locus computation procedure, is introduced, allowing to easily discriminate these objects as either extraneous or as pertaining to the sought locus. Our technique takes profit of the recently developed GrobnerCover algorithm. The taxonomy introduced can be generalized to higher dimensions, but we focus on 2-dimensional loci for classical reasons. The proposed method is illustrated through a web-based application prototype, showing that it has reached enough maturity as to be considered a practical option to be included in the next generation of dynamic geometry environments.
