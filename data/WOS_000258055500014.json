The solution of such problems is challenging owing to large computational requirements of the multiscale process model. This problem is addressed by developing a reduced multiscale model. This is achieved by combining order reduction techniques for dissipative partial-differential equations with adaptive tabulation of microscopic simulation data. The multiscale process optimization problem is subsequently solved using standard search algorithms. The proposed method is applied to two representative catalytic oxidation processes where optimal inlet concentration profiles are computed to guide the microscopic system from one stable stationary state to another stable stationary state.
