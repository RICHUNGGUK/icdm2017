Among the reasons is the important slippage of skin markers with respect to scapula. Methods using electromagnetic tracking devices are validated and frequently applied. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a new method for in vivo optoelectronic scapular capture dealing with the accepted accuracy issues of validated methods. Eleven arm positions in three anatomical planes were examined using five subjects in static mode. The method was based on local optimisation, and recalculation procedures were made using a set of five scapular surface markers. The scapular rotations derived from the recalculation-based method yielded RMS errors comparable with the frequently used electromagnetic scapular methods (RMS up to 12.6 degrees for 150 degrees arm elevation). The results indicate that the present method can be used under careful considerations for 3D kinematical studies examining different shoulder movements.", "paper_title": "A new method for motion capture of the scapula using an optoelectronic tracking device: a feasibility study", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600012"}
