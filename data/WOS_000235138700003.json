However, relational rule learning can be adapted also to subgroup discovery. This paper proposes a propositionalization approach to relational subgroup discovery, achieved through appropriately adapting rule learning and first-order feature construction. The proposed approach was successfully applied to standard ILP problems (East-West trains, King-Rook-King chess endgame and mutagenicity prediction) and two real-life problems (analysis of telephone calls and traffic accident analysis).", "paper_title": "Propositionalization-based relational subgroup discovery with RSD", "paper_id": "WOS:000235138700003"}
