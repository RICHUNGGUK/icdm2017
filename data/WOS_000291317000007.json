First, a T-S fuzzy model and a mean-value estimation technique are adopted to approximate a so-called virtual linearized system (VLS) of a real system and avoiding a high-order derivative problem, respectively. Second, a novel design concept combining the T-S fuzzy controller, observer, and tuning algorithm by neural networks is proposed to improve system performance. After that, we also use improved generalized projection-update laws, which prevent parameters drift and confine adjustable parameters to the specified regions, to tune adjustable parameters. As a result, both the stability guarantee based on strictly positive real (SPR) Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's lemma and the better tracking performance are concluded. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-S fuzzy controller and observer-design methodology, numerical simulation results are given in this paper.", "paper_title": "Observer-Based T-S Fuzzy Control for a Class of General Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems Using Generalized Projection-Update Laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317000007"}
