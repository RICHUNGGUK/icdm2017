A user can interact with the virtual characters in real time via an avatar by changing their moving behavior. Moreover, the user is allowed to select any character as the avatar to be controlled. A path planning algorithm is proposed to address the problem of dynamic navigation of individual and groups of characters in the multi-agent system. A natural interface is designed for the interaction between the user and the virtual characters, as well as the virtual environment, based on gesture recognition. To evaluate the efficiency of the dynamic navigation method, performance results are provided. The presented system has the potential to be used in the training and evaluation of emergency evacuation and other real-time applications of crowd simulation with interaction.", "paper_title": "An immersive multi-agent system for interactive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000317715200001"}
