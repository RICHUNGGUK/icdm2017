The proposed approach embeds watermarks in the significant features of 3D models in a spread-spectrum manner. This novel scheme is robust against a wide variety of attacks including rotation, translation, scaling, noise addition, smoothing, mesh simplifications, vertex reordering, cropping, and even pose deformation of meshes. To the best of our knowledge, the existing approaches including blind, semi-blind, and non-blind detection schemes cannot withstand the attack of pose editing, which is a very common routine in 3D animation. In addition, the watermarked models can be semi-reversed (i.e., the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the recovered models is greater than 90 dB in all experiments) in semi-blind detection scheme. Experimental results show that this novel approach has many significant advantages in terms of robustness and invisibility over other state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "A novel semi-blind-and-semi-reversible robust watermarking scheme for 3D polygonal models", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800069"}
