To produce a color image, the two missing color components have to be estimated at each pixel of the corresponding CFA image. This process is commonly referred to as demosaicing, and its result as the demosaiced color image. Since demosaicing methods intend to produce \"perceptually satisfying\" demosaiced color images, they attempt to avoid color artifacts. Because this is often achieved by filtering, demosaicing schemes tend to alter the local texture information that is, however, useful to discriminate texture images. To avoid this issue while exploiting color information for texture classification, it may be relevant to compute texture descriptors directly from CFA images. From chromatic co-occurrence matrices (CCMs) that capture the spatial interaction between color components, we derive new descriptors (CFA CCMs) for CFA texture images. Color textures are then compared by means of the similarity between their CFA CCMs. Experimental results achieved on benchmark color texture databases show the efficiency of this approach for texture classification.
