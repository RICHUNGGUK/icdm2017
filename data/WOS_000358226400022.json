Cascading failures occur between coupled networks, cause the system more fragile than single network. Besides widely used metric giant component, we study small cluster (small component) in interdependent networks after cascading failures occur. We first introduce an overview on how small clusters distribute in various single networks. Then we propose a percolation theory based mathematical method to study how small clusters be affected by the interdependence between two coupled networks. We prove that the upper bounds exist for both the fraction and the number of operating small clusters. Without loss of generality, we apply both synthetic network and real network data in simulation to study small clusters under different interdependence models and network topologies. The extensive simulations highlight our findings: except the giant component, considerable proportion of small clusters exists, with the remaining part fragmenting to very tiny pieces or even massive isolated single vertex; no matter how the two networks are tightly coupled, an upper bound exists for the size of small clusters. We also discover that the interdependent small-world networks generally have the highest fractions of operating small clusters. Three attack strategies are compared: Inter Degree Priority Attack, Intra Degree Priority Attack and Random Attack. We observe that the fraction of functioning small clusters keeps stable and is independent from the attack strategies.", "paper_title": "Small Cluster in Cyber Physical Systems: Network Topology, Interdependence and Cascading Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000358226400022"}
