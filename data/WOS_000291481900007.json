We consider how much the price of anarchy worsens and how much the price of stability improves as a function of the approximation factor epsilon. We give tight bounds for the price of anarchy of atomic and non-atomic congestion games and for the price of stability of non-atomic congestion games. For the price of stability of atomic congestion games we give non-tight bounds for linear latencies. Our results not only encompass and generalize the existing results of exact equilibria to epsilon-Nash equilibria, but they also provide a unified approach which reveals the common threads of the atomic and non-atomic price of anarchy results. By expanding the spectrum, we also cast the existing results in a new light.", "paper_title": "On the Performance of Approximate Equilibria in Congestion Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000291481900007"}
