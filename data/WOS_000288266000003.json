After providing an overview of architecture design of the adaptive TSP system, the article presents an adaptive TSP optimization model that optimizes green splits for three consecutive cycles to minimize the weighted sum of transit vehicle delay and other traffic delay, considering the safety and other operational constraints under the dual-ring structure of signal control. The model is illustrated using a numerical example under medium and heavily congested situations. The findings from a field operational test are also reported to validate and demonstrate the developed TSP system. At a congested intersection, it is found that the average bus delay and average traffic delay along the bus movement direction were reduced by approximately 43% and 16%, respectively. Moreover, the average delay of cross-street traffic was increased by about 12%.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Implementation of Adaptive Transit Signal Priority on Actuated Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288266000003"}
