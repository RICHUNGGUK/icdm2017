However, the observed data are usually blurred due to cell asynchrony during experiments. In this paper, the effect of cell asynchrony is investigated by conducting numerical experiments. The simulation results suggest that cell asynchrony has varying effects on different intrinsic expression patterns. Specifically, the intrinsic patternswith high expression around the late life stage are more likely to be affected by cell asynchrony. It is also investigated how the effect of cell asynchrony depends on the experimental conditions. From this analysis, the burst rate r% in infection period and the standard deviation s of growth rate are identified to have a strong impact on the blurring due to cell asynchrony. Consequently, it is important to measure these two parameters during biological experiments in order to deblur time-series gene expression data.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Cell Asynchrony on Gene Expression Levels: Analysis and Application to Plasmodium Falciparum", "paper_id": "WOS:000358620500014"}
