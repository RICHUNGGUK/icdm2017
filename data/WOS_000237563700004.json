These inequalities are called Zigzag inequalities because they cut off fractional solutions containing a zigzag associated with variables with 0.5 value. Two different types of inequalities, the Odd Zigzag and the Even Zigzag inequalities, are presented. Finally, their application to other known Arc Routing Problems is discussed.", "paper_title": "Zigzag inequalities: a new class of facet-inducing inequalities for Arc Routing Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237563700004"}
