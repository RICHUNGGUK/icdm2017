We derive that in a restricted class of eventual failure detectors there does not exist a single weakest oracle, but a weakest family of oracles : every two oracles in are incomparable, and every oracle that allows for solving renaming provides at least as much information about failures as one of the oracles in . As a by product, we obtain one more evidence that renaming is strictly easier to solve than set agreement.", "paper_title": "Renaming and the weakest family of failure detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000310382600001"}
