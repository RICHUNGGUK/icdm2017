More specifically, in this work we focus on the support of extremely powerful, but complex, fine-grained data-centric access control mechanisms based on multi-authority Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE). By integrating access control policies into the (encrypted) data, such mechanisms do not require any server-based access control infrastructure and are thus highly desirable in many wireless sensor network scenarios. However, as concretely shown by a proof-of-concept implementation first carried out in this paper on TelosB and MicaZ motes, computational complexity and energy toll of state-of-the-art multi-authority CP-ABE schemes is still critical. We thus show how to mitigate the relatively large energy consumption of the CP-ABE cryptographic operations by proposing AGREE (Access control for GREEn wireless sensor networks), a framework that exploits energy harvesting opportunities to pre-compute and cache suitably chosen CP-ABE-encrypted keys, so as to minimize the need to perform CP-ABE encryptions when no energy from harvesting is available. We assess the performance of AGREE by means of simulation and actual implementation, validating its operation with real-world energy-harvesting traces collected indoors by TelosB motes equipped with photovoltaic cells, as well as public available traces of radiant light energy. Our results show that complex security mechanisms may become significantly less demanding when implemented so as to take advantage of energy harvesting opportunities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
