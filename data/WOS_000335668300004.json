By constructing a parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and checking its difference in two subintervals, respectively, some novel delay-segment-dependent stability criteria for the addressed system are derived. Two simulation examples are given to show effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-segment-dependent robust stability for uncertain discrete stochastic Markovian jumping systems with interval time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300004"}
