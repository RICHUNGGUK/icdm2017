There is now much work on developing the appropriate algorithms and codes able to correctly describe this class of materials within a parameter-free quantum physical description. In particular, van der Waals (vdW) forces play a major role in building up material cohesion in sparse matter. This work presents an application to the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) bulk structure of two versions of the vdW-DF method, a first-principles procedure for the inclusion of vdW interactions in the context of density functional theory (DFT). In addition to showing improvement compared to traditional semilocal calculations of DFT, we discuss the choice of various exchange functionals and point out issues that may arise when treating systems with large amounts of vacuum.
