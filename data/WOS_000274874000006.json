The simultaneous dealing of background modelling and foreground segmentation has the effect that the two processes constrain each other positively, such that a good estimate of the background call be obtained with it small number of frames, and a temporal change in the scene is reflected quickly in the construction of the background image.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous background/foreground segmentation and contour smoothing with level set based partial differential equation for intelligent surveillance systems over network", "paper_id": "WOS:000274874000006"}
