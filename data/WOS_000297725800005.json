If the scripts are available, captioning technology can help them in a certain degree by synchronously illustrating the scripts during the playing of videos. However, we show that the existing captioning techniques are far from satisfactory in assisting the hearing-impaired audience to enjoy videos. In this article, we introduce a scheme to enhance video accessibility using a Dynamic Captioning approach, which explores a rich set of technologies including face detection and recognition, visual saliency analysis, text-speech alignment, etc. Different from the existing methods that are categorized as static captioning, dynamic captioning puts scripts at suitable positions to help the hearing-impaired audience better recognize the speaking characters. In addition, it progressively highlights the scripts word-by-word via aligning them with the speech signal and illustrates the variation of voice volume. In this way, the special audience can better track the scripts and perceive the moods that are conveyed by the variation of volume. We implemented the technology on 20 video clips and conducted an in-depth study with 60 real hearing-impaired users. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and usefulness of the video accessibility enhancement scheme.", "paper_title": "Video Accessibility Enhancement for Hearing-Impaired Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000297725800005"}
