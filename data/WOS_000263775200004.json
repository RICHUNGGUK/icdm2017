In this paper, the HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) links and FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) devices have been modeled in the DC load flow analysis. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the proposed DC load flow results have been compared with the AC or AC-DC load flow results of DIgSILENT software. It is shown that the proposed DC load flow is accurate enough for power system studies.", "paper_title": "A Simple and Unified Method to Model HVDC Links and FACTS Devices in DC Load Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000263775200004"}
