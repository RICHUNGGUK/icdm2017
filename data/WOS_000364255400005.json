However, the utility of these audiovisual assets could be further improved by adding subtitles that can be exploited to incorporate added-value functionalities such as searchability, accessibility, translatability, note-taking, and discovery of content-related videos, among others. Today, automatic subtitles are prone to error, and need to be reviewed and post-edited in order to ensure that what students see on-screen are of an acceptable quality. This work investigates different user interface design strategies for this post-editing task to discover the best way to incorporate automatic transcription technologies into large educational video repositories. Our three-phase study involved lecturers from the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV) with videos available on the poliMedia video lecture repository, which is currently over 10,000 video objects. Simply by conventional post-editing automatic transcriptions users almost reduced to half the time that would require to generate the transcription from scratch. As expected, this study revealed that the time spent by lecturers reviewing automatic transcriptions correlated directly with the accuracy of said transcriptions. However, it is also shown that the average time required to perform each individual editing operation could be precisely derived and could be applied in the definition of a user model. In addition, the second phase of this study presents a transcription review strategy based on confidence measures (CM) and compares it to the conventional post-editing strategy. Finally, a third strategy resulting from the combination of that based on CM with massive adaptation techniques for automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieved to improve the transcription review efficiency in comparison with the two aforementioned strategies.
