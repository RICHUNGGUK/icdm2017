The scheme advances zeroth to second order piecewise moments at cell centers through their numerical fluxes obtained from one-dimensional high order interpolation. The modification simplifies the scheme without losing its high performance. We apply the scheme to two-dimensional electromagnetic Vlasov simulations of linear wave propagation and nonlinear magnetic reconnection problems. Our Vlasov simulation resolves microscopic structure of the non-Maxwellian plasma velocity distribution around the magnetic reconnection site as well as macroscopic structure of fluid quantities within the energy error of 2%, and is in good agreement with previous studies.
