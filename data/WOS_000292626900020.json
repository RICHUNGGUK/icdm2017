In this study, we propose a web mimicry anomaly detection method that uses HTTP token causal correlation. The proposed method extracts token sequences from web application HTTP requests and models the token correlation based on conditional random fields (CRFs) in order to identify web mimicry attacks. The CRF model is widely used for solving sequence labeling problems and suitable for capturing the dependency among different tokens in a token sequence. Since CRFs relax the strong independence assumptions that the other probabilistic sequence analysis methods (e.g., hidden Markov model) have, it can capture long term dependencies among the observed sequences of web tokens to improve the detection capability by observing significant attack patterns. The proposed method requires only HTTP request information and can be easily plugged into existing intrusion detection systems. Two datasets from \"ECML/PKDD 2007's Analyzing Web Traffic challenge\" and real world HTTP traffic data extracted from a private telecom company are used for an evaluation. The experiment results show that the proposed system performs well in the detection of both web mimicry attacks and general web application attacks even in heavily intersecting cases.", "paper_title": "WEB MIMICRY ATTACK DETECTION USING HTTP TOKEN CAUSAL CORRELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900020"}
