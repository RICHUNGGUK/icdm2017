On the basis of the so-far performed analyses, it can be presumed that around the year 2020, the calculative capacity of personal computers will match the capacity of the human brain. If there is no breakdown of this trend, then ten years after, the capacity will reach a level comparable with the size of all brains of all the people in the world. According to the idea of the grid computing, the possibility of downloading to such a \"machine\" that has all our mental make-up (recorded in neuron structures) will become achievable. The possibility of a human mastering the snowballing development of artificial intelligence lays in constructing a neural interface. The second way of integrating human mind with cyberspace is connected with building computers operating on the basis of a neural network principle. The previously mentioned two ways should be perceived as priority of ergonomic issues of the neural integrated human-computer interaction.", "paper_title": "Ergonomic issues of the neural integrated human-computer interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000235611100008"}
