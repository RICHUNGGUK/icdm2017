Several solutions combine static RAM and dynamic RAM buffering but still have major scaling limitations. Using a parallel architecture and distributed memory-management algorithms with hybrid SRAM/DRAM improves buffering performance. The parallel hybrid SRAM/DRAM memory system is also work conserving, which is particularly important under light traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "MEMORY SUBSYSTEMS IN HIGH-END ROUTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266877200007"}
