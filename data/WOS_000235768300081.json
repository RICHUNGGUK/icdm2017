Compared with other biometrics, it is more difficult to disguise. In addition, gait can be captured in a distance by using low-resolution capturing devices. In this paper, we proposed a new representation for human gait recognition which is called Motion Silhouettes Image (MSI). MSI is a grey-level image which embeds the critical spatio-temporal information. Experiments showed that MSI has a high discriminative power for gait recognition. The recognition rate is around 87% in SOTON dataset by using MSI for recognition. The recognition rate is quite promising. In addition, MSI can also reduce the storage size of the dataset. After using MSI, the storage size of SOTON has reduced to 4.2MB.", "paper_title": "A new representation for human gait recognition: Motion silhouettes image (MSI)", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300081"}
