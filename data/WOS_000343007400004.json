Releasing microdata is a way to protect data, mainly in the economic and medical field. However, this kind of data can experience privacy attacks. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy sets as a way to improve the protection of privacy in microdata. Then, traditional definitions of k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness are extended. The performance of these new approaches is checked in terms of the risk index.", "paper_title": "On the use of fuzzy partitions to protect data", "paper_id": "WOS:000343007400004"}
