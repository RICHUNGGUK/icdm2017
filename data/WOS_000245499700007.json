When formalizing the dynamics of such a system, the updates of that system organize themselves quite naturally in a quantale, or more generally, a quantaloid. In fact, we are led to consider cocomplete quantaloid-enriched categories as a fundamental mathematical structure for a dynamic logic common to both computer science and physics. Here we explain the theory of totally continuous cocomplete categories as a generalization of the well-known theory of totally continuous suplattices. That is to say, we undertake some first steps towards a theory of \"dynamic domains\". (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
