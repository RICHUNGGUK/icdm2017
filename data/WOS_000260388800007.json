Two numerical simulation examples axe given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theorems. It can be expected that these theorems provide new tools for understanding and studying PGS phenomena and information encryption.", "paper_title": "PARTIAL GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION THEOREMS OF DIFFERENTIAL AND DISCRETE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260388800007"}
