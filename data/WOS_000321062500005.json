After building a mixed 0-1 integer programming model for UBFLP, we present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee of 6.853+I mu for UBFLP on plane, which is composed of the algorithm by Dai and Yu (Theor. Comp. Sci. 410:756-765, 2009) and the schema of Xu and Xu (J. Comb. Optim. 17:424-436, 2008). We also provide a heuristic algorithm based on Benders decomposition to solve UBFLP on general graphes, and the computational experience shows that the heuristic works well.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithm for uniform bounded facility location problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000321062500005"}
