Meanwhile, increasing worldwide demand for different types of energy requires development of advanced intelligent forecasting tools to provide a basis from which decisions and plans can be made. This study presents a new approach called \"Cooperative Ant Colony Optimization-Genetic Algorithm\" (COR-ACO-GA), to construct expert systems with the ability to model and simulate fluctuations of energy demand under the influence of related factors. The proposed approach has two main stages, at the first stage it uses genetic algorithms to generate data base of the expert system, and at the second stage it adopts ant colony optimization to learn linguistic fuzzy rules such that degree of cooperation between data base and rule base increases and consequently performance of the algorithm improves. We evaluate capability of COR-ACO-GA by applying it on three case studies of annual electricity demand, natural gas demand and oil products demand in Iran. Results indicate that COR-ACO-GA provides more accurate-stable results than adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), and can assist decision makers in making appropriate decisions and plans for a coming period.
