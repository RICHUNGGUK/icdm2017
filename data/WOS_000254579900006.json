Specifically, the machine learning has been applied to blob extraction and detection, in order to decide whether a detected blob corresponds to a real target or not. Performance is assessed with an Evaluation function, which has been developed for optimizing the video surveillance system. This Evaluation function measures the quality level reached by the tracking system.", "paper_title": "Machine learning techniques for acquiring new knowledge in image tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000254579900006"}
