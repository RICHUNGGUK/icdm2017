Compared to other GA engines, the VGP-I specification defines a compact instruction set supporting multiple operator types, with scalable instruction encodings, prograrnmer-visible and auxiliary registers and optional extensions. Apart from the programmable accelerator approach, VGP-I instructions have been tightly integrated to the Nios II soft-core processor as well. For performance assessment, a cycle-accurate reference VGP-I model has been developed while VGP-I subsets have been realized on a prototype microarchitecture and as Nios 11 custom instructions, both verified on programmable logic. Performance improvements on the execution of genetic operators are typically at the level of two orders of magnitude with application kernels written in ANSI C being accelerated by about 20x due to the usage of GA instruction set extensions.
