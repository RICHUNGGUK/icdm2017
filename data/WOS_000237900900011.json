This model describes the microevolution in details by accounting for the birth, ageing, and natural death of individual organisms as prey-predator interactions on a hierarchical dynamic food web. It also provides a natural description of random mutations and speciation of species as well as their extinctions. The distribution of lifetimes of species follows an approximate power law only over a limited regime, and the distribution of trophic level follows an exponential attenuation.", "paper_title": "Unified eco-system model of macro- and microevolution based energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237900900011"}
