The minimum over all L(2, 1)-labeling of G of the largest used label is called (lambda) over bar (G). In this paper, we study the L(2, 1)-labelings problem on squared, triangular and hexagonal grids and for them we compute the exact values of (lambda) over bar.", "paper_title": "The L(2,1)-Labeling Problem on Oriented Regular Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000296300500011"}
