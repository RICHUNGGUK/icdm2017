Additionally, DTNs can also operate as cooperative DTNs to extend the coverage of other type of networks by carrying the messages that originate from farther away base station in a multi-hop fashion to the base station. In this paper, we focus on these cooperative DTNs and propose a novel routing scheme, ring distribution routing (RDR), that controls the replication and forwarding based on the source node surroundings. This paper also analyzes the reliability and buffer efficiency in RDR. Furthermore, we show that RDR provides the reliable and immediate message delivery in any environment through extensive computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Replication and Forwarding Control Based on Node Surroundings in Cooperative Delay-Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791400008"}
