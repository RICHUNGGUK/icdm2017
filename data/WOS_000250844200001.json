In DTSVM, a problem of multi class classification is decomposed into a senes of ones of binary classification. Here, the binary decision tree is generated by using kernel clustering algorithm, and each non-leaf node represents one binary classification problem. By compared with the other multi-class classification methods based on the binary classification SVMs, the scale and the complexity of DTSVM are less, smaller number of support vectors are needed, and has faster test speed. The final simulation results confirm the feasibility and the validity of DTSVM.", "paper_title": "Decision tree support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000250844200001"}
