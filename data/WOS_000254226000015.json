By practical, we mean adapting the circuit to particulars of the physical environment which restricts/complicates the establishment of certain direct interactions between qubits. This is a quantum version of the classical circuit placement problem. We study the theoretical aspects of the problem and also present empirical results that match the best known solutions that have been developed by experimentalists. Finally, we discuss the efficiency of the approach and the scalability of its implementation with regard to the future development of quantum hardware.", "paper_title": "Quantum circuit placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000254226000015"}
