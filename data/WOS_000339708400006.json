In each timestep, a node's value is updated to some weighted average of its neighbors and its old values. We study the case when the underlying network is dynamic and investigate different averaging models. Both our analysis and experiments show that dynamic networks exhibit fast convergence behavior, even under very mild connectivity assumptions.", "paper_title": "Fast Convergence for Consensus in Dynamic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339708400006"}
