The nonlinear model is identified based on a WN framework. Based on the technique of feedback linearization, supervisory control and H(infinity) control, an adaptive control strategy is developed to compensate for the nonlinearity in the structure so as to enhance the response of the system to earthquake type inputs. Furthermore, the parameter adaptive laws of the WN are developed. In particular, it is shown that the proposed control strategy offers a reasonably effective approach to semiactive control of structures. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated on a building structure by computer simulation.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF ADAPTIVE WAVELET NETWORKS FOR VIBRATION CONTROL OF BASE ISOLATED STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000282064900005"}
