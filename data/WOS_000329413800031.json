To achieve maximum effectiveness with the greatest margin of safety it is important to understand the mechanisms of light propagation through tissue and how that light affects living cells. Lasers with novel output characteristics for medical and military applications are too often implemented prior to proper evaluation with respect to tissue optical properties and human safety. Therefore, advances in computational models that describe light propagation and the cellular responses to laser exposure, without the use of animal models, are of considerable interest. Here, a physics-based laser-tissue interaction model was developed to predict the dynamic changes in the spatial and temporal temperature rise during laser exposure to biological tissues. Unlike conventional models, the new approach is grounded on the rigorous electromagnetic theory that accounts for wave interference, polarization, and nonlinearity in propagation using a Maxwell's equations-based technique.
