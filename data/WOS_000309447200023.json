Our first result characterizes communication topologies with a decidable reachability problem restricted to eager runs (i.e., runs where messages are either received immediately after being sent, or never received). The problem is EXPTIME-complete in the decidable case. The second result is a doubly exponential time algorithm for bounded context analysis in this setting, together with a matching lower bound. Both results extend and improve previous work from [21].", "paper_title": "REACHABILITY ANALYSIS OF COMMUNICATING PUSHDOWN SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309447200023"}
