The mixed delays are composed of time-varying delays and distributed delays, both of which are mode dependent. By adaptive feedback technique, several sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the global asymptotical stability in mean square for the uncertain stochastic dynamical networks with mixed delays and Markovian jumping parameters. The controller is easy to implement in practical situations. In the end, the corresponding simulation results are constructed to support the theoretical results in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
