There are quadratic time algorithms for computing the exact lower bound V on the variance of interval data, and for computing V under reasonable easily verifiable conditions. The problem is that in real life, we often make additional measurements. In traditional statistics, if we have a new measurement result, we can modify the value of variance in constant time. In contrast, previously known algorithms for processing interval data required that, once a new data point is added, we start from the very beginning. In this paper, we describe new algorithms for statistical processing of interval data, algorithms in which adding a data point requires only O(n) computational steps. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
