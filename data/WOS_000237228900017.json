First, the probe design for DNA microarray was formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization task by investigating the characteristics of probe design. Then the probe set for human paillomavrius (HPV) was found using E-multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with thermodynamic fitness calculation. The evolutionary optimization of probe set showed better results than the commercial microarray probe set made by Biomedlab Co.
