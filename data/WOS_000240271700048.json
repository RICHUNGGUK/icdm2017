We consider a class of generalised integer programs where the constraints are allowed to be taken from a broader set of relations (instead of just being linear inequalities). The set of allowed relations is defined using a many-valued logic and the resulting class of relations have provably strong modelling properties. We give sufficient conditions for when such problems are polynomial-time solvable and we prove that they are APX-hard otherwise.", "paper_title": "Generalised integer programming based on logically defined relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700048"}
