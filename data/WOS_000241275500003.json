The APL has been rationally designed by substituting two of the critical residues for recognition by the T-cell receptor. A conformational analysis of the APL has been sought using a combination of 2D NOESY nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and detailed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, in order to comprehend the stereoelectronic requirements for antagonistic activity, and to propose a putative bioactive conformation based on spatial proximities of the native peptide in the crystal structure. The proposed structure presents backbone similarity with the native peptide especially at the N-terminus, which is important for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding. Primary (Val(87), Phe(90)) and secondary (Asn(92), Ile(93), Thr(95)) MHC anchors occupy the same region in space, whereas T-cell receptor (TCR) contacts (His(88), Phe(89)) have different orientation between the two structures. A possible explanation, thus, of the antagonistic activity of the APL is that it binds to MHC, preventing the binding of myelin epitopes, but it fails to activate the TCR and hence to trigger the immunologic response. NMR experiments coupled with theoretical calculations are found to be in agreement with X-ray crystallography data and open an avenue for the design and synthesis of novel peptide restricted analogues as well as peptide mimetics that rises as an ultimate goal.
