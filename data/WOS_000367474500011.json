Focusing on data management strategies under multiple datacenters, this paper presents a design of a HDFS-based two Cascading Master-Slave Storage System (2CMSSS), which simplifies the research work of the replication management strategies under multi-datacenter cloud storage environments. On this basis a two-phase locking maintenance strategy for replica consistency is presented to validate and fix the problem of replica inconsistency across multiple datacenters. According to the experiment simulation, this strategy can ensure strong data consistency and maintain low latency for users to access data.", "paper_title": "Distributed Consistency Method and Two-Phase Locking in Cloud Storage over Multiple Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000367474500011"}
