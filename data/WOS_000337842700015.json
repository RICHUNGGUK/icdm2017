To address these challenges, we propose an effective background subtraction method by learning and maintaining an array of dynamic texture models within the spatio-temporal representations. At any location of the scene, we extract a sequence of regular video bricks, i.e., video volumes spanning over both spatial and temporal domain. The background modeling is thus posed as pursuing subspaces within the video bricks while adapting the scene variations. For each sequence of video bricks, we pursue the subspace by employing the auto regressive moving average model that jointly characterizes the appearance consistency and temporal coherence of the observations. During online processing, we incrementally update the subspaces to cope with disturbances from foreground objects and scene changes. In the experiments, we validate the proposed method in several complex scenarios, and show superior performances over other state-of-the-art approaches of background subtraction. The empirical studies of parameter setting and component analysis are presented as well.", "paper_title": "Complex Background Subtraction by Pursuing Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000337842700015"}
