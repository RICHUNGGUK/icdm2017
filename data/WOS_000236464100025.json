Weighted automata and series over pictures map pictures to some semiring and provide an extension to a quantitative setting. We establish a notion of a weighted MSO logics over pictures. The semantics of a weighted formula will be a picture series. We introduce weighted 2-dimensional online tessellation automata (W2OTA) extending the common automata-theoretic model for picture languages. We prove that the class of picture series defined by sentences of the weighted logics coincides with the family of picture series that are computable by W2OTA. Moreover, behaviours of W2OTA coincide precisely with the recognizable picture series characterized in [18].", "paper_title": "Weighted picture automata and weighted logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100025"}
