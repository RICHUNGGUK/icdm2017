The edge-detour index is conceived the same way as the sum of distances between all pairs of edges of the connected graph on the longest path between corresponding edges. In this paper, several possible distances between edges of a graph are considered. According to them, the corresponding edge-detour indices have been defined. Also, the combinatorial expressions of these two edge-detour indices of some familiar graphs have been computed.", "paper_title": "THE EDGE VERSIONS OF DETOUR INDEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000266749000014"}
