In such procedures, each decision maker is asked to separately consider pairs of elements which are not necessarily independent from each other. For this reason the votes collected are liable to contain inconsistencies. In this paper we are providing a selective indicator that focuses on the inconsistencies the decision group is willing to correct in conformity with its vote strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
