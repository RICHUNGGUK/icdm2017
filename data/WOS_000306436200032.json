Existing service composition methods can hardly meet the requirements of dynamism and performance for pervasive computing. This paper proposes a Petri net based service model to formally describe the function of services and employs a parameter based service description to represent both semantic and syntactic of services. And services are pre-aggregated in a two-layered graph according to the input and output parameters of the service description. Furthermore, we design a novel service composition scheme to achieve the user requirement through a tree search algorithm. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulation experiments show that both service model and composition scheme are correct and efficient.", "paper_title": "A dynamic service composition schema for pervasive computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200032"}
