The study of fullerene reactivity has motivated the concept of closed-shell independent sets. Such sets specify the location of bulky addends on a fullerene such that the residual pi system is a closed shell. The cardinality of the maximum-sized set is the closed-shell independence number. This paper presents a backtracking algorithm to calculate this number for fullerenes. The algorithm was run on all fullerene isomers with 100 or fewer carbons and front the results, some observations are made related to the properties of the fullerene isomers that indicate a minimum or maximum closed-shell independence number. It is conjectured that exactly three isomers have identical closed-shell independence and independence numbers.", "paper_title": "Backtracking to compute the closed-shell independence number of a fullerene", "paper_id": "WOS:000249283700008"}
