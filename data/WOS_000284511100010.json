An important step in the process of aggregating preference relations, is to determine the importance weight of each preference relation. In this paper, we develop a number of goal programming models and quadratic programming models based on the idea of maximizing group consensus. Our models can be used to derive the importance weights of fuzzy preference relations and multiplicative preference relations. We further develop iterative algorithms for reaching acceptable levels of consensus in group decision making based on fuzzy preference relations or multiplicative preference relations. Finally, we include an illustrative example. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "Group consensus algorithms based on preference relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000284511100010"}
