The development of mobile devices has further provided diverse communication channels for social networking websites. In virtual communities, the rich resources, instantaneous feedback, and sharing of information have led many studies to apply it to instructional environments involving collaborative learning. This study uses Google+ as the learning platform, Pad as the learning device, and group investigation (GI) as the collaborative learning instructional strategy, introducing it in a public health nursing practical training course at a nursing school. The experiment shows that students using the Google+ system to carry out GI collaborative learning have better learning effects than those engaging in GI instruction using a traditional paper-based method. Most learners and instructors expressed hope that future courses can be conducted in this manner.", "paper_title": "Using Google plus to Conduct High Interaction and Interdependence Learning Environments Based on Group Investigation Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000312045300015"}
