In this paper(1) we investigate another possibility of tabling, i.e. to compute an infinite sum of probabilities for probabilistic logic programs. Using PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling language with a tabling mechanism, we generalize prefix probability computation for probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) to probabilistic logic programs. Given a top-goal, we search for all proofs with tabling and obtain an explanation graph which compresses them and may be cyclic. We then convert the explanation graph to a set of linear probability equations and solve them by matrix operation. The solution gives us the probability of the top-goal, which, in nature, is an infinite sum of probabilities. Our general approach to prefix probability computation through tabling not only allows to deal with non-probabilistic context-free grammars such as probabilistic left-corner grammars but has applications such as plan recognition and probabilistic model checking and makes it possible to compute probability for probabilistic models describing cyclic relations.", "paper_title": "Infinite probability computation by cyclic explanation graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000346848400004"}
