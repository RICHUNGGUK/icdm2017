However, it is difficult to extract an estimate of the time-of-arrival (TOA) through use of a simple correlator due to degradation on correlation, and in the case where the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is less than the maximum excess delay (MED). In order to enhance the correlation capability, this paper proposes a TOA estimation method that obeys a threshold predetermined in a non-coherent system using multiple-mask operation (MMO). The performance of the Proposed scheme is verified by conducting simulations under two different types of channel situations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well even in a dense indoor multipath environment and with the existence of multiple simultaneously operating piconets (SOPs).", "paper_title": "A Multiple-Mask Operation Compatible with IEEE 802.15.4a Non-coherent UWB Ranging Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600050"}
