This paper presents a generic computational model that is able to identify and assess structural similarities in argumentative discourses. Focusing on the structure of such discourses, we sketch representative scenarios where the proposed model can be applied to a wide range of argumentation systems in order to define, elaborate and mine meaningful argumentation patterns. We argue that the proposed model contributes to both theoretical and practical aspects of argumentation.", "paper_title": "A computational model for the identification and assessment of structural similarities in argumentative discourses", "paper_id": "WOS:000311029800010"}
