The effects of second-generation current conveyor (CCII) non-idealities on the proposed and on the previously published inductances are investigated, in which lossless inductances are realized. CCIIs like all active devices have terminal current limitations that can not be exceeded. Thus, the values of the applied input current sources for the proposed and previously published inductances depending on the passive elements values and applied signal frequency impose restrictions on the input current of the inductor.", "paper_title": "The effects of non-idealities and current limitations on the simulated inductances employing current conveyors", "paper_id": "WOS:000234308500003"}
