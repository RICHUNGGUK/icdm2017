The proposed scheme exhibits low computational complexity and can converge to either the decorrelator or the LMMSE detector for two distinct values of the weighting factor. It uses a weighting factor to determine which average BER level the linear SIC converges to. We study the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme and prove that the latter is convergent if the weighting factor is between 0 and 1. Moreover, we propose a reduced complexity version of the WLSIC multi-user detector in which the complexity is reduced by 15% compared to the original WLSIC structure. Finally, simulation results obtained by applying the proposed WLSIC multi-user detector to cancel the inter-carrier interference (ICI) in an uplink OFDMA system coincide well with our theoretical findings.
