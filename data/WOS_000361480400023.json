However, low link reliability and link interference will affect the construction of virtual networks. This paper proposes a virtual resource mapping algorithm on the basis of Cayley structures. First, we analyze the characteristics of Cayley WDCs and model networks in WDCs, where a virtual network is modeled as a traditional undirected graph, while a physical topology is modeled as a directed graph. Second, we propose a virtual resource mapping and coloring algorithm based on link interference called VRMCA-LI. We build a connection interference matrix for each node and use a coloring method to avoid interference. VRMCA-LI uses the same color for the nodes that are within the transmitting angle of a sending node and whose signal-to-noise ratio is less than a threshold. These nodes with the same color cannot be allocated to virtual nodes at the same time. The allocation of nodes and links are concurrent, which performs dynamic adjustment to save mapping time. Third, our experimental results show that VRMCA-LI outperforms WVNEA-LR and PG-VNE in terms of mapping time of virtual nodes, acceptance rate of virtual networks, and average node utilization rate.", "paper_title": "Virtual Resource Allocation Based on Link Interference in Cayley Wireless Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000361480400023"}
