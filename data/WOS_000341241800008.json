Linear stability analysis is used to obtain the stability condition. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landan (TDGL) equation are deduced by means of the reductive perturbation method respectively. Further, the influence of the friction parameters upon pedestrian flow has been discussed. Our results also indicate that pedestrians moving along both directions uniformly are most stable.", "paper_title": "A bidirectional pedestrian flow model with the effect of friction parameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000341241800008"}
