As the two primary results, we prove a combinatorial lower bound on the number of encoding rules and a combinatorial characterization of optimal splitting authentication codes that are multi-fold secure against spoofing attacks. The characterization is based on a new type of combinatorial designs, which we introduce and for which basic necessary conditions are given regarding their existence.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial bounds and characterizations of splitting authentication codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849900004"}
