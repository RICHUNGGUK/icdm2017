A 3D-integrated broad-purpose accelerator architecture called parallel-on-demand (POD) integrates a specialized SIMD-based die layer on top of a CISC superscalar processor to accelerate a variety of data- parallel applications. It also maintains binary compatibility and facilitates extensibility by virtualizing the acceleration capability.", "paper_title": "POD: A 3D-integrated broad-purpose acceleration layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000259144100004"}
