We introduce the concept of kinetology, the phonology of human movement, and five principles on which such a system should be based: compactness, view-invariance, reproducibility, selectivity, and reconstructivity. We propose visuo-motor primitives and demonstrate their kinetological properties. Further evaluation is accomplished with experiments on compression and decompression. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate that action has a space characterized by a visuo-motor language.
