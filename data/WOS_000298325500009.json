This calls for image inpainting in wavelet domains. In this paper, a variational approach is used to formulate the reconstruction problem. We propose a simple but very efficient iterative scheme to calculate an optimal solution and prove its convergence. Numerical results are presented to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Primal-Dual Method for Total-Variation-Based Wavelet Domain Inpainting", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500009"}
