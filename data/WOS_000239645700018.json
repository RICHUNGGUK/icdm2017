We consider both separable and maximally entangled initial conditions, and show how the entanglement and the relative phase between the states describing the coin degree of freedom of each particle will influence the evolution of the quantum walk. In particular, these factors will have consequences for the distance between the particles and the probability of finding them at a given point, yielding results that cannot be obtained from a separable initial state, be it pure or mixed. Finally, we review briefly proposals for implementations.", "paper_title": "Discrete time quantum walk on a line with two particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000239645700018"}
