We believe the WAP Push service feature of mobile phones can help bridge the gap between internet and mobile services, and expand the number of potential blog readers. Since mobile phone screen size is very limited, content providers must be familiar with individual user preferences in order to recommend content that matches narrowly defined personal interests. To help identify popular blog topics, we have created (a) an information retrieval process that clusters blogs into groups based on keyword analyses, and (b) a mobile content recommender system (M-CRS) for calculating user preferences for new blog documents. Here we describe results from a case study involving 20,000 mobile phone users in which we examined the effects of personalized content recommendations. Browsing habits and user histories were recorded and analyzed to determine individual preferences for making content recommendations via the WAP Push feature. The evaluation results of our recommender system indicate significant increases in both blog-related push service click rates and user time spent reading personalized web pages. The process used in this study supports accurate recommendations of personalized mobile content according to user interests. This approach can be applied to other embedded systems with device limitations, since document subject lines are elaborated and more attractive to intended users. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
