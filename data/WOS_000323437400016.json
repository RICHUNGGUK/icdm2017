These equations were regarded by their proponents as potentially useful decision aids for funding agencies, peer reviewers, and hiring committees. This paper presents the results of a validation study in a sample of Spanish psychologists including neuroscience psychologists for whom the regression equations would be expected to apply but including also psychologists in other areas of the social/behavioral sciences for whom the applicability of the regression equations might be questionable. The results do not support the equations for any of the two groups: Errors of prediction were generally large and mostly positive, the more so the larger was the value of the h index used to make the prediction. Although the validity of these regression equations could still be investigated in additional cross-validation studies, an alternative approach to predicting future h indices is outlined and illustrated in this paper.", "paper_title": "Limited validity of equations to predict the future h index", "paper_id": "WOS:000323437400016"}
