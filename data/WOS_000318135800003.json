In the latter case, the system can behave in two different ways, in dependence of whether a suitably defined key parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Namely, below the threshold the delay is shown not to be able to influence the stability of the coexistence equilibrium; above it, existence of a Hopf bifurcation is analytically proven. Further, in this range, numerical simulations reveal a route to chaotic behavior as function of the size of the delay. Some operative conclusions for agroecosystem management are drawn, although they ultimately depend on each particular situation. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
