Two schemes for enhancing the mobility management are included in the proposed network's infrastructure support. Firstly, the local-link channels between sub-networks are provided to improve the mobility management efficiency for the mobile nodes roaming between neighboring sub-networks. Secondly, the early route optimization scheme has been applied, which optimizes the mobility management process between the corresponding node and the home agent (HA), resulting in reduced bandwidth waste and long end-to-end packet delays, as well as lowering the heavy burden on the HA. The performance of the proposed mobility management scheme has been evaluated in terms of handoff delays, packet losses and transmission costs. The superior performance of the proposed scheme has been verified and compared to other schemes.", "paper_title": "A wireless access network based on WDM-PON for HMIPv6 mobility support", "paper_id": "WOS:000282045600013"}
