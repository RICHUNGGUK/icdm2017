This survey gives a comprehensive overview of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols which directly or indirectly address this problem. The presented protocols are grouped in several categories and are described in the order of their publication date. To give the reader a deep understanding of the progress made in the area of alleviating the hidden node problem a brief summary of the key ideas as well as a detailed comparison of different protocols are presented. Open research directions are also discussed to serve as a starting point for future protocol design and evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
