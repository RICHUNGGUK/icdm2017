The first one stresses the public good property which suggests that all members of a winning coalition derive equal power. The second variation follows earlier work on the integration of a priori unions (Owen, 1977 and 1982) and refers to essential subsets of an a priori union when allocating power shares. Axiomatic characterizations of both indices are discussed. Numerical examples, one of them taken from a political setting, illustrate the new power indices presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Two variations of the Public Good Index for games with a priori unions", "paper_id": "WOS:000286921200015"}
