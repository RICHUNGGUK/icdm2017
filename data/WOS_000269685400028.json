The new option assumes that an investor sets up a stock exchange strategy based on the changes of the stock price when the investor has held option. Within the valid period of the option, the investor may sell stocks based on an investment strategy for put option. This paper proposes several general linear investment strategies for Put option, which are the linear investment strategy that the initial selling price is lower than the striking price, the linear investment strategy that sell a number of stocks at the striking price and the most general linear investment strategy. The intrinsic value functions deduce for the cases of put option. Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing theory, new option pricing models are finally obtained respectively by solving complex integral problems. Furthermore, the relationship and the disparity on the option prices between the new options and the classical ones are discussed.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL BASED ON GENERAL LINEAR INVESTMENT STRATEGY (PART I: PUT OPTION)", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400028"}
