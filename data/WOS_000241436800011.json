String generating hypergraph grammars have been proven useful for handling discontinuous constituents. In this paper we describe a new notation for hypergraph productions that allows on-the-fly interconnection of graph parts with regard to user-defined constraints. These constraints handle the order of nodes within the string hypergraph. The HyperEarley parser for string generating hypergraph grammars [1] is adapted to the new formalism. A German example is used for the explanation of the new notation and algorithms.", "paper_title": "String generating hypergraph grammars with word order restrictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241436800011"}
