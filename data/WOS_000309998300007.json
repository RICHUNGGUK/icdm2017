Taking advantage of the characteristics of auditory perception, interactive sonification offers promising opportunities for enhancing the training of athletes. The efficient learning and memorizing abilities pertaining to the sense of hearing, together with the strong coupling between auditory and sensorimotor systems, make the use of sound a natural field of investigation in quest of efficiency optimization in individual sports at a high level. This study presents an application of sonification to elite rowing, introducing and evaluating four sonification models. The rapid development of mobile technology capable of efficiently handling numerical information offers new possibilities for interactive auditory display. Thus, these models have been developed under the specific constraints of a mobile platform, from data acquisition to the generation of a meaningful sound feedback. In order to evaluate the models, two listening experiments have then been carried out with elite rowers. Results show a good ability of the participants to efficiently extract basic characteristics of the sonified data, even in a non-interactive context. Qualitative assessment of the models highlights the need for a balance between function and aesthetics in interactive sonification design. Consequently, particular attention on usability is required for future displays to become widespread.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of four models for the sonification of elite rowing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309998300007"}
