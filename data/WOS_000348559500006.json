The interpolation has a simple and explicit mathematical representation, and is of C-2 continuity without solving a system of consistency equations for the derivative values at the knots. In order to meet the needs of practical design, a local control method is employed to control the shape of curves. The advantage of the method is that it can be applied to modify the local shape of an interpolating curve by selecting suitable parameter. Also when f (x) is an element of C-2 [a, b], the error estimation formula of the interpolator is obtained.", "paper_title": "Local control and approximation properties of a C-2 rational interpolating curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559500006"}
