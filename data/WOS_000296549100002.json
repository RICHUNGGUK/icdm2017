Current deployment is reviewed and the growing opportunity to better address previously identified problems (both process and structural) within the construction industry is considered. Taking a 20 year perspective, the challenges and the opportunities that digital buildings will present to the construction industry - and to its IT suppliers - are explored against the context of needing to deliver greater value while also addressing sustainability, zero carbon and enhanced resilience objectives.
