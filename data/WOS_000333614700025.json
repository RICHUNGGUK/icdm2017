Owing to its unique properties, theoretically, one could restart a memristor-based computer immediately without the need for reloading the data. Further, current memories are mainly binary and can store only ones and zeros, whereas memristors have multilevel states, which means a single memristor unit can replace many binary transistors and realize higher-density memory. It is believed that memristors can also implement analog storage besides binary and multilevel information memory. In this paper, an implementation scheme for analog memristive memory is considered. A charge-controlled memristor model is derived and the corresponding SPICE model is constructed. Special write and read operations are demonstrated through numerical analysis and circuit simulations. In addition, an audio analog record/play system using a memristor crossbar array is designed. This system can provide great storage capacity (long recording time) and high audio quality with a simple small circuit structure. A series of computer simulations and analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Analog memristive memory with applications in audio signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333614700025"}
