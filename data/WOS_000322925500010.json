First, the T-S fuzzy model-based MPPT controller is developed to directly regulate the DC rectified voltage of the generator to the maximum power point voltage. The asymptotic MPPT control is guaranteed without measuring the wind speed and searching the maximum power point. Next, the robustness of the T-S fuzzy MPPT control is discussed under uncertainties, disturbance, and rapidly changing wind speed. The maximum power operational point of the converter is not calculated in the controller design, such that uncertainties are allowed in strict stability analysis. Finally, the satisfactory performance is shown from the simulation and experimental results.", "paper_title": "T-S Fuzzy Direct Maximum Power Point Tracking of Wind Energy Conversion Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322925500010"}
