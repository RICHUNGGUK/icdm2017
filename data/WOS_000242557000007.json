We start by analyzing the effects of a weather system on a vehicle traversing a single link. This helps characterize the time-dependent attributes of a link due to movement of the weather systems. This analysis is used as a building block for the problem of finding a least risk path for hazmat transportation on a network exposed to such weather systems. Several methods are offered to solve the underlying problem, and computational results are reported. We draw two conclusions from this paper. First, it is possible to determine the time-dependent attributes for links on a network provided that some assumptions on the nature of the weather system are made. Second, heuristics can provide effective solutions for practical size problems while allowing for parking the vehicle to avoid weather system effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
