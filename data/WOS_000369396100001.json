Several control and monitoring solutions for commercial and industrial applications are introduced in the literature. Many of them use wireless networks or GSM cellular data to find the physical location of an object or a wireless node with respect to a reference point. This paper presents a new line-of-sight technique for passive localization based on a transmitting multifrequency antenna array and a receiver. Objects equipped with an appropriate receiver are enabled to discover their location within a certain area dictated by the transmitted signal. Both frequency and phase variation are used in order to give a highly accurate and precise estimation of the range and the angle between the transmitter and the receiver(s). Extensive analysis and simulations are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and the precision of the proposed self-localization technique. It can be adopted for different frequency bands. However, 2.4-GHz frequency is selected where several wireless systems find application. Average root mean square error for range and angle estimation is 15 cm and 0.1 degrees, respectively. The simulation results of this technique have been compared with those of other methods proving its high accuracy, moderate complexity, and cost efficiency.", "paper_title": "A Novel Self-Localization Technique for Wireless Receivers Using Transmitting Multifrequency Antenna Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000369396100001"}
