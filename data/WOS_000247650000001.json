The intensity measurements obtained from such sensors are highly dependent on the location, geometry, and surface properties of the reflecting feature in a way that cannot be represented by a simple analytical relationship, therefore complicating the differentiation process. We construct feature vectors based on the parameters of angular IR intensity scans from different targets to determine their geometry and/or surface type. Mixture of normals classifier with three components correctly differentiates three types of geometries with different surface properties, resulting in the best performance (100%) in geometry differentiation. Parametric differentiation correctly identifies six different surface types of the same planar geometry, resulting, in the best surface differentiation rate (100%). However, this rate is not maintained with the inclusion of more surfaces. The results indicate that the geometrical properties of the targets are more distinctive than their surface properties, and surface recognition is the limiting factor in differentiation. The results demonstrate that simple IR sensors, when coupled with appropriate processing and recognition techniques, can be used to extract Substantially more information than such devices are commonly employed for.
