Given the large number of websites that are backed by SQL databases, methods that automate the translation of those databases to RDF are crucial. One approach, taken by a number of researchers, is to directly map the SQL schema to an equivalent Web Ontology Language (OWL) or RDF Schema representation, which in turn, implies an RDF representation for the relational data. This paper reviews this research, and derives a consolidated, overarching set of translation rules expressible as a stratified Datalog program. We present all the possible key combinations in an SQL schema and consider their implied semantic properties. We review the approaches and characterize them with respect to the scope of their coverage of SQL constructs.", "paper_title": "Survey of directly mapping SQL databases to the Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000298544100003"}
