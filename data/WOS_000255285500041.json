The computation of subsurface scattering is performed by first converting the integration over the 3D model surface into an integration over a 2D texture space and then applying importance sampling based on the irradiance stored in the texture. Such a conversion leads to a feasible GPU implementation and makes real-time frame rate possible. Our implementation shows that plausible images can be rendered in real time for complex translucent models with dynamic light and material properties. For objects with more apparent local effect, our approach generally requires more samples that may downgrade the frame rate. To deal with this case, we decompose the integration into two parts, one for local effect and the other for global effect, which are evaluated by the combination of available methods [DS03, MKB* 03a] and our texture space importance sampling, respectively. Such a hybrid scheme is able to steadily render the translucent effect in real time with a fixed amount of samples.", "paper_title": "Real-time translucent rendering using GPU-based texture space importance sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500041"}
