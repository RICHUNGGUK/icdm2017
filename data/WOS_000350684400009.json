This problem is known to be NP-hard, even when k = 1 (Garey and Johnson, Computers and Intractability, 1979). This paper first gives a simple approximation algorithm with factor-(2, 2), i.e. the algorithm computes a solution with delay and cost bounded by 2 * D and 2 * C respectively. Later, a novel improved approximation algorithm with ratio (1 + beta, max{2, 1 + ln(1/ beta)}) is developed by constructing interesting auxiliary graphs and employing the cycle cancellation method. As a consequence, we can obtain a factor-(1.369, 2) approximation algorithm immediately and a factor-(1.567, 1.567) algorithm by slightly modifying the algorithm. Besides, when beta = 0, the algorithm is shown to be with ratio (1, O(ln n)), i.e. it is an algorithm with only a single factor ratio O(ln n) on cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial approximation algorithm that strictly obeys the delay constraint for the kBCP problem.", "paper_title": "Improved approximation algorithms for computing k disjoint paths subject to two constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000350684400009"}
