Meanwhile VoIP is one popular application and a viable alternative to traditional telephony systems due to its cost efficiency. VoIP over WLAN (VoWLAN) has been emerging as an infrastructure to provide low-cost wireless voice services. However, VoWLAN poses significant challenges due to the characteristics of contention-based protocols and wireless networks. In this article we propose two mechanisms to provide quality of service for variable bit rate VoIP in IEEE 802.11e content ion-based channel access WLANs: access time-based admission control and access point dynamic access. Simulation results are conducted to study these schemes.", "paper_title": "Variable bit rate VoIP in IEEE 802.11e wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000253325100009"}
