The former is well known for its high accuracy and the latter for its low delay. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of scalable depth sensing to integrate the advantages of both the TM and SN methods. Our contribution is twofold. First, we design a set of hybrid structured light patterns composed of phase-shifted fringe and pseudo-random speckle. Under the illumination of the hybrid patterns, depth can be decently reconstructed either from a few consecutive frames with the TM principle for static scenes or from a single frame with the SN principle for dynamic scenes. Second, we propose a scene-adaptive depth sensing framework based on which a global or region-wise optimal depth map can be generated through motion detection. To validate the proposed scalable paradigm, we develop a real-time (20fps) depth sensing system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an efficient balance between accuracy and speed during depth sensing that has rarely been exploited before.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Scalable Depth Sensing With Hybrid Structured Light Illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000329195500008"}
