A 6th order WENO scheme with minimized dispersion and controllable dissipation is employed to compute the inviscid fluxes, a 4th order central difference scheme is applied to compute the viscous fluxes, and a 6th order conservative compact scheme is used for computing the geometrical metrics. An implicit LU-SGS method is used for time integration to improve computational efficiency over the explicit schemes such as the Runge-Kutta approach. The validity and applicability of the present algorithm is confirmed by comparing our results with laboratory experimental measurements and DNS results in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
