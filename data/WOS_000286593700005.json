If in contrast, the set of propositional operators is restricted, the complexity may decrease. This article systematically studies the model-checking problem for LTL formulae over restricted sets of propositional and temporal operators. For almost all combinations of temporal and propositional operators, we determine whether the model-checking problem is tractable (in P) or intractable (NP-hard). We then focus on the tractable cases, showing that they all are NL-complete or even logspace solvable. This leads to a surprising gap in complexity between tractable and intractable cases. It is worth noting that our analysis covers an infinite set of problems, since there are infinitely many sets of propositional operators.", "paper_title": "The Tractability of Model Checking for LTL: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000286593700005"}
