Although the database itself has been growing rapidly, the search paradigm of MEDLINE has remained largely unchanged. Results: Here, we propose a new system for exploring the entire MEDLINE collection, represented by two unique features: (i) interactive: providing instant feedback to users' query letter by letter, and (ii) fuzzy: allowing approximate search. We develop novel index structures and search algorithms to make such a search model possible. We also develop incremental-update techniques to keep the data up to date. Availability: Interactive and fuzzy searching algorithms for exploring MEDLINE are implemented in a system called iPubMed, freely accessible over the web at http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu/ and http://tastier.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ipubmed/ Contact: chenli@ics.uci.edu; xhx@ics.uci.edu", "paper_title": "Interactive and fuzzy search: a dynamic way to explore MEDLINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000281714100051"}
