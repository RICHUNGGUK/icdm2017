Color-blending is a major usability challenge as it leads to loss of color encodings and poor text legibility. Color correction aims at mitigating color blending by producing an alternative color which, when blended with the background, more closely approximates the color originally intended. In this paper we present an end-to-end approach to the color blending problem addressing the distortions introduced by the transparent material of the display efficiently and in real time. We also present a user evaluation of correction efficiency. Finally, we present a graphics library called SmartColor showcasing the use of color correction for different types of display content. SmartColor uses color correction to provide three management strategies: correction, contrast, and show-up-on-contrast. Correction determines the alternate color which best preserves the original color. Contrast determines the color which best supports text legibility while preserving as much of the original hue. Show-up-on-contrast makes a component visible when a related component does not have enough contrast to be legible. We describe SmartColor's architecture and illustrate the color strategies for various types of display content.", "paper_title": "SmartColor: Real-Time Color and Contrast Correction for Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000364037400004"}
