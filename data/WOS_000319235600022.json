We define the overall structure of the architecture and propose a flexible strategy to distribute the load due to the management of the entities of the DVE. The proposed approach takes into account the utilisation of the nodes, the economical cost due to their use of bandwidth, and their probability of failure. A greedy heuristics is exploited to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm in order to maintain a fair interactivity level to the end user of the DVE. A mobility model generating realistic Second Life traces is exploited to evaluate our algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
