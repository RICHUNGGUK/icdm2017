The ideal characteristics of a compliance mechanism include small volume, simple mechanical structure, low cost, large complaint range, and high precision and accuracy under displacement control. Most mechanical compliance mechanisms are able to meet the first three conditions but have a small compliant range and low precision and accuracy under displacement control. The electronic compliance mechanism is hardly limited in the degree of deformation and comes with a higher precision and accuracy under the displacement control, but its sensors are expensive and the system is difficult to control. To combine the advantages of both types, this research aims to develop a new design of compliance mechanism in which a small-scale torque-limiting mechanism with a self-locking feature is installed between the actuator and the arm structure to minimize the volume while providing an ample torque limit. When the robotic arm is overloaded under an external force, a slide will occur inside the compliance mechanism so that the robotic arm will move along the direction of the external force to avoid damage. The robotic arm will automatically return to its original position after the external force is removed. The new compliance mechanism not only exceeds most of the current mechanical designs in the range of compliance but also does not affect the precision and accuracy of the displacement control. Furthermore, the new compliance mechanism does not require any sensors, which will benefit small robotic arms.", "paper_title": "New Compliance-Mechanism Design for Small Companion Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000297365600015"}
