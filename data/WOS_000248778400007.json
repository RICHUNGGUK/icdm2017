A suitable data structure is developed for the local mesh adaptation process to be flexible and low CPU time consuming. The whole procedure is designed in the framework of finite-volume methods on unstructured grids. To avoid the appearance of ill-conditioned near-wall cells in the vicinity of curved surfaces of bodies a global mesh deformation technique is used. The whole procedure is applied to a complex turbulent flow around a high-lift multiple element airfoil in take-off configuration using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The adaptation is controlled by as many indicators as there are equations involved in the problem. It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology performs rigorous local adaptive mesh refinement and automatically achieves grid independent results. Thus, interesting gains are obtained in terms of CPU time, memory requirement and user effort compared to single mesh computations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
