Then, the analyses are extended to nondecreasing saturated activation functions with 2r corner points and some sufficient conditions are given to guarantee that the n-neuron DDCGNNs can have (r+1)(n) locally exponentially stable equilibrium points. Moreover, some conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of locally exponentially stable equilibrium point in a predesigned region. Finally, three examples are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
