This framework provides a common input-output interface among those HS modules developed on the framework, with a completely two-directional flow control and a highly parallel processing. This integration framework facilitates the incorporation of heterogeneous modules, together with their subsequent management and updating.", "paper_title": "Framework of fully integrated hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299177300005"}
