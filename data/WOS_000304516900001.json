The system continuously measures wheel slip under field conditions and generates commands for depth adjustment if the wheel slip falls outside the desired range. Wheel slip was calculated using the actual and theoretical speeds of the tractor obtained by measuring the rotational speed (rpm) of front and rear wheels, respectively. The developed system was installed on a test tractor and the performance was evaluated with different implements under varying field conditions. The performance data indicated a significant reduction in fuel consumption per hectare (20-30%), increase in field capacity (7-38%), and gain in tractive efficiency (4-10%) with slip control system versus the existing draft control system. The slip control system is also expected to reduce the operator's effort as it adjusts the depth control lever automatically in response to variation in the soil conditions within the field.
