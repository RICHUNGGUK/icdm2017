Rather than assuming a specific, fixed set of cryptographic primitives, we only require them to be specified through a term rewriting system, with no restrictions. Examples are provided to support our analysis. First, we tackle forward secrecy for a Diffie-Hellman-based protocol involving exponentiation, multiplication and inversion. Then, a simplified version of Kerberos is analyzed, showing that its use of timestamps succeeds in preventing replay attacks.", "paper_title": "Handling exp, x (and timestamps) in protocol analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000028"}
