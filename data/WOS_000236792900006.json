The reverse direction of whether ZPP(NP) contained in S-2(p) remains open. We show that if the zero-error algorithm is allowed to ask only one query to the NP oracle (for any input and random string), then it can be simulated in S-2(p). That is, we prove that ZPP(NP[1]) subset of S-2(p). Next we consider whether the above result can be improved as ZPP(NP[1]) subset of P-NP and point out a difficulty in doing so. Via a simple proof, we observe that BPP subset of ZPP(NP[1]) (a result implicitly proven in some prior work). Thus, achieving the above improvement would imply BPP subset of P-NP, settling a long standing open problem. We then argue that the above mentioned improvement can be obtained for the next level of the polynomial time hierarchy. Namely, we prove that ZPP(Sigma 2 p[1]) subset of P-Sigma 2 p[2]. On the other hand, by adapting Our proof of our main result it can be shown that ZPP(Sigma 2 p[1]) subset of S-2(NP[1]). For the purpose of comparing these two results, we prove that P-Sigma 2 p subset of S-2(NP[1]). We conclude by observing that the above claims extend to the higher levels of the hierarchy: for k >= 2, ZPP(Sigma k p[1]) subset of P-Sigma k p[2] and P-Sigma k p subset of S-2(Sigma k-1 p[1]).", "paper_title": "On zero error algorithms having oracle access to one query", "paper_id": "WOS:000236792900006"}
