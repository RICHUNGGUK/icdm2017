Lower emission, convenient charging experience, high performance, and energy security are considered as the significant benefits of the mentioned technology. Despite the aforementioned advantages, inappropriate place and size of CSs have brought new challenges for electric distribution systems. Prominent features of distributed generations (DGs) make this technology appropriate for compensating relevant problems of CSs installation. In this paper, simultaneous optimal planning (placing and sizing) of CSs and DGs is presented to address new challenges. In addition, financial (investment costs), technical (system reliability, power loss, and voltage profile), and environmental (CO2 emission) issues are considered in the proposed objective function. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the simulation study is carried out on a 33-bus radial distribution network. The simulation results show the effects of installation of CSs in the presence/absence of DGs on total costs, reliability, loss, voltage profile, and emission. Moreover, the effects of increasing PEV's availability are evaluated on the aforementioned terms in the electric distribution network.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Planning of PEV Charging Stations and DGs Considering Financial, Technical, and Environmental Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000362408000005"}
