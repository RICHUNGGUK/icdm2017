A cavitation model is implemented in a viscous Navier-Stokes solver. The liquid-vapour interface is assumed as a free surface boundary of the computation domain. Its shape is determined with an iterative procedure to match the cavity surface to a constant pressure boundary. The pressure distribution, as well as its gradient along the wall, is taken into account in updating the cavity shape iteratively. A series of computations are performed for the cavitating flows across three kinds of headform/cylinder bodies: conic, ogival and hemispheric heads. A range of cavitation numbers is investigated for each headform/cylinder body. The obtained results are reasonable and the iterative procedure of cavity shape updating is quite stable. The superiority of the developed cavitation model and algorithm is demonstrated.
