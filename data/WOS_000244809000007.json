We proposed the first threshold GQ signature scheme. The scheme is proved unforgeable and robust against any adaptive adversary by assuming hardness of computing discrete logarithm modulo a safe prime and existence of fully synchronous broadcast channel. Furthermore, with some modifications, our scheme achieves optimal resilience such that the adversary can corrupt up to a half of the players. As an extension of our work, we provided a threshold identity-based signature scheme and a threshold forward-secure signature scheme, which is the threshold version of the most efficient forward-secure signature scheme up to now.
