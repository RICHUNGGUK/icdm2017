After validation of the numerical procedures employing a high-order hybrid WENO/compact scheme by comparing the results of simulation with the results obtained from a well characterized experimental case, the effects of the convective Mach number, M-c, flow velocity ratio, r = U-1/U-2, and fluid density ratio, s = rho(1)/rho(2), between Stream 1 and Stream 2 on passive scalar mixing are considered by examining the variation of mixing layer thickness and the mixing efficiency represented by the transport of the passive scalar. M-c is specified from 0.2 to 0.8. The evolution of large-scale coherent structures is well reproduced, with vortices undergoing rolling up, pairing, merging, and breaking up. The mixing layer thickness and mixing efficiency both decrease as M-c increases. As s increases, the mixing layer thickness increases, and the mixing efficiency of an entrained fluid decreases. As r increases, the mixing layer thickness decreases while the mixing efficiency increases. While the present results are not applicable to the examination of micro-mixing properties, which require assessment by experimental methods or high computing cost direct numerical simulation, they are useful for evaluating the effects of different flow parameters on macro-performance, which is equally important for scramjet combustor design and evaluation in engineering.
