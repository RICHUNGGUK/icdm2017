For this purpose, a content analysis was performed of comments which led to the rejection of the manuscripts at AC-IE. For the content analysis, a classification scheme with thematic areas developed by Bornmann et al. (2008) was used. As the results of the analysis demonstrate, a large number of negative comments from referees in the areas \"Relevance of contribution'' and \"Design/Conception'' are clear signs that a manuscript rejected at AC-IE will not be published later in a high-impact journal. The number of negative statements in the areas \"Writing/Presentation,'' \"Discussion of results,'' \"Method/Statistics,'' and \"Reference to the literature and documentation,'' on the other hand, had no statistically significant influence on the probability that a rejected manuscript would later be published in a low-or high-impact journal. The results of this study have various implications for authors, journal editors and referees.", "paper_title": "A content analysis of referees' comments: how do comments on manuscripts rejected by a high-impact journal and later published in either a low- or high-impact journal differ?", "paper_id": "WOS:000276499500013"}
