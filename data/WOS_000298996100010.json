A new approach to solve such systems based on the new concept \"inclusion linear system\" is proposed. Moreover, new necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for obtaining the unique algebraic solution. Furthermore, based on our method, an algorithm is proposed and numerically demonstrated. Finally, we compare the result obtained by our method with that obtained by interval Gauss elimination procedure.", "paper_title": "A new approach to obtain algebraic solution of interval linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298996100010"}
