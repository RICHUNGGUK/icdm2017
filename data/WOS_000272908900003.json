The test cases generated according to the proposed approach satisfy the scenario coverage criterion and are suitable for system-level testing. For prioritizing test cases, three different prioritization metrics are proposed. The values of these prioritization metrics can be analytically computed from the model information only. This paper also presents an approach to generate test data using a concept called rule-based matrix. The prioritization metrics are used to control the number of test data without compromising the test adequacy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified using two industrial designs.
