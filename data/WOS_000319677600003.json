In this paper, we study the problem of load balance with guarantee of users' rate and formulate a general optimization model, where the weighted sum of the first-order and second-order statistics of load distribution (load variance and total load level) are considered directly. We prove the convexity of the model and derive the optimal user-station association scheme in different weights. Based on analysis of the optimization model, a dynamic admission and handover scheme is proposed. Mobile users with rate requirement select a base station based on the load utility in a distributed way and handover to the selected station (if handover is triggered). Furthermore, a simulation platform with seven cells is developed to evaluate the dynamic admission and handover scheme. It is demonstrated that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional counterpart.
