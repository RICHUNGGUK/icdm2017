Such sources usually have stringent jitter or delay requirements and in many cases they should be delivered exactly as they were generated. In this paper, we propose a strictly guaranteed QoS (quality-of-service) provisioning CAC (call admission control) scheme with a polling-based scheduling policy for CBR traffic in IEEE 802.11e wireless LANs. Under such a scheme, the proposed transmit-permission policy for HCCA (HCF controlled channel access) method can forecast the maximum suffered delay for each packet and derive sufficient conditions so that all the CBR sources satisfy their time constraints to provide deterministic QoS guarantees. A simple analytical model is carried out to estimate the average queueing delay of the proposed scheme. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted to validate its promising performance. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme maintains a high throughput with respect to the whole range of system load.
