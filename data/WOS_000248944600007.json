The basis of the algorithm formulation was the phenomenon of bone adaptation to mechanical stimulation. This process, called remodeling, leads to the optimization of the trabecular network in the bone. The simulation system, as well as the finite element mesh generation, decision criteria for structural adaptation, and the finite element analysis in a parallel environment are described. The possibility of applying the system in mechanical design is discussed. Some computation results using the developed system are presented, including the comparison to the topology optimization method.", "paper_title": "Structural optimization system based on trabecular bone surface adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248944600007"}
