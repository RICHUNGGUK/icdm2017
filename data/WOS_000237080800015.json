GIP is also the core of E-Government and is important communication channel between the government and its citizens. This paper first analyses the deficiency of the existing GIP, then proposes to apply Grid technology to improve the GIP. Based on new Grid standards on OGSA, OGSI and its implementation GT3.2, We implemented a prototype system of government information integration and sharing. The system makes use of Grid service as its basic unit and adopts GT3.2 as a development and operating platform. The system fully utilizes the capacity of the Grid environment and can easily realize the integration and sharing of government information.", "paper_title": "Research and implementation of E-Government information portal based on grid technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800015"}
