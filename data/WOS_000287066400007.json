Indeed, due to these queueing variations, end-to-end applications experience large delay jitter. Many studies have proposed efficient active queue management (AQM) mechanisms in order to reduce queue oscillations and stabilize the queue length. These AQM attempt to improve the random early detection (RED) model. Unfortunately, these enhancements do not react in a similar manner for various network conditions and are strongly sensitive to their initial setting parameters. Although this paper proposes a solution to overcome the difficulties of configuring the RED parameters by using a Kohonen neural network model; another goal of this study is to investigate whether cognitive intelligence could be placed in the core network to solve such stability problem. In our context, we use results from the neural network area to demonstrate that our proposal, named Kohonen-RED (KRED), enables a stable queue length without complex parameters setting or passive measurements to obtain a correct configuration.
