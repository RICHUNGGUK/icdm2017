At the very beginning they were called projective Reed-Muller type codes and their main parameters (length, dimension and minimum distance) were computed in several particular cases. In fact, the length and dimension of the evaluation codes arising from a complete intersection are known. In this paper we will calculate the minimum distance of some evaluation codes associated to a subset of the projective space that is a complete intersection. These codes are a generalization of the evaluation codes associated to a projective torus which are called generalized projective Reed-Solomon codes.", "paper_title": "Minimum distance of some evaluation codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000320041100001"}
