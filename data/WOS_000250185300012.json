However, the classification rules derived from most classifiers are complex and difficult to understand in biological significance. How to solve this problem is a new challenge. In this paper, a new classification model based on gene pair is proposed to address the problem. The experimental results on several microarray data demonstrate that the proposed classification model performs well in finding a large number of excellent feature gene pairs. A 100% LOOCV classification accuracy can be achieved using a single classification model based on optimal feature gene pair or combining multiple top-ranked classification models. Using the proposed method, we successfully identified important cancer-related genes that had been validated in previous biological studies while they were not discovered by the other methods.
