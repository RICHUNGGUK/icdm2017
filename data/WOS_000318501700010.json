This leads us to apply a concept of multivalued phase pressures and a notion of weak solution for the flow which have been introduced in CancSs and Pierre (SIAM J Math Anal 44(2):966-992, 2012). We discretize the problem by means of a numerical algorithm which reduces to a standard finite volume scheme in each rock and prove the convergence of the approximate solution to a weak solution of the two-phase flow problem. The numerical experiments show in particular that this scheme permits to reproduce the oil-trapping phenomenon.", "paper_title": "Finite volume approximation for an immiscible two-phase flow in porous media with discontinuous capillary pressure", "paper_id": "WOS:000318501700010"}
