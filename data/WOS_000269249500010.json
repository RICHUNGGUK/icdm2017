We demonstrate this by looking into the heavy-tailed distributions of observables in fatal plane and car accidents. Their origin is examined and can be understood as stochastic processes that are related to human activities. Simple mathematical models are proposed to illustrate such processes and compared with empirical results obtained from existing databanks.", "paper_title": "HEAVY-TAILED DISTRIBUTIONS IN FATAL TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS: ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269249500010"}
