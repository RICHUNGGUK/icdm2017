In this paper, the weaknesses in complexity and security of AES S-box are analyzed. We propose to increase the complexity and security of AES S-box by modifying the affine transformation and adding an affine transformation. Performance analysis demonstrates that the improved AES S-box has following cryptographic properties: the affine transformation period is increased from 4 to the most 16, the iterative period is increased from less than 88 to the most 256, and the distance to SAC is reduced from, 432 to 372. Moreover, the number of terms in the improved AES S-box algebraic expression is increased from 9 to 255, and its inverse S-box keeps almost the same as AES inverse S-box. Comparison results suggest that the improved AES S-box has better performance and can readily be applied to AES.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED AES S-BOX AND ITS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100022"}
