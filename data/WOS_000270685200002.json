At the same time, frequently, protein repeats are strongly degenerated during evolution and, therefore, cannot be easily identified. To solve this problem, several computer programs which were based on different algorithms have been developed. Nevertheless, our tests showed that there is still room for improvement of methods for accurate and rapid detection of tandem repeats in proteins. Results: We developed a new program called T-REKS for ab initio identification of the tandem repeats. It is based on clustering of lengths between identical short strings by using a K-means algorithm. Benchmark of the existing programs and T-REKS on several sequence datasets is presented. Our program being linked to the Protein Repeat DataBase opens the way for large-scale analysis of protein tandem repeats. T-REKS can also be applied to the nucleotide sequences.", "paper_title": "T-REKS: identification of Tandem REpeats in sequences with a K-meanS based algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200002"}
