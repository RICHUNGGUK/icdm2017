Here, we use electroencephalographic source imaging methods to estimate the cortical movement-related oscillatory activity during finger extension movements. Then, we apply network theory to investigate changes (expressed as differences from the baseline) in the connectivity structure of cortical networks related to the preparation and execution of the movement. We compute the topological accessibility of different cortical areas, measuring how well an area can be reached by the rest of the network. Analysis of cortical networks reveals specific agglomerates of cortical sources that become less accessible during the preparation and the execution of the finger movements. The observed changes neither could be explained by other measures based on geodesics or on multiple paths, nor by power changes in the cortical oscillations.", "paper_title": "Node Accessibility in Cortical Networks During Motor Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322259300007"}
