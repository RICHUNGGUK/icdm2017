This management helps in minimizing congestion and improving network energy conservation through its load based allocation (LBA) and time allocation leister (TAL) techniques. LBA is typically based on STDMA that uses sensor node information for assignment of dynamic timeslots to the sensor, nodes, whereas TAL targets the mobility management of sensor nodes that further comprises three main strategies of cluster member node that is, joining cluster, leaving cluster, and absence of data/redundant data with extricated time allocation (ETA), shift back time allocation (SBTA), and eScaped Time Allocation (STA) subtechniques. In addition, TSEEC protocol introduces the mobility pattern to control the mobile sensor node (MSN) movement to enable the protocol to effectively adapt itself to change the traffic environments and mobility. Mathematical analysis and NS2 simulation show that TSEEC outperforms SMAC in terms of energy consumption and packet deliver ratio. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of TSEEC with various well-known related MAC protocols is also given.", "paper_title": "Mobility Aware Energy Efficient Congestion Control in Mobile Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000332974800001"}
