Contracts are expressed by social commitments associated with temporal constraints. The procedure reasons from the relations among such commitments, and returns one amongst different possible mismatches that may have caused an exception. In particular, we consider two possibilities: , when two agents have two different views of the same commitment, and , when there is no misalignment, but a debtor agent fails to oblige. We also provide a realignment policy that can be applied in case of a misalignment. Our formalization uses a reactive form of Event Calculus. We illustrate the workings of our approach by discussing a delivery process from e-commerce as a case study.", "paper_title": "Exception diagnosis in multiagent contract executions", "paper_id": "WOS:000303801500003"}
