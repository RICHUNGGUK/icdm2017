Such evaluation reveals the capability of the SS to tolerate the worst faults over a prescribed set under possible energy constraints. The evaluation is achieved by using the smallest eigenvalue of a proposed 'switched-system controllability Gramian'. Simulation results about a longitudinal flight control process example are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fault recoverability analysis of switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297251500012"}
