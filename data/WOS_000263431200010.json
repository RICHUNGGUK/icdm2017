Some existing clustering algorithms uses single prototype to represent each cluster, which may not adequately model the clusters Of arbitrary shape and size and hence limit the clustering performance on complex data structure. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm to represent one cluster by multiple prototypes. The squared-error clustering is used to produce a number of prototypes to locate the regions of high density because of its low computational cost and yet good performance. A separation measure is proposed to evaluate how well two prototypes are separated. Multiple prototypes with small separations are grouped into a given number of clusters in the agglomerative method. New prototypes are iteratively added to improve the poor cluster separations. As a result, the proposed algorithm can discover the clusters of complex structure with robustness to initial settings. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
