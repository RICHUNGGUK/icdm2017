First method works autonomously utilizing star coordinates in three consecutive image frames thus independent of star identification or biased attitude information. The parameters obtained in autonomous self-calibration technique helps to identify the imaged stars with the cataloged stars. Least Square based second method utilizes inertial star coordinates to determine satellite attitude and star camera parameters with lens radial distortion, both independent of each other. Camera parameters determined by the second method are more accurate than the first method of camera self calibration. Moreover, unlike most of the attitude determination algorithms where attitude of the satellite depend on the camera calibrating parameters, the second method has the advantage of computing spacecraft attitude independent of camera calibrating parameters except lens distortions (radial). Finally Kalman filter based sequential estimation scheme is employed to filter out the noise of the LS based estimation.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Star Camera Calibration and Spacecraft Attitude Determination", "paper_id": "WOS:000356816000010"}
