The present study aimed to investigate the use of optimization of architecture and weights of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for identification of the factors related to CMDs. The identification of the factors was possible by optimizing the architecture and weights of the network. The optimization of architecture and weights of ANNs is based on Particle Swarm Optimization with early stopping criteria. This approach achieved a good generalization control, as well as similar or better results than other techniques, but with a lower computational cost, with the ability to generate small networks and with the advantage of the automated architecture selection, which simplify the training process. This paper presents the results obtained in the experiments with ANNs in which it was observed an average percentage of correct classification of individuals with positive diagnostic for the CMDs of 90.59%.
