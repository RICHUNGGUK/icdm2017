In this method, image features are extracted by Scale-Invariant Feature Transform in each frame, and their correspondence in two contiguous frames is then computed separately in foreground and background regions. By using the above two functions, the proposed method accurately generates interpolation frames and thus achieves frame rate up-conversion.", "paper_title": "Video Frame Interpolation by Image Morphing Including Fully Automatic Correspondence Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700040"}
