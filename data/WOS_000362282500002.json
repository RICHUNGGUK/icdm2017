However, existing sequential algorithms for subgraph enumeration fall short in handling large graphs due to the involvement of computationally intensive subgraph isomorphism operations. Thus, some recent researches focus on solving the problem using MapReduce. Nevertheless, exiting MapReduce approaches are not scalable to handle very large graphs since they either produce a huge number of partial results or consume a large amount of memory. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm Twin Twig Join based on a left-deep-join framework in MapReduce, in which the basic join unit is a Twin Twig (an edge or two incident edges of a node). We show that in the Erds-Renyi random-graph model, Twin Twig Join is instance optimal in the left-deep-join framework under reasonable assumptions, and we devise an algorithm to compute the optimal join plan. Three optimization strategies are explored to improve our algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss how our approach can be adapted in the power-law random-graph model. We conduct extensive performance studies in several real graphs, one of which contains billions of edges. Our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in all tests.", "paper_title": "Scalable Subgraph Enumeration in MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000362282500002"}
