In this paper, we present a multi-process approach that is mainly performed in 2D space to faithfully construct a 3D model of the trunk and main branches of a real tree from a single range image. The range image is first segmented into patches by jump edge detection based on depth discontinuity. Coarse skeleton points and initial radii are then computed from the contour of each patch. Axis directions are estimated using cylinder fitting in the neighborhood of each coarse skeleton point. With the help of axis directions, skeleton nodes and corresponding radii are computed. Finally, these skeleton nodes are hierarchically connected, and improper radii are modified based on plant knowledge. 3D models generated from single range images of real trees demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The main contributions of this paper are simple reconstruction by virtue of image storage order of single scan and skeleton computation based on axis directions.", "paper_title": "Simple reconstruction of tree branches from a single range image", "paper_id": "WOS:000251010700007"}
