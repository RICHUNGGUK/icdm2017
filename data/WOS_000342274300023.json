When free surfaces are simulated using this method a Dirichlet boundary condition for pressure at the free surface has to be applied. In existing ISPH methods this is achieved by identifying free surface particles using heuristically chosen threshold of a parameter such as kernel sum, density or divergence of the position, and explicitly setting their pressure values. This often leads to clumping of particles near the free surface and spraying off of surface particles during splashes. Moreover, surface pressure gradients in flows where surface tension is important are not captured well using this approach. We propose a more accurate semi-analytical approach to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the free surface. We show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by using test cases of elongation of a droplet and dam break. We perform two dimensional simulations of water entry and validate the proposed algorithm with experimental results. Further, a three dimensional simulation of droplet splash is shown to compare well with the Volume-of-Fluid simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
