Securing data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure the data provenance for these devices by exploiting spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless channel that these devices use for communication. Our solution enables two parties to generate closely matching link fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party can later verify the details of the transaction, particularly the wireless link on which the data was transmitted. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge; they are lightweight compared with traditional provenance mechanisms and enable interesting security properties such as accountability, nonrepudiation, and resist man-in-the-middle attacks. We validate our technique with experiments using bodyworn sensors in scenarios approximating actual device deployment and present some extensions, which reduce energy consumption. We believe this is a promising first step toward using wireless-link characteristics for the data provenance in body area networks.", "paper_title": "Securing First-Hop Data Provenance for Bodyworn Devices Using Wireless Link Fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000353290200003"}
