The bentness was finally proved later in 2009 using a complicated technique that employs Stickelberger's theorem. Extensively using the previously found results and approaches, in this paper, a surprisingly short proof for the conjectured expression of the dual is given but without resolving the sign ambiguity. Furthermore, we resolve the sign by finding the trace representation of the dual function.", "paper_title": "On the Dual of Certain Ternary Weakly Regular Bent Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800015"}
