To improve these issues, this paper introduces a novel disk I/O model for virtualized cloud system called HypeGear, where the guest file system uses synchronous operations to deal with the guest write request and the host file system performs asynchronous operations to write the data to the hard disk. A prototype system is implemented on the Xen hypervisor and our experimental results verify that this new model has many advantages over the conventional asynchronous-synchronous model. We also evaluate the overhead of asynchronous I/O at host, which is brought by our new model. The result demonstrates that it enforces little cost on host layer.", "paper_title": "A New Disk I/O Model of Virtualized Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499900008"}
