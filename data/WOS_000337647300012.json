Traditionally, stereo cameras have been used as a low-cost 3D sensor. However, the lack of precision and texture for some surfaces suggests that the use of other 3D sensors could be more suitable. In this work, we examine the use of two sensors: an infrared SR4000 and a Kinect camera. We use a combination of 3D data obtained by these cameras, along with features obtained from 2D images acquired from these cameras, using a Growing Neural Gas (GNG) network applied to the 3D data. The goal is to obtain a robust egomotion technique. The GNG network is used to reduce the camera error. To calculate the egomotion, we test two methods for 3D registration. One is based on an iterative closest points algorithm, and the other employs random sample consensus. Finally, a simultaneous localization and mapping method is applied to the complete sequence to reduce the global error. The error from each sensor and the mapping results from the proposed method are examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
