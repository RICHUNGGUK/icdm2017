To exploit these resources, new distributed algorithms are necessary, particularly concerning the way to distribute data and to use this partition. We present a clustering algorithm dubbed Progressive Clustering that provides an \"intelligent\" distribution of data on grids. The usefulness of this algorithm is shown for several distributed datamining tasks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
