Moreover, such activation of multiple radios from the application layer is another aspect, which is yet to be examined. Therefore, we investigate simultaneous activation of heterogeneous radios from the application layer in this paper. Our study reveals that we can significantly improve network performance with the simultaneous activation, and the improvement can even be disproportionately higher than the capability of the additional low-capability radio. However, the activation requires a judicious exploitation of the heterogeneous radios, i.e., suitable splitting of data over the radios. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer mathematical model to estimate the optimal data splitting. Estimations from our proposed model exhibit only 3 % average error, which we verify through ns-2 simulation. Besides, we evaluate the notion of simultaneous activation over a number of different network topologies through both ns-2 simulation and real testbed experiment to demonstrate achieving the disproportionately high performance improvement.", "paper_title": "SiAc: simultaneous activation of heterogeneous radios in high data rate multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000023"}
