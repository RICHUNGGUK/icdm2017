An uncertain continuous Takagi-Sueeno (T-S) fuzzy system with both state and input varying delays, in the presence of possible actuator faults, is obtained equivalently on the basis of the input delay methodology. A tighter bounding lemma is proposed so as to gain less conservative closed-loop stability criteria. Delay-dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived for the mode-independent fault-tolerant stabilizing controller of the resulting Markovian network-based system by employing a novel stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional. An illustrative example is simulated to show the validity of the obtained results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
