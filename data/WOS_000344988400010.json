While more and more wireless devices are phased in, a user can barely familiarize herself with managing these devices. This is because wireless devices often operate in some form of binding relationships among themselves, which are typically set up at startup in a self-organizing fashion, leaving the user little room for intervention. As a remedy, we propose a software-hardware codesign and implementation that enable the user to adapt network operations to certain needs anytime without knowledge of low-level details. Binding manipulation is done straightaway with simple mouse clicking and dragging on icons in our graphical user interface. We demonstrate example applications in green power systems as well. A practical platform over which to inspire other applications, this study elegantly lends itself to generic wireless network environments.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE BINDING OF WIRELESS DEVICES FOR HOME AUTOMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988400010"}
