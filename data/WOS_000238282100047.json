This paper checks the correspondence between spatiotemporal relations and the 3D topological relations and presents a relation analysis model for indeterminate evolving 2D regions. It extends the 2D Egg/Yolk model into the third dimension that can describe the approximate topological relations for indeterminate evolving regions. The result is a collection of relation clusters that have different spatiotemporal natures.", "paper_title": "Reasoning the spatiotemporal relations between time evolving indeterminate regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100047"}
