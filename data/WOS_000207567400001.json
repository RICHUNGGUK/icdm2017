This procedure yields the multistatic response matrix that is characteristic of the elastic inclusion. We show how the eigenvalue structure of this matrix can be employed within the framework of a noniterative method of MUSIC (multiple signal classification) type in order to retrieve the elastic inclusion. We illustrate our reconstruction procedure with a variety of computational examples from synthetic, noiseless, and severely noisy data.", "paper_title": "Direct Elastic Imaging of a Small Inclusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000207567400001"}
