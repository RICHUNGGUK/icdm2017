One such initiative involves the implementation of electronic knowledge repositories (EKR). EKR implementation frequently results in a rapid increase in the quantity of information that must be processed daily by employees. This raises concerns about information overload (IO), and this is particularly true in relation to modern EKRs that use distributive technology. Furthermore, employees can also suffer from contribution overload (CO) because they can fulfill the functions of both knowledge seekers and knowledge contributors. This study employs the cognitive dissonance theory to determine whether IO and CO affect employees' willingness to use EKRs. The results from 144 survey respondents provide the first empirical evidence that contribution overload exerts a direct and significant negative effect on the intention to continue using EKR, whereas information overload exerts an indirect and significant negative effect on the intention to continue using EKR by altering perceived usefulness and satisfaction with the system.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Information Overload and Contribution Overload on Continued Usage of Electronic Knowledge Repositories", "paper_id": "WOS:000280158300003"}
