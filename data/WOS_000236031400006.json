The circuit can be configured to realize any of the two functions. The circuit can approximate these functions with relative root-mean-square error less than 1%. It is shown that the center, width, and peak amplitude of the dc transfer characteristic can be independently controlled. SPICE simulation results using 0.18 mu m CMOS process model parameters of TSMC18 technology are included.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable Gaussian/Triangular Basis functions computation circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000236031400006"}
