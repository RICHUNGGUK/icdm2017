The optimal component order in the 1-out-of-n WSP system is studied in this paper. The optimal component order strategies in terms of the expected system lifetime are proposed, and proved for several cases. Furthermore, the 1-out-of-n WSP system with exponential components is investigated from the viewpoint of the system reliability; it is proved that the components should be activated according to the descending order of their failure rates. These results are very useful and applicable in the design of 1-out-of-n WSP systems.", "paper_title": "A Study of Optimal Component Order in a General 1-Out-of-n Warm Standby System", "paper_id": "WOS:000350865900028"}
