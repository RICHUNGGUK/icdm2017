Stream ciphers are preferred in many applications, since they can destroy statistical properties of natural languages to some extent. However, it seems hard to design a stream cipher with many proven security properties. The objective of this paper is to present a binary stream cipher which is secure with respect to a number of attacks, and has reasonable performance. The advantage of the stream cipher over existing ones is that it has more proven security properties.", "paper_title": "A simple stream cipher with proven properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000208851000001"}
