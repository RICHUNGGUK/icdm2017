In order to achieve this goal, we propose a multi-dimensional liquid browsing concept, which facilitate browsing of comparably large amounts of information on the various types of devices. Furthermore, the service migration concept among the various types of devices is proposed and experimental results for the image information are shown.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous multimedia access with a multidimensional information browser", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100006"}
