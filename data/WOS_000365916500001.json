Extra care must be taken for communication-intensive algorithms, which may be a bottleneck for forthcoming era of exascale computing. This paper aims to present a high-level stencil framework implemented for the EULerian or LAGrangian model (EULAG) that efficiently utilisesmulti- and many-cores architectures. Only an efficient usage of both many-core processors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) with the flexible data decomposition method can lead to the maximum performance that scales the communication-intensive Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) elliptic solver with preconditioner.", "paper_title": "Methods to Load Balance a GCR Pressure Solver Using a Stencil Framework on Multi- and Many-Core Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000365916500001"}
