The delay variation or delay jitter and the effect of burst overhead have not yet been investigated. This paper introduces a new technique called swapping min-max (SWIM) for UGS scheduling that not only meets the delay constraint with optimal throughput, but also minimizes the delay jitter and burst overhead.", "paper_title": "A Scheduler for Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS) in IEEE 802.16e Mobile WiMAX Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284540900010"}
