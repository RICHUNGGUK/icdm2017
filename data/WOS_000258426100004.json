In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-supported and agent-based decentralized grid resource discovery mechanism. Without overhead of negotiation, the algorithm allows individual resource agents to semantically interact with neighbour agents based on local knowledge and to dynamically forma resource service chain to complete a task. The algorithm ensures the resource agent's ability to cooperate and coordinate on neighbour knowledge requisition for flexible problem solving. The developed algorithm is evaluated by investigating the relationship between the success probability of resource discovery and semantic similarity under different factors. The experiments show the algorithm could flexibly and dynamically discover resources and therefore provide a valuable addition to the field. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
