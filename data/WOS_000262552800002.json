In some cases, however, the support of privacy is compromised and consistent privacy protection remains elusive. Privacy perceptions and requirements differ from person to person and over time, leading to diverse privacy preferences within a community. This paper reports on a privacy-enhancing database architecture that is premised upon this view of privacy and oil Australia's Use and Disclosure National Privacy Principle. The approach extends to supporting privacy under Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.", "paper_title": "A Privacy-Enhancing Architecture for Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000262552800002"}
