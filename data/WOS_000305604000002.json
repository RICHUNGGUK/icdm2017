The apparent simplicity of GRSs hides an incredible complexity and turns the study of these systems into an involved task requiring high-level expertise. We designed PORGY, an interactive visual environment to fully support GRSs related tasks, exploiting a long historical tradition of GRSs with node-link representations of graphs. PORGY enables rule-based modeling and simulation steering through graphical representations and direct manipulation of all GRSs components. This paper contributes a design study and task taxonomy relevant to the interactive visualization of GRSs.", "paper_title": "PORGY: A Visual Graph Rewriting Environment for Complex Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305604000002"}
