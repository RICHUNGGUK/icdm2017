A primary concern in devising scenario-tailored detecting systems is coverage of their monitoring units. While disk-like coverage facilitates topology control, simplifies deployment analysis, and is crucial for proximity-based applications, conventional monitoring units demonstrate directional coverage due to the underlying transmitter-receiver link architecture. To achieve omnidirectional coverage under such link-centric architecture, we propose the concept of omnidirectional passive human detection. The rationale is to exploit the rich multipath effect to blur the directional coverage. We harness PHY layer features to robustly capture the fine-grained multipath characteristics and virtually tune the shape of the coverage of the monitoring unit, which is previously prohibited with mere MAC layer RSSI. We design a fingerprinting scheme and a threshold-based scheme with off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and evaluate both schemes in typical clustered indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate an average false positive of 8 percent and an average false negative of 7 percent for fingerprinting in detecting human presence in 4 directions. And both average false positive and false negative remain around 10 percent even with threshold-based methods.", "paper_title": "Omnidirectional Coverage for Device-Free Passive Human Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000340282400016"}
