Then a grammar was proposed to generate compound linguistic expressions based on the primitive ones, and simultaneously based on the semantic interpretations of those basic linguistic expressions a general scheme for the semantics of the rest of linguistic expressions were proposed. Sentences involving linguistic quantifiers and vague predicates constitute a fragment of natural language. In this paper, we choose this fragment of the natural language, and explore the semantics from the perspective of rough sets [13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21]. We fix a set of basic crisp quantifiers, mainly of proportional kind. A set of vague quantifiers are proposed to lie in a close vicinity of those crisp quantifiers in the sense that a particular vague quantifier can be visualized as a blurred, may be called rough, image of a set of crisp quantifiers. Semantics of the rest of the vague quantifiers can be obtained based on the subjective perception of the interrelations among the (vague) quantifiers.", "paper_title": "Generalized Quantifiers in the Context of Rough Set Semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000367316400012"}
