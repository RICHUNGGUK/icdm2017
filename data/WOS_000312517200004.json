Modelling complements field experiments in the design of new farming systems. French researchers involved in such design issues developed a specific modelling platform to help model, simulate and evaluate cropping systems. After testing several existing environments, the RECORD platform was developed under the VLE environment, allowing the design of atomic and coupled models. It integrates different time steps and spatial scales and proposes some standard formalisms used to model agro-ecosystems (e.g. difference equations, differential equations, state charts ... ). A graphic user interface was designed to simplify coding tasks. A variety of research projects already use this platform. Examples are given showing the ability to recode simple models, encapsulate more complex models, link with GIS and databases, and use the R statistical package to run models and analyse simulation outputs. The option to use web interfaces enables application by non-scientist end-users. As the models follow a given standard, they can be placed in a repository and used by other researchers. Linking RECORD to other international platforms is now a compelling issue. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
