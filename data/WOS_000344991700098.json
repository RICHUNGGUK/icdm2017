Methods for extracting PV usually operate on a 3D grid and start with detecting seed points on a cell face. We propose. to the best of our knowledge, the first provably correct test that determines the parity of the number of PV points on a cell face. The test only needs to sample along the face boundary and works for any choice of the two vector fields. A discretization of the test is described, validated, and compared with existing tests that are also based on boundary sampling. The test can guide PV-extraction algorithms to ensure closed curves wherever the input fields are continuous, which we exemplify in extracting ridges and valleys of scalar functions.", "paper_title": "A Robust Parity Test for Extracting Parallel Vectors in 3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000344991700098"}
