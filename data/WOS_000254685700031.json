For certain values of the parameters of the equation, the studied equation becomes identical to the pure-streamfunction equation of the Navier-Stokes equations. A weak form, a finite element method approximation procedures, and an iterative method for solving the discrete nonlinear problems are provided. Using the Bogner-Fox-Schmidt element, the steady 2-D incompressible flow in a driven cavity is solved using a grid mesh of 16 x 16. Streamfunction Contours are also displayed showing the main features of the flow.
