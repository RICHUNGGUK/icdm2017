At any time n is an element of N, let G(n) be the subgroup of S(N) generated by the K positions of the chains. In the uniform transposition model, we prove that there is a cut-off phenomenon at time N ln(N)/(2K) for the non-existence of fixed point of G(n) and for the transitivity of G(n), thus showing that these properties occur before the chains have reached equilibrium. In the uniform neighbor transposition model, a transition for the non-existence of a fixed point of G(n) appears at time of order N(1+2/K) (at least for K >= 3), but there is no cut-off phenomenon. In the latter model, we recover a cut-off phenomenon for the non-existence of a fixed point at a time proportional to N by allowing the number K to be proportional to ln(N). The main tools of the proofs are spectral analysis and coupling techniques. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
