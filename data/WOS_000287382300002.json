For each one of these models we study the class of languages generated by labeled transition systems describing their semantics. We consider here two types of accepting conditions: coverability and reachability of a fixed a priori configuration. In both cases we obtain a strict hierarchy in which constrained multiset rewriting systems is the most expressive model.
