Sensors closer to a sink node have a larger forwarding traffic burden and consume more energy than nodes further away from the sink. The whole lifetime of WSN is deteriorated because of such an uneven node power consumption patterns, leading to what is known as an energy hole problem (EHP). From open literatures, most research works have focused on how to optimally increase the probability of sleeping states using various wake-up strategies. In this article, we propose a novel power-saving scheme to alleviate the EHP based on the N-policy M/M/1 queuing theory. With little or no extra management cost, the proposed queue-based power-saving technique can be applied to prolong the lifetime of the WSN economically and effectively. A mathematical analysis on the optimal control parameter has been made in detail. Focusing on many-to-one WSN, numerical and network simulation results validate that the proposed approach indeed provides a feasibly cost-effective approach for lifetime elongation of WSN.", "paper_title": "Lifetime elongation for wireless sensor network using queue-based approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000299509500010"}
