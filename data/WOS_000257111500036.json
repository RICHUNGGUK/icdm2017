Results are presented for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based spatial multiplexing. New exact closed-form expressions are derived for the variance of the mutual information. In contrast to previous results, our new expressions apply for systems with both arbitrary numbers of antennas and arbitrary-length channels. Simplified expressions are also presented for high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The analytical variance results are used to provide accurate analytical approximations for the distribution of the mutual information, and the outage capacity.", "paper_title": "On the mutual information distribution of OFDM-based spatial multiplexing: Exact variance and outage approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500036"}
