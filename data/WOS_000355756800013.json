AS spoofing defenses mitigate these attacks by enforcing AS-level source address validity. Although many inter-AS defenses have been proposed, none is sufficiently deployed by Internet service providers. In this article we investigate the deployability of the defenses by evaluating their deployment benefit, deployment cost, and operational risk. Evaluation results reveal the technical features of highly deployable defenses, which can help improve existing defenses and the design of future defenses.", "paper_title": "On the Deployability of Inter-AS Spoofing Defenses", "paper_id": "WOS:000355756800013"}
