The capacity region for general MACs, which are not required to satisfy ergodicity and stationarity with perfect feedback was first shown by Tatikonda and Mitter without the proof, where perfect feedback means that the channel output is perfectly fed back to senders. In this paper, we generalize Tatikonda and Mitter's result to the case of deterministic feedback, where the values of deterministic functions of past channel outputs is fed back to senders. We show that the capacity region for general MACs with deterministic feedback can be represented by the information-spectrum formula introduced by Han and Verdu, and directed information introduced by Massey. We also investigate the compound MAC problem, the epsilon-coding problem, the strong converse property and the cost constraint problem for general MACs with deterministic feedback.", "paper_title": "A General Formula of the Capacity Region for Multiple-Access Channels with Deterministic Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300006"}
