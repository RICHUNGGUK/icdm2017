Being the convergence center of large-scale multi-source vehicle tracking data, it caused great challenge on GPS map-matching efficiency and privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a secure parallel map-matching system based on Cloud Computing technology to meet the demand of transportation data center. The main contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a leapfrog method to improve the efficiency of traditional serial map-matching algorithm on the increasingly common high sampling rate GPS data; (2) we adapt the serial leapfrog map-matching algorithm for cloud computing environment by reforming it in the MapReduce paradigm; (3) we propose a privacy-aware map-matching model over hybrid clouds to realize the sensitive GPS data protection. We implemented the proposed map-matching system in the hadoop platform and tested its performance with a large-scale vehicle tracking dataset, which exceeds 100 billion records. The experimental results show that our approach is highly efficient and effective on massive vehicle tracking data processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
