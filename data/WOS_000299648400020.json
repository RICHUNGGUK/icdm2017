In this competitive environment, teachers have to manage their imparting knowledge not only by maintaining quality and creativeness, but also by increasing interaction with their students. Learning-oriented concepts can give teachers a competitive edge for sustainable development. The key to maintaining the knowledge management learning cycle (KMLC) with students is based on a stable sharing system, effective management, expertise participation, social relationship assets, etc. The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation among the antecedents of information education using Lego NXT intelligent robots. Valid questionnaires are received and the research model was tested. The relationships assumed in the conceptual model were analyzed. The findings show a significant positive effect for learning intention and performance.", "paper_title": "AN INNOVATIVE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT LEARNING CYCLE BY LEGO NXT FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400020"}
