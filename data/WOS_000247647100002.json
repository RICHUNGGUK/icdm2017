In such problems the analysis equations are modified repeatedly during the solution process. The CA approach is based on the integration of several concepts and methods. The advantage is that efficient local approximations and accurate global approximations are combined to achieve an effective solution procedure. Some numerical examples demonstrate how the CA method can be used as a general tool in various structural analysis problems. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
