Here we present and develop the theory of such a model, the recursive Petri nets. First, we show that the mechanisms supported by recursive Petri nets enable to model patterns of discrete event systems related to the dynamic structure of processes. Furthermore, we prove that these patterns cannot be modelled by ordinary Petri nets. Then we study the decidability of some problems: reachability, finiteness and bisimulation. At last, we develop the concept of linear invariants for this kind of nets and we design efficient computations specifically tailored to take advantage of their structure.", "paper_title": "Recursive Petri nets - Theory and application to discrete event systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250838400001"}
