In addition, people handicapped or using one hand for handling other pieces may encounter difficulties to touch exact numbers for calling with their smartphones. Thus, motion-tracked speed dialing can be a good solution for these cases and also an advanced feature applicable in the future network not requiring dedicated Internet connections. The previous study on this feature showed a result with a limitation of using servers connected via Internet connections for solving real-time control issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for the smartphone dialing on motion-tracked numbers without any servers or Internet connections, and presents the details of its implementation and results.", "paper_title": "Motion-tracked Speed Dialing for Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047100013"}
