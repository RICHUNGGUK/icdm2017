Currently, the parallel methods for retrieving such information can only provide a similar performance to serial methods. In this paper we first perform an analysis to determine the factors that affect the performance of existing methods, i.e., HQR and EHQR, and show that the several of these factors are not considered by these methods. Motivated by this, we propose a new dispatch scheme called AEHQR, which takes into account the features of parallel dispatching. In addition, we provide cost models that determine the optimal performance achievable by any parallel dispatching method. Using experimental comparison, we illustrate that the AEHQR is significantly outperforms the HQR and EHQR under all conditions.", "paper_title": "A parallel information retrieval method for e-commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952300005"}
