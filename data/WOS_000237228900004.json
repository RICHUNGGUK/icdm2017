This approach is associated to a fuzzy logic based pre-filtering technique. The CA is used to evolve gene subsets whose fitness is evaluated by a SVM classifier. Using archive records of \"good\" gene subsets, a frequency based technique is introduced to identify the most informative genes. Our approach is assessed on two well-known cancer datasets and shows competitive results with six existing methods.", "paper_title": "A hybrid GA/SVM approach for gene selection and classification of microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900004"}
