This note is devoted to proving that this condition is, in a certain sense, also necessary, provided the underlying space is a Banach space. Our result is based upon the existence of a non-supporting weak*-closed hyperplane to any weak*-closed and convex unbounded linearly bounded subset of the topological dual of a Banach space.", "paper_title": "On the necessity of the Moreau-Rockafellar-Robinson qualification condition in Banach spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381200008"}
