From the perspective of an administrator, controlling access to data networks, via these devices, usually includes the creation of separate login credentials. This leads to an administrative nightmare, from both the user and administrator's point of view. This paper proposes a novel approach to this problem and offers a single-sign-on system, where the user's authorisation is based on the login credentials of the user, and the profile of the device the user is using. An instance of this design is presented with SESAME, to demonstrate the usefulness of the design, and also practicality for implementation.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous authorization scheme based on device profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000032"}
