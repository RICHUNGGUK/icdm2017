We first design a polynomial-time algorithm for building epsilon-nets of size O(1/epsilon log log 1/epsilon) for the instances of HITTING SET associated with our guarding problem. We then apply the technique of Bronnimann and Goodrich to build an approximation algorithm from this e-net finder. Along with a simple polygon P, our algorithm takes as input a finite set of potential guard locations that must include the polygon's vertices. If a finite set of potential guard locations is not specified, e. g., when guards may be placed anywhere on the perimeter, we use a known discretization technique at the cost of making the algorithm's running time potentially linear in the ratio between the longest and shortest distances between vertices. Our algorithm is the first to improve upon O(log OPT)-approximation algorithms that use generic net finders for set systems of finite VC-dimension.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximation for Guarding Simple Galleries from the Perimeter", "paper_id": "WOS:000292310200004"}
