The proposed algorithm consists of two parts. The first part is fuzzy rule-based edge-direction detection with an edge preserving part that utilizes fuzzy theory to find the most accurate edge direction and interpolates the missing pixels. Using the introduced gradients in the interpolation, the vertical resolution in the deinterlaced image is subjectively concealed. The second part of the proposed algorithm is a rough sets-assisted optimization which selects the most suitable of five different deinterlacing methods and Successively builds approximations of the deinterlaced sequence. Moreover, this approach employs a size reduction of the database system, keeping only the information essential for the process. The proposed algorithm is intended not only to be fast, but also to reduce deinterlacing artifacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
