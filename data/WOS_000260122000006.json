This paper focuses on the test suite description and test implementation techniques. TTCN-3 is chosen as the test suite description language and extended in both syntax and semantics to satisfy the requirements of protocol robustness testing. PITSv3, a protocol integrated testing system based on TTCN-3, is developed, and the extensions for robustness testing are implemented. Finally, two practical test applications are presented.", "paper_title": "A TTCN-3-based protocol testing system and its extension", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000006"}
