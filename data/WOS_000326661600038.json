This, therefore, has led to an increased demand for improved quality TV services. In this paper, cloud computing technology is used to build a program recommendation system for digital TV programs, and the Hadoop Fair Scheduler is utilized to improve processing performance. Historical data of watched TV programs are collected through an electronic program guide, and then processed using K-means clustering, term frequency/inverse document frequency and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, to obtain clusters of audience groups and to find popular TV programs for each cluster. The proposed system can process massive amounts of user data in real-time, and can easily be scaled up. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
