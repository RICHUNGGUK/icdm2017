This result was obtained under the realistic assumption that each source generator produces a sequence of correlated and biased bits. The proposed theorems and formulas are useful in designing random bit generators with satisfactory properties that are robust to external manipulations or to environmental changes up to a certain degree.", "paper_title": "On the Quality of Random Sequences Produced with a Combined Random Bit Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000015"}
