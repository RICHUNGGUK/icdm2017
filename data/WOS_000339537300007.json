The general framework for the derivation of consistent non-local tangent operators is initially presented for elasto-plastic materials. Then, closed-form analytical expressions are established for a J(2) hybrid local/non-local plasticity model and the Lemaitre-based non-local model. The structure of the consistent tangent operators is discussed and the corresponding assembly procedure is described. The numerical results show the efficiency of the approach and demonstrate that quadratic rates of convergence are successfully achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
