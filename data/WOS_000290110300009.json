The degrees of freedom are coordinate frames. In contrast with traditional skinning, frame positions are not scripted but move in reaction to internal body forces. The displacement field is smoothly interpolated using dual quaternion blending. The deformation gradient and its derivatives are computed at each sample point of a deformed object and used in the equations of Lagrangian mechanics to achieve physical realism. This allows easy and very intuitive definition of the degrees of freedom of the deformable object. The meshless discretization allows on-the-fly insertion of frames to create local deformations where needed. We formulate the dynamics of these models in detail and describe some precomputations that can be used for speed. We show that our method is effective for behaviors ranging from simple unimodal deformations to complex realistic deformations comparable with Finite Element simulations. To encourage its use, the software will be freely available in the simulation platform SOFA.", "paper_title": "Frame-Based Elastic Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000290110300009"}
