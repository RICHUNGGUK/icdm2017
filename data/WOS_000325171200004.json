In this paper, we argue for a new twist on the classical resource provisioning problem: heterogeneous workloads are a fact of life in large-scale data centers, and current resource provisioning solutions do not act upon this heterogeneity. Our contributions are threefold: first, we propose a cooperative resource provisioning solution, and take advantage of differences of heterogeneous workloads so as to decrease their peak resources consumption under competitive conditions; second, for four typical heterogeneous workloads: parallel batch jobs, web servers, search engines, and MapReduce jobs, we build an agile system PhoenixCloud that enables cooperative resource provisioning; and third, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for both real and synthetic workload traces. Our experiments show that our solution could save the server cost aggressively with respect to the noncooperative solutions that are widely used in state-of-the-practice hosting data centers or cloud systems: for example, EC2, which leverages the statistical multiplexing technique, or RightScale, which roughly implements the elastic resource provisioning technique proposed in related state-of-the-art work.", "paper_title": "Cost-Aware Cooperative Resource Provisioning for Heterogeneous Workloads in Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000325171200004"}
