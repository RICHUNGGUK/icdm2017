However, there also come some security concerns in cloud computing environment, such as emerging network attacks and intrusions, and instable cloud service provision due to flexible cloud infrastructure and resources. To this end, we research on the trusted computing in cloud computing environment. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a trust model based on virtual machines, with two considerations. First, we introduce timeliness strategy to ensure the response time and also minimize the idle time of servers. Second, we extend the linear trust chain by differentiating the trust of the platform domain and user domain. Besides, we develop a fuzzy theory based method to calculate the trust value of cloud service providers. We also conduct some experiments to evaluate our method.", "paper_title": "Trust Model in Cloud Computing Environment Based on Fuzzy Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000340232400004"}
