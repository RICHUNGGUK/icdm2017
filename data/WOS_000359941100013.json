With a view to minimizing the computational efforts, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) method coupled with parametric finite element has been developed and compared with the traditional GA. The shape of railhead top surface where the wheel contacts nonlinearly was optimized using the hybridized GA method. Comparative study of the optimal result and the search efficiency between the traditional and hybrid GA methods has shown that the hybridized GA provides the optimal shape in fewer computational cycles without losing accuracy. The method will be beneficial to solving complex engineering problems involving contact nonlinearity.
