As the owners of Cloud applications expect to fulfill the requested Quality of Services (QoS) by the Grid environment, an adaptive scheduling mechanism is needed which enables to distribute a large number of related tasks with different computational and communication demands on multi-cluster Grid computing environments. Addressing the problem of scheduling large-scale Cloud workflow applications onto multi-cluster Grid environment regarding the QoS constraints declared by application's owner is the main contribution of this paper. Heterogeneity of resource types (service type) is one of the most important issues which significantly affect workflow scheduling in Grid environment. On the other hand, a Cloud application workflow is usually consisting of different tasks with the need for different resource types to complete which we call it heterogeneity in workflow. The main idea which forms the soul of all the algorithms and techniques introduced in this paper is to match the heterogeneity in Cloud application's workflow to the heterogeneity in Grid clusters. To obtain this objective a new bi-level advanced reservation strategy is introduced, which is based upon the idea of first performing global scheduling and then conducting local scheduling. Global-scheduling is responsible to dynamically partition the received DAG into multiple sub-workflows that is realized by two collaborating algorithms: (1) The Critical Path Extraction algorithm (CPE) which proposes a new dynamic task overall critically value strategy based on DAG's specification and requested resource type QoS status to determine the criticality of each task; and (2) The DAG Partitioning algorithm (DAGP) which introduces a novel dynamic score-based approach to extract sub-workflows based on critical paths by using a new Fuzzy Qualitative Value Calculation System to evaluate the environment. Local-scheduling is responsible for scheduling tasks on suitable resources by utilizing a new Multi-Criteria Advance Reservation algorithm (MCAR) which simultaneously meets high reliability and QoS expectations for scheduling distributed Cloud-base applications. We used the simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in comparison with four well-known approaches. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches in different QoS related terms.", "paper_title": "Bi-level fuzzy based advanced reservation of Cloud workflow applications on distributed Grid resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000329111400009"}
