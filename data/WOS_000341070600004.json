Yet little IS research has offered critical reflections on the use of the panopticon to represent the control potential of mobile IS. This study investigates whether the way mobile IS are engaged in the workplace reinforce panoptic control systems or generate other types of control logics, requiring another conceptual lens. A qualitative exploratory case study investigated a consulting company whose professionals equipped themselves with mobile IS. The study reveals the emergence of a subtle, invisible form of 'free control' through mobile IS. Although consultants are mobile, flexible, and autonomous, a powerful communication and information network keeps them in a position of 'allowed subjection'. Free control is characterised by a shift in the location of authority, a time-related discipline, a deep sense of trust, and adherence to organisational norms that the professionals themselves co-construct. These characteristics, which render such control even more pernicious than panoptic arrangements, deserve more attention in further IS research.", "paper_title": "Mobile information systems and organisational control: beyond the panopticon metaphor?", "paper_id": "WOS:000341070600004"}
