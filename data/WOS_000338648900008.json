The SCJ technology specification is the result of an international effort from industry and academia. In this paper, we present a formalization of the SCJ Level 1 execution model, formalize a translation strategy from SCJ into a refinement notation and describe a tool that largely automates the generation of the formal models. Our modelling language is part of the Circus family; at the core, we have Z, communicating sequential processes and Morgan's calculus, but we also use object-oriented and timed constructs from the OhCircus and Circus Time variants. Our work is an essential ingredient for the development of refinement-based reasoning techniques for SCJ.", "paper_title": "Circus Models for Safety-Critical Java Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338648900008"}
