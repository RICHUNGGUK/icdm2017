The melting temperature is a suitable parameter used to evaluating the stability of DNA duplex. Traditional method to predict Tin in biological engineering may exist lager error for a few sequences. Thus it misfits the lager amount of DNA sequences in DNA computing. In this paper, we introduced artificial neural network to predict the Tin based on Next-Nearest-Neighbor model. Our result shows that the methods have a higher precision than TP methods based on nearest-neighbor model.", "paper_title": "Predicting melting temperature (Tm) of DNA duplex based on neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400030"}
