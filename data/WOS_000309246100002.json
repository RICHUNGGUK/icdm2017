Prom the clusters formed, we can identify the impulsive pixels in the noisy image. Combining it with a detail preserving noise filter using the switching framework, we obtain a high-performance two-stage algorithm for universal impulse denoising. As opposed to many existing filters that focus only on a particular impulse noise model, the proposed method, called the Augmented Variational Series and Histogram-Based Clustering (A VSHC) filter, demonstrates excellent performance in suppressing random-valued and fixed-valued impulse noise models, as well as a combination of both models. Extensive simulations conducted on monochrome test images under a wide range of impulse noise densities show that the A VSHC filter substantially outperforms other state-of-the-art impulse noise filters in terms of impulse detection, image restoration, and computational cost.", "paper_title": "AUGMENTED VARIATIONAL SERIES AND HISTOGRAM-BASED CLUSTERING FOR UNIVERSAL IMPULSE DENOISING", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100002"}
