It is difficult to obtain a transient solution in explicit form to the queue equations because of their complex structure. We propose a simple method of computing W-q(t)-the mean waiting time of a customer arriving in the queue at time t, based on an exponential function approximation.", "paper_title": "Approximation to the Transient Solution of the M/E-k/1 Queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000259912700003"}
