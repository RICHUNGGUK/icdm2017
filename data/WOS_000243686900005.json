The overall effectiveness of replication can be measured by the total communication cost consisting of client accesses and consistency management, both of which depend on the locations of the replicas. This paper investigates the problem of placing replicas under the widely used TTL-based consistency scheme. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal placement of a given number of replicas in a network. The new replica placement scheme is compared, using real Internet topologies and Web traces, against two existing approaches which do not consider consistency management or assume invalidation-based consistency scheme. The factors affecting their performance are identified and discussed.", "paper_title": "Optimal replica placement under TTL-based consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000243686900005"}
