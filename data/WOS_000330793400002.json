The energy used by a disk can be reduced by prefetching video frames into buffer to allow the disk to spin down. But frequent spindowns compromise disk life, so it is desirable to limit the number of times that the disk spins down. We propose a method of data prefetching that fully utilizes the available buffer while providing continuous video playback. We analyze the effect of the amount of data comprising the frames in the buffer on disk power consumption and formulate algorithms that determine when the disk should enter standby mode and the optimal number of disk spindowns. We implemented our scheme in the Linux 2.6 MPlayer and find that a portable 1.8-inch disk uses between 10 and 37 % less energy than it does with the existing MPlayer.", "paper_title": "Balancing disk energy against reliability in video playback", "paper_id": "WOS:000330793400002"}
