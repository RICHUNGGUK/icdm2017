Originally designed for the static indoor applications, the throughput performance of IEEE 802.11 in the outdoor vehicular environment is, however, still unclear especially when a large number of fast-moving users transmitting simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF in the highly mobile vehicular networks. We first propose a simple yet accurate analytical model to evaluate the throughput of DCF in the large scale drive-thru Internet scenario. Our model incorporates the high-node mobility with the modeling of DCF and unveils the impacts of mobility (characterized by node velocity and moving directions) on the resultant throughput. Based on the model, we show that the throughput of DCF will be reduced with increasing node velocity due to the mismatch between the MAC and the transient high-throughput connectivity of vehicles. We then propose several enhancement schemes to adaptively adjust the MAC in tune with the node mobility. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the accuracy of the developed analytical model and the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement schemes.", "paper_title": "MAC in Motion: Impact of Mobility on the MAC of Drive-Thru Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000298294100012"}
