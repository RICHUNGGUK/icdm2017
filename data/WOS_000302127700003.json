The CP-EDCA protocol was designed to achieve deterministic delay bounds for emergency-class traffic during distributed wireless network operation. The CP-EDCA scheme could be an ideal choice for prioritised channel access in WSNs, if the performance is demonstrated to be effective under WSN conditions. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of CP-EDCA protocol under erroneous channel conditions and multi-hop data flow scenarios, which are distinctive features of WSNs. Mathematical and simulation analysis depicts that under typical WSN conditions, distributed preemptions accomplish deterministic delay bounds for emergency traffic even with heavy network loads. Under severe packet losses, CP-EDCA depicted perceivable improvements, relative to IEEE 802.11e standards. Analysis in multi-hop scenarios validates that the channel access preemptions have a significant impact on the end-to-end data flow performance.", "paper_title": "Preemptive emergency medium access for wireless sensor networks: performance under realistic network conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302127700003"}
