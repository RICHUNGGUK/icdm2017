The drawings symbolize the intuition behind the notion denoted by the constants. Without losing rigor, logicographic symbols can be used in formal statements with the effect of enhancing readability considerably. In this paper we describe the concept, the design, and the use of logicographic symbols in logic languages, notably in the Theorema system. The presentation will be based on examples that illustrate the various aspects of logicographic symbols. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
