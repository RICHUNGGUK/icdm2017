TGOVM is superior to the previous models in stabilizing the uniform traffic flow by considering all the front influencing factors: headways, relative velocities, and interactions. The linear analysis result showed its superiority to the GOVM, FLOVM, and FLRVM. The nonlinear analysis method is adopted to analyze this model, which described by a differential-difference equation. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived and the kink-antikink soliton solution is obtained near the critical point. The simulation results show that the stabilization is enhanced by the improvement.", "paper_title": "STABILITY AND KINK-ANTIKINK SOLITON SOLUTION FOR TOTAL GENERALIZED OPTIMAL VELOCITY MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000260270100002"}
