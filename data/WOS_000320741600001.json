Then, by using the signed splitting technique invented by Atanassov, we obtain a discrepancy bound for a (t, e, s)-sequence in base b. It follows that a (unanchored) discrepancy bound for the first N > 1 points of a generalized Niederreiter sequence in base b is given as NDN <= (1/s! Pi(s)(i=1) 2[b(ei)/2]/e(i) log b) (log N)(s) + O((log N)(s-1)), where the constant in the leading term is asymptotically much smaller than the one currently known. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
