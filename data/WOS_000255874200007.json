This problem is NP-hard and the current best known approximation algorithm achieves the approximation ratio 2-c(log N)/N, where c is an arbitrary positive constant and N is the number of men in an input. In this paper, we improve the ratio to 2 - c/root N, where c is an arbitrary constant that satisfies c <= 1/(4 root 6).", "paper_title": "A (2-c1/root N)-approximation algorithm for the stable marriage problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000255874200007"}
