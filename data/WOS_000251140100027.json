As one of those approaches for designing ABCs, perfectly matched layer (PML) has achieved great success for both linear and nonlinear wave equations. In this paper we apply PML to the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equations. The idea involved is stimulated by the good performance of PML for the linear Schrodinger equation with constant potentials, together with the time-transverse invariant property held by the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equations. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our PML approach for both nonlinear Schrodinger equations and some Schrodinger-coupled systems in each spatial dimension. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
