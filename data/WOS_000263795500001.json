Based on a recent result that develops a type Robust Nash equilibrium for a multi-modeled linear affine-quadratic game [12], where the players compose a min-max strategy to deal with the parametric uncertainties (unmatched type) in this paper we add a second type of uncertainties of the \"matched type\". It is shown that for the case of a two players game, the matched uncertainties can be rejected from the initial time introducing in the strategies an integral sliding mode control term, obtaining an equivalent game dynamic in which the matched uncertainties have been eliminated.", "paper_title": "ROBUST NASH STRATEGIES BASED ON INTEGRAL SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR A TWO PLAYERS UNCERTAIN LINEAR AFFINE-QUADRATIC GAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500001"}
