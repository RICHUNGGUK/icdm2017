In this letter, an activation-function-tunable neural network is established, and a multistep searching method which can be used to train the model is proposed. The proposed method can effectively calculate the object's continuous spectral emissivity from the multispectral radiation information. It is a universal method, which can be used to realize on-line emissivity demarcation.", "paper_title": "Study on modeling of multispectral emissivity and optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235536300021"}
