Design/methodology/approach Objectives are realized via discrimination of invaluable opinion (information/data), case study analyses of experiments (projects), differentiation of distinguished effects (phenomena), and intervention in the evolution of urban planning theory. Findings - It is found that the disposition of geometrical forms of quasi-crystal type - \"Penrose Tiling- or \"Shechtmanites\" - realizes extensive economies in urban space allocations (land use), escalation of population indices (density), substantial contraction of time and distance in movement patterns (energy conservation): a triplet (encompassing quantity, quality and economy) are surely applicable in a world confronted by the unceasing demand for urban shelter and threat of a global economic meltdown. Practical implications Transformation of the manually derived models (for town design) is dependent on significant investment in the phase involving development of complex algorithms for enabling combinatorial computing and modeling; the sine qua non for testing applications at various scale levels prior to development of a universally viable computer software. The implications for urban habitat policies generally would be phenomenal if not revolutionary should the envisaged software ever be realized. Originality/value Exposure of original work in progress enhances the potential for obtaining valuable feedback from intrigued professionals as well as potential consumers, particularly those from public sector housing agencies experiencing acute budgetary agendas.", "paper_title": "Jacob \"John\" Rose - a tribute", "paper_id": "WOS:000264459300008"}
