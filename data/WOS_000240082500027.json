We show that for a large range of parameters, the planted solution (more precisely, one of the planted solution pair) is the optimal solution for the generated instance with high probability. We then give a simple linear time algorithm based on a message passing method, and we prove that it solves the MAX-2SAT problem with high probability under our planted solution model.", "paper_title": "Average-case analysis for the MAX-2SAT problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240082500027"}
