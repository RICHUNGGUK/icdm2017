The main problem of the RANSAC algorithm is that it is too expensive in terms of execution time when real-time processing is needed (30 fps). In view of the importance of this algorithm and the rise of parallelism-based technologies, we analyze and compare in this work various parallel implementations based on different techniques (OpenMP, POSIX Threads, and CUDA). To the best of our knowledge, no other articles have attempted a similar study. In order to make this first study, we have used some standard metrics in parallelism (Runtime and Speedup) and some specific metrics used in evaluating search strategies (Precision, Recall, and F-Score). Furthermore, the experiments have been executed in different hardware alternatives in order to present a more complete study. The conclusions of our study show the advantages and disadvantages of the different parallel implementations.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Study of Parallel RANSAC Implementations in 3D Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000358648600002"}
