The programs are shown to work successfully in some models and compared with other programs. A practical method is also suggested to use high frequencies in inverse modeling by suppressing amplification of error included in high frequencies. Enhancement in computational speed due to the Fast Fourier Transform method makes it straightforward and useful to apply these programs to various situations (a) in geophysical interpretations that require extensive data processing of large datasets, including a wide range of density contrasts and depths. and (b) in joint studies with other geophysical approaches such as the seismic method.
