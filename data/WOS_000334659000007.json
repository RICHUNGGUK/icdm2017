To reduce the influence of key exposure, we introduce key-insulated mechanism into certificate-based cryptography and formalize the notion and security model of the certificate-based key-insulated signature scheme. We then present a certificate-based key-insulated signature scheme, which is proven to be existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model. The proposed scheme has potential applications in trusted computing.
