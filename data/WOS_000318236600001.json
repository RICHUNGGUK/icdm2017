The package also includes estimators of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function and pair correlation function. stpp is the first dedicated unified computational environment in the area of spatio-temporal point processes. In this paper we describe space-time point processes and introduce the package stpp to new users.", "paper_title": "stpp: An R Package for Plotting, Simulating and Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000318236600001"}
