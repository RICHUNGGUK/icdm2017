This idea admits to have uncertainty in the penalty and margin terms jointly. Robustness against noise is shown to be superior in the experimental results as a property compared with conventional SVR.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy cost support vector regression on the fuzzy samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000296009800007"}
