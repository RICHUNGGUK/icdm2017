Such mixtures can occur when one takes photos through a transparent medium, like a window glass, and the camera or the medium moves between snapshots. To understand how to achieve correct separation, we study the statistics of natural images in the Labelme data set. We not only confirm the well-known sparsity of image gradients, but also discover new joint behavior patterns of image gradients. Based on these statistical properties, we develop a sparse blind separation algorithm to estimate both layer motions and linear mixing coefficients and then recover all layers. This method can handle general parameterized motions, including translations, scalings, rotations, and other transformations. In addition, the number of layers is automatically identified, and all layers can be recovered, even in the underdetermined case where mixtures are fewer than layers. The effectiveness of this technology is shown in experiments on both simulated and real superimposed images.", "paper_title": "Blind Separation of Superimposed Moving Images Using Image Statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000297069900002"}
