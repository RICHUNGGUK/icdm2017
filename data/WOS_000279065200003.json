This has led to the evolution of coupons into mobile coupons (m-coupons). In this paper, we propose an m-coupon sharing scheme that makes use of the popularity of mobile devices to circulate coupons among existing social networks and thereby increase the redemption of m-coupons. In this scheme, the firm first selects targeted members and then sends a virtual coupon book and a virtual sharable coupon book to each of these targeted members. The targeted member is encouraged to forward the sharable coupons to his/her peers. The recipient, who could be either a non-targeted member or a non-member, may redeem the shareable coupon directly and avail of an introductory discount. Alternatively, a larger discount is given to a non-member who registers as a member and then redeems the coupon or to a non-targeted member who redeems the coupon after updating his/her customer profile. If a forwarded m-coupon is redeemed, the sender of that coupon may receive rewards in future marketing campaigns. It is important to note that the value ascribed to the m-coupons could possibly render them the target of alterations and forgeries. Our implementation incorporates only lightweight computations and simple hash chains for security. The marketer can analyse used m-coupons through a marketing campaign that makes use of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
