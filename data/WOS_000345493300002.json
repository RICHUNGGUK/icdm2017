First of all, by choosing a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the property of conditional mathematical expectation, a novel delay-dependent approach is developed to deal with the mean-square exponential stability problem and H-infinity control problem. Then, a mean-square exponentially stable and Markovian jump filter is designed such that the filtering error system is mean-square exponentially stable and the H-infinity performance of estimation error can be ensured. Besides, the derivative of discrete time-varying delay h(t) satisfies h(t) <= eta and simultaneously the decay rate beta can be finite positive value without equation constraint. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.", "paper_title": "EXPONENTIAL H-infinity FILTER DESIGN FOR STOCHASTIC MARKOVIAN JUMP SYSTEMS WITH BOTH DISCRETE AND DISTRIBUTED TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000345493300002"}
