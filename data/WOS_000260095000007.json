We look at two cases: chain-on-chain partitioning, where the order of the processors is specified, and chain partitioning. where processor permutation is allowed. We present polynomial time algorithms to solve the chain-on-chain partitioning problem optimally, while we prove that the chain partitioning problem is NP-complete. Our empirical studies show that our proposed exact algorithms produce substantially better results than heuristics, while solution times remain comparable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
