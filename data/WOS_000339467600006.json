Although various link prediction algorithms for general networks may be adapted for this purpose, the recent notion of \"trust propagation\" has been shown to effectively capture the trust-formation mechanisms and resulted in an effective prediction algorithm. This article builds on the concept of trust propagation and presents a probabilistic trust propagation model. Our model exploits the modern framework of probabilistic graphical models, more specifically, factor graphs. Under this model, the trust prediction problem can be formulated as a statistical inference problem and we derive the belief propagation algorithm as a solver for trust prediction. The model and algorithm are tested using datasets from Epinions and Ciao, by which performance advantages over the previous algorithms are demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Trust Prediction via Belief Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339467600006"}
