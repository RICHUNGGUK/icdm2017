The techniques are evaluated and compared with standard methods using two test areas that contain large numbers of submarine pockmarks developed in distributed arrays. The familiar Ripley K and Voronoi tesselation techniques are used, and the results are then compared with those obtained using more novel techniques, the correlation length and minimal spanning tree. The correlation length technique is found to identify the precise distances at which clustering occurs more accurately, making a physical interpretation more clear than is possible using the Ripley K. The minimal spanning tree is found to be powerful at identifying the space-filling nature of the pockmark distribution, and has the advantage of being immune to edge effects. The use of these two novel techniques permits more information to be extracted from the datasets, and demonstrates clear statistically significant differences between them, which are not detectable using standard techniques.
