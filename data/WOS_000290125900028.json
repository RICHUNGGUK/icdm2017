In a distant-talking environment, the channel impulse response is longer than the short-term spectral analysis window. By treating the late reverberation as additive noise, a noise reduction technique based on spectral subtraction was proposed to estimate the power spectrum of the clean speech using power spectra of the distorted speech and the unknown impulse responses. To estimate the power spectra of the impulse responses, a variable step-size unconstrained MCLMS (VSS-UMCLMS) algorithm for identifying the impulse responses in a time domain is extended to a frequency domain. To reduce the effect of the estimation error of the channel impulse response, we normalize the early reverberation by cepstral mean normalization (CMN) instead of spectral subtraction using the estimated impulse response. Furthermore, our proposed method is combined with conventional delay-and-sum beamforming. We conducted recognition experiments on a distorted speech signal simulated by convolving multi-channel impulse responses with clean speech. The proposed method achieved a relative error reduction rate of 22.4% in relation to conventional CMN. By combining the proposed method with beamforming, a relative error reduction rate of 24.5% in relation to the conventional CMN with beamforming was achieved using only an isolated word (with duration of about 0.6 s) to estimate the spectrum of the impulse response.", "paper_title": "Distant-Talking Speech Recognition Based on Spectral Subtraction by Multi-Channel LMS Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125900028"}
