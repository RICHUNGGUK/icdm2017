In particular, the TEEN (Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network) protocol is used widely as a basic clustered multihop routing protocol. However, energy efficient routing protocols without proper security suffer from many security vulnerabilities. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hybrid key scheme specially for the TEEN protocol: a symmetric key scheme for the intracluster and a public key scheme for the intercluster. The simulation results show that network lifetime of the proposed hybrid key scheme decreases about 8% than the TEEN protocol and about 4% compared with the TEEN protocol with symmetric key scheme. On the other hand, a hybrid key scheme provides better probability of successful transmission than that of the symmetric key scheme.", "paper_title": "Key Schemes for Security Enhanced TEEN Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321359300001"}
