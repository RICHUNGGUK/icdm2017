Then we obtain the system-length distribution, using the distributional Little's law. The analysis proposed here is based on the roots of the characteristic equation of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the virtual queueing-time distribution. Numerical aspects have been tested for a variety of arrival and service-time parameters and a sample of numerical outputs along with detailed discussion on accuracy and computation-time is presented.
