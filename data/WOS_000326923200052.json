We propose a method for on-the-fly non-periodic infinite texturing of surfaces based on a single image. Pattern repetition is avoided by defining patches within each texture whose content can be changed at runtime. In addition, we consistently manage multi-scale using one input image per represented scale. Undersampling artifacts are avoided by accounting for fine-scale features while colors are transferred between scales. Eventually, we allow for relief-enhanced rendering and provide a tool for intuitive creation of height maps. This is done using an ad-hoc local descriptor that measures feature self-similarity in order to propagate height values provided by the user for a few selected texels only. Thanks to the patch-based system, manipulated data are compact and our texturing approach is easy to implement on GPU. The multi-scale extension is capable of rendering finely detailed textures in real-time.", "paper_title": "On-the-Fly Multi-Scale Infinite Texturing from Example", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200052"}
