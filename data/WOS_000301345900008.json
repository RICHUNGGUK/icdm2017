We mainly focus on the system proposed by Akiyama et al. in 2008, but we also show that this system is in some sense isomorphic to some other rational base number systems by means of finite transducers. We identify the numbers with finite and eventually periodic representations and we also determine the number of representations of a given p-adic number.", "paper_title": "RATIONAL BASE NUMBER SYSTEMS FOR p-ADIC NUMBERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301345900008"}
