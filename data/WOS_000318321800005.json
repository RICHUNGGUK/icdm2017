In this paper we ask whether two non-Kahler homogeneous Einstein metrics on a certain flag manifold are isometric. We tackle this question by reformulating it into a related question on a parametric system of polynomial equations and answering it by carefully combining Grinner bases and geometrical arguments. Using this technique, we are able to prove the isometry of such metrics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
