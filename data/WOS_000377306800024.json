Due to the simplicity of nanonetworks, routing protocols require minimal overhead. The main objective of this paper is to investigate opportunistic routing (OR) for DMC. Based on distance and concentration gradient information, a novel routing protocol has been proposed. Performance evaluation is carried out using analytical and simulation studies.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Routing in Diffusion-Based Molecular Nanonetworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800024"}
