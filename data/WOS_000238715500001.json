We obtain two sufficient conditions about existence of a unique almost periodic solution for the system by way of exponential dichotomy and the Banach fixed point theorem, and point out the utilization occasion of every condition. Moreover, we prove that the almost periodic solution is global exponential stability by using of Halanay inequality. Two examples are given to illustrate that the criterion are feasible.", "paper_title": "Almost periodic solution for shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks with time-varying delays and variable coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000238715500001"}
