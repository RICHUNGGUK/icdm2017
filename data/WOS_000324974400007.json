Cognitive radio functionality can be implemented in femtocell networks based on an overlay mechanism under the assumption of a hierarchical access scenario. This study introduces a novel femtocell network architecture, that is characterized by a completely autonomous femtocell bandwidth access and a distributed media access control protocol for supporting data and real-time traffic. The detailed description of the architecture and media access protocol is presented. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analysis is performed on the proposed media access protocol using discrete-time Markov chain modeling to validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and architecture.
