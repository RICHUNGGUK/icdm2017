Virtual view synthesis, known as the analogue expression to the real world, is one of the key techniques in interactive 3D video systems. This paper proposes a new algorithm of virtual view synthesis, which is based on disparity estimation. Considering two rectified input reference images that are taken in the same scene simultaneously, the accurate dense disparity maps are gained as the first step. Then image interpolation is used to synthesize certain virtual view image and reverse mapping is adopted to fill up the holes which are formed in previous process. By defining a position parameter, this algorithm can produce results at an arbitrary view between the two original views. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.
