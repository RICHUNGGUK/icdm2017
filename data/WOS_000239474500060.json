The main result is that with high probability a partition S-1,...,S-k of G that coincides with V-1,...,V-k on a huge subgraph core(G) can be computed in polynomial time via spectral techniques. The result covers the case of sparse graphs (average degree O(i)) as well as the massive case (average degree #V(G) - O(1)). Furthermore, the spectral algorithm is adaptive in the sense that it does not require any information about the desired partition beyond the number k of classes.", "paper_title": "An adaptive spectral heuristic for partitioning random graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500060"}
