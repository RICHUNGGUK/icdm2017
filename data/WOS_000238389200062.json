An improved generation algorithm is proposed instead of the existing methods that are either difficult or inefficient to be implemented. The algorithm simplifies the definition of relation between blocks and avoids employing complicated graph operations. The time complexity of the algorithm is O (n(2)) and can be reduced to O (n log n), where n is the number of blocks. The experimental results of the algorithm show its superiority in running time.", "paper_title": "An improved algorithm for Sequence Pair generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200062"}
