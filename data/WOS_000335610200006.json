Due to the presence of several equilibrium points, randomness and hence the complexity of the state time series for these multi-wing chaotic systems is much higher than that of the conventional double-wing chaotic attractors. A real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) based global optimization framework has been adopted in this paper as a common template for designing optimum Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in order to control the state trajectories of four different multi-wing chaotic systems among the Lorenz family viz. Lu system, Chen system, Rucklidge (or Shimizu Morioka) system and Sprott-1 system. Robustness of the control scheme for different initial conditions of the multi-wing chaotic systems has also been shown. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
