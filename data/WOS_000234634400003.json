As the normal law is a particular Kotz type distribution, it seems reasonable, taking into account the known results about the normal law, to search such estimators inside the family of unbiased linear estimators. However, we have proven that it is not possible to obtain efficient linear estimators. Then, we have focused our interest on determining the best unbiased linear estimators in the sense of minimizing the distance to the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The results theoretically obtained are illustrated in a numerical simulation example.", "paper_title": "Efficient linear estimation problem in the bivariate Kotz distribution under dependence assumptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000234634400003"}
