In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant learning method for training radial basis function (RBF) networks that may contain the coexistence of the stuck-at-zero node fault and the stuck-at-one node fault. First, we provide a formulation for evaluating the mean square error of the faulty RBF networks. Next an objective function, together with an algorithm for training the fault-tolerant RBF networks, is developed. Subsequently, we derive a mean prediction error (MPE) formula to estimate the test set error of the faulty RBF networks. With the MPE formula, we can estimate the RBF width that leads to near-optimal fault-tolerant capability. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our method, as well as its compliance with the theoretical outcome.", "paper_title": "An Improved Fault-Tolerant Objective Function and Learning Algorithm for Training the Radial Basis Function Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000341593600003"}
