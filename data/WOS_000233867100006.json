We consider this concept applied to graphs, and call a graph to be balanced when its clique matrix is balanced. Characterizations of balanced graphs by forbidden subgraphs and by clique subgraphs are proved in this work. Using properties of domination we define four subclasses of balanced graphs. Two of them are characterized by 0-1 matrices and can be recognized in polynomial time. Furthermore, we propose polynomial time combinatorial algorithms for the problems of stable set, clique-independent set and clique-transversal for one of these subclasses of balanced graphs. Finally, we analyse the behavior of balanced graphs and these four subclasses under the clique graph operator.", "paper_title": "On balanced graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100006"}
