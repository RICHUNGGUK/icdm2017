In the first step, the vulnerability concept is defined and quantified formally, and distinct user and technological perspectives are highlighted. In the second step, the conceptual measures are adapted and calculated according to the conditions, requirements and goals of a particular analysis. The paper describes practical indicators and algorithms developed for large-scale vulnerability analyses. For the third step, the paper analyzes both single link closures and area-covering disruptions and the distribution of impacts among different regions in a case study on the Swedish road transport system. The spatial patterns are put in connection with the regional variations in location and travel patterns and network density. Finally, the implications for policy and possible approaches to vulnerability management are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
