Recent research has discussed efficiency and fairness requirements and identified a number of desirable scheduling objectives including so-called dominant resource fairness (DRF). We argue here that proportional fairness (PE), long recognized as a desirable objective in sharing network bandwidth between ongoing data transfers, is preferable to DRF. The superiority of PF is manifest under the realistic modeling assumption that the population of jobs in progress is a stochastic process. In random traffic the strategy-proof property of DRF proves unimportant while PF is shown by analysis and simulation to offer a significantly better efficiency fairness tradeoff.
