The coexisting systems of normally placed and displaced amacrine cells in the vertebrate retina provide interesting examples of retinotopic spatial organization. However, it is not clear whether these two systems are spatially interrelated or not. The current work applies two mathematical-computational methods-a new method involving Voronoi diagrams for local density quantification and a more traditional approach, the Ripley K function-in order to characterize the mosaics of normally placed and displaced amacrine cells in the retina of Hoplias malabaricus and search for possible spatial relationships between these two types of mosaics. The results obtained by the Voronoi local density analysis suggest that the two systems of amacrine cells are spatially interrelated through nearly constant local density ratios.", "paper_title": "Voronoi analysis uncovers relationship between mosaics of normally placed and displaced amacrine cells in the thraira retina", "paper_id": "WOS:000245930400005"}
