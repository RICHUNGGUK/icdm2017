Hence, it is regarded as a good target for the development of clinically useful agents. In this study, the effects of lipid bilayer, N-acetylglucosamine and S-palmitoyl on the dynamic behavior of A(2B)AR model is explored. Homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore structural features of A(2B)AR in the presence of lipid bilayer. Twenty ns MD simulation was performed on the constructed model inserted in a hydrated lipid bilayer to examine stability of the best model. OSIP339391 as the most potent antagonist was docked in the active site of the model. Another MD simulation was performed on the ligand-protein complex to explore effects of the bilayer on this complex. A similar procedure was performed for the modified protein with N-acetylglucosamine and S-palmitoyl moieties in its structure. Phe173 and Glu174 located in EL2 were determined to be involved in ligand-receptor interactions through pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding. Asn254 was crucial to form hydrogen-bonding. The reliability of the model was assessed through docking using both commercial and synthetic antagonists and an r(2) of 0.70 was achieved. Our results show that molecular dynamics simulations of palmitoylated/glycosylated, membrane-integrated human A(2B)AR in its native environment is a possible approach and this model can be used for designing potent and selective A(2B)AR antagonists.", "paper_title": "Characterization of adenosine receptor in its native environment: insights from molecular dynamics simulations of palmitoylated/glycosylated, membrane-integrated human A(2B) adenosine receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000030"}
