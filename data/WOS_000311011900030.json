In the two-step error concealment method, the interpolations are only spatially applied however, higher efficiency of the interpolation can be expected by utilizing spatial and temporal similarities. In this paper, we propose an enhanced spatial and temporal error concealment method in order to achieve higher error concealment (EC) performance in packet loss networks. In the temporal error concealment method, structural similarity (SSIM) index is employed for inter group of pictures (GOP) EC and minimum mean square error (MMSE) is used for intra GOP EC. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain remarkable performance compared with the conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Performance of Spatial and Temporal Error Concealment Method for 3D DWT Video Coding in Packet Loss Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900030"}
