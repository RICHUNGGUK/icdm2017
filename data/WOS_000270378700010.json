Some of these properties raised the idea of the existence of order within a system-linkage, but that idea was only semantic. There was not any formal definition of order within a system-linkage. The put-pose of this paper is to define more precisely what is understood to be an \"ordered\" system-linkage, as well as studying before one of the main cases of disorder in these systems: turbulences. Design/methodology/approach - First, a reminder is given of all the concepts and proved results that readers need for understanding the paper. Then, two new and important definitions are given: definition of ordered system-linkage and the definition of turbulence. The paper proves several questions linking this definition with the main objects which appear within a system-linkage. Several examples of turbulences will be showed using graphs. Findings - The definition of turbulence presented, basically refers to the dependent relationship between two subsets disjoint from the M set of variables, once the associated structural function operates on them. It is a good example of disorder within a system-linkage and, moreover, it is a good example of how the initial conditions, in a lot of cases, do not allow to see the real relationships between the variables or sets of them of a system-linkage. Originality/value - It is the first time that an ordered system-linkage is formalized. Moreover, the Situation of turbulence, under the qualitative point of view, is also shown for the first time.", "paper_title": "Turbulences and disorder in general systems theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000270378700010"}
