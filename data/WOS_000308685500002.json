These paradigms, usually referred to as Pocket Switched Networks or Delay Tolerant Networks, jointly exploit human mobility and store-and-forward communications to improve the connectivity in sparse or isolated networks. Clearly, understanding the human mobility patterns is a key challenge for the design of routing protocols based on such paradigms. To this aim, we anonymously collected the positions of almost two thousand mobile phone users, spread over a metropolitan area greater than 200 km(2) for roughly one month. Then, with a multi-disciplinary approach, we estimated the mobility patterns from the collected data and, assuming Wi-Fi connectivity, we inferred the contact events among the devices to evaluate the connectivity properties of a human mobility-enabled wireless network. In a nutshell, the contribution of the paper is threefold: (i) it confirms some of the results obtained in smaller environments, such as the power-law distribution for contact and inter-contact times, allowing us to estimate the distribution parameters with high statistical significance; (ii) it addresses the feasibility of the transmission opportunities provided by human mobility to build a city-wide connected network for different forwarding strategies classes; (iii) it shows uncovered characteristics of the connectivity properties of human mobility, such as the presence of the small world phenomenon in wide-scale experiments.
