The present paper investigates the antenna array technique for its ability in reducing the multipath delay spread of the ionosphere channel and, thus, increasing possibly the bandwidth of the HF system. To enable fast moving speed of the vehicular receiver, we propose to use single antenna at the receiver and the adaptive array at the transmitter. The adaptive beamforming is driven based on the protocol design and reciprocity principle of channel. In order to evaluate the performance of array system, a statistical HF double-directional channel model, which includes angular information at both the transmitter and receiver, is presented. The explicit expressions are obtained for calculating the coherence bandwidth. The numerical results show the efficiency of this approach for mid-latitude mid-range channel.
