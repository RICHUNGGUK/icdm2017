Thus, the issue of executing wills for the purpose of dividing inheritance is worth investigating. Acrimony caused by family disputes or distribution of inheritance has a negative impact on society. Thus, we seek to construct a method of constructing a secure and private escrow will. The concept of secret sharing was proposed by Shamir and Blakley in 1979. Our method seeks to alleviate problems associated with secret sharing. We divide secret S into n pieces and distribute those pieces to n specific objects. We call the n owners the shadows. We then reconstruct these shadows and retrieve the original main key. Our method functions on the basis of the secret sharing mechanism. The proposed scheme combines the convenience of the Internet with cryptology technologies to solve the security problems of the online wills. It not only reduces cost and improves performance, but also prevents family infighting.
