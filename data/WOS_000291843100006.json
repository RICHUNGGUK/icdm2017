In the proposed method, each EEFL is divided into four partitions using external electrodes formed on the outer surface of the lamp. The luminance is controlled by varying the duration of ac power applied to the center electrode of each partition. The shape of the external circuit for the center electrode is designed to have a reliable on/off operation. Balance circuits connected to the grounded electrodes are used to reduce the luminance difference between the left and right parts of each partition. The proposed method was tested on a 42-in. LCD using an EEFL backlight unit (BLU) after dividing the BLU into 24 blocks. The EEFL BLU could operate reliably up to an ac peak voltage of 1.4 kV, while controlling the luminance of each block independently. When one block at the corner was turned on, and the others were turned off, the luminance ratio was similar to 11.1:1 between the block and the nearest one, and similar to 9000:1 between the block and the farthest one. These experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is an effective approach for local dimming of LCDs using EEFL BLUs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
