Separating the trunk from its background is the first step toward the 3D model construction of the tree. In this paper, a three-phase algorithm is developed to extract the trunk structure of the tree and hence segment the trunk from the image. Some experiments were conducted and results confirmed the feasibility of proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "An approach to extracting trunk from an image", "paper_id": "WOS:000237203100033"}
