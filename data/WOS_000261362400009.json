We propose an on-demand cost-credit routing (ODCCR) protocol for cooperative routing using a cost-credit concept and propose a way for including this in an AODV-like implementation. ODCCR can be applied to power constrained static as well as mobile ad hoc networks using a route management module to take care of routes with forwarding nodes that have become unavailable due to deactivation (no more battery power left) or mobility. The implementation of a forwarding rule in ODCCR ensures that each node will be able to increase their self transmission in this cooperative and power constrained environment. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the network lifetime and throughput performances of ODCCR, AODV and a reward-based on-demand routing (RBODR) protocol in a static as well as a mobile power-constrained network. We also propose a centralized routing protocol based on maximizing the minimum battery power among all nodes for the cost-credit system. Routes selected must enable source nodes to transmit as many data packets as possible. We will evaluate this protocol against ODCCR and observe how the two protocols with different objectives set perform with regards to their network lifetime and throughput performances.
