In particular, a key addition is the new virtual concatenation feature that allows for inverse multiplexing of connection demands across SONET/SDH domains. This paper presents a novel tiered survivability scheme that leverages this feature to support multiple levels of service survivability and higher load carrying capability and service resiliency. Detailed simulation performance analysis results are also presented along with conclusions and directions for future work.", "paper_title": "Multi-tiered service survivability in next-generation SONET/SDH networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242061100007"}
