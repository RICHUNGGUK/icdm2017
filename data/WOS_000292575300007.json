Here, instead of developing a new methodology for ECS design, we propose to upgrade an existing one by bridging it with a methodology used in other areas of embedded systems design. We created a transformation bridge between the control-scheduling and the hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design tools. By defining this bridge, we allow for an automatic model transformation. As a result, we obtain more accurate timing-behaviour simulations, considering not only the real-time software, but also the hardware architecture's impact on the control performance. We show an example with different model-evaluation results compared to real implementation measurements, which clearly demonstrates the benefits of our approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
