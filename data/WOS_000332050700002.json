Design/methodology/approach - This paper is a case study of how linked data technologies can be applied for the enhancement Of open learning contents. Findings - Results presented under the umbrella of OCW-Universia consortium, as the integration and access to content from different repositories OCW and the development of a query method to access these data, reveal that linked data would offer a solution to filter and select semantically those open educational contents, and automatically are linked to the linked open data cloud. Originality/value - The new OCW-Universia integration with linked data adds new features to the initial framework including improved query mechanisms and interoperability.", "paper_title": "Consuming and producing linked open data: the case of OpenCourse Ware", "paper_id": "WOS:000332050700002"}
