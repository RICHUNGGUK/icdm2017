Most of the works on multimedia transmission are focused on bit errors and packet losses due to the fading channel environment of a wireless network. Error resilient multimedia is significant research topic which can be adapted to the different conditions in a wireless environment. The current solutions in transmission of multimedia across different networks include some type of transcoder where the source is partially or fully decoded, and re-encoded to suit the network conditions. This paper introduces a flexible progressive coding framework for 3D meshes, which can be adapted to the different conditions imposed by wired and wireless channels at the bitstream level. By avoiding the computationally complex steps of transcoding between networks, could deteriorate decoded model quality. The framework also allows refined degradation of model quality when the network conditions are poor due to congestion or deep fades.", "paper_title": "Progressive meshes transmission over a wired-to-wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000252193500004"}
