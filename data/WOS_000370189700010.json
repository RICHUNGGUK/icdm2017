Unlike conventional support vector regression (SVR), linear L-p-WSVR ensures that useful features are selected based on theoretical analysis. By using the wavelet kernel, L-p-WSVR approaches any curve in quadratic continuous integral space that leads to improving regression performance. Results of experiments show the superiority of L-p-WSVR in both feature selection and regression performances. Applying L-p-WSVR to Chinese real estate prices shows that the most significant and powerful factor contributing to Chinese housing prices is monetary growth.", "paper_title": "Wavelet L-p-Norm Support Vector Regression with Feature Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189700010"}
