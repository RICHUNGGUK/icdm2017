The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, the feature point based watermark synchronization and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based watermark embedding/extraction. In watermark synchronization, the locally most stable feature points (LMSP) are extracted from the scale normalized image to generate some non-overlapped circular regions. These regions are invariant to image rotation and scaling, and watermark synchronization is achieved using these local invariant regions. In the second process, a new image watermarking scheme is proposed in DWT domain. The watermark is embedded into all the local invariant regions repeatedly, and it can be extracted blindly. DWT domain watermarking is robust to signal processing attacks and watermark synchronization gets rid of the effect of geometric attacks. The integration of the above two techniques in the proposed scheme guarantees its robustness to both signal processing attacks and geometric attacks. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantage of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Robust image watermarking using feature based local invariant regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400013"}
