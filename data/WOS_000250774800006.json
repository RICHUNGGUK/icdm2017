In contrast to many classical approaches, the discretization process is multivariate: all variables are discretized simultaneously, and the proposed discretization is evaluated with the Naive-Bayes classifier. The search for the optimal discretization is carried out as an optimization process with the learning model estimated accuracy guiding it. The global optimization algorithm is based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a set of novel algorithms which are special kinds of evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the behaviour of the algorithm, an analysis of different parameters is performed by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The evaluation was carried out using artificial datasets, and with UCI datasets. The results suggest that the proposed method provides an effective and robust technique for discretizating variables.", "paper_title": "Wrapper discretization by means of estimation of distribution algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000250774800006"}
