From the programmer's standpoint, new tools are necessary toease the use of these techniques within current programming platforms. This paper presents a step in this direction by describing a general framework that supports the implementation of applications dealing with fuzzy objects. We pay special attention to the study of the object comparision problem by offering both a theoretical analysis and a simple and transparent way to use our theoretical results in practice.", "paper_title": "A general framework for computing with words in object-oriented programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307200007"}
