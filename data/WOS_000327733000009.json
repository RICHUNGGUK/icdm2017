In this article, we propose a new mathematical formulation for this problem. We analyze our formulation and compare it with two formulations in the literature. We also develop branch-and-cut algorithms to solve the problem to optimality. We present computational results for instances based on three types of graphs: directed, undirected, and mixed.
