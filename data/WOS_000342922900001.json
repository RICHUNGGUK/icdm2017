A challenge in application-specific NoC design is to find the right balance among different tradeoffs, such as communication latency, power consumption and chip area. We propose a novel approach that generates latency-aware heterogeneous NoC topology. Experimental results show that our approach improves the total communication latency up to 27% with modest power consumption.", "paper_title": "Application-Specific Heterogeneous Network-on-Chip Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000342922900001"}
