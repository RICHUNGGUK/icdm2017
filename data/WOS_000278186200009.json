However, they usually have poor performance in segmenting images with complex object shape and complex background, and also in dealing with the issue of weak-edge-leakage. To guide the front of active contour toward the desired object boundary and prevent it from moving over the weak edges with strong neighbors, we present a novel external force field, referred to as gradient and direction vector flow (G&DVF), which integrates the gradient vector flow (GVF) and the prior directional information provided by a user. The proposed method is sufficiently general and simple to implement. The experiments conducted on image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed method is insensitive to image clutters/noise and capable of driving the fronts of active contours to conform to complex shapes and addressing the issue of weak-edge-leakage in some cases.
