One particular problem is known as Why-Not question and focusses on the reasons for missing tuples from query results. The EFQ platform demonstrated here has been designed in this context to efficiently leverage Why-Not Answers polynomials, a novel approach that provides the user with complete explanations to Why-Not questions and allows for automatic, relevant query refinements.", "paper_title": "EFQ: Why-Not Answer Polynomials in Action", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800081"}
