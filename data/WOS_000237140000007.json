The objective of FDA is to find an optimal projection matrix, which maximizes the between-class-distance and simultaneously minimizes within-class-distance. The main limitation of traditional FDA is the so-called Small Sample Size (3S) problem. It induces that the within-class scatter matrix is singular and then the traditional FDA fails to perform directly for pattern classification. To overcome 3S problem, this paper proposes a novel two-step single parameter regularization Fisher discriminant (2SRFD) algorithm for face recognition. The first semi-regularized step is based on a rank lifting theorem. This step adjusts both the projection directions and their corresponding weights. Our previous three-to-one parameter regularized technique is exploited in the second stage, which just changes the weights of projection directions. It is shown that the final regularized within-class scatter matrix approaches the original within-class scatter matrix as the single parameter tends to zero. Also, our method has good computational complexity. The proposed method has been tested and evaluated with three public available databases, namely ORL, CMU PIE and FERET face databases. Comparing with existing state-of-the-art FDA-based methods in solving the S3 problem, the proposed 2SRFD approach gives the best performance.", "paper_title": "Two-step single parameter regularization Fisher discriminant method for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000237140000007"}
