These two models are used to describe the collisions of particles, and the distributions can be identified as density functions. If the particles are placed at a single point, then the density function turns out to be a delta-function and is difficult to be well approximated numerically. In this paper, we use DG method to approximate such a singularity and demonstrate the good performance of the scheme. Since the density functions are always positive, we apply a positivity-preserving limiter to them. Moreover, for pressureless Euler equations, the velocity satisfies the maximum principle. We also construct special limiters to fulfill this requirement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
