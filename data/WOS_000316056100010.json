The variability of the medial offset was covered using literature data (minimum, 0mm; average, 7mm and maximum, 14mm). The following parameters were studied: moment arm (MA; middle deltoid), muscle activity and stability ratios. The minimum offset decreased the MA of the middle deltoid (11%), increased its activation (+18%) and its superior destabilising action (+40%). The maximum offset had an opposite effect (+9%, 30% and 30%). The stabilising action of the rotator cuff was not affected. Varying the medial offset seems to have an influence on the destabilising action of the middle deltoid. The AnyBody simulation tool appears to be promising in establishing links between shoulder morphology and stability.", "paper_title": "Influence of the medial offset of the proximal humerus on the glenohumeral destabilising forces during arm elevation: a numerical sensitivity study", "paper_id": "WOS:000316056100010"}
