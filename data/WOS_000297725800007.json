However, the imbalance of the online tags affects the performance of emotion classification. In this paper, we present a novel data-sampling method that eliminates the imbalance but still takes the prior probability of each emotion class into account. In addition, a two-layer emotion classification structure is proposed to harness the genre information available in the online repository of music tags. We show that genre-based grouping as a precursor greatly improves the performance of emotion classification. On the average, the incorporation of online genre tags improves the performance of emotion classification by a factor of 55% over the conventional single-layer system. The performance of our algorithm for classifying 183 emotion classes reaches 0.36 in example-based f-score.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Online Music Tags for Music Emotion Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000297725800007"}
