Assuming unit aspect ratio and zero skew, we show that interimage homographies can be expressed as a function of only the principal point. By minimizing symmetric transfer errors, we thus obtain an accurate solution for the camera parameters. We also extend our approach to a calibration technique using images of a I-D object with a fixed pivoting point. Unlike existing methods that rely on orthogonality or pole-polar relationship, our approach utilizes new interimage constraints and does not require knowledge of the 3-D coordinates of feature points. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we present results for both synthetic and real images.", "paper_title": "Camera calibration using symmetric objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100034"}
