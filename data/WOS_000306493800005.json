This class admits several dimensionality-reduction techniques based on data averaging or sampling, which are especially useful for large-scale problems. We survey these approaches and their connection to stochastic optimization. The data-averaging approach is only viable, however, for a least-squares misfit, which is sensitive to outliers in the data and artifacts unexplained by the forward model. This motivates us to propose a robust formulation based on the Student's t-distribution of the error. We demonstrate how the corresponding penalty function, together with the sampling approach, can obtain good results for a large-scale seismic inverse problem with 50 % corrupted data.", "paper_title": "Robust inversion, dimensionality reduction, and randomized sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000306493800005"}
