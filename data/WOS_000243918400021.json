Systems' architecture size, their approximation capability, and the smoothness of provided mappings are used as performance indexes for this comparative paper. Two widely used kernel functions, the siginoid-logistic function and the Gaussian function, are analyzed by their computation through an accuracy-controllable approximation algorithm designed for hardware implementation. Two artificial neural network (ANN) paradigms are selected for the analysis: backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs) with one hidden layer and radial basis function (RBF) networks. Extensive simulation of simple benchmark approximation problems is used in order to Achieve generalizable conclusions. For the performance analysis of fuzzy systems, a functional equivalence theorem is used to extend obtained results to fuzzy inference systems (FISs). Finally, the adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) paradigm is used to observe the behavior of neurofuzzy systems with learning capabilities.", "paper_title": "An experimental study on nonlinear function computation for neural/fuzzy hardware design", "paper_id": "WOS:000243918400021"}
