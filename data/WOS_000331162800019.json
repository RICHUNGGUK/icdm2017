The NISTNet emulator is used for adjusting the IP channel network. The transmission quality criterion is an MOS parameter investigated using the ITU-T P.862 PESQ, future P.863 POLQA and P.563 3SQM algorithms. Jitter and packet loss influence are investigated for the PCM codec and the Speex codec. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
