Four wave mixing (FWM) and cross phase modulation (XPM) on a dispersion shifted fiber (DSF) are used, for the combination of the Intensity modulated (IM) payload with Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulated header synchronously on the same optical carrier, and for the header removal and payload wavelength conversion respectively. Simulations have proven the feasibility of this DSF fiber based method, and shown the potential for high bit rate AOLS applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
