To integrate the proposed constitutive equations, a semi-implicit algorithm (implicit for the stresses and explicit for the damage variable) has been developed, leading to the generalized expressions of the classical return mapping algorithm. The model was implemented in a commercial finite element code and its performance was demonstrated by comparing its predictions with experimental results obtained by other authors.
