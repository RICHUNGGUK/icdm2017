Due to their simplicity and ease of specification, qualitative decision tools are popular in artificial intelligence. Brafman and Tennenholtz [R.I. Brafman, M. Tennenholtz, An axiomatic treatment of three qualitative decision criteria, J. ACM 47 (3) (2000) 452-482] model an agent's uncertain knowledge as her local state, which consists of states of the world that she deems possible. A policy determines for each local state a total preorder of the set of actions, which represents the agent's preference over these actions. It is known that a policy is maximin representable if and only if it is closed under unions and satisfies a certain acyclicity condition. In this paper we show that the above conditions, although necessary, are insufficient for minmax regret and competitive ratio policies. A complete characterization of these policies is obtained by introducing the best-equally strictness. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
