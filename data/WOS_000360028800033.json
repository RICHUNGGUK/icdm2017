Different from traditional Bernstein polynomials, partition of interval on input variable can be chosen as nonequidistant division. We prove that generalized Bernstein fuzzy systems are universal approximators to a given continuous function and its high-order derivatives. Further, ELM method is used to tune the parameters of generalized Bernstein fuzzy system and Spline fuzzy system. It is proved that ELM-Spline fuzzy system can approximate a function and its derivative. Simulation examples show that the proposed ELM-Bernstein fuzzy system and ELM-spline fuzzy system can achieve high approximation capability for nonlinear model. (C) 2014 Elsevier By.
