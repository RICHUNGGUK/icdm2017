We first define and analyze the problem of time-constrained services and then propose an effective scheduling algorithm that constructs a broadcast program to satisfy as many clients' requirements within the expected times as possible. The performance study reveals the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
