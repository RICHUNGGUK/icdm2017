For this purpose, we introduce a sparse multiscale Lagrange interpolation method for the function. Using this interpolation method, we then design a quadrature scheme for evaluating the Fourier coefficients of the sparse Fourier expansion. This leads to a fast discrete algorithm for computing the sparse Fourier expansion. We prove that this method gives the optimal approximation order O(n(-s)) for the sparse Fourier expansion, where s > 0 is the order of the Sobolev regularity of the function to be approximated and where n is the order of the univariate trigonometric polynomial used to construct the sparse multivariate approximation, and requires only O(n log(2d-1) n) number of multiplications to compute all of its Fourier coefficients. We present several numerical examples with d = 2, 3 and 4 that confirm the theoretical estimates of approximation order and computational complexity and compare I he numerical performance of the proposed method with that of a well-known existing algorithm. We also have a numerical example for d = 8 to test the efficiency of the propose algorithm for functions of a higher dimension. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
