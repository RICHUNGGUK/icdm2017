In this paper, we extend an ANOVA model by relaxing the assumption of independence in time. We further relax the assumption of homoskedasticity in the traditional profile analysis by introducing GARCH innovations in our proposed profile analysis that allows for both autoregressive and moving average components in the heteroskedastic variance to display a high degree of persistence. We reprise the model with regards to the issue of American depository receipts by relaxing the time-dependence assumption that has been ignored in the literature. Applying our model, we find that the returns from the stocks and the American depository receipts are time-dependent and hence the traditional ANOVA cannot fully explore the time effect from the data.
