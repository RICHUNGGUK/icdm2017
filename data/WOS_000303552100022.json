Due to plenteous technical domain terms and lengthy sentences prevailing in patent claims, it is difficult to apply a NLP Parser directly to parse the plain texts in the patent claim. This paper combines techniques such as finite state machines, Part-Of-Speech tags, conceptual graphs, domain ontology and dependency tree to convert a patent claim into a formally defined conceptual graph. The method of a finite state machine splits a lengthy patent claim sentence into a set of shortened sub-sentences so that the NLP Parser can parse them one by one effectively. The Part-Of-Speech and dependency tree of a patent claim are used to build the conceptual graph based on the pre-established domain ontology. The result shows that 99% sub-sentences split from 1700 patent claims can be efficiently parsed by the NLP Parser. There are two types of nodes in a conceptual graph, the concept and the relation nodes. Each concept or relation can be extracted directly from a patent claim and each relation can link with a fixed number of concepts in a conceptual graph. From 100 patent claims, the average precision and recall of a concept class mapping from the patent claim to domain ontology are 96% and 89%, respectively, and the average precision and recall for Real relation class mapping are 97% and 98%, respectively. For the concept linking of a relation, the average precision is 79%. Based on the extracted conceptual graphs from patents, it would facilitate automated comparison and summarization among patents for judgment of patent infringement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
