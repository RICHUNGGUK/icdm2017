Common examples include tracking of moving objects, intelligent transportation systems, cellular communications and meteorology monitoring. A spatiotemporal query determines the objects included in a region at a specified period of time between two date-time instants referred as time window. In the context of this work, we present SMaRT: A novel Spatiotemporal Mysql ReTrieval framework, based on MySQL and PostgreSQL database management system. Moreover, we propose a demo user interface that implements all of its capabilities, in order to help user determine the most efficient spatiotemporal query method on user-defined 20 trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to study and compare methods of addressing range queries on nonlinear moving object trajectories, that are represented both in dual and native dimensional space. In particular, it is the first time a theoretically efficient dual approach was implemented for nonlinear trajectories and incorporated into a well-known open-source RDBMS. An experimental evaluation is included that shows the performance and efficiency of our approach. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
