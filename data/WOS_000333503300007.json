The planar-array of micro-blazed grating has been proposed to realize 2D PST based on its interesting properties such as high diffraction efficiency, small size, high degree of integration, and easy to fabricate. 2D PST could be realized in free space through controling the etching direction and the period of micro-blazed grating, which results in signal beams can reach the desired spatial position. Unlike the conventional method depending on the operation of dividing, magnification, interlacing, and superimposing, this approach, which mainly relies on the diffractive properties of signal beams and the distribution of light intensity, presents a single diffractive element to perform 2D PST. Thus, this approach has the advantages of high energy efficiency, high feasibility, compact in structure, and easy to integrate. The theoretical analyses and the experimental results show that it should be helpful in optical interconnection network, especially, in PS omega network. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
