Due to universal approximation theorem, fuzzy control provides nonlinear controller, i.e., fuzzy logic controllers, to perform the unknown nonlinear control actions and the tracking error, because of the matching error and external disturbance is attenuated to arbitrary desired level by using H(infinity) tracking design technique. In this paper, a new direct adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy controller is developed to handle the training data corrupted by noise or rule uncertainties for nonlinear MIMO systems involving external disturbances. Therefore, linguistic fuzzy control rules can be directly incorporated into the controller and combine the H(infinity) attenuation technique. Simulation results show that the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system can handle unpredicted internal disturbance, data uncertainties, very well, but the adaptive type-1 fuzzy controller must spend more control effort in order to deal with noisy training data. Furthermore, the adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy controller can perform successful control and guarantee the global stability of the resulting closed-loop system and the tracking performance can be achieved.
