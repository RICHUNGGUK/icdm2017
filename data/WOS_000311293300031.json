In conjunction with the Federal Communication Commission's study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we investigate the throughput and latency of network access links from about 4000 routers across eight ISPs. Our findings provide a snapshot of access network performance across the United States, offer insights on how access network performance should be measured and presented to users, and inform various ongoing efforts to evaluate the performance of access networks around the world.", "paper_title": "Measuring Home Broadband Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000311293300031"}
