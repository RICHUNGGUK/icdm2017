In this article, we present mobile energy disseminators (MED), a new concept, that can facilitate EVs to extend their range in a typical urban scenario. Our proposed method exploits Inter-Vehicle (IVC) communications in order to eco-route electric vehicles taking advantage of the existence of MEDs. Combining modern communications between vehicles and state of the art technologies on energy transfer, vehicles can extend their travel time without the need for large batteries or extremely costly infrastructure. Furthermore, by applying intelligent decision mechanisms we can further improve the performance of the method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic wireless charging of electric vehicles on the move with Mobile Energy Disseminators", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580500034"}
