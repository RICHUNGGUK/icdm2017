Such additive decompositions have applications in a variety of numerical problems including system identification, latent variable graphical modeling, and principal components analysis. We study conditions under which recovering such a decomposition is possible via a combination of norm and trace norm minimization. We are specifically interested in the question of how many sparse corruptions are allowed so that convex programming can still achieve accurate recovery, and we obtain stronger recovery guarantees than previous studies. Moreover, we do not assume that the spatial pattern of corruptions is random, which stands in contrast to related analyses under such assumptions via matrix completion.", "paper_title": "Robust Matrix Decomposition With Sparse Corruptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100001"}
