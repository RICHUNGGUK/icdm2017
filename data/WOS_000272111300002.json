The proposed method is illustrated by examining two practiced datasets for publicly traded firms in Taiwan. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the listing methods in terms of accuracy and number of rules. Furthermore, the proposed method generates a set of comprehensible decision rules that can be applied in a knowledge-based system for investment decision-making of investors.", "paper_title": "AN ALTERNATE METHOD OF EXAMINING IPO RETURNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111300002"}
