Our new FFT processors use mixed-radix multipath delay commutator (MRMDC) architecture from the point of view of low complexity and high memory use. A conventional MRMDC architecture induces large circuits in delay commutators, which change the order of data sequences for the butterfly units. The proposed architecture replaces delay elements with new commutators that cooperate with other MIMO-OFDM processing blocks. These commutators are inserted in the front and rear of the input and output memory units. Our FFT processors exhibit a 50-51% reduction in logic gates and 70-72% reduction in power dissipation as compared with conventional ones.", "paper_title": "Design of Area- and Power-Efficient Pipeline FFT Processors for 8x8 MIMO-OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000015"}
