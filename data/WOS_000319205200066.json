To perform efficient scheduling, channel state information (CSI) for users is required, and is obtained via their respective feedback channels. In this paper, a more realistic imperfect CSI feedback, in the form of a finite set of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values, is assumed as specified in the HSDPA standard. A mathematical model of the problem is developed for use in the optimization process. A hybrid heuristic approach based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing is used to solve the problem. Simulation results indicate that the hybrid approach outperforms individual implementations of both simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
