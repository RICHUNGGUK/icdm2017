In this paper, we address differentiated data delivery in the presence of congestion in wireless sensor networks. We propose a class of algorithms that enforce differentiated routing based on the congested areas of a network and data priority. The basic protocol, called Congestion-Aware Routing ( CAR), discovers the congested zone of the network that exists between high-priority data sources and the data sink and, using simple forwarding rules, dedicates this portion of the network to forwarding primarily high-priority traffic. Since CAR requires some overhead for establishing the high-priority routing zone, it is unsuitable for highly mobile data sources. To accommodate these, we define MAC-Enhanced CAR ( MCAR), which includes MAC-layer enhancements and a protocol for forming high-priority paths on the fly for each burst of data. MCAR effectively handles the mobility of high-priority data sources, at the expense of degrading the performance of low-priority traffic. We present extensive simulation results for CAR and MCAR, and an implementation of MCAR on a 48-node testbed.", "paper_title": "Mitigating performance degradation in congested sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255012900002"}
