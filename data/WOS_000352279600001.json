With respect to the minimum expected risk, DTRSs deduce the rules of three-way decisions. Considering the new expression of evaluation information with hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), we introduce HFSs into DTRSs and explore their decision mechanisms. More specifically, we take into account the losses of DTRSs with hesitant fuzzy elements and propose a new model of hesitant fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets (HFDTRSs). Some properties of the expected losses and their corresponding scores are carefully investigated under the hesitant fuzzy information. Three-way decisions and the associated cost of each object are further derived. With the above analysis, a novel risk decision-making method with the aid of HFDTRSs is developed. Besides the three-way decisions with DTRSs, the method investigates the ranking and resource allocation by utilizing the associated costs of alternatives and multiobjective 0-1 integer programming. Our study also offers a solution in the aspect of determining losses of DTRS and extends the range of applications.", "paper_title": "A Novel Risk Decision Making Based on Decision-Theoretic Rough Sets Under Hesitant Fuzzy Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600001"}
