This paper proposes a STEP-NC data model for on-line inspections. A framework of STEP-NC enabled closed-loop machining is also presented. The aim is to achieve a fully closed computer-aided design, process planning, machining and inspection chain. A new version of STEP-NC Interpreter has been developed to implement the proposed framework. A case study is included to demonstrate the implementation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
