Design/methodology/approach - After a preliminary design on the basis of an analytical model, finite element simulations are adopted to refine the design of the machine. Findings - The designed ISA drive is able to satisfy all the requirements of modern cars, where the power of the electrical generators is increasing to deliver the on-board power demand. The drive exhibits high torque, driving start, and a wide constant power speed range driving generation. Originality/value - The entire system design is considered in the paper, both the electrical machine and the control strategy.", "paper_title": "Interior permanent magnet integrated starter-alternator", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800009"}
