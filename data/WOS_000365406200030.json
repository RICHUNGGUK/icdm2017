The proposed framework considers the dynamic security aspect of the power system in the scenario-based market operation. To solve the problem, first, on the basis of lattice Monte Carlo simulation, different scenarios are generated to model the uncertainties of power system (including generating units and transmission line contingencies). Then, the competing objective functions of the proposed framework, including the expected social welfare function and expected corrected transient energy margin (CTEM), are simultaneously optimized for each scenario in the multiobjective framework. To calculate the CTEM, a sensitivity analysis based on the ac power flow formulation is incorporated before solving the optimization problem of the market clearing. The optimization problem is solved considering dc power flow constraints and system reserve requirements. Eventually, the scenarios are aggregated based on the expected value of decision variables to produce the final results of the market clearing framework. The model is applied to the New England test system, and simulation studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Corrected Transient Energy Margin in Electricity Energy Market Operation Using Stochastic Multiobjective Mathematical Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200030"}
