In this work, we improve both the previous known upper bound of 2(2k) [1] and lower bound of (k + 1) [2] for mimicking networks, reducing the doubly-exponential gap between them to a single-exponential gap as follows: Given a graph G, we exhibit a construction of mimicking network with at most k'th Hosten-Morris number (approximate to 2([(k-1)/2]) of vertices (independent of the size of V). There exist graphs with k terminals that have no mimicking network with less than 2(k-1/2) number of vertices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
