It is called vertex-transitive (respectively arc-transitive) if its automorphism group acts transitively on its vertex-set (respectively arc-set). In this paper, we combine some new theoretical results with computer calculations to determine all cubic vertex-transitive graphs of order at most 1280. In the process, we also determine all tetravalent arc-transitive graphs of order at most 640. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
