Along with classical regularization techniques based on smoothness, entropy, and sparsity, an emerging powerful regularization is one that leans on image examples. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for using image examples as driving a powerful regularization, applied to the image scale-up (super-resolution) problem. In this work, we target specifically scanned documents containing written text, graphics, and equations. Our algorithm starts by assigning per each location in the degraded image several candidate high-quality patches. Those are found as the nearest-neighbors (NN) in an image-database that contains pairs of corresponding low- and high-quality image patches. The found examples are used for the definition of an image prior expression, merged into a global MAP penalty function. We use this penalty function both for rejecting some of the irrelevant outlier examples, and then for reconstructing the desired image. We demonstrate our algorithm on several scanned documents with promising results.", "paper_title": "Example-based single document image super-resolution: a global MAP approach with outlier rejection", "paper_id": "WOS:000246565700005"}
