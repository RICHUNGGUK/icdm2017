These services have improved a great number of aspects related to pervasive systems such as saving resources, efficiency, reliability, scalability and low power consumption. In this paper, mu SMS middleware, using an event-based service model, is presented. This novel approach makes up the design requirements previously mentioned by implementing a dynamic memory kernel and a variable payload multiplexing mechanism for the information events in order to provide advanced services. The results obtained over real-world deployments, especially those related with provision of e-Health services, reflect a significant improvement over other similar proposals, such as the RUNES approach: 50% lower memory overhead, 53% lower software components load time and 12% lower event's propagation time.
