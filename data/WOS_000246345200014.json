The method is verified by comparing its modeling results with measured ones as well as with results obtained from a mode-matching method for bench-mark structures. The leakage properties of elliptical NRD guides and also the complete losses in trapezoidal NRD guides are studied in detail for the first time to demonstrate the advantages of the new method.
