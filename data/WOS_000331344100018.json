Since sensing data is spatially correlated, compressed sensing (CS) is a promising reconstruction scheme to provide low cost packet error correction and load balancing. In this letter, assuming a multi-hop network topology, we present a CS oriented data aggregation scheme with a new measurement matrix which balances energy consumption of the nodes and allows for recovery of lost packets at fusion center without additional transmissions. Comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed scheme offers higher recovery precision and less energy consumption on TinyOS.", "paper_title": "Low Cost Error Correction for Multi-Hop Data Aggregation Using Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100018"}
