Our problem allows users to apply their domain knowledge to control the construction of the agreement subtrees in order to get better results. We show that the MCAST problem can be reduced to the MAST problem in linear time and thus we have algorithms for MCAST with running times matching the fastest known algorithms for MAST.", "paper_title": "From constrained to unconstrained maximum agreement subtree in linear time", "paper_id": "WOS:000252251700005"}
