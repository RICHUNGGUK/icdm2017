It performs both exploratory and automatic analysis of the collected data with a variety of linear and nonlinear modeling methods. The paper investigates issues, such as the ability to predict future values for a varying number of days ahead and the effect of including values from a varying number of past days. Experimental results provide interesting insights on the predictability of the target variables and the performance of the different learning algorithms. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
