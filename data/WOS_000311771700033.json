The challenges that have to be overcome by web application designers include how to make these applications support as much concurrent users as possible, without degrading application's performance, and without single points of failure. Such complex task would be much easier to achieve if designers could concentrate on the application functionalities without worrying about its wide-area scope and derived problems. In this article, we introduce CloudSNAP, a decentralized web deployment platform. CloudSNAP allows transforming any actual web application into a globally-enabled and scalable one. By using a distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud interception middleware, all necessary functionalities are injected into existent web infrastructures in a transparent way. Therefore, CloudSNAP provides many benefits from P2P Cloud computing, like a decentralized deployment environment as well as a set of distributed mechanisms, like load balancing, fault tolerance, dynamic activation, persistence and replication. Moreover, our solution offers important advantages: (i) a high degree of transparency and decoupling in all provided services by means of distributed interception techniques, and (ii) the direct deployment of existent Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications and services with practically no changes on them. In summary, CloudSNAP makes it easy to deploy any Java EE web application into a P2P Cloud infrastructure, and immediately benefit from all of its inherent services at a minimal development and infrastructure cost.
