However, most of the current AR authoring tools are actually programming interfaces that are exclusively suitable for programmers. In this paper, we propose an AR authoring tool which provides advanced visual effect, such as occlusion or media contents. This tool allows non-programming users to develop low-cost AR applications, specially oriented to on-site assembly and maintenance/repair tasks. A new 3D edition interface is proposed, using photos and Kinect depth information to improve 3D scenes composition. In order to validate our AR authoring tool, two evaluations have been performed, to test the authoring process and the task execution using AR. The evaluation results show that overlaying 3D instructions on the actual work pieces reduces the error rate for an assembly task by more than a 75%, particularly diminishing cumulative errors common in sequential procedures. Also, the results show how the new edition interface proposed, improves the 3D authoring process making possible create more accurate AR scenarios and 70% faster. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
