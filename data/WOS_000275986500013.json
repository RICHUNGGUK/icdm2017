The wall's external stability under static conditions is addressed and modeled as a series system with correlated failure modes. Computations of reliability are performed using Monte Carlo simulations for assumed probability distributions of the backfill and foundation material engineering properties. A case example is analyzed based on the described methodology. The results indicated that risk, measured by the system probability of failure, is not a linear function of safety ratios. All three safety ratios in question were positively correlated, with bearing capacity being subjected to higher degree of uncertainty. The degree of correlation was found to have an important effect on the system probability of failure. Considering the width of the base as varying design parameter, the study also showed that first-order reliability bounds, which are often applied in practice, may lead to a noteworthy over- or under-estimation of the design.
