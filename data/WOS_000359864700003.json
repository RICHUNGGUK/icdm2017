This paper presents a distributed traffic simulation framework where traffic simulation and data processing are performed in a distributed fashion by mobile computing. In this framework, communication middleware and traffic simulation are integrated to manage the distributed network to synchronize traffic predictions among logical processes using a rollback-based optimistic synchronization protocol. The traffic predictions across the multiple logical processes are coordinated by optimistic execution inspired by Time Warp which mitigates the synchronization problem allowing each logical process to execute asynchronously. Invalidated estimates are updated quickly by this mechanism to ensure more robust and reliable estimates. This framework allows each mobile computing based in-vehicle simulation to model a small portion of the overall network and provide detailed traffic state information. Such a system could provide both more up-to-date and robust predictions than that offered by centralized simulations within a single transportation management center. As these systems evolve, the mobile computing online traffic predictions can be used in surface transportation management and travelers will benefit from more accurate and reliable traffic forecast.", "paper_title": "Mobile computing traffic simulation framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700003"}
