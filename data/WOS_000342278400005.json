This paper compares three different structural fault diagnosis techniques, two from the DX community and one from the FDI community. To simplify our comparison, we start with bond graphs as the common system modeling language and develop a graph-based framework using temporal causal graphs as the basis for analyzing the three fault isolation approaches. This framework allows for systematic comparison of the diagnosability properties of the three algorithms. The three-tank system is used as a running example to illustrate our concepts and algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Common Framework for Compilation Techniques Applied to Diagnosis of Linear Dynamic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278400005"}
