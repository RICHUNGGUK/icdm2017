Their knowledge is generally based on the measurements of system variables and on the physico-chemical models of the process. Nevertheless, this information is imprecise because of process and measurement noise. So, the research ways aim at developing new and more powerful techniques for the detection of process fault. This article presents a method for the fault detection based on the comparison between the reference model evolution and the real system generated by the extended Kalman filter. The reference model is simulated by the dynamic hybrid simulator, PrODHyS. It is a general object-oriented environment which provides common and reusable components designed for the development and the management of dynamic simulation of industrial systems. The use of this method is illustrated through a didactic example relating to the field of Chemical Process System Engineering. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
