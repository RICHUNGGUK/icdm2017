With the advent of cloud computing, more and more web services in cloud may provide the same function but differ in performance. In addition, the development of cloud computing presents a geographically distributed manner, which elevates the impact of the network on the QoS of composited web services. Therefore, a significant research problem in service composition is how to select the best candidate service from a set of functionally equivalent services in terms of a service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we propose a composition model that takes both QoS of services and cloud network environment into consideration. We also propose a web service composition approach based on genetic algorithm for geo-distributed cloud and service providers who want to minimize the SLA violations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
