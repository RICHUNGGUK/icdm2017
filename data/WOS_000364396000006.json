We find that in nearly half of those studied, use of this latent communication channel expands total expression channel capacity. A method is described that detects tension in auricular muscles, which is used to signify intent. This intent signal is then transmitted on the person's visual attention vector to select, activate, and control objects in an environment.", "paper_title": "Auricular Tensing for Indication of Intent on a Visual Selection Vector", "paper_id": "WOS:000364396000006"}
