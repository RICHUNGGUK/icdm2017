The single objective RAP is to select the proper combination and redundancy levels of components to meet system level constraints, and to optimize the specified objective function. In practice, the need to consider two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously increases nowadays in order to assure managers or designers' demand. Amongst all system level objectives, maximizing system reliability is the most studied and important one, while system weight or system cost minimization are two other popular objectives to consider. According to the authors' experience, VNS has successfully solved the single objective RAP (Liang and Chen, Reliab. Eng. Syst. Saf. 92:323-331, 2007; Liang et al., IMA J. Manag. Math. 18:135-155, 2007). Therefore, this study aims at extending the single objective VNS algorithm to a multiple objective version for solving multiple objective redundancy allocation problems. A new selection strategy of base solutions that balances the intensity and diversity of the approximated Pareto front is introduced. The performance of the proposed multi-objective VNS algorithm (MOVNS) is verified by testing on three sets of complex instances with 5, 14 and 14 subsystems respectively. While comparing to the leading heuristics in the literature, the results show that MOVNS is able to generate more non-dominated solutions in a very efficient manner, and performs competitively in all performance measure categories. In other words, computational results reveal the advantages and benefits of VNS on solving multi-objective RAP.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective redundancy allocation optimization using a variable neighborhood search algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000276908400013"}
