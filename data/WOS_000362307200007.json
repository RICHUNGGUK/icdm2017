First, two lemmas are obtained to demonstrate how to design the observer. Then, based on the non-quadratic Lyapunov function, a new method is proposed to locally stabilize the T-S fuzzy system. The new method can be applied to any T-S models no matter whether the rules are even or odd. Naturally, the new method is extended to get some LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) to design the observer. For practical reason, the disturbances considered in this paper are bounded by magnitude and energy. Finally, three examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
