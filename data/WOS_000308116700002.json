The approximation is that, when n of the M queues are non-empty, the (transmission) attempt probability of each of the n non-empty nodes is given by the long-term (transmission) attempt probability of n saturated nodes. With the arrival of packets into the M queues according to independent Poisson processes, the SDAR approximation reduces a single cell with non-saturated nodes to a Markovian coupled queueing system. We provide a sufficient condition under which the joint queue length Markov chain is positive recurrent. For the symmetric case of equal arrival rates and finite and equal buffers, we develop an iterative method which leads to accurate predictions for important performance measures such as collision probability, throughput and mean packet delay. We replace the MAC layer with the SDAR model of contention by modifying the NS-2 source code pertaining to the MAC layer, keeping all other layers unchanged. By this model-based simulation technique at the MAC layer, we achieve speed-ups (w.r.t. MAC layer operations) up to 5.4. Through extensive model-based simulations and numerical results, we show that the SDAR model is an accurate model for the DCF MAC protocol in single cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
