Group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of items into pools. Each pool is then tested to identify the defective items, which are usually assumed to be sparse. We consider nonadaptive randomly pooling measurements, where pools are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. We also consider a model where noisy measurements allow for both some false negative and some false positive test outcomes (and also allow for asymmetric noise, and activation noise). We consider three classes of algorithms for the group testing problem (we call them specifically the coupon collector algorithm, the column matching algorithms, and the LP decoding algorithms-the last two classes of algorithms (versions of some of which had been considered before in the literature) were inspired by corresponding algorithms in the compressive sensing literature. The second and third of these algorithms have several flavors, dealing separately with the noiseless and noisy measurement scenarios. Our contribution is novel analysis to derive explicit sample-complexity bounds-with all constants expressly computed-for these algorithms as a function of the desired error probability, the noise parameters, the number of items, and the size of the defective set (or an upper bound on it). We also compare the bounds to information-theoretic lower bounds for sample complexity based on Fano's inequality and show that the upper and lower bounds are equal up to an explicitly computable universal constant factor (independent of problem parameters).", "paper_title": "Non-adaptive Group Testing: Explicit Bounds and Novel Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900039"}
