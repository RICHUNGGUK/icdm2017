In the multi-companding procedure, the nonlinear companding algorithm is developed to control the error distribution continuously, while the adaptive scheme is employed to reduce the number of used wavelets. Consequently, the proposed multi-companding algorithm can not only modify the modeling error distribution continuously but also decrease the number of basis functions efficiently. Moreover, the companding function generation is automatic and can be applied for the behavioral modeling of any analog circuits.", "paper_title": "Analog behavioral modeling by multi-companding and wavelet collocation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241604600008"}
