Maintaining these indexes up-to-date is an essential task to ensure the quality of search results. However, changes in web pages are unpredictable. Identifying the moment when a web page changes as soon as possible and with minimal computational cost is a major challenge. In this article we present the Web Change Detection system that, in a best case scenario, is capable to detect, almost in real time, when a web page changes. In a worst case scenario, it will require, on average, 12 minutes to detect a change on a low PageRank web site and about one minute on a web site with high PageRank. Meanwhile, current search engines require more than a day, on average, to detect a modification in a web page (in both cases).", "paper_title": "Distributed and Collaborative Web Change Detection System", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158200005"}
