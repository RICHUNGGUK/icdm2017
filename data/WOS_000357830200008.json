All the features are extracted from normalized left and right hand images. Fusion is applied at feature and also at decision level. Two probability-based algorithms are proposed for classification. The first algorithm computes the maximum probability for nearest three neighbors. The second algorithm determines the maximum probability of the number of matched features with respect to a thresholding on distances. Based on these two highest probabilities initial decisions are made. The final decision is considered according to the highest probability as calculated by the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Depending on the various combinations of the initial decisions, three schemes are experimented with 201 subjects for identification and verification. The correct identification rate is found to be 99.5%, and the false acceptance rate ( FAR) of 0.625% has been found during verification.", "paper_title": "Fusion-Based Hand Geometry Recognition Using Dempster-Shafer Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000357830200008"}
