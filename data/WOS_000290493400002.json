The main challenge lies in the fact that the channel allocation problem is NP-complete. Because of a maximum allowable time limit imposed in practical situations for allocation of channels, sometimes we may need to be satisfied with a near-optimal solution. In this correspondence, we present a discussion on the various challenges and approaches that have been used by different researchers to solve the problem of channel allocation taking into account different interference issues and efficient utilization of available communication channels for cellular mobile (including multimedia communication) environment and cognitive radio based networks.
