In this work, together with the later improved version [2], the drawbacks of the particle correction procedure in the original particle level set method were investigated in detail and an optimized particle correction procedure was developed to improve the accuracy and robustness of the implicitly represented moving interface. A refined grid point level set value selection process has been proposed and shown to effectively improve the interface location accuracy through a set of standard advection test cases when using a fast first order accurate semi-Lagrangian solver firstly proposed in [3]. With the implementation of our enhanced level set value selection procedure during the particle correction stage, it was observed that the particle reseeding was not required, which allowed for faster runtime performance of the fast particle level set method without compromising interface position accuracy.
