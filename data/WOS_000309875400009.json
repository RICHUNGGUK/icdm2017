The analysis of eye blinks provides reliable information about drowsiness. This paper proposes to study the relation between electrooculogram (EOG) and video analysis for blink detection and characterization. An original method to detect and characterize blinks from a video analysis is presented here. The method uses different filters based on the human retina modelling. A illumination robust filter is first used to normalize illumination variations of the video input. Then, Outer and an Inner Plexiform Layer filters are used to extract energy signals from eye area. The eye detection is processed mixing gradient and projection methods which makes it able to detect even closed eyes. The illumination robust filter makes it possible to detect the eyes even in night conditions, without using external lighting. The video analysis extracts two signals from the eye area measuring the quantity of static edges and moving edges. Blinks are then detected and characterized from these two signals. A comparison between the features extracted from the EOG and the same features extracted from the video analysis is then performed on a database of 14 different people. This study shows that some blink features extracted from the video are highly correlated with their EOG equivalent: the duration, the duration at 50%, the frequency, the percentage of eye closure at 80% and the amplitude velocity ratio. The frame rate influence on the accuracy of the different features extracted is also studied and enlightens on the need of a high frame rate camera to detect and characterize accurately blinks from a video analysis.", "paper_title": "Using retina modelling to characterize blinking: comparison between EOG and video analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000309875400009"}
