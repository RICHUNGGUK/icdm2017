We target higher portability, flexibility, and performance of the prospective design solutions by means of a strictly architectural approach. Our proposal to improve overall system performance is twofold. First, we provide architectural mechanisms to accelerate applications by supporting computationally intensive kernels with reconfigurable hardware accelerators. Second, we propose an infrastructure capable of facilitating thread management. Besides the architectural and microarchitectural extensions of the reconfigurable computing system, we also propose a hierarchical programming model. The model supports balanced and performance efficient SW/HW co-execution of multithreading applications. We demonstrate that our approach provides better performance-portability and performance-flexibility trade-off characteristics compared to other state-of-the-art proposals. The experimental results, based on real applications, suggest average system speedups between 1.2 and 19.6. Based on singlethreaded synthetic benchmark, we achieve average speedup between 8.5 and 129. For multithreaded synthetic benchmark, the achieved average speedup is between 1.3 and 7.3.
