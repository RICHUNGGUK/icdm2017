However, there is still an insufficiency in ABC regarding its solution search equation, which is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. Inspired by differential evolution (DE), we propose an improved solution search equation, which is based on that the bee searches only around the best solution of the previous iteration to improve the exploitation. Then, in order to make full use of and balance the exploration of the solution search equation of ABC and the exploitation of the proposed solution search equation, we introduce a selective probability P and get the new search mechanism. In addition, to enhance the global convergence, when producing the initial population, both chaotic systems and opposition-based learning methods are employed. The new search mechanism together with the proposed initialization makes up the modified ABC (MABC for short), which excludes the probabilistic selection scheme and scout bee phase. Experiments are conducted on a set of 28 benchmark functions. The results demonstrate good performance of MABC in solving complex numerical optimization problems when compared with two ABC-based algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
