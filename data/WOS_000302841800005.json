The definition of section geometry and material properties can be unconditionally complex, based on an object-oriented implementation. Stress integration is performed using a Green path integral, with an adaptive strain-mapped Gaussian sampling. Derivative-free solution strategies for the calculation of incremental and ultimate response are applied. Results are presented in the form of moment-curvature curves, ultimate strength interaction curves and 3D failure surfaces. The performance of the methodology is demonstrated through various case studies, comparisons and benchmarks. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
