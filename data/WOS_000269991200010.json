This configuration is investigated by feasibility studies based on the assumption of maximal separation and is compared with the traditional batch rectifier (BR). We study the configurations also by dynamic simulation based on a detailed model using a professional simulator. For the new configuration the minimal duration of the process is determined. The influence of the most important operational parameters is studied. The calculations and the simulations are performed for a binary (n-butanol-water) and for a ternary heteroazeotropic mixture (isopropanol-water + benzene as entrainer). One of the advantages of the DCS is that distillation of binary and ternary systems is performed in only one step. Furthermore the recovery of components is usually higher and the amount of byproducts is lower. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
