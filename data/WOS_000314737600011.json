It will observe all objects in the sky in the visible magnitude range from 6 to 20, up to approximately 10(9) sources. An international scientific consortium, the Gala Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (Gaia DPAC), has organized itself in several coordination units, with the aim, among others, of addressing the work of classifying the observed astronomical sources, using both supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms. This work focuses on the analysis of classification outliers by means of unsupervised classification. We present a novel method to combine SOMs trained with independent features that are calculated from spectrophotometry. The method as described here can help to improve the models used for the supervised classification of astronomical sources. Furthermore, it allows for data exploration and knowledge discovery in huge astronomical databases such as the upcoming Gaia mission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
