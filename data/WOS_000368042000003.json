They are perceived as a vast source of information about their users. Variety of different methods and techniques has been proposed to analyze these networks in order to extract valuable information about the users - things they do and like/dislike. A lot of effort is put into improvement of analytical methods in order to grasp a more accurate and detailed image of users. Such information would have an impact on many aspects of everyday life of people - from politics, via professional life, to shopping and entertainment. The theory of fuzzy sets and systems, introduced in 1965, has the ability to handle imprecise and ambiguous information, and to cope with linguistic terms. The theory has evolved into such areas like possibility theory and computing with words. It is very suitable for processing data in a human-like way, and providing the results in a human-oriented manner. The paper presents a short survey of works that use fuzzy-based technologies for analysis of social networks. We pose an idea that fuzzy-based techniques allow for introduction of human-centric and human-like data analysis processes. We include here detailed descriptions of a few target areas of social network analysis that could benefit from applications of fuzzy sets and systems methods.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Based Techniques in Human-Like Processing of Social Network Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000368042000003"}
