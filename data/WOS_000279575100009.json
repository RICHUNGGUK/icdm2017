Some of the intrinsic characteristics of medical databases, such as the huge volume and imbalanced samples as well as stringent performance standards, make this mining process particularly challenging. By elaborating various challenges existing in Task 1 of KDD Cup 2008 competition, this paper analyzes some potential solutions to these problems and presents a modified boosted tree as the final classification model. This model ranked the fourth among all the solutions to Task 1. We hope that our analysis and solutions to these challenges would contribute to the development of medical data mining applications.", "paper_title": "Detecting malignant patients via modified boosted tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000279575100009"}
