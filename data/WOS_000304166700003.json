It also regulates the memory requirements for an encoder design enabling regular, symmetrical hardware implementations. This paper presents a series of new enhancements to existing techniques for determining the best SW-length within a rate-distortion (RD) framework, and analyses the nexus between SW-length and storage for ORD hardware realizations. In addition, it presents an efficient bit-allocation strategy for managing multiple shapes together with a generalized adaptive SW scheme which integrates localized curvature information (cornerity) on contour points with a bi-directional spatial distance, to afford a superior and more pragmatic SW design compared with existing adaptive SW solutions which are based on only cornerity values. Experimental results consistently corroborate the effectiveness of these new strategies.", "paper_title": "Sliding-Window Designs for Vertex-Based Shape Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000304166700003"}
