Yet, theoretical attempts to understand the dynamics behind shaping these inequalities are scarce. This study draws upon the extent literature on digital divide and explains how the four different access gaps (motivational, material, skills, and usage) interact and contribute to digital divide. Revealed causal mapping (RCM) is utilised to analyse the data collected from eight same-gender focus groups in four primary schools located in Iran. The revealed causal map demonstrates the interaction and linkages between different access gaps. The findings provide a theoretical account of the dynamics behind shaping digital divide and generate insights into extending the concepts of access gaps. We establish a theoretical model that places an emphasis on the centrality of motivational-related factors such as 'lack of interest in IT-related things' and 'lack of motivation to learn recent technology' as well as skills-related factors such as 'operating skills', 'anti-filtering skills', and 'lack of IT background'.", "paper_title": "How access gaps interact and shape digital divide: a cognitive investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000350300100002"}
