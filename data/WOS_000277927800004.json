For data transfer from a source node to the destination node, the algorithms can construct multiple dynamic paths by selecting some other nodes as data relays. The bandwidth available in different paths can be aggregated thus to significantly speed up the data transfer process. The proposed algorithms differ from each other in whether the global networking information should be considered. Experimental results indicate that both algorithms can provide efficient data transfer under various circumstances.", "paper_title": "Multi-path based Algorithms for Data Transfer in the Grid Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000277927800004"}
