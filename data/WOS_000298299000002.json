As well as being smart technologically speaking, a smart home should also never forget to retain the \"home nature\" when it is serving its users. In this paper, we first analyze the relationship among services, spaces, and users, and then we propose a framework as well as a corresponding algorithm to model their interaction relationship. Later, we also realize the human-system interaction framework to implement a smart home system and develop \"pervasive applications\" to demonstrate how to utilize our framework to fulfill the human-centric interaction requirement of a smart home. Finally, our preliminary evaluations show that our proposed work can enhance the performance of the human-system interaction in a smart home environment.", "paper_title": "Design and Realization of a Framework for Human-System Interaction in Smart Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000298299000002"}
