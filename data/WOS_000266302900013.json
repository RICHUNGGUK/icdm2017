Nowadays, more and more Security mechanisms, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS), are introduced to protect fire network from malicious attacks. This paper proposes air agent and service based intrusion detection and response system for active network. In contrast to a traditional passive network, an active network gives the nodes programmable ability to exercise various active network technologies. Tire intrusion response, service deployment, and service update mechanisms are centered on this technology. The proposed model of intrusion detection and response system (IDRS) catches network attacks and responses to stop the attacks at the first time to reduce the damage. Detecting, reporting, and responding capabilities arc all embedded and integrated in the proposed system. A prototype system is developed using a novel data mining technology (the support vector machine) to enhance the detection function. In addition, several experiments were conducted to verify the system and results showed that the system was able to effectively identify the intrusions and respond promptly. Experiments also showed that the Support vector machine out-performs the competitive neural networks in identifying the intrusions.", "paper_title": "Intrusion Detection Based on Active Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266302900013"}
