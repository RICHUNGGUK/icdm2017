Given two moving image regions in an image sequence we present an algorithm for determining if the two moving regions can be interpreted as a planar object and its cast shadow. Projective geometry and motion properties are employed to directly recover a homology that constrains point correspondences of the outlines of the image regions and determine if they obey an object/shadow relationship. This homology is derived directly from the motions of the regions and therefore is easier to accomplish than determining point-to-point correspondences between candidate object-shadow pairs. Several experiments under approximate point light source illumination are presented.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of planar objects and their shadows in motion sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000237122300003"}
