We introduce the notion of extended sensors and we show that the observation error decreases when the support of a sensor is widened. We also show that the observation error decreases when the number of sensors increases.", "paper_title": "REGIONAL OBSERVATION AND SENSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265706000001"}
