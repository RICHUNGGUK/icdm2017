Some of the messages exchanged by BnB-ADOPT turned out to be redundant. Removing most of the redundant messages increases substantially communication efficiency: the number of exchanged messages is -in most cases- at least three times fewer (keeping the other measures almost unchanged), and termination and optimality are maintained. On the other hand, handling n-ary cost functions was addressed in the original work, but the presence of thresholds makes their practical usage more complex. Both issues -removing most of the redundant messages and efficiently handling n-ary cost functions- can be combined, producing the new version BnB-ADOPT(+). Experimentally, we show the benefits of this version over the original one.", "paper_title": "Removing Redundant Messages in N-ary BnB-ADOPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000310799900001"}
