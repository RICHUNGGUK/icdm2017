Moreover delay constraints for safety applications add complexity and latency requirements to the design. Existing MAC protocols overcome some challenges however don't provide an integrated solution. Hence, the merit if this work lies in designing an efficient MAC protocol that incorporates various VANet's challenges in a complete end-to-end solution. In this work, we propose an efficient Multichannel QoS Cognitive MAC (MQOG). MQOG assesses the quality of channel prior to transmission employing dynamic channel allocation and negotiation algorithms to achieve significant increase in channel reliability, throughput and delay constraints while simultaneously addressing Quality of Service. The uniqueness of MQOG lies in making use of the free unlicensed bands. The proposed protocols were implemented in OMNET++ 4.1, and extensive experiments demonstrated a faster and more efficient reception of safety messages compared to existing VANet MAC Protocols. Finally, improvements in delay, packet delivery ratios and throughput were captured.", "paper_title": "A Multichannel QoS MAC with Dynamic Transmit Opportunity for VANets", "paper_id": "WOS:000328203300006"}
