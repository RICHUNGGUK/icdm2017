In this note a generalized algorithm is proposed for the Painleve test of nonlinear variable-coefficient PDEs. For the three steps of Painleve test, i.e. leading order analysis, resonance determination and verification of resonant conditions, the analysis of parametric constraints is similar to those of nonlinear PDEs with constant coefficients given in my previous work. The main difference lies in the coefficients of Laurent series should have proper dependence according to the types of variable coefficients. By this generalized algorithm, several important nonlinear variable-coefficient PDEs, including KdV equation, mKdV equation, KP equation, NLS equation and higher-order NLS equation are studied and, in addition to rederiving all known P-integrable conditions, some new P-integrable models are obtained with the assistance of Maple.
