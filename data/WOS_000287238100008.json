The article contains no formal security analysis, but a specific parameter choice has been considered. We describe a heuristic attack technique against the suggested instance, which for the published \"challenge value\" results in a complete session key recovery with only a minor computational effort.", "paper_title": "CRYPTANALYSIS OF A 2-PARTY KEY ESTABLISHMENT BASED ON A SEMIGROUP ACTION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000287238100008"}
