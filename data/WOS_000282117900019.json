Although the location map can be compressed by a lossless compression algorithm, this lowers embedding capacity and increases computational cost during the procedures of embedding and extracting. The study presents an adaptive reversible data scheme based on the prediction of difference expansion. Since each cover pixel generally resembles its surrounding pixels, most of the difference values between the cover pixels and their corresponding predictive pixels are small; therefore, the proposed scheme gains from embedding capacity by taking full advantage of the large quantities of smaller difference values where secret data can be embedded. The proposed scheme offers several advantages, namely, (1) the location map is no more required, (2) the embedding capacity can be adjusted depending on the practical applications, and (3) the high embedding capacity with minimal visual distortion can be achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields high embedding capacity by comparing the related schemes that are proposed recently. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
