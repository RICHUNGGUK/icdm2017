This paper proposed a face detection architecture, which could be adjusted by the user according to the background, the sensor resolution, the detection accuracy and speed in different situations. This user adjustable mode makes the reconfiguration simple and efficient, and is especially suitable for portable mobile terminals whose working condition often changes frequently. In addition, this architecture could work as an accelerator to constitute a larger and more powerful system integrated with other functional modules. Experimental results show that the reconfiguration of the architecture is very reasonable in face detection and synthesized report also indicates its advantage on little consumption of area and power.", "paper_title": "A High Speed Reconfigurable Face Detection Architecture Based on AdaBoost Cascade Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900011"}
