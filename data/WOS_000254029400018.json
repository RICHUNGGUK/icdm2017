Based on the Lyapunov functional method and Kronecker product properties, several sufficient conditions are established to ensure global exponential synchronization based on the design of the coupling matrices, the inner linking matrices, and/or some free matrices representing the relationships between the system matrices. The conditions are expressed within the framework of linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily computed by the interior-point method. In addition, a typical chaotic cellular neural network is used as the node in the array to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Global synchronization in an array of delayed neural networks with hybrid coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029400018"}
