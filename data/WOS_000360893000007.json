Security and privacy concerns are major obstacles for V2G networks to be extensively deployed. In 2011, Yang et al. proposed a very interesting privacy-preserving communication and precise reward architecture for V2G networks in smart grids. In this paper, we enhance Yang et al.'s framework with the formal definitions of unforgeability and restrictiveness. Then, we propose a new traceable privacy-preserving communication and precise reward scheme with available cryptographic primitives. The proposed scheme is formally proven secure with well-established assumptions in the random oracle model. Thorough theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and practical for secure V2G networks in smart grids.", "paper_title": "TPP: Traceable Privacy-Preserving Communication and Precise Reward for Vehicle-to-Grid Networks in Smart Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000360893000007"}
