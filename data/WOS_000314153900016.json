These solutions present a structural instability which make difficult to approximate their evolution in long time intervals with enough accuracy. The standard numerical methods do not guarantee the convergence to the proper solution of the initial value problem and often fail by approaching solutions associated to different initial conditions. In this frame the numerical schemes that preserve the discrete invariants related to some conservation laws of this equation produce better results than the methods which only take care of a high consistency order. Pseudospectral spatial discretization appear as the most robust of the numerical methods, but finite difference schemes are useful in order to analyze the rule played by the conservation of the invariants in the convergence.
