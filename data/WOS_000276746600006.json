In this paper we present some interesting notes on this optimal workpiece setup problem. These notes show that (1) The greedy algorithm proposed in Comput. Aided Des. 35 (2003), pp. 1269-1285 for the optimal workpiece setup problem has the performance ratio bounded by O(ln n - ln ln n+0.78), where n is the number of spherical polygons in the ground set; (2) In addition to greedy heuristic, linear programming can also be used as a near-optimal approximation solution; (3) The performance ratio by linear programming is shown to be tighter than that of greedy heuristic in some cases.", "paper_title": "Some notes on maximal arc intersection of spherical polygons: its NP-hardness and approximation algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746600006"}
