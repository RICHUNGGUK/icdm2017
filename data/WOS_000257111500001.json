We ask whether it is possible to transmit this information reliably when a fraction of the transmitted codeword is corrupted by arbitrary gross errors, and when in addition, all the entries of the codeword are contaminated by smaller errors (e.g., quantization errors). We show that if one encodes the information as Ax where A is an element of R-m x n (m >= n) is a suitable coding matrix, there are two decoding schemes that allow the recovery of the block of n pieces of information x with nearly the same accuracy as if no gross errors occurred upon transmission (or equivalently as if one had an oracle supplying perfect information about the sites and amplitudes of the gross errors). Moreover, both decoding strategies are very concrete and only involve solving simple convex optimization programs, either a linear program or a second-order cone program. We complement our study with numerical simulations showing that the encoder/decoder pair performs remarkably well.", "paper_title": "Highly robust error correction by convex programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500001"}
