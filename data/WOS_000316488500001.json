Signcryption is the proper primitive to do this. However, existing signcryption schemes are heavyweight and not suitable for resource-limited sensors. In this paper, we at first propose a braid-based signcryption scheme and then develop a key establishment protocol for wireless sensor networks. From the complexity view, our proposal is 2(15) times faster than RSA-based ones. As far as we know, our proposal is the first signcryption scheme based on noncommutative algebraic structures.", "paper_title": "Noncommutative Lightweight Signcryption for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316488500001"}
