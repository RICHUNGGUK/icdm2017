The proposed signaling combines the half-rate clock to the common mode of the differential data with its mixing phase off by 0.5 UI. Two transceivers with resistive-load and inductive-load receivers are implemented in 130-nm CMOS technology to verify their feasibility for use as serial links. The prototype transceivers achieve a wide operating frequency range 2.25-6 and 5.6-8 Gb/s, respectively, satisfying bit error rate of < 10(-12) measured at Tx-Rx linked configuration by 5-in-long FR4 trace with 2(31) -1 PRBS. The power efficiencies of transceivers at maximum data rates are 6.4 and 4.6 mW/Gb/s, respectively.", "paper_title": "Half-Rate Clock-Embedded Source Synchronous Transceivers in 130-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100005"}
