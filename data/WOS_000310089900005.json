The proposed method employs a model-based approach in which (1) each trajectory (position and velocity) is modelled using a hidden Markov model (HMM), and (2) the distance between two trajectories is computed as the probabilistic similarity between HMMs, by means of the probability product kernel. Experiments on a set of real traffic video sequences reveal very good results of the proposed approach, outperforming two non-trivial baselines. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this approach is novel for trajectory grouping in traffic videos.", "paper_title": "Trajectory clustering in CCTV traffic videos using probability product kernels with hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000310089900005"}
