Solid models in this framework are represented by an extension of the ray representation Layered Depth-Normal Images (LDNI), which inherits the good properties of Boolean simplicity, localization and domain decoupling. The defect of ray representation in computational intensity has been overcome by the newly developed parallel algorithms running on the graphics hardware equipped with Graphics Processing Unit (CPU). The LDNI for a solid model whose boundary is represented by a closed polygonal mesh can be generated efficiently with the help of hardware accelerated sampling. The parallel algorithm for computing Boolean operations on two LDNI solids runs well on modern graphics hardware. A parallel algorithm is also introduced in this paper to convert LDNI solids to sharp-feature preserved polygonal mesh surfaces, which can be used in downstream applications (e.g., finite element analysis). Different from those GPU-based techniques for rendering CSG-tree of solid models Hable and Rossignac (2007, 2005) [1,2], we compute and store the shape of objects in solid modeling completely on graphics hardware. This greatly eliminates the communication bottleneck between the graphics memory and the main memory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
