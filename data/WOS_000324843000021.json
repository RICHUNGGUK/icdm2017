These routings use greedy modes or forwarding paths to forward packets. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular network such as frequently changed topology, vehicles density and radio obstacles, could create local maximum, sparse connectivity and network partitions. We propose GeoSVR, a geographic stateless routing combined with node location and digital map. The proposed GeoSVR scheme enhances forwarding path to solve local maximum and sparse connectivity problem, and the proposed restricted forwarding algorithm overcomes unreliable wireless channel issues. In our study, simulations and real world experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solution. Our results show GeoSVR can provide higher packet delivery ratio with comparable latency to other geographic routing schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
