This paper explores the benefits of Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Vary-On Vary-Off (VOVO) for energy management in multi-tier data centers. Unlike previous work, which addressed the DVFS and VOVO separately. In this paper, an optimization problem is formulated to achieve energy benefits while maintaining performance in multi-tier data centers. DVFS and VOVO technology are combined to yield an optimal energy management strategy. From a user's perspective, only the end-to-end delay across the entire data center is relevant. The proposed optimization method offers controllable and predictable quantitative control of energy consumption with theoretically guaranteed end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Dynamic Server Provisioning and Frequency Adjustment in Multi-Tier Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600008"}
