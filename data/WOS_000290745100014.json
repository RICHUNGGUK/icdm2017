Specifically, a new method is proposed to improve the robustness by removing outliers based on a filtering approach. In addition, this work also proposes a method to divide the 3D points in to several buckets for applying the sparse bundle adjustment algorithm (SBA) individually, removing the outliers and finally merging them. The residuals are used to filter potential outliers to reduce the re-projection error used as the performance evaluation of refinement. In our experiments, the original mean re-projection error is about 47.6. After applying the proposed methods, the mean error is reduced to 2.13. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
