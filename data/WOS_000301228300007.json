The first variant improves every node in each step maximizing the current valuation locally, whereas the second variant computes the globally optimal improvement in each step. We outline families of games on which both variants require exponentially many strategy iterations.", "paper_title": "EXPONENTIAL LOWER BOUND FOR THE LATEST DETERMINISTIC STRATEGY ITERATION ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301228300007"}
