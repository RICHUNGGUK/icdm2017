Wireless communication plays a continual key role in future ubiquitous network where all devices need to be connected freely. Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is a new method of short-range wireless technology which is suit for ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we provided the potentials of impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) technology in ubiquitous computing environments. Our study investigated possible communication methods which can be used in ubiquitous network. Comparisons between different communication technologies demonstrated that UWB-based solutions can support identification, location, sensing, and connectivity. In addition, we proposed two typical schemes which show how IR-UWB is used in ubiquitous computing.", "paper_title": "Potentials of IR-UWB technology for ubiquitous computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000286002100009"}
