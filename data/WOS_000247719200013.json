The brain has the ability through the so-called adaptive control to progressively decrease the motor errors despite visual image alteration. Adaptive control in both the visuo-manual and the vestibulo-ocular systems is reviewed. A parallel is tentatively made between adaptation to ordinary optical alterations (resulting from the use of refraction-corrective glasses) in the visual mapping of these two systems and the adaptation to more complex visuo-motor relationships experienced by people working in virtual environments.
