Froude number is the most basic parameter in the case of the alluvial channel, thus effect of Froude number on resistance to flow should be considered in the formulation of the friction factor, which is not in the case of present available resistance equations. At present, no generally acceptable quantitative description of the effects of the Froude number on hydraulic resistance has been developed. Metamodeling technique, which is particularly useful in modeling a complex processes or where knowledge of the physics is limited, is presented as a tool complimentary to modeling friction factor in alluvial channels. Present work uses, a radial basis metamodel, which is a type of neural network modeling, to find the effect of Froude number on the flow resistance. Based on the experimental data taken from different sources, it has been found that the predicting capability of the present model is on acceptable level. Present work also tries in formulating an empirical equation for resistance in alluvial channel comprising all the three major parameters, namely, roughness parameter, Froude number and Reynolds number.
