In mathematical terms, such distortion can be described as the cumulative effect of a blurring kernel and a time-dependent deformation of the image domain. We introduce a statistical dynamic model for the generation of turbulence based on linear dynamical systems (LDS). We expand the model to include the unknown image as part of the unobserved state and apply Kalman filtering to estimate such state. This operation yields a blurry image where the blurring kernel is effectively isoplanatic. Applying blind nonlocal Total Variation (NL-TV) deconvolution yields a sharp final result.", "paper_title": "A Linear Systems Approach to Imaging Through Turbulence", "paper_id": "WOS:000329234700014"}
