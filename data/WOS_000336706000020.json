We show that even with the introduction of the sum-of-logarithm-processing-times based deterioration to job processing times, single machine makespan minimization problem remain polynomially solvable. But for the total completion time minimization problem, we show that the optimal schedule is not always V-shaped with respect to job normal processing times. Heuristic algorithms and computational results are presented for the total completion time minimization problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
