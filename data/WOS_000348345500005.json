This lets the tracker specialize in both rigid and deformable objects on-line and with no prior assumptions. We provide a probabilistic model of the target variations over time. We then rigorously show that this model is a special case of the Earth Mover's Distance optimization problem where the ground distance is governed by some underlying noise model. This noise model has several parameters that control the cost of moving pixels and changing their color. We develop two such noise models and demonstrate how their parameters can be estimated on-line during tracking to account for the amount of local (dis) order in the target. We also discuss the significance of this on-line parameter update and demonstrate its contribution to the performance. Finally we show LOT's tracking capabilities on challenging video sequences, both commonly used and new, displaying performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Locally Orderless Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000348345500005"}
