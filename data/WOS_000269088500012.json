Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) studies suggest that both steric and electrostatic interactions contribute to the compounds' binding affinity, with the major contribution arising from hydrophobic interactions. The models show excellent correlation and high predictive power even evaluated by the most stringent criteria for a QSAR model. The results of this work demonstrate that structure-based design methods (such as docking) cultivate the development of reliable QSAR models; they also illustrate the utility of this procedure in design of new potent caspase-3 ligands.", "paper_title": "Docking and 3D-QSAR Studies on Isatin Sulfonamide Analogues as Caspase-3 Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000269088500012"}
