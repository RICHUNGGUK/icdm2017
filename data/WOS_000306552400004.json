In this work, we deal with its decision version in the framework of tissue P systems. A tissue P system with cell division is a computing model which has two types of rules: communication and division rules. The ability of cell division allows us to obtain an exponential amount of cells in linear time and to design cellular solutions to computationally hard problems in polynomial time. We here present an effective solution to Common Algorithmic Decision Problem by using a family of recognizer tissue P systems with cell division. Furthermore, a formal verification of this solution is given.", "paper_title": "Solving Common Algorithmic Problem by Recognizer Tissue P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306552400004"}
