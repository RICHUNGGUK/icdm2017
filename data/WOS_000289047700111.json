Then, we consider its global convergence under the elitist preserving strategy using the Markov chain theory and analyze its performance through three examples from different aspects. The results indicate that the new algorithm possesses several advantages such as better convergence and less chance of being trapped into premature states. As a result, it can be widely applied to many large-scale optimization problems which require higher accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
