Firstly, a faster approach for reconstructing corrupted pixels is proposed by applying a processing-circle instead of a processing-square. It is shown that the obtained quality of the reconstructed image is no worse because of this. The quality of the reconstruction is further improved by controlling the pixel corrupting process within the input image. It is shown that a combination of the processing-circle approach and data-dependent corruption reduces the reconstruction time, and the mistakes of the reconstructed pixels.", "paper_title": "Efficient Reconstruction of Images with Deliberately Corrupted Pixels", "paper_id": "WOS:000302509500003"}
