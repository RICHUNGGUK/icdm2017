It is shown that, for a unital quantale L, both formal concept lattices and property oriented concept lattices are functorial from the category L-Ctx of L-contexts and infomorphisms to the category L-Sup of complete L-lattices and suprema-preserving maps. Moreover, the formal concept lattice functor can be written as the composition of a right adjoint functor from L-Ctx to the category L-Cls of L-closure spaces and continuous functions and a left adjoint functor from L-Cls to L-Sup.
