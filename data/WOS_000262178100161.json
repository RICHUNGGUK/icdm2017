This paper describes modal and deontic extensions of defeasible logic, motivated by potential applications for modelling multi-agent systems and policies. It describes a logic metaprogram that captures the underlying intuitions, and outlines an implemented system. Finally, it demonstrates its use for modelling policies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
