In this study, a competitively boundary error sorting (CBES) scheme, in which the separate side match errors at two boundaries are competitively sorted, is proposed to design a better next-state function for SMVQs. The simulation results show that the coding performance and, especially, the visual quality can be improved for the images with strong edges.", "paper_title": "Competitively boundary error sorting scheme for improving side match vector quantizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776000019"}
