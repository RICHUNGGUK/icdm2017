Currently used P2P computing systems (e.g., BOINC) are most often centrally managed, i.e., the final result of computations is created at a central node using partial results - what may be not efficient in the case when numerous participants are willing to download the final result. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to P2P computing systems. We assume that results can be delivered to all peers in a distributed way using three types of network flows: unicast, Peer-to-Peer and anycast. We describe our concept of the system architecture with a special focus on the decision strategies developed for system participants. Using our discrete realtime simulator we evaluate the proposed strategies in various scenarios and present a comprehensive analysis of obtained results. According to obtained results, the Peer-to-Peer flow provides lower operational cost of the computing system compared to unicast and anycast flows. Moreover, an appropriate selection of decision strategy can significantly reduce the operational cost.", "paper_title": "Decision Strategies for a P2P Computing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000304354400002"}
