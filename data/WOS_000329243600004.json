Examples have been provided on the quality of video applications ranging from popular entertainment to new trends such as applications in wide-reaching public systems, not just those used by security forces but also for medical purposes. In particular, two typical usages of task-based video: surveillance video for accurate licence plate recognition, and medical video for credible diagnosis prior to bronchoscopic surgery were introduced by the author. The problem of task-based video quality assessment starting from subjective psychophysiological experiments to objective quality models is discussed. Example test results and models are provided alongside to the descriptions. Finally, a quality optimisation approach, driven by recognition rates is presented.", "paper_title": "Optimising task-based video quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000329243600004"}
