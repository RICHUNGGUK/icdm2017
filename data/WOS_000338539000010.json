The information on the graph is given online. As the exploration proceeds, searchers gain more information on the graph. Assuming an appropriate communication model among searchers, searchers can share the information about the environment. Thus, a searcher must decide which vertex to visit next based on the partial information on the graph gained so far by searchers. We assume that all searchers initially start the exploration at the origin vertex, and the goal is that each vertex is visited by at least one searcher and all searchers finally return to the origin vertex. The objective is to minimize the time when the goal is achieved. We study the case of cycles and trees. For the former, we give an optimal online exploration algorithm in terms of competitive ratio, and for the latter, we also give an online exploration algorithm which is optimal among greedy algorithms.", "paper_title": "Online graph exploration algorithms for cycles and trees by multiple searchers", "paper_id": "WOS:000338539000010"}
