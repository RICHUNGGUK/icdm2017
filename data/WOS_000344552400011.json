In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm for time-invariant DMREs that uses a piecewise-linearized approach based on the Pad, approximation of the matrix exponential. The algorithm designed is based upon intensive use of matrix products and linear system solutions so we can seize the large computational capability that modern graphics processing units (GPUs) have on these types of operations using CUBLAS and CULATOOLS libraries (general purpose GPU), which are efficient implementations of BLAS and LAPACK libraries, respectively, for NVIDIA GPUs. A thorough analysis showed that some parts of the algorithm proposed can be carried out in parallel, thus allowing to leverage the two GPUs available in many current compute nodes. Besides, our algorithm can be used by any interested researcher through a friendly MATLAB interface.", "paper_title": "Solving time-invariant differential matrix Riccati equations using GPGPU computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400011"}
