Two cases are considered that are the system without a leader and the one with a leader. New linear control protocols are introduced to make second-order multi-agent systems consensus. By applying the Lyapunov function method and the graph theory, some sufficient conditions for consensus of positions and velocities are derived. Finally, two simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Consensus of second-order multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics and time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200021"}
