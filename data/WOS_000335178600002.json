The proposed protocol employs a sliding window mechanism, where the server needs to store only the tag's old and new adjacent eigenvalues for tag matching and authentication. The eigenvalue window moves forward just one step every time when the secret update is done successfully, and this leads to lower storage, better performance and higher security compared to the previously proposed RFID pseudonym protocol P-1 and secret update protocol P-2. Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can resynchronise when suffering continuous desynchronising attacks.", "paper_title": "Scalable and resynchronisable radio frequency identification ownership transfer protocol based on a sliding window mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000335178600002"}
