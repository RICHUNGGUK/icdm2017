Decision making for a complex situation often needs a team to work cooperatively to get consensus awareness for the situation. Team SA is characterized including information sharing, opinion integration and consensus SA generation. In the meantime, various uncertainties are involved in team SA during information collection and awareness generation. Also, the collaboration between team members may be across distances and need web-based technology to facilitate. This paper presents a web-based fuzzy group decision support system (WFGDSS) and demonstrates how this system can provide a means of support for generating team SA in a distributed team work context with the ability of handling uncertain information.", "paper_title": "TEAM SITUATION AWARENESS USING WEB-BASED FUZZY GROUP DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143400005"}
