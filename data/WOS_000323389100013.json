Theoretical contributions to knowledge organization and decision making are stressed. We chose to work with a type of methodology known as multiple criteria decision making-Saaty's analytical hierarchies process (AHP). This made it possible to develop a detailed analysis of the decision-making process and arrive at a hierarchical model. The model provided a structure representing the studied field, where an order of priority could be given to the decision-making process. The knowledge derived may be used in other fields of study such as information retrieval and knowledge representation.", "paper_title": "Saaty's analytic hierarchies method for knowledge organization in decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000323389100013"}
