The key technical ingredient is a new extremal inequality. It is shown that the lower bound coincides with the Berger-Tung upper bound in the high-resolution regime. Similar results are derived for the direct vector Gaussian two-terminal source coding problem.", "paper_title": "Vector Gaussian Two-Terminal Source Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800030"}
