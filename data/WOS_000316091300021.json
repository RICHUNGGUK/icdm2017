As one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, Max-Cut has attracted considerable attention over the last decades. In this paper, we present Breakout Local Search (BLS) for Max-Cut. BLS explores the search space by a joint use of local search and adaptive perturbation strategies. The proposed algorithm shows excellent performance on the set of well-known maximum cut benchmark instances in terms of both solution quality and computational time. Out of the 71 benchmark instances, BLS is capable of finding new improved results in 34 cases and attaining the previous best-known result for 35 instances, within computing times ranging from less than 1 s to 5.6 h for the largest instance with 20,000 vertices.
