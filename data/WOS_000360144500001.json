Smart home system includes internal network, intelligent gateway, and external network. Multiple servers are designed in gateway, which start at the same time and receive various forms of data. Then data is processed for internal network format. External network includes several modes of communication such as TCP/IP, UDP, and pipe. Internal network includes ZigBee wireless and power line carrier (PLC) communication. Power line carrier protocol is improved, and it expands data transmission capacity to accommodate communication needs of modern family. Smart home system is designed as modules, such as intelligent gateway module, power line carrier communication module, ZigBee wireless communication modules, and appliance within electric equipment. Finally this system is physically designed and verified. The smart home system introduced in this paper has easily used and has strong compatibility.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Wireless Sensor Networks System with Multiple Servers Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000360144500001"}
