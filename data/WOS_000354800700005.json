Our method can reduce their dependence on corrective eyewear. It also benefits individuals with normal vision by improving visual acuity at a distance and of small details. Our approach does not require custom hardware. Instead, the calculated images can be shown on a standard computer display, on printed paper, or superimposed on a physical scene using a projector. Our technique uses a constrained total variation method to produce a deconvolution result which, upon observation, appears sharp at the edges. We introduce a novel relative total variation term that enables controlling ringing reduction, contrast gain, and sharpness. The end result is the ability to generate sharper appearing images, even for individuals with refractive vision problems including myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Our approach has been validated in simulation, in camera-screen experiments, and in a study with human observers.", "paper_title": "A Total Variation Approach for Customizing Imagery to Improve Visual Acuity", "paper_id": "WOS:000354800700005"}
