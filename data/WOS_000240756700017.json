This research attempts to construct a novel neural fuzzy CMAC, in which Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) learning is introduced to determine the optimal fuzzy sets, and a truth-value restriction inference scheme is subsequently employed to derive the truth values of the rule weights of implication rules. The BYY is motivated from the famous Chinese ancient Ying-Yang philosophy: everything in the universe can be viewed as a product of a constant conflict between opposites-Ying and Yang, a perfect status is reached when Ying and Yang achieve harmony. The proposed fuzzy CMAC (FCMAC)-BYY enjoys the following advantages. First, it has a higher generalization ability because the fuzzy rule sets are systematically optimized by BYY; second, it reduces the memory requirement of the network by a significant degree as compared to the original CMAC; and third, it provides an intuitive fuzzy logic reasoning and has clear semantic meanings. The experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that the proposed FCMAC-BYY outperforms the existing representative techniques in the research literature.", "paper_title": "FCMAC-BYY: Fuzzy CMAC using Bayesian Ying-Yang learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700017"}
