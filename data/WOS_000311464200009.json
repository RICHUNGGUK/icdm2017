Simulation results and the flow characteristics are presented for six different Reynolds numbers (130 <= Re <= 2500). Many aspects of turbulent flow are presented and discussed including vortex shedding, flapping motion and statistics of turbulence. The numerical results of this work are compared with available experimental and numerical data of other researchers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
