A memory can behave like a processor with complete functionality by simulating a classic Turing machine. By means of this stored logic based architecture, the processor adopts a simple and regular internal organization. In addition, it makes the most of the inherent features in the memories and offers the possibility of reconfiguration by writing new results inside of it. This paper reviews different possibilities to use memory elements to perform computations that would replace combinational logic processing of a given function. In this research, a computational model based on stored logic is described and interesting issues concerned with memory utilization in processing are analyzed. A small functional unit based on these notions is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
