Representing and reasoning properly on temporal clinical data at different granularities are important both to guarantee the efficacy and the quality of care processes and to detect emergency situations. Temporal sequences of data acquired during a care process provide a significant source of information not only to search for a particular value or an event at a specific time, but also to detect some clinically-relevant patterns for temporal data. We propose a general framework for the description and management of temporal trends by considering specific temporal features with respect to the chosen time granularity. Temporal aspects of data are considered within temporal relational databases, first formally by using a temporal extension of the relational calculus, and then by showing how to map these relational expressions to plain SQL queries. Throughout the paper we consider the clinical domain of hemodialysis, where several parameters are periodically sampled during every session. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
