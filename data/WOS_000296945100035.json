Five models were built from computed-tomography scans: four 2D models with Plane Strain and Plane Stress State with linear triangular and quadratic quadrilateral elements and one 3D model. The finite element results indicated that the stress distribution was similar qualitatively in all models but the stress magnitude was quite different. It was concluded that 2D models are acceptable when investigating the biomechanical behavior of upper central incisor qualitatively. However, quantitative stress analysis is less reliable in 2D-finite element analysis, because 2D models overestimate the results and do not represent the complex anatomical configuration of dental structures. Therefore 3D finite element analyses of dental biomechanics cannot be simplified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
