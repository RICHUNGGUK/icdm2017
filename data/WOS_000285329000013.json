A counter example shows that a network with uniform degree can have significant traffic congestion when the degree is larger than 6. A profound understanding of what causes congestion is reestablished, based on the network curvature theorem. A load balancing algorithm based on curvature control is presented with network applications.", "paper_title": "Load Balancing by Network Curvature Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000285329000013"}
