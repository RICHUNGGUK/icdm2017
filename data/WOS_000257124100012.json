The system is composed of the supervisor module, the model refinement module, the process plant and the database. In the supervisor module, the user prescribes the desired curve for the plant dynamic process. The model refinement module is in parallel with the process plant, and consists of the self-tuning process model, which contains an architecture-adaptive neural network. The model refinement module could learn intelligently the real process plant by the prompt adjustments based on the difference of the outputs of the two modules, and its learned model is also refined gradually. This diagram is especially versatile in the complex nonlinear and time-variant systems in practice.", "paper_title": "An architecture-adaptive neural network online control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000257124100012"}
