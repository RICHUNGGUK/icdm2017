Operations for computing inverse relation, for composing relations, for combining relations coming from different sources and pertaining to the same temporal points, or for representing negative information are defined. An illustrative example of representation and reasoning with uncertain temporal relations is provided. This article shows how possibilistic temporal uncertainty can be handled in the setting of point algebra. Moreover, the article emphasizes the advantages of the possibilistic approach over a probabilistic approach previously proposed. This work does for the temporal point algebra what the authors previously did for the temporal interval algebra. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals.
