The participants in the system, such as the resource providers and the consumers who belong to multiple control domains, work together to enable a coordinated federation. The coordinated load management protocol embeds a logical spatial index over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) space for efficient management of the coordination objects; the DHT-based space serves as a kind of decentralized blackboard system. We show that our coordination protocol has a message complexity that is logarithmic to the number of nodes in the system, which is significantly better than existing broadcast based coordination protocols. The proposed load management protocol can be applied for efficiently coordinating resource brokering services of distributed computing systems such as grids and PlanetLab. Resource brokering services are the main components that control the way applications are scheduled, managed and allocated in a distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic Grid computing environments. Existing Grid resource brokers, e-Science application work-flow schedulers, operate in tandem but still lack a coordination mechanism that can lead to efficient application schedules across distributed resources. Further, lack of coordination exacerbates the utilization of various resources (such as computing cycles and network bandwidth). The feasibility of the proposed coordinated load management protocol is studied through extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Coordinated load management in Peer-to-Peer coupled federated grid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305554800004"}
