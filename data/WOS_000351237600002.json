Such complexity results from a larger design space created by numerous combinations of accelerators, algorithms, and hw/sw partitions. Exploration of this increased design space is critical due to widely varying performance and energy consumption for each accelerator when used for different application domains and different use cases. To address this problem, numerous studies have evaluated specific applications across different architectures. In this article, we analyze an important domain of applications, referred to as sliding-window applications, implemented on FPGAs, GPUs, and multicore CPUs. For each device, we present optimization strategies and analyze use cases where each device is most effective. The results show that, for large input sizes, FPGAs can achieve speedups of up to 5.6x and 58x compared to GPUs and multicore CPUs, respectively, while also using up to an order of magnitude less energy. For small input sizes and applications with frequency-domain algorithms, GPUs generally provide the best performance and energy.", "paper_title": "A Tradeoff Analysis of FPGAs, GPUs, and Multicores for Sliding-Window Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351237600002"}
