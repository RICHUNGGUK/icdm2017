However, sensors could be compromised by adversaries to claim arbitrary locations to disrupt the normal network operation. Thus, location verification should be carried out for security considerations. Due to the importance of the problem, we propose a highly efficient algorithm that effectively detects false location claims from compromised sensors. Extensive analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is energy-efficient and resilient against adversaries.", "paper_title": "Efficient distributed location verification in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292503700010"}
