To support texture mapping progressive meshes (PM), we usually allow the whole PM sequence to share a common texture map. Although such a common texture map can be derived by using appropriate mesh parameterizations that consider the minimization of geometry stretch, texture stretch, or even the texture deviation introduced by edge collapses, we have found that even with a well parameterized texture map, the texture mapped PM still reveals apparent texture distortion due to geometry changes and the nature of linear interpolation used by texture mapping hardware. In this paper we propose a novel, simple, and efficient approach that adapts texture content for each edge collapse, aiming to eliminate texture distortion. A texture adaptation and its inverse are local and incremental operations that can be fully supported by texture mapping hardware, the render-to-texture feature, and the fragment shader Once the necessary correspondence in the partition of texture space is built during the course of PM construction, the texture adaptation or its inverse can be applied on the fly before rendering the simplified or refined model with texture map. We also propose the mechanism of indexing mapping to reduce blurred artifacts due to under-sampling that might be introduced by texture adaptation.", "paper_title": "Texture adaptation for progressive meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800013"}
