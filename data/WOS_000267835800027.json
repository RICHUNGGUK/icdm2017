Thus, the properties of fractals and power-law scaling have become attractive for research in biology and medicine because of their potential for discovering patterns and characteristics of complex biological morphologies. Despite the successful applications of fractals for the life sciences, the quantitative measure of the scale invariance expressed by fractal dimensions is limited in more complex situations, such as for histopathological analysis of tissue changes in disease. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fuzzy scaling and its analysis of a mouse mutant with postnatal brain morphological changes.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Scaling Analysis of a Mouse Mutant With Brain Morphological Changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000267835800027"}
