Because of this property, SWSFETs are useful to implement different multivalued logic with reduced device count. In this paper, we introduce the circuit model of a SWSFET and the design of a unipolar inverter where only one kind of charge carrier contributes to the current flow. We also simulate two input unipolar logic gates such as NAND and NOR and demonstrate their universal property to implement other unipolar logic gates. We also simulate NOR gate and full adder circuits based on unipolar logic gates.", "paper_title": "Unipolar Logic Gates Based on Spatial Wave-Function Switched FETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400001"}
