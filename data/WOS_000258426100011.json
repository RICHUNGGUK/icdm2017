This ubiquitous computing poses new security challenges while the information call be accessed at anywhere and anytime because it may be applied by criminal users. Additionally, the information may contain private information that cannot be shared by all user communities. Several approaches are developed to protect information for pervasive environments against malicious users. However, ad hoc mechanisms or protocols are typically added in the approaches by compromising disorganized policies or additional components to protect from unauthorized access. In this paper, we present a usage control model to protect services and devices ill ubiquitous Computing environments, which allows the access restrictions directly on services and object documents. The model not only supports complex constraints for pervasive Computing, such as services, devices and data types but also provides a mechanism to build rich reuse relationships between models and objects. Finally, comparisons with related works are analysed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
