Three behavior rules are added to the extended boids model: following a feed; avoiding obstacle; avoiding enemy boids. The moving vector is a linear combination of every behavior rule vector, and the coefficients should be optimized. We also proposed a genetic algorithm to optimize the coefficients. Experimental results show that by using the GA-based optimization, the aggregate motions of fish schools become more realistic and similar to behaviors of real fish world.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithms for optimization of boids model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600007"}
