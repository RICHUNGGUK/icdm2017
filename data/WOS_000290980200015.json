In addition to investigating the asymmetric effect of oil price shocks on stock returns, we also examine the effect of the performances of stock markets themselves, which are relevant to firms' strategies in the future. Although the responses of stock markets to oil price shocks are diverse among G7 countries, we present the inconsistent reflections of stock markets based on their performances. In many cases, quanti le regression estimates are quite different from OLS models. These results carry crucial implications for the linkage between oil and stock markets. (C) 2011 IMACS.
