Such structures are rigid, and hard to scale up and scale out. A good data center network structure should have high scalability, efficient switch utilization, and high reliability. In this paper we present a class of data center network structures based on hypergraph theory and combinatorial block design theory. We show that our data center network structures are more flexible and scalable than fat trees. Using switches of the same size, our data center network structures can connect more nodes than fat trees, and it is possible to construct different structures with tradeoffs among inter-cluster communication capacity, reliability, the number of switches used, and the number of connected nodes.", "paper_title": "Switch-Centric Data Center Network Structures Based on Hypergraphs and Combinatorial Block Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000021"}
