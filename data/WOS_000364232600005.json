First, some methodological approaches and theoretical results are outlined; and then an application of DEA with real-world data (for assessing educational departments in a university) is addressed. Afterwards, possible extensions and applications of the existing approaches in the presence of fuzzy data are developed. The final theoretical part of the paper contains a main theorem which provides a sufficient condition for efficiency maintaining in the presence of fuzzy data. To do this, we have used some notions/results from multi-objective decision-making theory.", "paper_title": "Inverse DEA: Review, Extension and Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000364232600005"}
