The fractional order indirect Lyapunov method is available for the 0 < alpha < 1 case, by introducing the appropriate transformations of frequency distributed model. Meanwhile, based on the semigroup property of fractional order derivative and the fractional order tracking differentiator, we extend the result to the 1 < alpha < 2 case. The case of controlling fractional order systems with unknown control input coefficient is also investigated. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
