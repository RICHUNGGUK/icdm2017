The cost function of the proposed algorithm is to maximize the probability that the equalizer output power is equal to the constant modulus of the transmitted symbols. Two blind information-theoretic learning (ITL) algorithms based on constant modulus error signals are also introduced: One for minimizing the Euclidean probability density function distance and the other for minimizing the constant modulus error entropy. The relations between the algorithms and their characteristics are investigated, and their performance is compared and analyzed through simulations in multi-path channel environments. The proposed algorithm has a lower computational complexity and a faster convergence speed than the other ITL algorithms that are based on a constant modulus error. The error samples of the proposed blind algorithm exhibit more concentrated density functions and superior error rate performance in severe multi-path channel environments when compared with the other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Maximization of Zero-Error Probability for Adaptive Channel Equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000284188700007"}
