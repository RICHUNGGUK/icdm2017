This task is difficult due to the inherent problems of echographic images (i.e. low contrast, speckle noise, signal dropout, presence of shadows). In this article, we extend a level-set method recently proposed in Dietenbeck et al. (2012) in order to track the whole myocardium in echocardiographic sequences. To this end, we enforce temporal coherence by adding a new motion prior energy to the existing framework. This motion prior term is expressed as new constraint that enforces the conservation of the levels of the implicit function along the image sequence. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed method is improved by adjusting the associated hyperparameters in a spatially adaptive way, using the available strong a priori about the echocardiographic regions to be segmented. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the obtained segmentation with experts references and to another state-of-the-art method on a dataset of 15 sequences (similar or equal to 900 images) acquired in three echocardiographic views. We show that the algorithm provides results that are consistent with the inter-observer variability and outperforms the state-of-the-art method. We also carry out a complete study on the influence of the parameters settings. The obtained results demonstrate the stability of our method according to those values. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
