In the same way as traditional points-based studies, control based on lines compares the positions between the lines (one from a given database to be controlled and the other from a more accurate independent control database). The proposed method is based on vertex displacements and their influence on adjacent segments. The new methodology which applies these metrics is called 'vertex influence method'. It also includes an analysis for detection of systematic displacements and a variability value of displacements based on the accuracy of the lines. All the proposed metrics are applied to a real case made up of more than 180 km of roads from the two databases. By means of this study we also compare the results obtained from the main traditional methodologies. This study has revealed the viability of the use of this method to obtain an accuracy value of positional cartographic products.", "paper_title": "New method for positional quality control in cartography based on lines.
