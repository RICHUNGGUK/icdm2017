An 2(2)3(1) experimental design was established to describe the effects of three controlled factors with distinct levels: pH (10 and 12), temperature (25 and 60 degrees C) and detoxification time (15,30 and 60 min) on the concentration of xylose, FF and HMF. A better understanding of this overliming process was possible by exploring the chromatograms obtained with 2D Correlation Spectroscopy (2DCOS). 2D correlation spectroscopy gave information about the relations that exist between chromatographic peaks and chromatograms. The order in which the constituents vary can be deduced from the sign of peaks in the synchronous and asynchronous matrices, facilitating the interpretation of kinetic studies.
