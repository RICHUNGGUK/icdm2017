In contrast to previous algorithms which search for the projection matrix directly, our new algorithm investigates a similarity metric matrix (SMM). With a certain verification threshold, this matrix is learned by a semidefinite programming approach, along with the constraints of the kindred pairs with similarity larger than the threshold, and inhomogeneous pairs with similarity smaller than the threshold. Then, the subspace dimension and the feature fusing weights are simultaneously inferred from the singular value decomposition of the derived SMM. In addition, the weighted and tensor extensions are proposed to further improve the algorithmic effectiveness and efficiency, respectively. Essentially, the verification is conducted within an affine subspace in this new algorithm and is, hence, called the affine subspace for verification (ASV). Extensive experiments show that the ASV can achieve encouraging face verification accuracy in comparison to other subspace algorithms, even without the need to explore any parameters.", "paper_title": "Formulating face verification with semidefinite programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000250241500016"}
