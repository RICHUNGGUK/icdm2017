A set of benchmark problems is solved to get insight on the behavior of different gradient-based methods and two variants of the Newton-Raphson method, using a finite element model of the structure. Numerical experiments indicate that the limited memory BFGS method is generally more robust, faster, and easier to implement, and therefore it may replace or complement the Newton-Raphson method in this type of analysis.
