To develop a general retrieval scheme which is less dependent on domain-specific knowledge, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is employed as a feature extraction method. In establishing the database, the DC coefficients of Y, U and V components are quantized such that the feature space is partitioned into a finite number of grids, each of which is mapped to a grid code (GC). When querying an image, at coarse classification stage, the grid-based classification (GBC) and the distance threshold pruning (DTP) serve as a filter to remove those candidates with widely distinct features. At the fine classification stage, only the remaining candidates need to be computed for the detailed similarity comparison. The experimental results show that both high efficacy and high efficiency can be achieved simultaneously using the proposed two-stage approach.", "paper_title": "A fast two-stage content-based image retrieval approach in the DCT domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761800007"}
