The aim of the problem is to derive a sufficient condition and an adaptive control strategy such that the synchronization can be achieved for the master system and the slave system. By generalized Ito's formula and Lyapunov functional method, a sufficient condition in terms of LMI is established to ensure the synchronization of the two systems, and the adaptive update law is determined as well. A numerical simulation is provided to verify the usefulness of the proposed criterion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
