The structure of input data and error discovered through fuzzy clustering is captured in the form of a collection of fuzzy clusters, which helps eliminate (compensate) error produced by the global model. We discuss a detailed architecture of the proposed rule-based model and present its design based on an augmented version of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). An extended suite of experimental studies offering some comparative analysis is covered as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
