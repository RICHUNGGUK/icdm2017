The initial condition is assumed to be a random function and the transport velocity is a random variable. The scheme is based on local Riemann problem solutions and Godunov's method. We show that the scheme is stable and consistent with an advective-diffusive equation. Numerical examples are added to illustrate our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
