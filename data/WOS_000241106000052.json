In this paper, the traditional vector approximation is improved. Firstly, it decreases the dimensions by LLE (locally-linear-embedding). As a result of it, a set of absolute low dimensions are gotten. Then, this paper uses the Gaussian mixture distribution and estimates the distribution through EM (expectation-maximization) method. The original data vectors are replaced by vector approximation. This approach gains higher efficiency and less run time. The experiments show a remarkable reduction of I/O. They also show an improvement on the indexing performance and then speed the image retrieval.", "paper_title": "A new and fast method of image indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000052"}
