We describe an algorithm to very efficiently generate these distributions. The core idea behind our method is to compute a Capacity-Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CCDT), namely, given a simple polygon P in the plane, and the desired number of points n, compute a Delaunay triangulation of the interior of P with n Steiner points, whose triangles have areas which are as uniform as possible. This is computed iteratively by alternating update of the point geometry and triangulation connectivity. The vertex set of the CCDT is shown to have good blue noise characteristics, comparable in quality to those of state-of-the-art methods, achieved at a fraction of the runtime. Our CCDT method may be applied also to an arbitrary density function to produce non-uniform point distributions. These may be used to half-tone grayscale images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
