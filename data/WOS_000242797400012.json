The simulations show the extent to which intermolecular hydrogen bonding is important in determining the stability of the monolayer formed by the surfactant molecules and show that mono-alkanoyl glyceride molecules are able to pack more efficiently, forming significantly more intermolecular hydrogen bonds and occupying approximately half the volume needed by di-alkanoyl glyceride molecules. Density profiles are presented which show significant mixing of the hydrophobic tail groups and a non-polar solvent. The distribution of torsion angles in the tail groups shows that the conformation is consistent with a liquid at finite temperature rather than a crystal structure. The measured friction coefficients of equimolar solutions of the glycerides show that the efficacy as friction modifiers varies in the order mono-, di- and the tri-oleyl glyceride, which is consistent with the efficacy of film formation predicted by the molecular dynamics calculations.
