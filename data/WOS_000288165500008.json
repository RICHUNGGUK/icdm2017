This paper presents the design of a 60 GHz receiver front-end using 65 nm CMOS technology. Initially, a heterodyne receiver front-end architecture is presented to exploit its possible compatibility with legacy systems. In order to implement the front-end, an EM simulation based methodology and the corresponding design flow are proposed. A transistor EM model, using existing compact models as core, is developed to account for the parasitic elements due to wiring stacks. A spiral inductor lumped model, based on S-parameter data from EM simulation is also derived. After the device modeling efforts, a single-stage LNA and a single-gate mixer are designed using 65 nm CMOS technology. They are characterized by EM co-simulation, and compared with the state-of-the-art. After integration, the simulated front-end achieves a conversion gain of 11.9 dB and an overall SSB noise figure of 8.2 dB, with an input return loss of -13.7 dB. It consumes 6.1 mW DC power, and its layout occupies a die area of 0.33 mm x 0.44 mm.", "paper_title": "A 60 GHz receiver front-end in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500008"}
