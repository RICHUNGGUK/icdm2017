New lower bounds for 2-D GO sequences, based on matrix theory on rank, are derived and presented, some examples that attain these lower bounds are given. As a direct application to our results, upper bound on family size of 2-D mutually complementary orthogonal (MCO) codes defined by Luke [9] is proposed.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds on two-dimensional generalized orthogonal sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400041"}
