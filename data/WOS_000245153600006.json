We analyse the alternatives of conventional alpha-blending and so-called late-switching (the switching of LODs 'far enough' from the eye-point), widely thought to solve the LOD switching discontinuity problem, and conclude that they either do not work in practice, or defeat the concept of LODs. In contrast we show that our algorithm produces visually pleasing blends for static and animated discrete LODs, for discrete LODs with different types of LOD representations (e.g. billboards and meshes) and even to some extent totally different objects with similar spatial extent, with a very small runtime overhead.", "paper_title": "Unpopping: Solving the image-space blend problem for smooth discrete LOD transitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000245153600006"}
