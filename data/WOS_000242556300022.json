With a novel two-dimensional binary encoding approach, the algorithm performs well on coalition parallel generation. An adaptive disturbance factor is adopted to force swarms getting out of local optimums quickly. Introduced an active-feedback based on island models, the algorithm has a good cooperative searching characteristic. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is proved by experiments.", "paper_title": "Particle swarms cooperative optimization for coalition generation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300022"}
