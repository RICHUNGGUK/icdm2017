It de novo assembles short reads and then maps the assembly against a reference genome to call SNPs, short insertions/deletions and structural variations. FermiKit takes about one day to assemble 30-fold human whole-genome data on a modern 16-core server with 85 GB RAM at the peak, and calls variants in half an hour to an accuracy comparable to the current practice. FermiKit assembly is a reduced representation of raw data while retaining most of the original information.", "paper_title": "FermiKit: assembly-based variant calling for Illumina resequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000365134700023"}
