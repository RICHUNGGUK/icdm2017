In this framework, two typical assumptions are: (1) the stationary regime, and (2) the system homogeneity (i.e., homogeneity of the underlying infinitesimal generator). In the absence of these assumptions, the computation of the stationary queue length distribution becomes extremely intricate or, even, intractable. The use of maximum queue lengths provides an alternative queueing measure overcoming these problems. We apply our results to some problems arising from call center management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
