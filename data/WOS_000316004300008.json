Their role in contemporary multimedia content delivery and communication systems is strong, as witnessed by many popular applications and services. Groups in P2P systems can originate from the relations between humans, or they can be defined with purely technical criteria such as proximity. In this article, we present a conceptual analysis of P2P group management systems. We illustrate how groups are formed using different P2P system architectures, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using each P2P system architecture for implementing P2P group management. The evaluation criteria in the analysis are performance, robustness, fairness, suitability for battery-powered devices, scalability, and security. The outcome of the analysis facilitates the selection of an appropriate P2P system architecture for implementing P2P group management in both further research and prototype development.", "paper_title": "P2P Group Management Systems: A Conceptual Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000316004300008"}
