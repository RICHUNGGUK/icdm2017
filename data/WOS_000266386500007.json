While leveraging current IPv4-based SNMP management scheme to IPv6 networks' management need is necessary, it is more urgent to coin a new network management architecture to accommodate the scalability and extensibility requirements of next generation Internet management. The paper proposes a novel network management architecture, IMN (Internet Management Network), which creates an overlay network of management nodes. While each management node can perform management tasks autonomously and independently, it can finish more sophisticated management tasks by collaboratively invoking management operations or sharing information provided by other management nodes. P2P-based communication services are introduced in IMN to enable such collaboration. The paper presents a prototyping implementation based on the Web service related technology, as well as some of the key technologies, especially solutions to those issues arising from the management practice of CERNET2. Experiences of deployment of CERNET2 operation and lessons learned from the management practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Towards Next Generation Internet Management: CNGI-CERNET2 Experiences", "paper_id": "WOS:000266386500007"}
