The current P2PSIP scenarios only consider the infrastructure for the connectivity inside a single domain. This paper proposes an extension of the current work to a hierarchical multi-domain scenario: a two level hierarchical peer-to-peer overlay architecture for the interconnection of different P2PSIP domains. The purpose is the creation of a global decentralised multimedia services in enterprises, ISPs or community networks. We present a study of the routing performance and routing state in the particular case of a two-level distributed hash table hierarchy that uses Kademlia. The study is supported by an analytical model and its validation by a peer-to-peer simulator. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
