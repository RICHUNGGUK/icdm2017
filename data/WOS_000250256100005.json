Account is taken of nuisance caused to population along routes and of equity considerations. Not only is equity as regards effects on different population centres considered, but also between carriers of waste from different towns giving rise to the concept of routing fairness. The resulting model problem is computationally complex and heuristic solution procedures are developed. These are applied to real data relating to the district of Algarve, Portugal, and results of numerical experiments are reported. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
