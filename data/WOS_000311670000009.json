In fact, in fibring, fusion and other forms of combination reported in the literature, each shared connective inherits the logical properties of each of its components. A new form of combining logics (meet-combination) is proposed where such a connective inherits only the common logical properties of its components. The conservative nature of the proposed combination is shown to hold without provisos. Preservation of soundness and completeness is also proved. Illustrations are provided involving classical, intuitionistic and modal logics.", "paper_title": "On meet-combination of logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000311670000009"}
