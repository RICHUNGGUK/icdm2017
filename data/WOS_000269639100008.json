We describe the first exact and efficient algorithm for the Episode Clustering problem, which, given a collection of rooted gene trees and a rooted species tree, seeks the minimum number of locations on the species tree of gene duplication events. Solving this problem allows one to place gene duplication events onto nodes of a given species tree and potentially detect large-scale gene duplication events. We examined the performance of an implementation of our algorithm using 85 plant gene trees that contain genes from a total of 136 plant taxa. We found evidence of large-scale gene duplication events in Populus, Gossypium, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and near the root of the eudicot clade that are consistent with previous genomic evidence. However, a lack of phylogenetic signal within the gene trees can produce erroneous evidence of large-scale duplication events, especially near the root of the species tree. Although the results of our algorithm should be interpreted cautiously, they provide hypotheses for precise locations of large-scale gene duplication events with data from relatively few gene trees and can complement other genomic approaches to provide a more comprehensive view of ancient large-scale gene duplication events.", "paper_title": "Locating Large-Scale Gene Duplication Events through Reconciled Trees: Implications for Identifying Ancient Polyploidy Events in Plants", "paper_id": "WOS:000269639100008"}
