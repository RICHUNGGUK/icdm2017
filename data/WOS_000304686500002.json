In addition, partial pressure profiles of components during styrene production process inside porous catalyst were obtained using Dusty-Gas model. The preservation equations are adopted to calculate temperature and flow profiles in the reactors filled with iron-potassium promoted catalyst pellets. The presented mathematical model for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation consists of nonlinear simultaneous differential equations with multiple dependent variables. Simulation results such as selectivity and operating temperature for different conventional catalysts have been presented and compared with those of a new introduced catalyst based on Fe2O3. Comparison of simulation results with experimentally observed ones shows that the model can precisely predict behavior of the industrial unit. Furthermore, the obtained results show that application of the new introduced catalyst increase ethylbenzene conversion and decrease necessary inlet temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
