In this paper, we propose a core for a legal information system that manages a variety of hard paper documents and automatically transforms them into Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements for suitable indexing, retrieval and long-term preservation. Although we describe a general architecture that can be used for several legal application domains, our system is particularly suitable for the notary realm.", "paper_title": "A semantic document management system for legal applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426700002"}
