We discuss here some of their basic properties, among them a \"Cobham-Semenov-like\" dichotomy theorem. Our main result is a characterisation of bijective semi-synchronously rational transductions as those bijections mapping regular relations to regular ones and non-regular relations to non-regular ones.", "paper_title": "Semi-synchronous transductions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262531800002"}
