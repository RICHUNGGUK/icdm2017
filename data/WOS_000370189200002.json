By using the prediction of status to compensate for the real state of feature points, non-holonomic robots conduct visual servoing tasks efficiently. Results of simulation and experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Switched Extend Kalman-Filter for Visual Servoing Applied in Nonholonomic Robot with the FOV Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200002"}
