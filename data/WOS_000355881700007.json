We propose a new formulation for the (k,c)-coloring problem and develop a Branch-and-Price algorithm. We tested the algorithm on instances having from 20 to 80 vertices and different combinations for k and c, and compare it with a recent algorithm proposed in the literature. Computational results show that the overall approach is effective and has very good performance on instances where the previous algorithm fails. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
