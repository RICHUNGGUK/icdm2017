We report convincing experimental results to show the effectiveness of each individual enhancement. With all these enhancements together, NTHU-Route 2.0 solves all ISPD98 benchmarks with very good quality. Moreover, NTHU-Route 2.0 routes 7 of 8 ISPD07 benchmarks and 12 of 16 ISPD08 benchmarks without any overflow. Compared with other state-of-the-art global routers, NTHU-Route 2.0 is able to produce better solution quality and/or run more efficiently.", "paper_title": "NTHU-Route 2.0: A Robust Global Router for Modern Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284417400008"}
