ACOhg is a new kind of ant colony optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of real ants equipped with internal resorts to search in very large search landscapes. We here apply ACOhg to concurrent models in scenarios located near the edge of the existing knowledge in detecting property violations. The results state that the combination is computationally beneficial for the search and represents a considerable step forward in this field with respect to exact and other heuristic techniques.
