The sink gathers and analyzes the data from sensors and then takes the corresponding action. Such architecture may have single-point of failure problem. Besides, when sensors have no direct link with the sink, they must deliver data by hopping scheme. The sink may take a longer time to collect data. Furthermore, faulty sensors and environment interference may cause an incorrect result. To overcome the mentioned problems, we propose a consensus problem based solution to make all sensors reach an agreement without the sink. It can conduct actions more quickly and directly.
