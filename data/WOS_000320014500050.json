The \"sensor\" estimates the positions of transmitters on traffic participants by comparing the strengths of signals received by four ZigBee receivers installed at the four corners of a vehicle. On-board sensors involving cameras cannot detect objects in non line-of-sight (NLOS) area caused by buildings and other vehicles. Although infrastructure sensors for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative systems can detect such hidden objects, they are substantially more expensive than on-board sensors. The on-board wireless \"sensor\" developed in this work would function as an alternative tool for collision avoidance around intersections. Herein, we extend our previous work by considering a road surface reflection model to improve the estimation accuracy. By using this model, we succeeded in reducing the error mismatches between the observed data and the calibration data of the estimation algorithm. The proposed system will be realized on the basis of these enhancements.", "paper_title": "Object Detection Using RSSI with Road Surface Reflection Model for Intersection Safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500050"}
