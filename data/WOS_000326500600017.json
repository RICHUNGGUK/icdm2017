One of the main difficulties is dynamically providing high-quality recommendation on sparse data. In this paper, a novel dynamic personalized recommendation algorithm is proposed, in which information contained in both ratings and profile contents are utilized by exploring latent relations between ratings, a set of dynamic features are designed to describe user preferences in multiple phases, and finally, a recommendation is made by adaptively weighting the features. Experimental results on public data sets show that the proposed algorithm has satisfying performance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Personalized Recommendation on Sparse Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326500600017"}
