The paper proposes a numerical scheme for analysing the evolution of moisture distribution in concrete subjected to wetting-drying exposure caused by intermittent periods of rainfall. The proposed paradigm is based on the stage wise implementation of non-linear finite element (FE) analysis, with each stage representing a distinct phase of a typical wet-dry cycle. The associated boundary conditions have been constituted to realize the influence of various meteorological elements such as rain, wind, relative humidity and temperature on the exposed concrete surface. The reliability of the developed scheme has been demonstrated through its application for the simulation of experimentally recorded moisture profiles reported in published literature. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to study the influence of critical material properties on simulated results. The proposed scheme is vital to the service life modelling of concrete structures in tropical climates which largely remain exposed to the action of alternating rains.", "paper_title": "Moisture distribution in concrete subjected to rain induced wetting-drying", "paper_id": "WOS:000348594100001"}
