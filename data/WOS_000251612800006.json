Familiarity is often considered to be an important factor in determining the level of trust. In previous research, familiarity between two agents has been simply assumed to be the similarity between them. We propose an improved familiarity measurement based on the exploration of factors that affect a human's feelings of familiarity. We also carry out experiments to show that the trust model with our improved familiarity measurement is more effective and more stable.", "paper_title": "A familiarity-based trust model for effective selection of sellers in multiagent e-commerce systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251612800006"}
