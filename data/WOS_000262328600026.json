The achievable rate can also be extended to Gaussian channels. A second achievable rate for the Gaussian relay channel based on a Schalkwijk-Kailath type scheme is presented. For some channels both achievable rates strictly improve upon all previously known achievable rates. For the discrete memoryless relay channel also a converse result is provided.", "paper_title": "On the Relay Channel With Receiver-Transmitter Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600026"}
