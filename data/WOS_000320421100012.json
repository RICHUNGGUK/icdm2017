In this paper, the topological structure of the Guangzhou urban rail transit network was made by space L and space P methods. The network characteristics, such as average path length, clustering coefficient and degree distribution were selected in each method. Then the network's reliability was discussed, and the results show that the Guangzhou rail transit network at present is classified as a random network. When suffered from selected attack, the average travel length and the global efficiency are increasing; the local efficiency keeps the same. As long as most of the stations work well, the entire rail network structure is relative stable.", "paper_title": "CHARACTERISTICS AND RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLEX NETWORK IN GUANGZHOU RAIL TRANSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100012"}
