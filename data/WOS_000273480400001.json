TCP-based applications account for a majority of data traffic in the Internet; thus understanding and improving the performance of TCP implementations over OBS networks are critical. Previously, several articles show that load-balanced routing improves loss-performance in OBS. In this paper, we identify the ill-effects of load-balanced OBS on TCP performance caused by false time-outs and false fast-retransmits. We propose a source-ordering mechanism that significantly improves TCP throughput over a load-balanced OBS network.", "paper_title": "Source-ordering for improved TCP performance over load-balanced optical burst-switched (OBS) networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480400001"}
