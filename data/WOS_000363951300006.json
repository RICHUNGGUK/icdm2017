Following up the study of unimodular lattice wiretap codes (Lin and Oggier in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 59(6):3295-3303, 2013), this paper investigates 2- and 3-modular lattices which can be constructed from linear codes and compares them with unimodular lattices. Most even 2- and 3-modular lattices are found to have better performance (that is, a higher secrecy gain) than the best unimodular lattices in dimension . Odd 2-modular lattices are considered, too, and three lattices are found to outperform the best unimodular lattices.", "paper_title": "2-and 3-Modular lattice wiretap codes in small dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000363951300006"}
