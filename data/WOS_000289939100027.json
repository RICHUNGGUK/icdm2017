The overall approach taken in the project is presented through an electronic signature case study. The case study illustrates a situation where, in order to reduce legal uncertainties, the parties wish to include in the contract specific clauses to define as precisely as possible the share of liabilities between them for the main types of failures of the system.", "paper_title": "Liability Issues in Software Engineering The use of formal methods to reduce legal uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000289939100027"}
