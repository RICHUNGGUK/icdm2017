While a range of problems related to barrier coverage have been investigated, little effort has been made to explore the effects of different sensor deployment strategies and mechanisms to improve barrier coverage of a wireless sensor network after it is deployed. In this paper we study the barrier coverage of a line-based sensor deployment strategy and explore how to exploit sensor mobility to improve barrier coverage. We first establish a tight lower bound for the existence of barrier coverage under the line-based deployment. Our results show that the barrier coverage of the line-based deployment significantly outperforms that of the Poisson model when the random offsets are relatively small compared to the sensor's sensing range. To take advantage of the performance of line-based deployment, we further devise an efficient algorithm to relocate mobile sensors based on the deployed line so as to improve barrier coverage. The algorithm finds barrier gaps and then relocates mobile sensors to fill the gaps while at the same time balancing the energy consumption among mobile sensors. Simulation results show that the algorithms can effectively improve the barrier coverage of a wireless sensor network for a wide range of deployment parameters. Therefore, in wireless sensor network applications, the coverage goal, possible sensor deployment strategies, and sensor mobility must be carefully and jointly considered. The results obtained in this paper will provide important guidelines and insights into the deployment and performance of wireless sensor networks for barrier coverage. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
