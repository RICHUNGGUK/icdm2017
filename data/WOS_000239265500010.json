In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the problem based on evaluation of the community structure. By testing the proposed algorithm on artificial and real-world networks, experimental results demonstrate that our approach is both accurate and fast. Our algorithm may shed light on uncovering the universal principles of network architectures and topologies.", "paper_title": "Community finding in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239265500010"}
