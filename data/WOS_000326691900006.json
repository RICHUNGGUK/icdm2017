As a key concept in uncertain set theory, the independence was first defined in the paper (Liu in Fuzzy Optim Decis Mak 11(4):387-410, 2012b). However, the definition is somewhat weak to deal with uncertain sets completely. In order to overcome this disadvantage, this paper presents a stronger definition of independence of uncertain sets and discusses its mathematical properties.", "paper_title": "A new definition of independence of uncertain sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000326691900006"}
