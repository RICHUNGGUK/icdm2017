In typical applications such as clustering, it is not the complete set but only a subset of discriminating frequent subsequences which is of interest. One approach to discovering the subset of useful frequent subsequences is to apply any existing frequent sequence mining algorithm to find the complete set of frequent subsequences. Then, a subset of interesting subsequences can be further identified. Unfortunately, it is very time consuming to mine the complete set of frequent subsequences for large sequence databases. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, CONTOUR, which efficiently mines a subset of high-quality subsequences directly in order to cluster the input sequences. We mainly focus on how to design some effective search space pruning methods to accelerate the mining process and discuss how to construct an accurate clustering algorithm based on the result of CONTOUR. We conducted an extensive performance study to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of CONTOUR, and the accuracy of the frequent subsequence-based clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "CONTOUR: an efficient algorithm for discovering discriminating subsequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000261951600001"}
