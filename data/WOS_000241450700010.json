The language is a compositional subset of UML2.0 activity diagrams which by themselves are not compositional in our sense of the word. We show how we transform models in this language into models for the ASML platform that implements coordination. The fact that the language is compositional enables us to define the transformation in a simple and compact manner.", "paper_title": "Compositional MDA", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700010"}
