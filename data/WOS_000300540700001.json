We proposed two new constructs, peer intrinsic motivation and peer extrinsic motivation, and investigated their effect on a player's intention to learn individually and collaboratively. Our survey and interview findings showed that an individual player's peer intrinsic and extrinsic motivations had significantly positive influence on his or her intention to learn collaboratively and individually. Implications for academics, educators, game developers, and players are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
