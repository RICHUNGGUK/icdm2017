The nonlinear governing equations are derived and solved by means of an incremental Newton-Raphson method. A displacement-based one-dimensional finite element model that accounts for the geometric nonlinearity in the von Karman sense is developed. Numerical results are obtained for thin-walled composite box beam under vertical load to investigate the effect of geometric nonlinearity, and address the effects of the fiber orientation, laminate stacking sequence, load parameter on axial-flexural-torsional response.
