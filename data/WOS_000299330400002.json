In this article, we determine K (q) (n, 4, 3, 1) for all n a parts per thousand yen 4, q = 3, 4 or q = 2 (m) + 1 with m a parts per thousand yen 2, leaving the only case (q, n) = (3, 5) in doubt. Our construction method is mainly based on the auxiliary designs, H-frames, which play a crucial role in the recursive constructions of group divisible 3-designs similar to that of candelabra systems in the constructions of 3-wise balanced designs. As an application of this approach, several new infinite classes of nonuniform group divisible 3-designs with block size four are also constructed.", "paper_title": "Optimal constant weight covering codes and nonuniform group divisible 3-designs with block size four", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330400002"}
