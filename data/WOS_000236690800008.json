The formulation of simultaneous plant-controller design optimization problem and the description of solution techniques based on a heuristic evolutionary algorithm for solving this optimization problem are presented. The gravity balanced two-link planar manipulator design is described and a class of nonlinear gain PD controllers is introduced for the set-point control of manipulator with counter-weights and different payloads. The results of the simultaneous design optimization involving a nonlinear PD controller and the two-link manipulator are given. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
