The fuzzy system is constructed with complete and consistent input membership functions and imposes special parametric constraints on the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. The monotonicity property and approximation capability of the developed fuzzy system are demonstrated using numerical examples.", "paper_title": "MONOTONIC FUZZY SYSTEMS AS UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATORS FOR MONOTONIC FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664600002"}
