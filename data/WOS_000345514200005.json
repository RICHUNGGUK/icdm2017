Also, it is a big challenge to segment remote sensing image mainly because of the complex terrain. In this paper, an enhanced multiphase phase level set method based on the Chan-Vese (C-V) model is proposed for segmenting remote sensing images. Compared with the C-V model, two main contributions of the proposed model mainly include the following: First, we introduce a new strategy of initialization in which the contours of the first k biggest connected regions are extracted as the initial curves (k is the number of level set functions); Second, to increase the accuracy, a morphological gradient component is added to the original intensity image. To investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, we have applied it to analyze different kinds of images, including synthetic, real, and remote sensing images. The experimental results have shown that our method is able to achieve better segmentation with less computational consumption compared with the traditional multiphase C-V model and local and global intensity fitting model.
