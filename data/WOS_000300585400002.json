Our preprocessing algorithm starts by generating a simplified representation of the input mesh. It then builds a multiresolution hierarchy for the simplified model. For each face in the hierarchy, it generates and assigns a displacement map that resembles the original surface represented by that face. At runtime, the multiresolution hierarchy is used to select a coarse view-dependent level-of-detail representation, which is sent to the graphics hardware. The GPU then refines the coarse representation by replacing each face with a planar tile, which is elevated according to the assigned displacement map. Our results show that our implementation achieves quality images at high frame rates.", "paper_title": "Displacement patches for view-dependent rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000300585400002"}
