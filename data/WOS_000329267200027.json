The four algorithms proposed can be classified into two classes: two bloom filter based precise algorithms, which are UBP and BBP, and two bloom filter based approximate algorithms, which are SRBP and PBP. By using the bloom filter and introducing the inaccuracy, the communication cost involved by the query processing can be reduced. For the two precise algorithms UBP and BBP, simulation results show that UBP consumes 51% less energy than BBP on average. UBP is better than BBP on energy consumption. For energy consumption comparison between the approximate algorithms and the precise algorithm UBP, simulation results show that SRBP consumes 18% less energy than UBP on average as while as PBP consume approximately the same energy as UBP on average. For query accuracy comparison between the approximate algorithms and the precise algorithm UBP, simulation results show that the average relative error between UBP and PBP is 14% and the average relative error between UBP and SRBP is 2%. SRBP is better than PBP on energy consumption and query accuracy respectively. UBP and SRBP are two preferred bloom filter based query processing algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
