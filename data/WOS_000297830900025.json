In fields like lighting control systems, the effect of low quality sensors compromises the control strategy and the emergence of new technologies also degrades the data quality introducing linguistic values. This research analyzes the aforementioned problem and shows that, in the field of lighting control systems, the uncertainty in the measurements gathered from sensors should be considered in the design of control loops. To cope with this kind of problems Hybrid Intelligent methods will be used. Moreover, a method for learning equation-based white box models with this low quality data is proposed. The equation-based models include a representation of the uncertainty inherited in the data. Two different evolutive algorithms are use for learning the models: the well-known NSGA-II genetic algorithm and a multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm hybridized with genetic operators. The performance of both algorithms is found valid to evolve this learning process. This novel approach is evaluated with synthetic problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
