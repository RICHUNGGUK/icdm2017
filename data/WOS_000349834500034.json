This must be protected. Effective detection of DDoS attacks requires an adaptive learning classifier, with less computational complexity, and an accurate decision making to stunt such attacks. We propose a distributed intrusion detection system called Cooperative IDS to protect wireless nodes within the network and target nodes from DDoS attacks by using a Cooperative Fuzzy Q-learning (Co-FQL) optimization algorithmic technique to identify the attack patterns and take appropriate countermeasures. The Co-FQL algorithm was trained and tested to establish its performance by generating attacks from the NSL-KDD and \"CAIDA DDoS Attack 2007\" datasets during the simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed Co-FQL IDS has a 90.58% higher accuracy of detection rate than Fuzzy Logic Controller or Q-learning algorithm or Fuzzy Q-learning alone.", "paper_title": "Co-FQL: Anomaly detection using cooperative fuzzy Q-learning in network", "paper_id": "WOS:000349834500034"}
