Unsafe lane change maneuvers are key factor for traffic accidents and traffic congestion. For drivers' safety, comfort and convenience, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are presented. The main problem discussed in this paper is the development of an autonomous lane change system. The system can be extended applied in intelligent vehicles in future. It solves two crucial issues - trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Polynomial method was adopted for describing the trajectory planning issue. Movement of a host vehicle was abstracted into time functions. Moreover, collision detection was mapped into a parameter space by adopting infinite dynamic circles. The second issue was described by backstepping principle. According to the Lyapunov function, a tracking controller with global convergence property was verified. Both the simulations and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed method for autonomous lane change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
