This work presents a novel methodology based on self-organizing neural networks and Gaussian distributions to detect unusual objects in the scene, and to improve the foreground mask handling occlusions between objects. After testing the proposed approach on several traffic sequences obtained from public repositories, the results demonstrate that this methodology is promising and suitable to correct segmentation errors on crowded scenes with rigid objects.", "paper_title": "A self-organizing map to improve vehicle detection in flow monitoring systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361728200009"}
