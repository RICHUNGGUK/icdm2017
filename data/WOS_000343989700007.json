Multi-tone waveform measurement capabilities will prove useful in enhancing the understanding of the response of devices under realistic operating conditions, and allow for detailed investigation into device problems leading to memory effects. The system, which is based around a standard sampling oscilloscope, is capable of measuring all four traveling waves simultaneously. It is a cost effective solution, capable of capturing high quality measurement data, it consists of two test sets one to measure RF components of the signal and one to measure IF components, which are then recombined before being measured by the sampling oscilloscope. Vector error correction is applied to the measured data to fully calibrate the system to the device plane, ensuring any dispersion in the connecting hardware is removed. A multi-tone waveform sampling method is employed, ensuring the waveforms are captured in the most efficient manner. Device results are presented showing the multi-tone voltage and current waveforms at the device plane. Some useful applications of the system are demonstrated and explained.", "paper_title": "MULTI-TONE WAVEFORM MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ENABLING CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROWAVE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000343989700007"}
