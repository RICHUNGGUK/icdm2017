For every v is an element of V, we denote by N(v) the set of neighbours of v, and let N[v] = N(v) boolean OR {v}. A set C subset of V is said to be a dominating code in G if the sets N[v] boolean AND c, v is an element of V, are all nonempty. A set C subset of V is said to be a locating-dominating code in G if the sets N[v] boolean AND C, v is an element of V \\ C, are all nonempty and distinct. The smallest size of a dominating (resp., locating-dominating) code in G is denoted by d(G) (resp., l(G)). We study the ensemble of all the different optimal dominating (resp., locating-dominating) codes C, i.e., such that vertical bar C vertical bar = d(G) (resp., vertical bar C vertical bar = l(G)) in a graph G, and strongly link this problem to that of induced subgraphs of Johnson graphs.
