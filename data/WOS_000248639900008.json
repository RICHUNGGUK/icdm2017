Secondary structure prediction problem has been known for almost a quarter of century. In this paper, new machine learning methods such as LAD, LEM2, and MODLEM have been used for secondary protein structure prediction with the aim to choose the best among them which will be later parallelized in order to handle a huge amount of data sets.", "paper_title": "New machine learning methods for prediction of protein secondary structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000248639900008"}
