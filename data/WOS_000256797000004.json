This article is composed of three parts. The first one frames ACO in current trends of research on metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization. The second outlines some current research within the ACO community, reporting recent results obtained on different problems, while the third part focuses on a particular research line, named ANTS, providing some details on the algorithm and presenting results recently obtained on a prototypical strongly constrained problem: the set partitioning problem.", "paper_title": "Very strongly constrained problems: An ant colony optimization approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000256797000004"}
