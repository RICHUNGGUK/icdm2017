Different methodologies as well as commercial systems have been proposed and developed to tackle this task. Most of these systems are based on one or both of two major image retrieval schemes, namely annotation-based image retrieval and content-based image retrieval. The former is simple and accurate, provided some annotations have been added to the images. However, such annotations are often missed in most of images available in large datasets such as the WWW. To tackle this deficiency, we propose a method that could automatically annotate images with some keywords that could feasibly describe the semantics of the images. A set of training images as well as their annotations are trained to find the relationships between images as well as between keywords. New image could then be annotated and retrieved according to such relationships. Our preliminary experiments suggest promising result in both image annotation task and image retrieval task.", "paper_title": "SEMANTIC MATCHING AND ANNOTATION OF IMAGES BY SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264294800014"}
