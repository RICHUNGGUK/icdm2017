(2004) [6]. We first reformulate the model derived from an energetic variational formulation into a form which is suitable for numerical approximation, and establish the energy dissipation law. Then, we develop a stabilized, decoupled, time discretization scheme for the coupled nonlinear system. The scheme is unconditionally energy stable and leads to linear and decoupled elliptic equations to be solved at each time step. Stability analysis and ample numerical simulations are presented thereafter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
