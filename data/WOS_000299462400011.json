Design/methodology/approach - The ACO is employed to obtain optimal routes in an equivalent graph representation of the discretized design space, with each route corresponding to a given distribution of material. Findings - The problem associated with the maximization of the torque of a c-core magnetic actuator is investigated, in which part of the yoke is discretized into a 16 x 8 grid and can assume three different materials: air, pure iron and a magnetic material. Research limitations/implications - The results of the c-core magnetic actuator problem, which are in agreement with literature available, show the adequacy of the proposed approach to TO of electromagnetic devices. Practical implications - The graph representation of the design space permits the solution of topological design problems with an arbitrary number of materials. Originality/value - The results illustrate the potential of the methodology in dealing with multi-domain TO problems, and the possibility to extend the application to 3D problems.", "paper_title": "Multi-domain topology optimization with ant colony systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299462400011"}
