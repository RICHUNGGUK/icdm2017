Previous papers on this topic are either based on restrictive underlying assumptions about the flow structure or are limited to a small number of states. In this paper, a generalized approach for the construction of a multidimensional state space first order Markov chain that represents the mixing of monodisperse particles is introduced. The transition probability matrix is computed directly using results obtained from a discrete element model. This work shows that, if accurate measurements of the state of the system are available, the associated Markov operator leads to a good estimate of the particle dynamics in the system.
