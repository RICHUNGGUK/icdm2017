Initially, a state of the art of mobility assistance, interfaces and types of commands for smart wheelchairs is presented. The deictic concept, and more particularly, the approach used for the design of our interface is examined Then the two functionalities carried out to implement this type of interface, as well as methodology used to control our wheelchair are illustrated. Finally, the usability of this deictic approach for the assistance to the driving of a smart wheelchair is discussed.
