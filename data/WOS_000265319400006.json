Whilst many methods for the requirements analysis phase of the DWs have been proposed, the elicitation of security requirements as non-functional requirements has not received sufficient attention. Hence, in this paper we propose a methodology for the DW design based on Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and the standard Software Process Engineering Metamodel Specification (SPEM) from the Object Management Group (OMG). We define four phases comprising of several activities and steps, an d five disciplines which cover the whole DW design. Our methodology adapts the i* framework to be used under MDA and the SPEM approaches in order to elicit and develop security requirements for DWs. The benefits of our proposal are shown through an example related to the management of the pharmacies consortium business. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
