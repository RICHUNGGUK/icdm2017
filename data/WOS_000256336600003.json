We argue, in particular, that the introduction of obligations can provide a new reading of the concepts of intention and intentionality. Then we examine the notion of social agent (i.e., an agent where obligations prevail over intentions) and discuss some computational and philosophical issues related to it. We show that the notion of social agent either requires more complex computations or has some philosophical drawbacks.", "paper_title": "BIO logical agents: Norms, beliefs, intentions in defeasible logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000256336600003"}
