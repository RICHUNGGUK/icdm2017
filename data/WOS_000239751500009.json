It is very important to provide analysts with guaranteed error bounds for approximate results to aggregation queries in enterprise applications such as decision support systems. We propose a general method of providing tight error bounds for approximate results to OLAP range-sum queries. We perform an extensive experiment on diverse data sets and examine the effectiveness of the proposed method for various data cube dimensions and query sizes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
