However, in slow fading channels, it is highly possible for consecutive block transmissions to be correlated. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer adaptive transmission scheme, which is an optimum combination of modulation format and packet size, combined with selective repeat automatic repeat request (SR-ARQ) to improve the throughput in correlated slow fading channels. We apply it multi-state Markov system model to analyze the system performance and to optimize the selection of modulation levels at the physical layer and packet sizes at the data link layer in a correlated slow fading channel. which is also described by it finite-state Markov chain. A general closed-form expression of the average throughput for this cross-layer adaptive transmission scheme is presented. Simulation results show that our adaptive transmission scheme combined with SR-ARQ can obtain a good performance in correlated slow fading channels. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
