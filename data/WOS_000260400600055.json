For a given concept, manifold ranking (MR) is first employed to MIL (referred as MR-MIL) for effectively mining the positive instances (i.e. regions in images) embedded in the positive bags (i.e. images). With the mined positive instances, the semantic model of the concept is built by the probabilistic output of SVM classifier. The experimental results reveal that high annotation accuracy can be achieved at region-level.", "paper_title": "MR-MIL: Manifold Ranking Based Multiple-Instance Learning for Automatic Image Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600055"}
