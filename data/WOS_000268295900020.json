The best algorithmic feature of our method is using two local Gauss integrations to replace projection operator. We theoretically discuss the relationship between our method and common VMS method for the Taylor-Hood elements, and show that the nonlinear system derived from our method by finite element discretization is much smaller than that of common VMS method computationally. Additionally we present numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness, storage, computational complexity of our method. Finally, we give some numerical simulations of the nonlinear flow problems to show good stability and accuracy properties of the method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
