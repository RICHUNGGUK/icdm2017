A key challenge that remains in this area is how to select the best algorithms and protocols to communicate effectively on a large scale. In this paper, we focus in particular on large scale mobile networks where effectiveness depends on the requirements of the application at hand and on the context of the peers in the network. We propose a framework for context-aware adaptive information sharing that allows the evaluation of and comparison with alternative information routing protocols using network metrics to measure a variety of quality attributes of the information dissemination protocols. These metrics can then be used to verify which protocol is best suited for a particular application. We illustrate our evaluation framework with different information dissemination protocols in an inter-vehicle communication scenario.", "paper_title": "Evaluation framework for adaptive context-aware routing in large scale mobile peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286329800004"}
