Let (s,t)-exemplar distance denote the exemplar distance problem on two genomes G(1) and G(2), where each gene occurs at most s times in G(1) and at most t times in G(2). We show that the simplest nontrivial variant of the exemplar distance problem, (1, 2)-EXEMPLAR DISTANCE, is already hard to approximate for a wide variety of distance measures, including both popular genome rearrangement measures such as adjacency disruptions, signed reversals, and signed double-cut-and-joins, and classic string edit distance measures such as Levenshtein and Hamming distances.", "paper_title": "Inapproximability of (1,2)-Exemplar Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000332481000005"}
