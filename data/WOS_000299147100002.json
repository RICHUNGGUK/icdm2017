The proposed System-on-Chip is intended to be designed as a hardware coprocessor embedded in the camera sensor node. The goal is to relieve the node microcontroller of the image compression tasks and to achieve high-speed and low power image processing. The interest of our solution is twofold. First, compression settings can be changed at runtime (upon reception of a request message sent by an end user or according to the internal state of the camera sensor node). Second, the image compression chain includes a (block of) pixel interleaving scheme which significantly improves the robustness against packet loss in image communication. We discuss in depth the internal hardware architecture of the encoder chip which is planned to reach high performance running in FPGAs and in ASIC circuits. Synthesis results and relevant performance comparisons with related works are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
