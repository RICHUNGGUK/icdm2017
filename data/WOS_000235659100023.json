In such a system each sensor node operates autonomously with no central node of control in the network, and it can be a data source as well as a data sink. We aim at developing energy efficient protocols that disseminate information to any nodes that are interested in. Two protocols are proposed, one is based on the quorum scheme and the other is based on the home-agent scheme. The proposed protocols have two advantages: 1) High success rate for data retrieval; 2) Fully distributed. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show their significant improvements on energy efficiency over the previous protocols.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient protocols for information dissemination in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100023"}
