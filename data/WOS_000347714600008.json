We show that the infinitary unique normal form property (UN infinity) fails by an example of a weakly orthogonal TRS with two collapsing rules. By translating this example, we show that UN infinity also fails for the infinitary lambda beta eta-calculus. As positive results we obtain the following: Infinitary confluence, and hence UN infinity, holds for weakly orthogonal TRSs that do not contain collapsing rules. To this end we refine the compression lemma. Furthermore, we establish the triangle and diamond properties for infinitary multi-steps (complete developments) in weakly orthogonal TRSs, by refining an earlier cluster-analysis for the finite case.", "paper_title": "INFINITARY TERM REWRITING FOR WEAKLY ORTHOGONAL SYSTEMS PROPERTIES AND COUNTEREXAMPLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714600008"}
