The formulation is systematically derived based on the variational multiscale formalism and the method of horizontal lines. The derivation does not need the assumption that the fine-scale variables do not depend on the time, which is the case with the conventional derivation of multiscale stabilized formulations for transient mixed problems. An expression for the stabilization parameter is obtained in terms of a bubble function, and appropriate bubble functions for various finite elements are also presented. Under the proposed formulation, equal-order interpolation for the velocity and pressure (which is computationally the most convenient) is stable. Representative numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed formulation. Spatial and temporal convergence studies are also performed, and the proposed formulation performed well.
