This paper presents the results of a spectral HRV analysis conducted with 46 patients. HRV indices for the whole night show differences among patients with severe and mild apnea, and healthy subjects. These differences also appear when performing the analysis over 5-min intervals, regarding apneas being present or not in the intervals. Differences were also observed when analyzing the HRV nocturnal evolution. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk remains constant for OSA patients while it increases towards the end of the night for healthy subjects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
