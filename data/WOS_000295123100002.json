In this paper, even-variable-balanced RSBFs with maximum algebraic immunity (AI) are investigated. At first, we give an original construction of 2(m)-variable-balanced RSBFs with maximum AI. Then we improve the construction to obtain more 2(m)-variable-balanced RSBFs with maximum AI, and these new RSBFs have higher non-linearity than all previously obtained RSBFs. Further, we generalise our construction of 2(m)-variable RSBFs to a new construction that can generate any even-variable RSBFs.", "paper_title": "Balanced rotation symmetric boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity", "paper_id": "WOS:000295123100002"}
