Each island GA of this multipopulation technique self-adapts the period for exchanging information with the other islands regarding the local evolution process. Thus, the different islands can develop different migration settings behaving like a heterogeneous dGA. The proposed algorithm is tested on a large set of instances of the Max-Cut problem, and it can be easily applied to other optimization problems. The results of this heterogeneous dGA are competitive with the best existing algorithms, with the added advantage of avoiding time-consuming preliminary tests for tuning the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Designing heterogeneous distributed GAs by efficiently self-adapting the migration period", "paper_id": "WOS:000303480300004"}
