However, there is dearth of knowledge about what dimensions of flow and how they actually influence online consumer behavior as flow is difficult to conceptualize and measure. This research examines flow and its effects on online consumer behavior in a unified model which draws upon theory of planned behavior (TPB). The four important dimensions of flow (concentration, enjoyment, time distortion, telepresence) are explored in terms of their antecedent effects on online consumer behavior. Results of this empirical study show that flow influences online consumer behavior through several important latent constructs. Findings of this research not only extend the existing knowledge of flow and its antecedent effects on online consumer behavior but also provide new insights into how flow can be conceptualized and studied in the e-commerce setting.", "paper_title": "THE IMPACT OF FLOW ON ONLINE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000281129300001"}
