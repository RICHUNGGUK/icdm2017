On the basis of it, an efficiency evaluation model for complex system integrating Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with fuzzy synthetic evaluation method has been set up, which can obtain more reasonable and objective evaluation result for complex system. Through analyzing an example of the system fighting efficiency for missile and gun integration weapon, the result shows the validity and feasibility of this method.", "paper_title": "An AHP-fuzzy synthetic evaluation model based on evidence theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300013"}
