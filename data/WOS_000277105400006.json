This theory offers four constructs that inform properties of modeling grammars in the form of ontological deficiencies, and their implications for development and use of conceptual modeling in IS practice. In this paper we report on the development of a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the perceptions that individuals have of the ontological deficiencies of conceptual modeling grammars. We describe a multi-stage approach for instrument development that incorporates feedback from expert and user panels. We also report on a field test of the instrument with 590 modeling practitioners. We further study how different levels of modeling experience influence user perceptions of ontological deficiencies of modeling grammars. We provide implications for practice and future research.
