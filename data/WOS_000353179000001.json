EA is managed, developed, and maintained throughout the EA Implementation Methodology (EAIM). Objective: The aims of this study are to identify the existing effective practices that are used by existing EAIMs, identify the factors that affect the effectiveness of EAIM, identify the current tools that are used by existing EAIMs, and identify the open problems and areas related to EAIM for improvement. Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out. 669 papers were retrieved by a manual search in 6 databases and 46 primary studies were finally included. Result: From these studies 33% were journal articles, 41% were conference papers while 26% were contributions from the studies consisted of book chapters. Consequently, 28 practices, 19 factors, and 15 tools were identified and analysed. Conclusion: Several rigorous researches have been done in order to provide effective EAIM, however there are still problems in components of EAIM, including: there is lack of tool support for whole part of EA implementation, there are deficiency in addressing the EAIM's practices especially in modeling, management, and maintenance, there is lack of consideration on non-functional requirement in existing EAIM, there is no appropriate consideration on requirement analysis in most existing EAIM. This review provides researchers with some guidelines for future research on this topic. It also provides broad information on EAIM, which could be useful for practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
