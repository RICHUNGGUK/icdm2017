The bias current range and modulation current range are 1-75 mA and 5-80 mA respectively. The DC-coupled interface between the driver and the laser diode can tolerate the output transient voltage as low as 0.6v. The novel digital APC loop can stabilize the output average optical power and extinction ratio respectively within +/- 0.3 dBm and +/- 0.4 dB (-40 to 100 degrees C) with less than 0.6 mu s initialization time and infinite bias current and modulation current hold time. Moreover, the fast burst response is achieved with burst on/off time less than 5 ns. The chip is implemented in a TSMC 0.35-mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology and occupies an area of 1.56 x 1.67 mm(2) with power consumption of 105 mW from a supply voltage of 2.5 v.", "paper_title": "DC-coupled burst-mode laser diode driver with automatic power control for 1.25Gbit/s PON system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234308500010"}
