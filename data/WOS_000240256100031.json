We prove the following quite surprising result: the union of all zones reached by different interleavings of the same set of transitions is convex. Consequently we can improve the standard reachability computation for timed automata by merging such zones whenever they are encountered. Since passage of time distributes over union, we can continue the successor computation from the new zone and eliminate completely the explosion due to interleaving.", "paper_title": "On interleaving in timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000240256100031"}
