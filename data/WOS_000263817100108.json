Perhaps surprisingly, there have been no comprehensive studies in the scientific literature comparing the various ordinal classifiers. This paper compares the accuracy of five ordinal and three non-ordinal classifiers on a benchmark of fifteen real-world datasets. The results show that the ordinal classifiers that were tested had no meaningful statistical advantage over the corresponding non-ordinal classifiers. Furthermore, the ordinal classifiers that guaranteed monotonic classifications showed no meaningful statistical advantage over a majority-based classifier. We suggest that the tested ordinal classifiers did not properly utilize the order information in the presence of non-monotonic noise. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
