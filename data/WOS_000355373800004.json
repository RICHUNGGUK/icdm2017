We first formulate the optimal routing problem as an integer linear programming problem. Subsequently, we develop a polynomial time heuristic algorithm which can efficiently decrease the computational complexity. Moreover, we design a distributed routing protocol based on the random walk method which is effective in large-scale WSNs by avoiding solving the linear programming formulations. The simulation results show that the cross-layer routing scheme significantly reduces energy consumption and end-to-end transmission delay. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
