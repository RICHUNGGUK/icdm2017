We call these relations synchronous. In the eighties Angluin and Hoover and then Lauchli and Savioz introduced a proper subfamily which the first authors called regular prefix. Our main result shows that given a synchronous relation it is decidable whether or not it is regular prefix. Incidentally we also show that the family of regular prefix relations is uniformizable in the sense that all such relations contain a partial function with the same domain whose graph is a regular prefix relation.", "paper_title": "Deciding Whether or Not a Synchronous Relation is Regular Prefix", "paper_id": "WOS:000343005000001"}
