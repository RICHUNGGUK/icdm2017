SuperIso v2.3, in addition to the isospin asymmetry of B --> K*gamma, which was the main purpose of the first version, incorporates new flavor observables such as the branching ratio of B --> mu(+)mu(-), the branching ratio of B --> tau nu(tau). the branching ratio of B --> D tau v(tau) and the branching ratio of K --> mu nu(mu). The calculation of the branching ratio of B --> X-S gamma is also improved in this version, as it now includes NNLO Standard Model contributions in addition to partial NLO supersymmetric contributions. The program also computes the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g - 2). Four sample models are included in the package. namely mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and GMSB. SuperIso uses a SUSY Les Houches Accord file (SLHA1 or SLHA2) as input, which can be either generated automatically by the program via a call to external spectrum calculators, or provided by the user. The calculation of the observables is detailed in the Appendices, where a suggestion for the allowed intervals for each observable is also provided.

Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 745 External routines: ISASUGRA/ISAJET and/or SOFTSUSY Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes Nature of problem: Calculation of flavor physics observables as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with minimal flavor violation, in order to derive constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space. Solution method: SuperIso uses a SUSY Les Houches Accord file, which can be either generated automatically via a call to SOFTSUSY or ISAJET, or provided by the user. This file contains the masses and couplings of the supersymmetric particles. SuperIso then computes the most constraining flavor physics observables and the muon (g - 2). Superlso is able to perform the calculations in different supersymmetry breaking scenarios, such as mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and GMSB. Reasons for new version: This new version incorporates the calculation of several additional observables, and the inclusive branching ratio of b --> s gamma is now computed at NNLO accuracy for the Standard Model. The implemented routines are therefore extensively modified. Summary of revisions: Compatibility with the SLHA2 input file format Implementation of the calculation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment Implementation of observables related to leptonic and semi-leptonic B meson decays Implementation of observables related to K meson decays Improvement of the calculations of the branching ratio of b --> s gamma (now at NNLO accuracy) and the isospin asymmetry of B --> K * gamma Update of parameters to their latest values Unusual features: The code is very modular, and new routines for calculating new observables can be easily added.
