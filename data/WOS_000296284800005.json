These graphs have been studied extensively from a graph-theoretic point of view. In this paper, we introduce and study the algorithmic complexity of finding Konig-Egervary subgraphs of a given graph. In particular, given a graph G and a nonnegative integer k, we are interested in the following questions: 1. does there exist a set of k vertices (edges) whose deletion makes the graph Konig-Egervary? 2. does there exist a set of k vertices (edges) that induce a Konig-Egervary subgraph?.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of Konig Subgraph Problems and Above-Guarantee Vertex Cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000296284800005"}
