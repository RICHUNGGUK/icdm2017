In this paper, we consider how to get the consistent data from an inconsistent XML document. There are two basic concepts for this problem: Repair is the data consistent with the integrity constraints, and also minimally differs from tile original one. Consistent data is the data common for every possible repair. First we give a general constraint model for XML, which can express tile commonly discussed integrity constraints, including functional dependencies, keys and multivalued dependencies. Next we provide a repair framework for inconsistent XML document with three basic update operations: node insertion, node deletion and node value modification. Following this approach, we introduce the concept of repair for inconsistent XML document, discuss the chase method to generate repairs, and prove some important properties of the chase. Finally we give a method to obtain tile greatest lower bound of all possible repairs, which is sufficient for consistent data. We also implement prototypes Of Our method, and evaluate our framework and algorithms in the experiment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
