The method facilitates intuitive and efficient constructions of open and closed PH spline curves, that typically agree closely with the corresponding cubic B-spline curves. The C-2 PH quintic spline curve associated with a given control polygon and knot sequence is defined to be the \"good\" interpolant to the nodal points of the C-2 cubic spline curve with the same B-spline control points, knot sequence, and end conditions-it may be computed to machine precision by just a few Newton-Raphson iterations from a close starting approximation. The relation between the PH spline and its control polygon is invariant under similarity transformations. Multiple knots may be inserted to reduce the order of continuity to C-1 or C-0 at specified points, and by means of double knots the PH splines offer a linear precision and local shape modification capability. Although the non-linear nature of PH splines precludes proofs for certain features of cubic B-splines, such as convex-hull confinement and the variation-diminishing property, this is of little practical significance in view of the close agreement of the two curves in most cases (in fact, the PH spline typically exhibits a somewhat better curvature distribution).
