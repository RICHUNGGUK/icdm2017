We propose a modified algorithm of phase congruency to detect image features based on two-dimensional (2-D) discrete Hilbert transform. Windowing technique is introduced to locate image features in the algorithm. Local energy is obtained by convoluting original image with two operators of removing direct current (DC) component over current window and 2-D Hilbert transform, respectively. Then, local energy is divided with the sum of Fourier amplitude of current window to retrieve the value of phase congruency. Meanwhile, we add the DC component of current window on original image to the denominator of phase congruency model to reduce the noise. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with some existing algorithm in systematical way. The experimental results of images in Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) and remotely sensed images show that this algorithm is readily to detect image features. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
