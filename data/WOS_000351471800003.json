A fire begins at some vertex and spreads to all neighbors in discrete steps; in the meantime f vertices can be deleted at each time-step. Let f be the least f such that, with probability 1, any fire on G can be stopped in finite time. We show that f is bounded between two linear functions of . The lower bound makes use of a new result concerning oriented percolation in the plane; the constant factor in the upper bound is is tight, provided a certain conjecture, for which we offer supporting evidence, is correct.
