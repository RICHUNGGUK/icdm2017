To evaluate the specific cognitive activities that take place during the recognition of a 3D structure, the act of mentally framing 3D images from plane figures and the ability to match mental images to actual objects were investigated. The results reveal that the effects of depth cues such as shade and color in the 3D images significantly facilitated the cognitive process in human-computer interfaces. In addition, optimal presentation angles for the matching phase exist; these findings suggest effective methods in a field requiring quick judgment based on high cognitive functions.", "paper_title": "Optimal View Angles in Three-Dimensional Objects Constructed From Plane Figures as Mental Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686300002"}
