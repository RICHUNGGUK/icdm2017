In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using vibrotactile feedback for in-vehicle information delivery. First, we measured the spectral characteristics of ambient vibrations in a vehicle, and designed clearly distinguishable sinusoidal vibrations. We further selected via dissimilarity rating the four sets of sinusoidal vibrations which had three to six vibrations. Second, we evaluated the learnability of the vibration sets when associated with common menu items of a Driver Information System (DIS). We also replaced the two most confused sinusoidal vibrations with patterned messages, and assessed the degree of learnability improvement. Finally, we evaluated the extent to which participants could select a desired function in a DIS via vibrotactile messages while simultaneously performing a driving-like primary task with higher priority. The results demonstrated high potential for vibrotactile messages to be effectively used for the communicative transfer of in-vehicle system information.", "paper_title": "Vibrotactile Feedback for Information Delivery in the Vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000289470300007"}
