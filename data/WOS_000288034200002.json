One method (Ren Yu-Xin, Computers and Fluids 2003; 32: 1379-1403) uses the rotated method and another one (Hao Wu et al., submitted) is the hybrid method. Taking into account the efficiency, accuracy and robustness, the hybrid method is better than rotated method for HLLC solver. A series of test problems prove this conclusion.
