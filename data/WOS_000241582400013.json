Censored sampling offers a principled way of reducing this initial training time. We study the trade-off between training time and model precision by varying the censoring threshold, and analyzing the consequent impact on the performance of an optimal restart strategy, based on an estimated model of runtime distribution. We present experiments with a SAT solver on a graph-coloring benchmark. Due to the \"heavy-tailed\" runtime distribution, a modest censoring can already reduce training time by a few orders of magnitudes. The nature of the optimization process underlying the restart strategy renders its performance surprisingly robust, also to more aggressive censoring.", "paper_title": "Impact of censored sampling on the performance of restart strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400013"}
