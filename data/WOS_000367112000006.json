The GluCl based model was found to the represent the structure of rho 1 GABA(C) receptors. The GABA pose docked in the selected best model was confirmed by QM-polarized ligand docking and induced fit docking protocol, and used to study molecular interactions in the rho 1 GABA binding site. The potential interactions of identified residues are discussed. This study identified several residues with potential ligand interactions located on loops F and G with their side chain oriented toward the binding site such as Ser215 and GIn83. The partial agonists muscimol and imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA) were docked into the binding site of the most reliable 'GABA bound' homology model. The potency and efficacy of these partial agonists in activating recombinant rho 1 receptors were correlated with their docking results. The model predicts that muscimol resembles GABA in the docking pose with similar interactions. However, I4AA has a very different docking pose to GABA and was predicted by the model to form pi-pi stacking with aromatic residues in the orthosteric binding site. A set of TPMPA bound rho 1 homology models based on the GluCl alpha 'apo state' template was built in order to study a competitive antagonist in the rho 1 orthosteric binding site. The results demonstrated the ability of our model to explain most experimental findings and predict potential roles of residues within the orthosteric binding site.
