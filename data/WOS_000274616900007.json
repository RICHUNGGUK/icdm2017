The considered structures are consisted from main portal frames, which are mutually connected with purlins. The optimization is performed by the mixed-integer non-linear programming approach, MINLP. The MINLP superstructure of different structure/topology and standard cross-section alternatives has been generated and the MINLP optimization model of the structure has been developed. The defined cost objective function is subjected to the set of (in)equality constraints known from the structural analysis. Internal forces and deflections are calculated by the elastic first-order analysis constraints. The dimensioning constraints of steel members are defined in accordance with Eurocode 3. The modified outer-approximation/equality-relaxation (OA/ER) algorithm, a two-phase MINLP strategy and a special prescreening procedure of discrete alternatives are used for the optimization. A numerical example of the cost optimization of a single-storey industrial steel building is presented at the end of the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
