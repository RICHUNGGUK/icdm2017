This procedure exploits the dependence among cross-sectional units to construct a counterfactual of the treated unit(s), and it is an appropriate method for research events that occur at an aggregate level like countries or regions and that affect only one or a small number of units. The implementation of the pampe package is illustrated using data from Hong Kong and 24 other units, by examining the economic impact of the political and economic integration of Hong Kong with mainland China in 1997 and 2004 respectively.", "paper_title": "An R Package for the Panel Approach Method for Program Evaluation: pampe", "paper_id": "WOS:000368551800009"}
