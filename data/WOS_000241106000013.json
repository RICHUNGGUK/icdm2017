The number of concepts in a variable threshold concept lattice is far less than that in a fuzzy concept lattice. Then a dependence space is constructed according to the variable threshold concept lattice. Applying the congruences on the dependence space, a closed set is obtained. And a new approach is discussed by using the closed set to construct variable threshold formal concepts.", "paper_title": "Variable threshold concept lattice and dependence space", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000013"}
