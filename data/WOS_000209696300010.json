In this letter, we introduce and propose adaptive relay-selection rules to offer a tradeoff between fairness and energy consumption at each node for a network with multiple, mutually cooperative nodes. Our performance analysis is supplemented by simulation results to illustrate the significant energy savings of the proposed optimal power allocation and the relay-selection rules.", "paper_title": "Power Efficient Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300010"}
