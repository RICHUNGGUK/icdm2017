While some wireless packet fair queuing algorithms to achieve the per-flow throughput fairness have been proposed, they are not appropriate for guaranteeing QoS in multi-rate wireless LAN environments. We propose a wireless packet scheduling algorithm that uses the multi-state (multi-rate) wireless channel model and performs packet scheduling by taking into account the channel usage time of each flow. The proposed algorithm aims at per-flow protection by providing equal channel usage time for each flow. To achieve the per-flow protection, we propose a temporally fair scheduling algorithm called Contention-Aware Temporally fair Scheduling (CATS) which provides equal channel usage time for each flow. Channel usage time is defined as the sum of the packet transmission time and the contention overhead time due to the CSMA/CA mechanism. The CATS algorithm provides per-flow protection in wireless LAN environments where the channel qualities of mobile stations are dynamic over time, and where the packet sizes are application-dependent. We also extend CATS to Decentralized-CATS (D-CATS) to provide per-flow protection in the uplink transmission. Using an NS-2 simulation, we evaluate the fairness property of both CATS and D-CATS in various scenarios. Simulation results show that the throughput of mobile stations with stable link conditions is not degraded by the mobility (or link instability) of other stations or by packet size variations. D-CATS also shows less delay and less delay jitter than FIFO. In addition, since D-CATS can coordinate the number of contending mobile stations, the overall throughput is not degraded as the number of mobile stations increases.", "paper_title": "Temporal fairness guarantee in multi-rate wireless LANs for per-flow protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000244306800007"}
