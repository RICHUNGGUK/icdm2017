The new hash function is made of cubic polynomials which are the products of quadratic polynomials and linear polynomials. The authors design the quadratic-polynomial part of the compression function based on the centre map of the multivariate public key cryptosystem Matsumoto-Imai cryptosystem (MI). The hash function QML can keep the three cryptography properties and be immune to the pre-image attack, second pre-image attack, collision attack, differential attack and algebraic attack. The required memory storage is about 50% of the one which is built of the cubic polynomials and their coefficients are random. On the avalanche effect, by experiments the authors get the result that about one half of the output bits are different when one input bit is changed randomly. The one-round diffusion of the hash function QML is twice of that of Blake. Also the authors simplify the matrixes of the new hash function, analyse the rationality and show the comparable data. Finally, the authors give the advice to the parameters of the new hash function and summarise the paper.", "paper_title": "New multivariate hash function quadratic polynomials multiplying linear polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000326462600003"}
