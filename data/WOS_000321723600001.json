We propose a framework that always computes a feasible solution (i.e. a set of paths and link activations) if there exists one, by optimally solving a mixed integer-nonlinear problem. Such solution can be computed in minutes or tens thereof for e.g. grids of up to 4 x 4 nodes. We also propose heuristics based on Lagrangian decomposition to compute suboptimal solutions considerably faster and/or for larger WMNs, up to about 50 nodes. We show that the heuristic solutions are near-optimal, and we exploit them to gain insight on the schedulability in WMN, i.e. to investigate the optimal placement of one or more gateways from a delay bound perspective, and to investigate how the schedulability is affected by the transmission range.
