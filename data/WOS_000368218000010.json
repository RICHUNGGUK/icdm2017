At present, the data is stored in a disorder way, thereby leading to difficult to utilize. To make them be used expediently, this paper presents a body-oriented cloud storage model. This paper firstly designs some metadata which contain BSNs contexts, time, sensor position, sensor type and health state, to describe the physiological data in BSNs. Then, the physiological data are encapsulated with the metadata in a coordinator of BSNs. At last, all of them are stored in repositories based on the body-oriented cloud storage model. We experimentally compare the performance of the proposed model to that of traditional one. The results show it can reduce the storage space and make BSNs data utilized expediently.", "paper_title": "A Body-Oriented Cloud Storage Model for Body Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000368218000010"}
