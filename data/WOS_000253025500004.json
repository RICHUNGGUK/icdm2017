Then a computational model for the forced expiration from the heterogeneous lung was used to analyse the regime and degree of flow limitation as well as movement and arrangement of the choke points. The conclusion is that flow limitation begins at similar time in every branch of the bronchial tree developing a parallel arrangement of the choke points. A serial configuration of flow-limiting sites is possible for short time periods in the case of increased airway heterogeneity. The most probable locations of choke points are the regions of airway junctions. The wave-speed mechanism is responsible for flow choking over most of vital capacity and viscous dissipation of pressure for the last part of the test. Turbulent dissipation, however, may play a significant role as a supporting factor in transition between wave-speed and viscous flow limitation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
