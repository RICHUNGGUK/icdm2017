We define a new, and as we believe, simpler and more natural framework: violator spaces, which constitute a proper generalization of LP-type problems. We show that Clarkson's randomized algorithms for low-dimensional linear programming work in the context of violator spaces. For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm for the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant number of blocks. We also give two new characterizations of LP-type problems: they are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type problems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets of a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the minimum of its intersection).", "paper_title": "Violator spaces: Structure and algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200034"}
