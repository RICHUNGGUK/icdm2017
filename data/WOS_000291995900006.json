Tsunami modeling is thus crucial to understanding and preparing for tsunami inundation. Recent research offers compelling examples of how basic modeling approaches can enhance our understanding of tsunami generation and propagation.", "paper_title": "Numerical Simulation of Complex Tsunami Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000291995900006"}
