We show how schedulability can be improved using gFPDS via appropriate choice of priority assignment and final nonpreemptive region lengths, and provide algorithms that optimize schedulability in this way. Via an experimental evaluation we compare the performance of multiprocessor scheduling using global approaches: gFPDS, gFPPS, and gFPNS, and also partitioned approaches employing FPDS, FPPS, and FPNS on each processor.", "paper_title": "Global and Partitioned Multiprocessor Fixed Priority Scheduling with Deferred Preemption", "paper_id": "WOS:000355679800009"}
