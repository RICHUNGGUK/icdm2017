These systems, when trained using data from human observations and questionnaires, can detect specific behaviors and attitudes with high accuracy. However, such data is time-consuming to collect, especially across an entire tutor curriculum. Therefore, to deploy a detector of behaviors or attitudes across an entire tutor curriculum, the detector must be able to transfer to a new tutor lesson without being re-trained using data from that lesson. In this paper, we present evidence that detectors of gaming the system can transfer to new lessons without re-training, and that training detectors with data from multiple lessons improves generalization, beyond just the gains from training with additional data.", "paper_title": "Generalizing detection of gaming the system across a tutoring curriculum", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100040"}
