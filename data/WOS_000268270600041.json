One of the challenges of strategic group analysis is the selection of the clustering method. In this study, the results of the strategic group analysis of Turkish contractors are presented to compare the performances of traditional cluster analysis techniques, self-organizing maps (SOM) and fuzzy C-means method (FCM) for strategic grouping. Findings reveal that traditional cluster analysis methods cannot disclose the overlapping strategic group structure and position of companies within the same strategic group. It is concluded that SOM and FCM can reveal the typology of the strategic groups better than traditional cluster analysis and they are more likely to provide useful information about the real strategic group structure.
