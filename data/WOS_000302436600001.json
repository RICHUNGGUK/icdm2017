We present a deterministic algorithm to approximate the marginal distribution of X at t = 1 by a discrete distribution, and hereby we get a deterministic quadrature rule for expectations E(f (X(1))). The construction of the algorithm is based on derandomization of the Euler scheme. We provide a worst case analysis for the computational cost and the error, assuming that the coefficients of the equation have bounded derivatives up to order four and that the derivatives off are polynomially bounded up to order four. In terms of the computational cost the error is almost of the order 2/3, if the diffusion coefficient is bounded away from zero, and in general we almost achieve the order 1/2. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
