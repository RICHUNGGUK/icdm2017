This nonlinearity introduces the possibility of chaotic behaviour as time (iteration) progresses. It is shown that for two-state systems, the d = 2 case is nonchaotic, while chaotic behaviour is found for degree d as low as 5. Examples, and open issues for other values of n and/or d, are also noted.", "paper_title": "Chaotic Evolution via Generalized Probabilistic Automata (Probabilistic Arrays)", "paper_id": "WOS:000303654500003"}
