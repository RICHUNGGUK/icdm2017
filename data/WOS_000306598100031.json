The TPCF enables multilinear image analysis in different color spaces, and demonstrates that color components provide additional information for robust FER. Using this framework, the components (in either RGB, YCbCr, CIELab or CIELuv space) of color images are unfolded to 2-D tensors based on multilinear algebra and tensor concepts, from which the features are extracted by Log-Gabor filters. The mutual information quotient method is employed for feature selection. These features are classified using a multiclass linear discriminant analysis classifier. The effectiveness of color information on FER using low-resolution and facial expression images with illumination variations is assessed for performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that color information has significant potential to improve emotion recognition performance due to the complementary characteristics of image textures. Furthermore, the perceptual color spaces (CIELab and CIELuv) are better overall for FER than other color spaces, by providing more efficient and robust performance for FER using facial images with illumination variation.", "paper_title": "Facial Expression Recognition in Perceptual Color Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100031"}
