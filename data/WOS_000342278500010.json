When multiple inputs and outputs are present, data envelopment analysis has been widely applied to assess efficiency. In cooperative groups, such as supply chains, a maximin decision approach can reflect not only overall system efficiency, but also efficiency of system elements. This paper discusses a maximin efficiency multistage supply chain model capable of measuring supply chain members performance as well as overall supply chain performance.", "paper_title": "Efficiency Evaluation for Supply Chains Using Maximin Decision Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278500010"}
