A trend has appeared that manufacturers change their attentions from providing only a product to offering both product and its services as a whole. However, preliminary literature review shows that few studies focus on integrated design of product and service. In the paper, a design approach is proposed for supporting conceptual design of product and maintenance (PM). In the layout process, the approach uses an improved quality function deployment (QFD) tool to translate customer requirements into concept specifications. An information exchange mechanism is developed to exploit the interrelationships between PM. In the mechanism, a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) tool is used to identify and analyse failure modes and their effects on the product concept. Then maintenance concepts are generated based on the results of QFD and FMEA. The proposed approach is applied in a conceptual design case of a horizontal directional drilling machine with its maintenance. Furthermore, the paper also addresses the management and improvement of PM concepts.", "paper_title": "A new approach for conceptual design of product and maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000279839700002"}
