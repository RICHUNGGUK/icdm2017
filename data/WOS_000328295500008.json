Particular stress is laid on the recent transition from forward design to inverse design where some significant limitations of previous cloaking solution in practice can be solved. We anticipate that future invisibility cloaking devices will be based on integration of both forward and inverse designs.", "paper_title": "Invisibility cloaks from forward design to inverse design", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500008"}
