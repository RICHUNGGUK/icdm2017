The proposed VS algorithm is inspired from the vortex pattern created by the vortical flow of the stirred fluids. To provide a good balance between the explorative and exploitative behavior of a search, the proposed method models its search behavior as a vortex pattern by using an adaptive step size adjustment scheme. The proposed VS algorithm is tested over 50 benchmark mathematical functions and the results are compared to both the single-solution based (Simulated Annealing, SA and Pattern Search, PS) and population-based (Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO2011 and Artificial Bee Colony, ABC) algorithms. A Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test is performed to measure the pair-wise statistical performances of the algorithms, the results of which indicate that the proposed VS algorithm outperforms the SA, PS and ABC algorithms while being competitive with the PSO2011 algorithm.
