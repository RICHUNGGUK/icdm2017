Indeed we show that the operations can be extended to the lattice of closed sets, but in this case it is only the linear identities that admit extension. Via the Scott topology, the theory is shown to be applicable to dcpo-completions of posets. We also explore connections with the construction of free algebras in the context of monotone convergence spaces. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
