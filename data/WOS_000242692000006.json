A new coordination mechanism through dynamic local adjustment (CDLA) is presented, and coordination is achieved when every agent utilizes explicitly the global system dynamics and performs iteratively a dynamic local adjustment procedure. The CDLA mechanism is investigated in an example multiagent shop floor system. The results show that the example manufacturing process is well-coordinated and the coordination approach is practically applicable and effective.", "paper_title": "Coordinating agents in shop floor environments from a dynamic systems perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000242692000006"}
