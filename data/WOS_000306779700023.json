However, for critical applications of WSNs there is a great need to access the real-time data inside the WSN from the nodes, because the real-time data may no longer be accessed through the base station only. So, the real-time data can be given access directly to the external users (parties) those who are authorized to access data as and when they demand. The user authentication plays a vital role for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a new password-based user authentication scheme in hierarchical wireless sensor networks. Our proposed scheme achieves better security and efficiency as compared to those for other existing password-based approaches. In addition, our scheme has merit to change dynamically the user's password locally without the help of the base station or gateway node. Furthermore, our scheme supports dynamic nodes addition after the initial deployment of nodes in the existing sensor network. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
