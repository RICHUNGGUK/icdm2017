First, we give a problem formulation that we consider throughout this letter. We next introduce a transformation law and gives its mathematical certification. Then, we apply the transformation method to an example and consider control design based on chained structure for the example in order to confirm the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Transformation and Chained Structure for a Class of Nonlinear Affine Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700032"}
