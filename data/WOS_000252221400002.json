Doing so would assist the trusting agent in its decision process and would also give the trusting agent a hint of the direction in which the interaction might head. The possible risk in an interaction is a combination of the probability of failure and the possible consequences of failure of an interaction. In this paper, we propose a methodology by which the trusting agent determines the probability of failure in interacting with a probable trusted agent. The determined probability of failure by the trusting agent is according to the specific demand of its future interaction with the probable trusted agent. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
