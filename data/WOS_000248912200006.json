The anisotropic diffusion we propose is based on a texture description provided by a set of Gabor filters and allows reducing speckle noise while preserving edges. Furthermore, it is used to extract an initial pre-segmentation of breast tumors which is used as initialization for the active contours technique. This technique has been adapted to the characteristics of ultrasonography by adding certain texture-related terms which provide a better discrimination of the regions inside and outside the nodules. These terms allow obtaining a more accurate contour when the gradients are not high and uniform.", "paper_title": "Texture-oriented anisotropic filtering and geodesic active contours in breast tumor ultrasound segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248912200006"}
