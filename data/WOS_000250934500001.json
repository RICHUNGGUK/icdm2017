We have incorporated the standard idea into topology optimization, and developed a feature-based structure topology optimization method. The method applies a real valued function to implicitly represent complex material interfaces of a design structure, and employs constructive solid geometry (CSG) to describe the design structure based on a set of simple geometric primitives during the topological optimization process. Meanwhile, the topological derivative analysis is adopted to determine where a simple geometric primitive is inserted in the current structure, and the morphing technology is used to determine which is chosen among the given geometric primitives by combining with the sensitivity analysis. In addition, Boolean operations on the geometric primitives are implemented by R-function method, which guarantees the regularity of the structure representation function, and which meets the need of the structure boundary smoothness for finite element analysis in the fixed Euler meshes. Finally, in order to further simplify the design structure, the shape matching technique is applied to merge the given geometric primitives so that each connected perforation is only constructed by one based geometric primitive.
