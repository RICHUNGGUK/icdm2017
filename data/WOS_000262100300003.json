Recently, however, RFID has generated widespread corporate interest as a means to waste management performance. In this paper, a vehicle routing model for waste collection is developed. The model not only uses precise data with respect to both quantity and location via RFID technology, but also includes single vehicle with a pre-determined capacity, multiple tours, and locations with deterministic waste quantities. Then a numerical example is solved via Dash Optimization XPress Solver to find an optimal route considering the locations of waste bins and the waste quantities. The impact of changing waste quantity on the operation cost is investigated considering the distance of the waste bins using variance analysis (ANOVA). With this method, municipality authorities can better manage itineraries and manpower, and have a monitoring system for the volume of the waste produced in the region of their responsibility.", "paper_title": "VEHICLE ROUTE OPTIMIZATION FOR RFID INTEGRATED WASTE COLLECTION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000262100300003"}
