In the control design process, a stable adaptive NN tracking control design technique is proposed for the nonaffine nonlinear systems with a mild assumption by combining a filtered tracking error with the implicit function theorem, input-to-state stability, and the small-gain theorem. The proposed stable control design technique not only overcomes the difficulty in controlling nonaffine nonlinear systems but also relaxes constraint conditions of the considered systems. In the learning process, the partial persistent excitation (PE) condition of radial basis function NNs is satisfied during tracking control to a recurrent reference trajectory. Under the PE condition and an appropriate state transformation, the proposed adaptive NN control is shown to be capable of acquiring knowledge on the implicit desired control input dynamics in the stable control process and of storing the learned knowledge in memory. Subsequently, an NN learning control design technique that effectively exploits the learned knowledge without re-adapting to the controller parameters is proposed to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Learning From Adaptive Neural Network Control of a Class of Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000328946500010"}
