Using principles of Robust Optimization, we propose robust schemes to handle data with ellipsoidal model and box model of uncertainty. The difficulty in treating l(0)-norm in feature selection problem is overcome by using appropriate approximations and Difference of Convex functions (DC) programming and DC Algorithms (DCA). The computational results show that the proposed robust optimization approaches are superior than a traditional approach in immunizing perturbation of the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
