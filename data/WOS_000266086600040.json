To this end, time series are transformed into symbol strings by means of several discretization methods and a distance based on a kernel between symbols in ordinal scale is used to calculate the similarity between time series. Hence, the idea proposed is the consideration of the simultaneous use of symbolic representation together with a kernel based approach for classification of time series, The methodology has been tested and compared with quantitative learning from a television-viewing shared data set and has yielded a high Success identification ratio.
