In one-sample prediction problem, we discuss the prediction of the life-lengths Y-j:ri (j = 1, 2,..., r(i); i = 1, 2,..., m) of all censored units in all m stages of censoring, where Y-j:ri denotes the jth-order statistics out of r(i) removed units at stage i. While in two-sample prediction problem, we discuss the prediction of the life-lengths (T-1,..., T-s) which is a second independent ordered sample of size s of future observation from the same population of Y, where Y is the progressively Type-II right-censored order statistics. Finally, we conduct a simulation study, and consider an illustrative example for our proposed predictors.", "paper_title": "On Bayes predictor of times to failure of Type-II progressively censored sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000371315300002"}
