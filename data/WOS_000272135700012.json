On the other hand, it is considerably more difficult to build services that combine telecommunications and Web aspects. Our thesis is that this is primarily due to the lack of a simple, yet expressive model for representing telco services. This paper presents a model, called the session data type (SDT), for the particular class of shared-experience services. The SDT model results in a considerable simplification of the design and the implementation of \"telco+web\" mashups. This paper provides several examples of such mashups and describes a prototype implementation.
