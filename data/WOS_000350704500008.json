Let G(n,m) be the set of connected graphs of order n and with m edges. In this note we determined the extremal graphs from G(n,m) with n <= m <= 2n-4 minimizing the matching energy. Also we determined the minimal matching energy of graphs from where m = n - 1+t and 1 <= t <= beta-1 and with a given matching number beta. Moreover, the above extremal graphs have been completely characterized.", "paper_title": "The Minimal Matching Energy of (n, m)-Graphs with a Given Matching Number", "paper_id": "WOS:000350704500008"}
