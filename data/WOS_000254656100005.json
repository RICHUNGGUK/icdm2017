A control theoretic methodology is applied to systematically design this control loop with analytic assurances of system stability and controller performance, despite unpredictable workloads and running environments. In a real server we are able to control power over a 1 second period to within 1 W and over an 8 second period to within 0.1 W. Conventional servers respond to power supply constraint situations by using simple open-loop policies to set a safe performance level in order to limit peak power consumption. We show that closed-loop control can provide higher performance under these conditions and implement this technique on an IBM BladeCenter HS20 server. Experimental results demonstrate that closed-loop control provides up to 82% higher application performance compared to open-loop control and up to 17% higher performance compared to a widely used ad-hoc technique.", "paper_title": "Power capping: a prelude to power shifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000254656100005"}
