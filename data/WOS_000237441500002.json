After revisiting the concepts of controllability and extendibility for systems of this type, the following main result is obtained: behaviors that are both controllable and extendable are characterized by a concatenation property that naturally generalizes the notion of strong controllability, originally introduced for two-dimensional discrete behaviors by Willems and the second author.", "paper_title": "Controllability and extendibility of continuous multi-dimensional behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000237441500002"}
