It can deal with all kinds of feature constraints such as internal holes, constraint lines, constraint points, density lines and density points, etc., and satisfy special requirements of mesh generation for numerical analysis. The quadrilateral mesh is generated based on the looping algorithm. As the core of the algorithm, the new splitting criteria are put forward to improve the quality and efficiency of mesh generation. The method of dealing with feature constraints is proposed by considering constraint lines and points, density lines and density points as internal holes with zero area. The method for generating boundary elements is also introduced to improve the element quality around the boundary and feature constraints. For the situation in which feature constraints subdivide the domain into sub-domains, an automatic determination method of sub-domain boundaries is presented. An improved looping algorithm is presented for 3D surface meshing with feature constraints. The determination of proper splitting plane and the handling of feature constraints are put forward. The program of quadrilateral mesh generation has been developed based on the method presented in this paper and successfully applied to mesh generation in several engineering fields.", "paper_title": "An automated approach to quadrilateral mesh generation with complex geometric feature constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000351203900009"}
