A three-point laser triangulation method is presented to find an initial posture of the robot and then a fuzzy extended information filtering (FEIF) method is used to improve the accuracy of the robot's posture estimation. With the odometric information from the driving wheels, a FEIF-based posture tracking algorithm is proposed to continuously keep trace of the robot's posture at slow speeds. Simulation and experimental results are conducted to show the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Laser pose estimation and tracking using fuzzy extended information filtering for an autonomous mobile robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000259273300002"}
