A 3D probabilistic facial expression recognition generic elastic model is proposed to reconstruct a 3D model from real-world human face using only a single 2D frontal image with/without facial expressions. Then, a feature library matrix (FLM) is generated for each subject in the gallery from all face poses by rotating the 3D reconstructed models and extracting features in the rotated face pose. Therefore, each FLM is subsequently rendered for each subject in the gallery based on triplet angles of face poses. In addition, before matching the FLM, an initial estimate of triplet angles is obtained from the face pose in probe images using an automatic head pose estimation approach. Then, an array of the FLM is selected for each subject based on the estimated triplet angles. Finally, the selected arrays from FLMs are compared with extracted features from the probe image by iterative scoring classification using the support vector machine. Convincing results are acquired to handle pose and expression changes on the Bosphorus, Face Recognition Technology (FERET), Carnegie Mellon University-Pose, Illumination, and Expression (CMU-PIE), and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) face databases compared with several state-of-the-art methods in pose-invariant face recognition. The proposed method not only demonstrates an excellent performance by obtaining high accuracy on all four databases but also outperforms other approaches realistically.", "paper_title": "Real-World and Rapid Face Recognition Toward Pose and Expression Variations via Feature Library Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000352534300007"}
