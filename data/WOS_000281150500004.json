This notion captures the idea that the view of any verifier in concurrent interaction can be reconstructed in almost the same time. Pandey et al. also constructed some precise concurrent zero-knowledge argument systems. In this paper we construct a precise bounded-concurrent zero-knowledge proof for NP, which has the precision p(n, y) = poly(n) + O(ny). Bounded-concurrency means that an a-priori bound on the number of concurrent sessions is specified before the protocol is constructed. Our result holds even if adversarial verifiers adopt the dynamic scheduling strategy. We make no setup assumption. The advantage of proof systems over argument systems is that the soundness property of proof systems can resist computationally-unbounded adversarial provers, while that of argument systems can only resist polynomial-time adversarial provers.", "paper_title": "Precise bounded-concurrent zero-knowledge proofs for NP", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500004"}
