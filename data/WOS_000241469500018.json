For each considered placement the what-if method inserts a placeholder into the schedule and simulates the processing of batch jobs currently known to the system. Each placement is evaluated wrt. well-known scheduling metrics. This information may be used by a Grid reservation service to choose the most likely successful placement of a reservation. According to the results of extensive simulations, the what-if method grants more reservations and improves the performance of local jobs compared to our previously used load method.", "paper_title": "On the placement of reservations into job schedules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500018"}
