This method involves a simple transform from a certain one-dimensional (I-D) signal to an expected two-dimensional (2-D) image. Unlike traditional methods, the input signal is generated by a simple 1-D function in our work instead of a sample texture. We first transform the 1-D input signal into frequency domain using fast Fourier transform. Based on the sufficient analysis in 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, where each of the coefficients expresses a texture feature in a certain direction, the 2-D pseudo-DCT coefficients are then constructed by appropriately rearranging the Fourier coefficients in terms of their frequency components. Finally, the corresponding texture image can be produced by 2-D inverse DCT algorithm. We applied the proposed method to generate several stochastic textures (i.e., cloud, illumination, and sand), and several structural texture images. Experimental results indicate the good performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A new texture generation method based on pseudo-DCT coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000236807100023"}
