However, the mobile authentication schemes existing in the literature cannot achieve this goal in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight authentication scheme with anonymity and unlinkability for roaming service in large-scale wireless networks. Moreover, we formally analyse our proposed scheme with the BAN-logic and show that it can withstand the several possible attacks.", "paper_title": "Scalable and efficient mobile authentication scheme preserving user privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000315943300001"}
