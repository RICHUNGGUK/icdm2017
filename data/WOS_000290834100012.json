A control-volume-based finite element (CVFEM) approach has been taken in which conservation equations are formed for each control volume throughout the solution domain. In this study, three different algorithms are proposed and investigated. In the first algorithm a fully coupled formulation is used, however in the second algorithm a segregated approach without pressure correction is employed. In the third solution algorithm, the scheme of MCIM is implemented to SIMPLE-like segregated algorithm. The linear system of equations obtained in these algorithms is solved using a direct sparse solver. The accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by solving different steady and unsteady benchmark problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
