After screening the descriptors, a total of 699 topological, geometric, and electronic descriptors (zero- to three-dimensional) representing various structural characteristics were calculated for each molecule in the dataset. Combined method of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) as a feature selection method for the extraction of four relevant descriptors and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) as a modeling technique was used for the prediction of retention times of diverse set of psychiatric drugs. The Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) for the calibration and prediction sets are 0.457 and 0.514, respectively.", "paper_title": "QSRR study of psychiatric drugs using Classification and Regression Trees combined with adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System", "paper_id": "WOS:000257477000006"}
