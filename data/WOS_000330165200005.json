Adjusted Pearson residuals are also obtained, having, to this order, expected value zero and variance one. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented illustrating the behaviour of both adjusted and unadjusted residuals.", "paper_title": "Adjusted Pearson residuals in beta regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200005"}
