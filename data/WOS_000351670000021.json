A real-time routing method for sensor network means that information is provided according to their end-to-end deadlines. In location based real-time routing, each mobile sensor has a location determination mechanism that can contribute to design a real-time routing algorithm. However, in corona framework, the whole system is divided into virtual circle centered on the sink and each mobile sensor has a circle Identifier. The corona based real-time routing is made based on the corona Id and real-time criteria. This paper studies the quality of service (QoS) for location based and corona based real-time routing protocol in MWSN. A comparison study is implemented in real test bed and simulation experiments. The founding in this research concludes that the overall QoS performance for corona mechanism is better than location based real-time routing for MWSN in term of delivery ratio; power consumption; packet overhead and end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of QoS performance for location based and corona based real-time routing protocol in mobile wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351670000021"}
