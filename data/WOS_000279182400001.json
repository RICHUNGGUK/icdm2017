Several spline approximations are computed for different transformations of the control point grid (e.g. translations and rotations). These approximations are then merged together after compensation of the transformations, yielding a high-quality invariant image reconstruction. Evaluations show that the use of hexagonal grids of the \"invariance by integration\" principle improves reconstruction quality. An application to image coding is also presented.
