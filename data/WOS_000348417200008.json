The biomechanical analysis of bowel and mesenteric injuries is a major challenge for injury prevention, particularly because seat belt restraint may paradoxically increase their risk of occurrence. The aim of this study was to identify the biomechanical behavior of mesentery and small bowel (MSB) tissue samples under dynamical loading conditions. A dedicated test bench was designed in order to perform tensile tests on fresh MSB porcine specimens, with quasi-static (1 mm/s) and dynamic (100 mm/s) loading conditions. The mechanical behavior of MSB specimens was investigated and compared to isolated mesenteric and isolated small bowel specimens. The results show a high sensitivity of MSB stiffness (1.0 +/- A 0.2 and 1.3 +/- A 0.3 N/mm at 1 and 100 mm/s, p = 0.001) and ultimate force (22 +/- A 5 and 35 +/- A 8 N at 1 and 100 mm/s, p = 0.001) to the loading rate but not for the displacement at failure. This leads to postulate on a failure criteria based on strain level regardless of the strain rate. These experimental results could be further used to develop refined finite element models and to further investigate on injury mechanisms associated to seat belt restraints, as well as to evaluate and improve protective devices.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical analysis of traumatic mesenteric avulsion", "paper_id": "WOS:000348417200008"}
