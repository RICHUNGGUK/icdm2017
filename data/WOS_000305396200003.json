Three different neuro-fuzzy and one neural network-based approaches have been developed. The performances of these approaches are compared among themselves, through computer simulations. Genetic algorithm-tuned multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is found to perform better than other three approaches for predicting both the outputs. This could be due to a more exhaustive search carried out by the genetic algorithm in comparison with back-propagation algorithm and the use of two separate adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for two different outputs. A designer may use the developed soft computing-based approaches in order to predict specific energy consumption and stability margin of the robot for a set of input parameters, beforehand.", "paper_title": "Soft computing-based approaches to predict energy consumption and stability margin of six-legged robots moving on gradient terrains", "paper_id": "WOS:000305396200003"}
