This paper presents an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm for global optimization. Inspired by differential evolution (DE) and introducing a parameter M. we propose two improved solution search equations, namely \"ABC/best/1\" and \"ABC/rand/1\". Then, in order to take advantage of them and avoid the shortages of them, we use a selective probability p to control the frequency of introducing \"ABC/rand/1\" and \"ABC/best/1\" and get a new search mechanism. In addition, to enhance the global convergence speed, when producing the initial population, both the chaotic systems and the opposition-based learning method are employed. Experiments are conducted on a suite of unimodal/multimodal benchmark functions. The results demonstrate the good performance of the IABC algorithm in solving complex numerical optimization problems when compared with thirteen recent algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
