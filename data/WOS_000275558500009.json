This work studies power-aware routing so as to maximize the minimum remaining energy of all nodes after routing. This routing metric, referred to as Maximum-Residual Routing, aims at maintaining the minimum remaining energy as high as possible so as to delay the fist failure time of nodes in the network. In this paper, a polynomial-time optimal algorithm is proposed for Maximum-Residual Multicasting. We then show that Maximum-Residual Aggregating is NP-hard and that, unless P = NP; its minimization version cannot be approximated within a ratio better than (2 - epsilon) for any epsilon > 0. The proposed routing algorithm for Maximum-Residual Multicasting can be applied to existing routing protocols, especially those based on the link-state approach. The capability of the algorithm was evaluated by a series of experiments, for which we have very encouraging results in network lifetime and load balance.", "paper_title": "Maximum-residual multicasting and aggregating in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275558500009"}
