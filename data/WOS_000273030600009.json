The proposed circuit integrates the 16 pixels of 19 mu m x 19 mu m electrode array, counter electrode, potentiostat circuit, digital decoding circuit, as well as control logics on a single chip, and provides a rail-to-rail range of assembling voltage, a potential resolution of 8 bit, and a maximal assembling current up to 459 mu A, biased at a current of 1 mu A. Meanwhile, a novel electrode-reuse scheme is also proposed to further simplify the architecture and save chip area as well, without degrading the functionalities. Experimental results from on-chip selective assembly of 50 nm polystyrene nano-particles are included and discussed to verify the feasibility of the proposed circuits.", "paper_title": "Fully integrated CMOS nano-particle assembly circuit for biological detections", "paper_id": "WOS:000273030600009"}
