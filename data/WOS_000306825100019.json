By using the fuzzy interpolation method, a systemic method will be proposed to stabilize and synchronize the nonlinear energy resource systems. Based on the designed fuzzy state-feedback controllers, several sufficient conditions are developed to ensure stabilization and robust stabilization of the four-dimensional energy resource system, respectively, as well as synchronization of two identical energy resource systems. At last, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Robust Stabilization and Synchronization of Nonlinear Energy Resource System via Fuzzy Control Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100019"}
