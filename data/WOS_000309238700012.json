Most approaches use the notions of blacklists versus whitelists (WWLs), and it is difficult to quantify the degree of a website's vulnerability against phishing attacks. In this paper, we present a quantitative approach for evaluating the phishing possibility of a given website using the refined security risk elements for domain and web page. Design and implementation of the website risk assessment system for antiphishing are also included. It can detect suspicious websites containing phishing attack and abnormal behavior and generates a warning if website is judged untrustworthy.
