Recommendation System technology can recommend web resources or information to people based on his/her personal preference, and has gotten a great deal of attention and development in recent years. In this paper, by combining collaborative filtering technology and information propagation principle, we proposed ROBIN, a novel recommendation model. The ROBIN model achieves a good recommendation effect by propagating the relationship information between users and resources. Based on the ROBIN model, we designed and implemented tag recommendation algorithm named ROBIN-T. For evaluating our proposed method, we have conducted tag recommendation experiments on three real datasets and the results show that the ROBIN-T algorithm achieves good performance when compared with classical approaches.
