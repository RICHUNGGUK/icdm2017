Contrary to the case of constant p, where the expected runtime is known to be O(1), we prove that here the expected runtime tends to infinity. We establish how the asymptotic behavior of the expected number of steps depends on the sequence p (n). In particular, for p(n) = d/n, where d is a constant, the runtime is always exponential, but it can be also polynomial if p (n) decreases sufficiently slowly, e.g. for p (n) = 1/ln n.
