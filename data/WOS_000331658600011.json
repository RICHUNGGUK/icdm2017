In this work, we present an intelligent machine vision system able to learn autonomously individual objects present in real environment. This system relies on salient object detection. In its design, we were inspired by early processing stages of human visual system. In this context we suggest a novel fast algorithm for visually salient object detection, robust to real-world illumination conditions. Then we use it to extract salient objects which can be efficiently used for training the machine learning-based object detection and recognition unit of the proposed system. We provide results of our salient object detection algorithm on MSRA Salient Object Database benchmark comparing its quality with other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed system has been implemented on a humanoid robot, increasing its autonomy in learning and interaction with humans. We report and discuss the obtained results, validating the proposed concepts.", "paper_title": "A machine learning based intelligent vision system for autonomous object detection and recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000331658600011"}
