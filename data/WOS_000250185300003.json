The results show a certain ingredient of subjectivity implicitly contained in these data: we get an average accuracy of 93.04% for the former and 83.31% for the latter. These findings suggest that observers see different things when looking at the samples in the microscope; a situation that significantly diminishes the performance of these classifiers in diagnosing such a disease.
