The game, called Business Networking Game, simulates the changing dynamics of business networks and stimulates the players' thinking on whether and how to develop a strategy to cope with the mass customization trend within their own businesses. The game can be tailored to a specific context. In this paper, we introduce the game by means of an application within the insurance industry. This paper describes the theoretical background, the design of the game, how it is played and how students of business administration and professionals from the insurance industry evaluated it.
