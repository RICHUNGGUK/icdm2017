In this study, we attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of the simple Bayes model by integrating global and local application of Naive Bayes classifier. We performed a large-scale comparison with other attempts that have tried to improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes algorithm as well as other state-of-the-art algorithms on 28 standard benchmark datasets and the proposed method gave better accuracy in most cases.", "paper_title": "Integrating Global and Local Application of Naive Bayes Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000336557000012"}
