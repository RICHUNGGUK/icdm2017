The establishment of e-contracts in a particular business domain usually involves a set of well-defined common and variable properties. These properties are not fully exploited by the existing e-contract establishment approaches. Feature modeling is a software engineering technique that has been widely used for capturing and managing commonalities and variabilities of product families in the context of software product line. This paper presents a feature-based approach to support Web services e-contract (WS-contract) establishment. The approach aims at improving the information structure and reuse of WS-contracts, including the QoS attributes. Features are used to represent possible WS-contract elements in order to drive WS-contract template instantiation, thus acting as a configuration space manager. A toolkit named FeatureContract was developed to automatically support the proposed approach. A case study was carried out within the telecom context to show the approach feasibility.", "paper_title": "WS-contract establishment with QoS: An approach based on feature modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258778400007"}
