In this paper, we present a new result on the global exponential convergence of the projection neural network. Unlike existing convergence results for the projection neural network, our main result does not assume the monotonicity of LVI problems. Therefore, the projection neural network can be further guaranteed to solve a class of non-monotone LVI and non-convex optimization problems. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.", "paper_title": "A new result for projection neural networks to solve linear variational inequalities and related optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500012"}
