In the existing work, mobility controlled devices are usually needed. We propose a data collection scheme based on human mobility in this paper, which is more energy efficient. We analyse its performance theoretically. Our work is based on the SLAW mobility model, which has been proposed recently according to the features of human mobility. We develop mathematical methods to calculate the expected waiting time for the sensing data and the expected queue length at the sensors. The correctness of our methods has been proved through numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "On human mobility assisted data collection in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364814200002"}
