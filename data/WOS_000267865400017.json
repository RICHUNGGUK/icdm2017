The focus is placed upon the design of a fuzzy DOF controller guaranteeing a prescribed noise attenuation level in an L-2-L-infinity sense. By using the slack matrix approach, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is derived to assure the mean-square asymptotic stability with an L-2-L-infinity performance for the closed-loop system. The corresponding solvability condition for a desired L-2-L-infinity DOF controller is established. Since these obtained conditions are not all expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI), the cone complementary linearization method is exploited to cast them into sequential minimization problems subject to LMI constraints, which can be easily solved numerically. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed theory.", "paper_title": "L-2-L-infinity Control of Nonlinear Fuzzy Ito Stochastic Delay Systems via Dynamic Output Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000267865400017"}
