Besides traditional virtual reality applications such as avatars, games, or cinema, these synthetic characters may be used to generate realistic fakes, which may lead to improper use of the technology. This fact raises the demand for advanced tools able to discriminate real and artificial human faces in digital media. In this paper, we propose a method to distinguish between computer generated and natural faces by modeling and evaluating their dynamic behavior. Because of a 3D-model-based video analysis, the proposed technique allows identifying synthetic characters by detecting their more limited variability over time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach also on very challenging and realistic video sequences.", "paper_title": "3D-Model-Based Video Analysis for Computer Generated Faces Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000359984600017"}
