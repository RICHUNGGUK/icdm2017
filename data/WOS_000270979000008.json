Bornmann & al. [2008] show that latent Markov models offer a fundamentally good opportunity to model statistically peer review processes. The main objective of this short communication is to test the influence of the applicants' gender on the modeling of a peer review process by using latent Markov models. We found differences in transition probabilities from one stage to the other for applications for a doctoral fellowship submitted by male and female applicants.", "paper_title": "The influence of the applicants' gender on the modeling of a peer review process by using latent Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000270979000008"}
