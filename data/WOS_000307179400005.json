The cycle structure of such a permutation can be associated with the path of a decreasing Markov chain on n integers. Under certain assumptions on the stick-breaking factor we prove a central limit theorem for the logarithm of the order of the permutation, thus extending the classical Erdos-Turan law for the uniform permutations and its generalization for Ewens' permutations associated with sampling from the PD/GEM(theta)-distribution. Our approach is based on using perturbed random walks to obtain the limit laws for the sum of logarithms of the cycle lengths.", "paper_title": "A Generalization of the Erdos-Turan Law for the Order of Random Permutation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307179400005"}
