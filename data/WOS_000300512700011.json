The theory of regions is recognized as the unique method for obtaining maximally permissive (i.e., optimal) controllers in the existing literature. All legal and live maximal behavior of a Petri net model can be preserved by using a marking/transition-separation instance (MTSI). However, obtaining them is an extremely time consuming problem. This work proposes crucial MTSIs that allow designers to employ much fewer MTSIs to deal with deadlocks. The advantage of the proposed policy is that an optimal deadlock controller can be obtained with drastically reduced computation. Experimental results, by varying the markings of given net structures, indicate that it is the most efficient policy to obtain such controllers.", "paper_title": "Computationally Improved Optimal Deadlock Control Policy for Flexible Manufacturing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300512700011"}
