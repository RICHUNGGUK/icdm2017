Sophisticated VoD broadcasting schemes such as Harmonic Broadcasting (HB) allows receivers to tune into the ongoing transmission of a video stream at arbitrary time, while still being able to receive the multimedia sequence from beginning to end, after short initial playout latency. In addition, we address service enhancements by using scalable video coding (SVC) to support heterogeneous receiver capabilities and receiving conditions as well as the reception of the signal from more than on transmission site. We present and discuss options for the integration of VoD broadcasting schemes in combination with fountain codes. Optimizations in parameter selection are discussed. A realistic protocol environment is only slightly modified to support our system concept. Simulation results show the benefits of the discussed VoD scheme compared to existing approaches if integrated in DVB-H.
