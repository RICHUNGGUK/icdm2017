This paper presents a pragmatic method to minimize human intervention for the construction of Korean part-of-speech (POS) tagged corpus. Instead of focusing on improving the performance of conventional automatic POS taggers, we devise a discriminative POS tagger which can selectively produce either a single analysis or multiple analyses based on the tagging reliability. The proposed approach uses two decision rules to judge the tagging reliability. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively control the quality of corpus and the amount of manual annotation by the threshold value of the rule.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Human Intervention for Constructing Korean Part-of-Speech Tagged Corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300039"}
