The prototyping technique employs deposition of material in curved layers in contrast to flat layers as in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). The proposed method would be particularly advantageous over FDM in the manufacturing of thin, curved parts (shells) by reduction of stair-step effect, increase in strength and reduction in the number of layers. The criteria for the generation of tool paths for CLFDM are proper orientation of filaments and appropriate bonding between adjacent filaments in same layer and in successive layers.
