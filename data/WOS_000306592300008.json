We define a square integrable representation of a homogeneous space G/H on a Hilbert space H. The reconstruction formula for G/H is established and as a result it is concluded that the set of admissible vectors is path connected. The continuous wavelet transform on G/H is defined and it is shown that the range of the continuous wavelet transform is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Moreover, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the continuous wavelet transform to be onto.", "paper_title": "ON THE CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM ON HOMOGENEOUS SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000306592300008"}
