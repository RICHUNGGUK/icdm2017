More biometric traits are required for improving the performance of authentication systems. In this paper, we present a new number for the biometrics family, i.e. tongueprint, which uses particularly interesting properties of the human tongue to base a technology for noninvasive biometric assessment. The tongue is a unique organ which can be stuck out of the mouth for inspection, whose appearance is amenable to examination with the aid of a machine vision system. Yet it is otherwise well protected in the mouth and difficult to be forged. Furthermore, the involuntary squirm of the tongue is not only a convincing proof that the subject is alive, but also a feature for recognition. That is to say, the tongue can present both static features and dynamic features for authentication. However, little work has hitherto been done on the tongue as a biometric identifier. In this work, we make use of a database of tongue images obtained over a long period to examine the performance of the tongueprint as a biometric identifier. Our research shows that tongueprint is a promising candidate for biometric identification and worthy of further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
