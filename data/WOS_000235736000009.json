At the same time, institutional repositories and digital libraries are adopting the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to expose their holdings. The authors harvested nearly 10 million records from OAI-PMH repositories. From these records, they extracted 3.3 million unique resource URLs and then conducted searches on samples from this collection to determine how much of the OAI-PMH corpus the three major search engines have indexed.", "paper_title": "Search engine coverage of the OAI-PMH corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000235736000009"}
