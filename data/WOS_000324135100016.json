An independent/connected/total (a,b)-Roman dominating function is an (a,b)-Roman dominating function f such that {vaV:f(v)not equal 0} induces a subgraph without edges/that is connected/without isolated vertices. For a weight function , the weight of f is w(f)=a (vaV) w(v)f(v). The weighted (a,b)-Roman domination number is the minimum weight of an (a,b)-Roman dominating function of G. Similarly, we can define the weighted independent (a,b)-Roman domination number . In this paper, we first prove that for any fixed (a,b) the (a,b)-Roman domination and the total/connected/independent (a,b)-Roman domination problems are NP-complete for bipartite graphs. We also show that for any fixed (a,b) the (a,b)-Roman domination and the total/connected/weighted independent (a,b)-Roman domination problems are NP-complete for chordal graphs. We then give linear-time algorithms for the weighted (a,b)-Roman domination problem with ba parts per thousand yena > 0, and the weighted independent (a,b)-Roman domination problem with 2aa parts per thousand yenba parts per thousand yena > 0 on strongly chordal graphs with a strong elimination ordering provided.", "paper_title": "Roman domination on strongly chordal graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000324135100016"}
