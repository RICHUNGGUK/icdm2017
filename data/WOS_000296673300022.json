In this paper, an adaptive scheme to suppress the effect of impulsive noise is proposed. The impact of impulsive noise can be detected by using the guard band in the frequency domain; furthermore the position information of the impulsive noise, including burst duration, instantaneous power and arrived time, can be estimated as well. Then a time-domain window function with adaptive parameters, which are decided in terms of the estimated information of the impulsive noise and the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), is employed to suppress the impulsive interference. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed scheme, which improved the bit error rate (BER) performance for the ISDB-T receivers in both AWGN channel and Rayleigh fading channel.", "paper_title": "Impulsive Noise Suppression for ISDB-T Receivers Based on Adaptive Window Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300022"}
