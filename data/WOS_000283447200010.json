We implement a prototype of such mobile decision support system in which experts use mobile phones to provide their preferences anywhere and anytime. To get a general system, experts' preferences are assumed to be represented by different preference representations: 1) fuzzy preference relations; 2) orderings; 3) utility functions; and 4) multiplicative preference relations. Because this prototype incorporates both selection and consensus processes, it allows us to model group decision-making situations. The prototype incorporates a tool for managing the changes on the set of feasible alternatives that could happen throughout the decision process. This way, the prototype provides a new approach to deal with dynamic group decision-making situations to help make decisions anywhere and anytime.", "paper_title": "A Mobile Decision Support System for Dynamic Group Decision-Making Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283447200010"}
