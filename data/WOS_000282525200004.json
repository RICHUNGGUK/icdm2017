The low bound of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is shown to converge almost surely to a constant. The throughput, spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency in the dominating systems are obtained. The analytical results are confirmed by simulations. We find that in high traffic loads the throughput with fading is higher than that without. When the energy efficiency increases, the spectrum efficiency tends to two contrary values due to SNR increases or decreases. For the ordinary stable systems, the stability region is shown to shrink as the traffic increases and enlarge with RD employment.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Large CDMA Random Access Systems with Retransmission Diversity over Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000282525200004"}
