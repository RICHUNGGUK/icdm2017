The scoring system is often based on log-likelihood ratios. These methods usually perform well but it is difficult to interpret how significant a score is. Results: We have developed several tests of significance for the scores: (1) a sum-of-scores test (SST), (2) an intersection-union test (IUT), based on a multiple hypothesis testing interpretation of an exon's score and (3) a meta-analytical approach (MA), which combines several P-values, corresponding to the exon's parts, to yield a global P-value. We performed simulation studies, which show that the MA has better sensitivity and specificity than other methods and is easier to interpret by non-expert users. This is an improvement over other methods and is especially relevant for users who would like to predict incomplete gene sequences.
