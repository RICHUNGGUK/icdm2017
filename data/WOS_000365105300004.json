We investigated how performance changed in response to various clock ticking speeds using a trick clock that allowed us to control its ticking speed. We found that the subjects' performance was influenced by the speed at which the clock ticked: Particularly, individuals showed slower performance when exposed to a slow-ticking clock. We demonstrated that common environmental stimuli encountered in daily life, such as the ticking of a clock, have a significant effect on human behavior.", "paper_title": "The effect of a ticking clock on task performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000365105300004"}
