Specifically, a lower bound and an upper bound are derived for each supporting hyperplane of the rate region, where the lower bound is associated with a max-min game while the upper bound is associated with a min-max game; furthermore, it is shown that these two bounds coincide due to the existence of a saddle point.", "paper_title": "Rate Region of Gaussian Multiple Description Coding With Individual and Central Distortion Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000269154600007"}
