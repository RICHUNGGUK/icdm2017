An uncertain variable is defined as a function from the uncertainty space to the set of real numbers and is characterized by an uncertainty distribution. This paper proposes the definition of type-2 uncertain variables within the framework of uncertainty theory through introduction of generalized uncertain measures and focuses on more complex twofold uncertainties. Some uncertainty reduction methods associated with type-2 uncertain variables are also proposed for convenience of applicability, including reduction of optimistic value, pessimistic value and expected value. Moreover, four classes of type-2 uncertain variables are reduced to type-1 uncertain variables with specific uncertainty distributions. Type-2 uncertain optimization methods are applied to solving the fixed charge solid transportation problem with the type-2 uncertain parameters, where the solution methods are also provided for the proposed models. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate application and sensitivity analysis of the proposed approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
