It also confronts vision researchers the problem of finding effective methods to navigate the vast amount of visual information. Semantic image understanding plays a vital role towards solving this problem. One important task in image understanding is object recognition, in particular, generic object categorization. Critical to this problem are the issues of learning and dataset. Abundant data helps to train a robust recognition system, while a good object classifier can help to collect a large amount of images. This paper presents a novel object recognition algorithm that performs automatic dataset collecting and incremental model learning simultaneously. The goal of this work is to use the tremendous resources of the web to learn robust object category models for detecting and searching for objects in real-world cluttered scenes. Humans contiguously update the knowledge of objects when new examples are observed. Our framework emulates this human learning process by iteratively accumulating model knowledge and image examples. We adapt a non-parametric latent topic model and propose an incremental learning framework. Our algorithm is capable of automatically collecting much larger object category datasets for 22 randomly selected classes from the Caltech 101 dataset. Furthermore, our system offers not only more images in each object category but also a robust object category model and meaningful image annotation. Our experiments show that OPTIMOL is capable of collecting image datasets that are superior to the well known manually collected object datasets Caltech 101 and LabelMe.", "paper_title": "OPTIMOL: Automatic Online Picture Collection via Incremental Model Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000275955400002"}
