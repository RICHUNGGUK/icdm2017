Several dynamic data distributions are proposed and evaluated on different systems: homogeneous and dedicated, and heterogeneous and/or non-dedicated. Results prove that dynamic distribution strategies perform better than traditional static distributions. Although all the data distributions presented here have been developed to be used with the STEM-II air quality model, they are also very suitable for use in other parallel applications.", "paper_title": "Dynamic load-balancing for the STEM-II air quality model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900074"}
