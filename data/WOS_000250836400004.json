A definition of reliability in the Rasch model is proposed and the connection to the classical definition of reliability is shown. As a modification of the classical estimator Cronbach's alpha, a new estimator logistic alpha is proposed. Finally, the properties of the new estimator are studied via simulations in the Rasch model.
