In this paper, we show that the disc cover problem is in fact a special case of the general alpha-hull problem. In spite of being a special case, the disc cover problem is not easier than the general alpha-hull problem. In addition to applying the existing alpha-hull algorithm to solve the disc cover problem, we present a simple, yet optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm that constructs the minimum disc cover for arbitrary cases, including those degenerate cases where the alpha-hull approach would fail.", "paper_title": "An optimal algorithm for the minimum disc cover problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000251647800002"}
