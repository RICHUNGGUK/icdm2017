This paper presents a simulation model of a multiprocessor network traffic analysis system. The model, which is based on closed networks of queues, evaluates the efficiency of the system depending on the hardware/software platform features. Therefore, this model is able to estimate performance early in the design and development stages simulating a multiprocessor architecture in charge of analysing network traffic. The goodness of the model will be checked by comparing analytical results with practical ones obtained in laboratory using a traffic analysis system that runs on a multiprocessor platform.
