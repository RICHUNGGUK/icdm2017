Due to prohibitive costs, little work has conducted experimental study on intercontact time in urban vehicular environments. In this paper, we carry out an extensive experiment involving thousands of operational taxies in Shanghai city. Studying the taxi trace data on the frequency and duration of transfer opportunities between taxies, we observe that the tail distribution of the intercontact time, that is, the time gap separating two contacts of the same pair of taxies, exhibits an exponential decay, over a large range of timescale. This observation is in sharp contrast to recent empirical data studies based on human mobility, in which the distribution of the intercontact time obeys a power law. By analyzing a simplified mobility model that captures the effect of hot areas in the city, we rigorously prove that common traffic influxes, where large volume of traffic converges, play a major role in generating the exponential tail of the intercontact time. Our results thus provide fundamental guidelines on design of new vehicular mobility models in urban scenarios, new data forwarding protocols and their performance analysis.", "paper_title": "Impact of Traffic Influxes: Revealing Exponential Intercontact Time in Urban VANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000292047500002"}
