It models systems of agents communicating by posting and querying partial information, represented as constraints over the variables of the system. This covers a vast variety of systems as those arising in biological phenomena, reactive systems, net-centric computing and the advent of social networks and cloud computing. In this paper we survey the main applications, developments and current trends of CCP.", "paper_title": "Models and emerging trends of concurrent constraint programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000323323200003"}
