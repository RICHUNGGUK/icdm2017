A previous literature review (Dahlberg et al. 2008b), covering articles published between 1999 and 2006, showed that the majority of research had only focused on a few topics. In order to address this issue, a research agenda was formulated to encourage researchers to explore new topics. Almost a decade later, our review reveals that researchers have continued to focus on the same topics (especially consumer adoption and technology aspects) with a limited accumulation of new knowledge and similar findings. In addition to reviewing the literature, we discuss the possible reasons for the lack of research diversity and propose new recommendations to enhance future mobile payment research.
