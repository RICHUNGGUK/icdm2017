In this paper, we proposed a novel method for constructing phylogenetic tree based on the minimal spanning tree of the complete graph, which is taken from the similarity matrix computed by 3D graphical representation of DNA sequences. This method didn't require sequence alignment and the computation was simple. The experiments proved its validity.", "paper_title": "A Method for Constructing Phylogenetic Tree Based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of the Complete Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000289039800013"}
