It is generally admitted that because of the finite resolution of images, getting a good precision in depth from stereovision demands a large angle between the views. In this paper, we show that under simple and feasible hypotheses, small baseline stereovision can be rehabilitated and even favoured. The main hypothesis is that the images should be band limited, in order to achieve sub-pixel precisions in the matching process. This assumption is not satisfied for common stereo pairs. Yet, this becomes realistic for recent spatial or aerian acquisition devices. In this context, block-matching methods, which had become somewhat obsolete for large baseline stereovision, regain their relevance. A multi-scale algorithm dedicated to small baseline stereovision is described along with experiments on small angle stereo pairs at the end of the paper.", "paper_title": "Small baseline stereovision", "paper_id": "WOS:000250379300002"}
