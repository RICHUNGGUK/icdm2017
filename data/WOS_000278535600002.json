In the absence of \"unhealthy\" (negative class) information, a marginal kernel density estimate of the \"healthy\" (positive class) distribution is used to construct an estimate of the negative class. The output of the one-class support vector classifier is calibrated to posterior probabilities by fitting a logistic distribution to the support vector predictor model in an effort to manage false alarms.", "paper_title": "Anomaly Detection Through a Bayesian Support Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000278535600002"}
