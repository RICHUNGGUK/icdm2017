We first consider the case that the chance-constrained program has equal probabilities for each scenario. We study the resulting mixing set with a cardinality constraint and propose facet-defining inequalities that subsume known explicit inequalities for this set. We extend these inequalities to obtain valid inequalities for the mixing set with a knapsack constraint. In addition, we propose a compact extended reformulation (with polynomial number of variables and constraints) that characterizes a linear programming equivalent of a single chance constraint with equal scenario probabilities. We introduce a blending procedure to find valid inequalities for intersection of multiple mixing sets. We propose a polynomial-size extended formulation for the intersection of multiple mixing sets with a knapsack constraint that is stronger than the original mixing formulation. We also give a compact extended linear program for the intersection of multiple mixing sets and a cardinality constraint for a special case. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inequalities in our computational experiments with probabilistic lot-sizing problems.", "paper_title": "On mixing sets arising in chance-constrained programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000301454100002"}
