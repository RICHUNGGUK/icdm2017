With extremely simple routing, such an infra structure would greatly enhance the ongoing trend of embedded systems implementation using multi-cores on FPGAs. An efficient H-tree based floor plan that naturally follows the MFT construction methodology was developed. Several instances of the proposed NoC were implemented with various inter-routers links progression schemes combined with very simple router architecture and efficient client network interface (CNI). The performance of all these implementations was evaluated using a cycle-accurate simulator for various combinations of NoC sizes and traffic models. Also a new data transfer circuit for transferring data between clients and NoC operating at different (unrelated) clock frequencies has been developed. Allowing data transfer at one data per cycle, the operation of this circuit has been verified using gate-level simulations for several ratios of NoC/client clock frequencies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
