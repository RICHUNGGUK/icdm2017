Vehicles typically have no strict constraints on processing power and storage capabilities. They can sense events (e.g., imaging from streets), process sensed data (e.g., recognizing license plates), and route messages to other vehicles (e.g., diffusing relevant notification to drivers or police agents). In this novel and challenging mobile environment, sensors can generate a sheer amount of data, and traditional sensor network approaches for data reporting become unfeasible. This article proposes MobEyes, an efficient lightweight support for proactive urban monitoring based on the primary idea of exploiting vehicle mobility to opportunistically diffuse summaries about sensed data. The reported experimental/analytic results show that MobEyes can harvest summaries and build a low-cost distributed index with reasonable completeness, good scalability, and limited overhead.", "paper_title": "MobEyes: Smart mobs for urban monitoring with a vehicular sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241747800011"}
