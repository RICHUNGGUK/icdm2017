We incorporate with nonnegativity, shift-invariance, and sparseness to select representative spectral basis vectors that are used to restore music sources from their monaural mixture. Experimental results with monaural instantaneous mixture of voice/cello and monaural convolutive mixture of saxophone/viola, are shown to confirm the validity of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Monaural music source separation: Nonnegativity, sparseness, and shift-invariance", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300077"}
