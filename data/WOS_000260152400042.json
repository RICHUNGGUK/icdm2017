Multi-branch structure has been proved to have higher representation/generalization ability and lower computational cost than conventional neural networks because of the nonlinear function of the multi-branches and the reduction of the number of neurons to be used. In addition, learning of delay elements of multi-branch ULNs has improved their potential to build up a compact dynamical model with higher performances and lower computational cost when applied for identifying dynamical systems.
