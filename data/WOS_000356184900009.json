Rather than offering the same contents for all students, we provide personalized contents according to the students' background and learning objectives. Although curriculum personalization can be faced in several ways, we focus on artificial intelligence (AI) planning as a very useful formalism for mapping actions, i.e. learning contents, in terms of preconditions (precedence relationships) and causal effects to find plans, i.e. learning paths that best fit the needs of each student. A key feature is that the learning path is generated and shown in Moodle in a seamless way for both the teacher and student, respectively. We also include some experimental results to demonstrate the scalability and viability of our approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
