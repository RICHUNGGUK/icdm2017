Specifically, we investigate how the physical layer VMISO benefits translate into network level performance improvements. We show that the improvements are nontrivial (15 to 300 percent depending on the node density) but rely on two crucial algorithmic decisions: the number of cooperating transmitters for each link; and the cooperation strategy used by the transmitters. We explore the tradeoffs in making routing decisions using analytical models and derive the key routing considerations. Finally, we present Proteus, an adaptive diversity routing protocol that includes algorithmic solutions to the above two decision problems and leverages VMISO links in multihop wireless network to achieve performance improvements. We evaluate Proteus using NS2-based simulations with an enhanced physical layer model that accurately captures the effect of VMISO transmissions.", "paper_title": "Proteus: Multiflow Diversity Routing for Wireless Networks with Cooperative Transmissions", "paper_id": "WOS:000319409900009"}
