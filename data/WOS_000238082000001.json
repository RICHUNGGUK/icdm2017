Security is one of the strategic technologies that will increase the value and utility of the Internet and Internet-based applications. Traditional security issues deal with the authentication and authorization of users in network domains. Today there are numerous novel security issues concerning users, information content, and application systems in information domains. Among these, we will consider a novel role/object-based access control mechanism for both participants and objects in workflow processes of information domains. In particular, we will present our implementation of this mechanism for digital libraries.", "paper_title": "Internet security: A novel role/object-based access control for digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000238082000001"}
