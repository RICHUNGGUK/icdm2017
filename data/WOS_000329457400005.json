We proved that a function with m jumping discontinuity points can be approximated by a simplest neural network and a decay RBF neural network in L-2(R) by each epsilon error, and a function with m jumping discontinuity point y = f(x), x is an element of E subset of R-d can be constructively approximated by a decay RBF neural network in L-2(R-d) by each epsilon > 0 error. Then the whole networks will have less hidden neurons and well generalization in the same of the first part. A real world problem about stock closing price with jumping discontinuity have been presented and verified the correctness of the theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
