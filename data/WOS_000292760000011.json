More specifically, we explore the necessary and sufficient conditions on choosing the pinned nodes to guarantee the pinning synchronisability of complex networks. It is found that the pinning synchronisability of complex networks relies totally on the way to pin the nodes as long as the coupling strength is large enough. Furthermore, it is proven that the entire network can synchronise exponentially fast. The least synchronisation speed can be specified as well. Finally, based on the theoretical findings proposed in this article, we provide the specific procedures for finding a least number of pinned nodes to realise the pinning synchronisability of complex networks.", "paper_title": "On pinning synchronisability of complex networks with arbitrary topological structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000292760000011"}
