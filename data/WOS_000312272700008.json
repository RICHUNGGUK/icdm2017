As a first step, we introduce a uniform structural formalism and assign it two kinds of semantics, abstract dynamic models and relational models. The corresponding completeness results are proved. As a second step, we extend the structural formalism to a two-sorted state-transition calculus, and prove its completeness with respect to the associated relational semantics.", "paper_title": "Causal dynamic inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000312272700008"}
