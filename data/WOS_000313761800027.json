We abstract web service components as coalgebraic monads, which has an advantage of supporting the studying of state systems such as concurrent or uncertain systems. With the help of monad techniques, we present a novel formal model for web services in a black-box observation way. Through monads' properties such as abstraction, reflection and composability, this model can help us formally describe and support further study on service components during web service publishing. After publishing, we in this paper also propose a composition method based on program slicing technology. Our monad-based methods proposed in this paper relatively improve service reuse and enable the integration and composition of web services because of the integration of combinable and reusable monads techniques.
