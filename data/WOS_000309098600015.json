The maximum pattern complexity p(Omega)*(k) is the maximum of p(Omega)(S) among S with #S = k. The S attaining the maximum is considered as the most effective sampling to distinguish the sets in Omega. We obtain the exact values or at least the order of p(Omega)*(k) in k for various classes Omega. We also discuss the dual problem in the case that #Omega = infinity, that is, consider the partition of R-2 generated by a finite family T subset of Omega. The number of elements in the partition is written as p(R2)(T) and p(R2)*(k) is the maximum of p(R2)(T) among T with #T = k. Here, p(Omega)*(k) = p(R2)*(k) does not hold in general. For the general setting that Omega is an infinite subset of A(Sigma), where A is a finite alphabet. Sigma is an arbitrary infinite set, and p(Omega)*(k) = max(#s=k) # Omega vertical bar(s), it is known that the entropy h(Omega) := lim(k ->infinity) log p(Omega)*(k)/k exists and takes value in {log 1, log 2, ... , log #A}. In this paper, we prove that the entropy h(Sigma) of the dual system coincides with h(Omega). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
