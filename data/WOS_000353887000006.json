Data owners in DaaS lose control of their sensitive data, which are stored in the delegated database and managed by the untrusted database service provider. Therefore, many encryption-based approaches including attribute-based encryption were proposed to implement fine-grained access control in DaaS scenarios. However, most of the proposed access control enforcement approaches only support one or two of the following privacy guarantees: data privacy, policy privacy and key privacy. In this paper, we first propose a novel concept of DualAcE: a flexible fine-grained dual access control enforcement mechanism in DaaS by efficiently combining the ciphertext-policy attribute-set-based encryption with database service provider re-encryption into a DaaS paradigm. The proposed mechanism has implemented dual access control enforcement with multi-privacy guarantee: data privacy in delegated database, policy privacy in delegated authorization table and key privacy in key distribution process.We describe the security and efficiency analysis through cryptography theory and experimental results.
