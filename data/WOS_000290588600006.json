We show that the HMSTP is equivalent to a Steiner tree problem (STP) in an appropriate layered graph. We prove that the directed cut model for the STP defined in the layered graph, dominates the best previously known models for the HMSTP. We also show that the Steiner directed cuts in the extended layered graph space can be viewed as being a stronger version of some previously known HMSTP cuts in the original design space. Moreover, we show that these strengthened cuts can be combined and projected into new families of cuts, including facet defining ones, in the original design space. We also adapt the proposed approach to the diameter-constrained minimum spanning tree problem (DMSTP). Computational results with a branch-and-cut algorithm show that the proposed method is significantly better than previously known methods on both problems.", "paper_title": "Modeling hop-constrained and diameter-constrained minimum spanning tree problems as Steiner tree problems over layered graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290588600006"}
