A user requests an item in the database from a database server by sending a query, and obtains the item from an answer to the query. Security requirements of data retrieval include protecting the privacy of the user, the secrecy of the database, and the consistency of answers. In this paper, a data retrieval scheme which satisfies all the security requirements is defined and an efficient construction is proposed. In the proposed construction, the size of a query and an answer is O((log N)(2)), and the size of data published by the database server when the database is updated is only O(1). The proposed construction uses the Merkle tree, a commitment scheme, and Oblivious Transfer. The proof of the security is given under the assumption that the used cryptographic schemes are secure.", "paper_title": "A private and consistent data retrieval scheme with log-squared communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300022"}
