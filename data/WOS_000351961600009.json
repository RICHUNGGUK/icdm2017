A principle of cognitive robotics is implemented to address the problem regarding uncertainties and variations in the automatic disassembly process. In this article, advanced behaviour control based on two cognitive abilities, namely learning and revision, are proposed. The knowledge related to the disassembly process of a particular model of product is learned by the cognitive robotic agent (CRA) and will be implemented when the same model has been seen again. This knowledge is able to be used as a disassembly sequence plan (DSP) and disassembly process plan (DPP). The agent autonomously learns by reasoning throughout the process. In case of an unresolved condition, human assistance is given and the corresponding knowledge will be learned by demonstration. The process can be performed more efficiently by applying a revision strategy that optimises the operation plans. As a result, the performance of the process regarding time and level of autonomy are improved. The validation was done on various models of a case-study product, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen.
