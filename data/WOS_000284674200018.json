A temperature-aware scheduling algorithm for soft real-time multi-core systems is proposed in this paper, namely LTCEDF (Low Thermal Contribution Early Deadline First). According to the core temperature and thread thermal contribution, LTCEDF performs thread migration and exchange to avoid thermal saturation and to keep temperature equilibrium among all the cores. The core temperature calculation method and the thread thermal contribution prediction method are presented. LTCEDF is simulated on ATMI simulator platform. Simulation results show that LTCEDF can not only minimize the thermal penalty, but also meet real-time guarantee. Moreover, it can create a more uniform power density map than other thermal-aware algorithms, and significantly reduce thread migration frequency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
