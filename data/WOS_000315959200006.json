In this paper, we show that conventional thermal simulations using the fixed ambient temperature may lead to the wrong conclusions in terms of temperature, performance, reliability, and leakage power. Though ambient temperature converges to a steady-state value after hundreds of seconds when we run SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite, the steady-state ambient temperature is significantly different depending on applications and system configuration. To overcome inaccuracy of conventional thermal simulations, we propose that microarchitectural thermal simulations should exploit application/system-dependent ambient temperature. Our evaluation results reveal that performance, thermal behavior, reliability, and leakage power of the same DTM scheme are different when we use the application/system-dependent ambient temperature instead of the fixed ambient temperature. For accurate simulation results, future microarchitectural thermal researchers are expected to evaluate their proposed DTM schemes based on application/system-dependent ambient temperature.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Application/System-Dependent Ambient Temperature for Accurate Microarchitectural Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200006"}
