Different from the conventional memoryless sliding surface, a memory-based sliding surface is proposed which consists of not only the current state but also the delayed state. Both robust and adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controllers are designed based on the proposed memory-based sliding surface. It is shown that the sliding surface can be reached and the closed-loop control system is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, to reduce the chattering, some continuous sliding mode controllers are also presented. Finally, the ball and beam system is used to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. It can be seen that, with the proposed control approaches, not only can the stability be guaranteed, but also its transient performance can be improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Synthesis of Memory-Based Fuzzy Sliding Mode Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300021"}
