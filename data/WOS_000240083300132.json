In our study, it is found that modeling the round trip time (RTT) in our network by a single statistical model is not adequate. Therefore two combined statistical distributions, Pareto distribution and generalized exponential distribution, are used to develop our model. This approach is verified by the standard Chi-square test widely used by statisticians. Based on the model developed, a gain-scheduling algorithm to adjust controller gain to compensate time delay in a networked control system (NCS) is developed. This paper presents the results of our initial study. In addition, further research based on the design methodology pioneered in this paper is also proposed.", "paper_title": "An initial study of gain-scheduling controller design for NCS using delay statistical model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300132"}
