The concerned network model includes many neural network models with various delays and structures as its special cases, such as the delays covering the discrete delays and distributed delays, and the network structures containing the neutral-type networks and high-order networks. Therefore, many new stability criteria for the above neural network models have also been derived from the present stability analysis method. All the obtained stability results have similar matrix inequality structures and can be easily checked. Three numerical examples are used to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "LMI-Based Approach for Global Asymptotic Stability Analysis of Recurrent Neural Networks with Various Delays and Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000293442800004"}
