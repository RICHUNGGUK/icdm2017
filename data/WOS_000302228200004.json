We investigate the security of this construction in the regime m = Dn, where D(d) is a sufficiently large constant. We prove that for any predicate P that correlates with either one or two of its inputs, f can be inverted with high probability. We also prove an amplification claim regarding Goldreich's construction. Suppose we are given an assignment x' is an element of.{0, 1}(n) that has correlation epsilon > 0 with the hidden assignment x is an element of {0, 1} n. Then, given access to x', it is possible to invert f on x with high probability, provided D = D(d, epsilon) is sufficiently large.", "paper_title": "On the security of Goldreich's one-way function", "paper_id": "WOS:000302228200004"}
