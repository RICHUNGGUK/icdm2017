This implies that any nonparallel execution or intercore communication will rapidly diminish the performance scalability for parallel applications. Amdahl's law serves as a guideline for parallel programmers to assess the upper bounds of attainable performance. Unfortunately, beyond performance, computer architects face another Grand Challenge: energy efficiency. Architects should carefully design a future many-core processor so that its power consumption doesn't exceed its power budget.", "paper_title": "Extending Amdahl's Law for Energy-Efficient Computing in the Many-Core Era", "paper_id": "WOS:000261998600014"}
