Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at \"order\" in performances among designs instead of \"value\" and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
