We first formulate and solve the scheduling problem as a binary linear programming problem. The computational complexity of the optimum scheduling solution may prevent it from being implemented in practice. We then propose a heuristic scheme, namely bottleneck first scheduling scheme, where scheduling decisions at stations (base station or subscriber stations) with higher traffic loads are done before those at stations with lower traffic loads. At each station, scheduling decisions for CBR packets with more hops to their destinations are done first. Numerical results show that the proposed scheduling scheme achieves the same capacity as the optimal one while obtaining satisfactory delay performance.", "paper_title": "Real-time CBR traffic scheduling in IEEE 802.16-based wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262409200006"}
