When the switching signal of the switched controller involves delay, by constructing a novel Lyapunov functional which is allowed to increase during the running time of active subsystems with the mismatched controller, sufficient conditions for exponential stability are developed for a class of switching signals based on the average dwell time method. Moreover the stabilizing output feedback controllers are designed. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.
