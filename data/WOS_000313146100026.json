To reduce leakage power of caches, several techniques using power-gating (PG) were proposed. Despite of its high leakage saving, a side effect of PG for caches is the loss of data during a sleep. If useful data is lost in sleep mode, it should be fetched again from a lower level memory. This consumes a considerable amount of energy, which very unfortunately mitigates the leakage saving. This paper proposes a new PG scheme considering data retentiveness of SRAM. After entering the sleep mode, data of an SRAM cell is not lost immediately and is usable by checking the validity of the data. Therefore, we utilize data retentiveness of SRAM to avoid energy overhead for data recovery, which results in further chance of leakage saving. To check availability, we introduce a simple hardware whose overhead is ignorable. Our experimental result shows that utilizing data retentiveness saves up to 32.42% of more leakage than conventional PG.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of a New Power-Gating Scheme Utilizing Data Retentiveness on Caches", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100026"}
