Based on the recently determined crystal structure of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the mouse nAChR alpha 1 subunit complexed with alpha-bungarotoxin at 1.94 angstrom resolution, we have constructed three-dimensional models of the ECD of the monomer, homodimer, and homopentamer of the human alpha 7 nAChR and investigated in detail the interface between the two alpha 7 subunits. The docking of the agonist in the ligand-binding pocket of the human alpha 7 dimer was also performed and found consistent with results from labeling and mutagenesis experiments. Since the nAChR ligand-binding site is a useful target for mutagenesis studies and the rational design of drugs against diseases, these models provide useful information for future work.
