By means of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, the overall closed-loop fuzzy dynamics are constructed through selected membership functions. Based on the stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a new robust finite-time stabilization condition is established for such fuzzy jump systems. The robust finite-time stabilization criterion is formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Simulation examples are included to demonstrate the potential of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "ROBUST FINITE-TIME STABILIZATION OF UNCERTAIN FUZZY JUMP SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700004"}
