They proposed a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) to minimize the total completion time. In this paper, we propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme to minimize the total weighted completion time. The FPTAS has O(n(2)/epsilon(2)) time complexity, where n is the number of jobs and epsilon is the required error bound. The proposed FPTAS outperforms all the previous approximation algorithms designed for this problem and its running time is strongly polynomial. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
