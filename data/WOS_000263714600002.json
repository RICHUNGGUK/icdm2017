Participating processors are prone to omission failures, that is, a faulty processor may fail to send or receive a message. The gossip problem in the fault-tolerant setting is defined as follows: every correct processor must learn the initial value of any other processor, unless the other one is faulty: in the latter case either the initial value or the information about the fault must be learned. We develop two efficient algorithms that solve the gossip problem in time O(log n), where n is the number of processors in the system. The first one is an explicit algorithm (i.e.. constructed in polynomial time) sending O(n log n + f(2)) messages, and the second one reduces the message complexity to O(n + f(2)), where f is the upper bound on the number of faulty processors.
