Specifically, we focused on the interarrival times of TCP flows and the number of packets within a flow. We show that the marginal distribution of the flow interarrival times is piecewise Weibull distributed. Second and higher order statistics show that the flow interarrival times are long-range dependent and exhibit multifractal scaling. Taking these higher order properties into consideration, we proposed a multinomial canonical cascade with 3 stages to model the flow interarrival times. Looking at the IP layer, we find that the number of packets in a flow is heavy-tailed distributed. Especially interesting is that in 2 of our data sets, the number of packets in a flow possesses infinite mean. The interairrival time of packets within a flow is highly correlated, bursty, and its statistical characteristics vary from flow to flow.
