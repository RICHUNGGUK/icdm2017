These inequalities result by focusing attention on a single knapsack constraint in addition to an inequality that bounds the sum of all variables, or in general, that bounds a linear form containing only the coefficients 0, 1, and -1. We provide an algorithm that generates all non-dominated second-order cover inequalities, making use of theorems on dominance relationships to bypass the examination of many dominated alternatives. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which these non-dominated second-order cover inequalities would be facets of the convex hull of feasible solutions to the parent constraints, and demonstrate how they can be lifted otherwise. Numerical examples of applying the algorithm disclose its ability to generate valid inequalities that are sometimes significantly stronger than those derived from traditional knapsack covers. Our results can also be extended to incorporate multiple choice inequalities that limit sums over disjoint subsets of variables to be at most one.", "paper_title": "Second-order cover inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000254805300001"}
