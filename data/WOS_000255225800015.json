Availability of sensitivity information at low computational cost can dramatically improve the efficiency of the optimization process, as it enables use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. The formulation and computation of design sensitivities of SMA shell structures using the direct differentiation method is considered, in a steady state electro-thermo-mechanical finite element context. Finite difference, semi-analytical and refined semi-analytical sensitivity analysis approaches are considered and compared in terms of efficiency, accuracy and implementation effort, based on a representative finite element model of a miniature SMA gripper.
