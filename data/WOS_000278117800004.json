The proposed codes exist for more processing gains than the previously reported codes do. In the network using these codes, the number of users can be extended without any essential changes in the previous transmitters. In this study, we propose a construction method for these codes and compare their performance with previously reported codes.", "paper_title": "Code Family for Modified Spectral-Amplitude-Coding OCDMA Systems and Performance Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000278117800004"}
