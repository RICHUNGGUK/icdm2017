The target category and meteorological information are introduced into the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to perform GA target tracking. Fuzzy logic inference is employed in the proposed algorithm to reflect the complicated relationship between these two factors and the transition probability matrix (TPM). Both the number of models in model set and the transition probabilities between models are adjusted through fuzzy inference. Simulation results show that the proposed method is efficient and effective.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic-based multi-factor aided multiple-model filter for general aviation target tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200034"}
