Three-qubit entangled states are used as quantum information carriers, two of which form the logical qubit, which is invariant with a special type of collective noise. The information is encoded on logical qubits with four unitary operations, which can be read out faithfully with Bell-state analysis on two physical qubits and a single-photon measurement on the other physical qubit, not three-photon joint measurements. Two bits of information are exchanged faithfully and securely by transmitting two physical qubits through a noisy channel. When the losses in the noisy channel is low, these protocols can be used to transmit a secret message directly in principle.", "paper_title": "FAULT TOLERANT QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION BASED ON QUANTUM DENSE CODING WITH COLLECTIVE NOISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273426500006"}
