For any alphabet Sigma, we call a word w is an element of Sigma* morphically imprimitive provided that there are a shorter word v and morphisms h, h' : Sigma* -> Sigma* satisfying h(v) = w and h'(w) = v, and we say that w is morphically primitive otherwise. We explain why this is a well-chosen terminology, we demonstrate that morphic (im-) primitivity of words is a vital attribute in many combinatorial domains based on finite words and morphisms, and we study a number of fundamental properties of the concepts under consideration.
