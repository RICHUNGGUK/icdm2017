As Des claimed, the proposed scheme can resist attacks and threats such as many logged-in users with the same login identity, stolen-verifier, guessing, impersonation and replay. Unfortunately, we find that Das's authentication scheme is insecure against attacks of unknown user, password guessing and masquerade. In this paper, based on the framework of Das's two-factor user authentication, we introduce a secure billing service, and analyze our extended scheme on how to achieve imposter prevention, as well as resist against the drawbacks of Des's scheme.", "paper_title": "A SECURE BILLING SERVICE WITH TWO-FACTOR USER AUTHENTICATION IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400018"}
