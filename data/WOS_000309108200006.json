Similar to Priority Inheritance, M-BWI lets a task that has locked a resource execute in the resource reservations of the blocked tasks, thus reducing their blocking time. The protocol is particularly suitable for open systems where different kinds of tasks dynamically arrive and leave, because it guarantees temporal isolation among independent subsets of tasks without requiring any information on their temporal parameters. Additionally, if the temporal parameters of the interacting tasks are known, it is possible to compute an upper bound to the interference suffered by a task due to other interacting tasks. Thus, it is possible to provide timing guarantees for a subset of interacting hard real-time tasks. Finally, the M-BWI protocol is neutral to the underlying scheduling policy: it can be implemented in global, clustered and semi-partitioned scheduling. After introducing the M-BWI protocol, in this paper we formally prove its isolation properties, and propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound to the interference suffered by a task. Then, we describe our implementation of the protocol for the LITMUS (RT) real-time testbed, and measure its overhead. Finally, we compare M-BWI against FMLP and OMLP, two other protocols for resource sharing in multiprocessor systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis and implementation of the multiprocessor bandwidth inheritance protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000309108200006"}
