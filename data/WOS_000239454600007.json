We show that, for any space of no more than three dimensions, the fixed point theorem [4] of Iimura, Murota and Tamura, on integrally convex sets can be derived from Chen and Deng's fixed point theorem [2] on lattices by extending every direction-preserving discrete correspondence over an integrally convex set to one over a lattice. We present a counter example for the four dimensional space. Related algorithmic results are also presented for finding a fixed point of direction-preserving correspondences on integrally convex sets, for spaces of all dimensions.", "paper_title": "Lattice embedding of direction-preserving correspondence over integrally convex set (Extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600007"}
