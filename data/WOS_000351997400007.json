The product features that cannot be machined using the conventional material removal processes can now be easily generated employing the NTM processes due to their various added advantages. To achieve enhanced machining performance of the NTM processes, it is always desirable to determine the optimal settings of various control parameters of those processes. It has been observed that the optimal parametric combinations attained applying different optimization techniques may not usually belong amongst the conducted experimental trials and the process engineer may have to perform additional experiments to achieve the desired machining goals. In this paper, the applicability of weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is explored for parametric optimization of five NTM processes. It is concluded that WASPAS method can be deployed as an effective tool for both single response and multiresponse optimization of the NTM processes. It is also observed that this method is quite robust with respect to the changing coefficient (A.) values.", "paper_title": "Application of WASPAS Method as an Optimization Tool in Non-traditional Machining Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000351997400007"}
