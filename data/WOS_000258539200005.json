The main feature of our model is the introduction of a regularizing term which is also a fractional power of the Laplacian. This term allows us to recover higher frequencies. The model is particularly useful to devise an algorithm for blind deconvolution. We will show, analyze and illustrate through examples the performance of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "Blind deconvolution models regularized by fractional powers of the Laplacian", "paper_id": "WOS:000258539200005"}
