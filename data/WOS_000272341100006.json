Thanks to the proposed algorithms, licensed spectrum holders can release spectrum bands in large geographical areas to be leased to other secondary markets in a cognitive radio environment, while preserving the quality of service (QoS) of the licensed users in the system. Results are obtained comparing the proposed schemes against other conventional frequency reuse strategies, revealing significant improvements in terms of both spectral efficiency and opportunities for secondary usage.
