Scratchpad memory (SPM) is software-managed small on-chip memory for improving system performance and predicability. We consider SPM based on spin-transfer torque RAM, a type of NVM with high performance and good endurance. We present algorithms for allocating data variables to SPM and distribute write activity evenly in the SPM address space, in order to achieve wear-leveling and prolong the lifetime of NVM. We present two optimization algorithms for minimizing system CPU utilization subject to NVM lifetime constraints: 1) an optimal algorithm based on ILP and 2) an efficient heuristic algorithm that can obtain close-to-optimal solutions.", "paper_title": "Endurance-Aware Allocation of Data Variables on NVM-Based Scratchpad Memory in Real-Time Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361683200006"}
