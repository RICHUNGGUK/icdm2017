It introduces smart cards ensuring strong authentication in IP networks, according to the extensible authentication protocol (EAP). An open software implementation has been released for Java cards. These devices may be deployed on clients' terminals (such as IEEE 802.1X supplicants) or in RADIUS servers. Experimental results, observed with platforms including win32 computers, Wi-Fi access points and smart card enabled RADIUS servers, demonstrate that this approach is realistic, even with today's smart cards.
