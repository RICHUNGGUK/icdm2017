Replicating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this paper explored the moderating effects of personal characteristics on the decision pattern of 3G MDS acceptance. The study applied SEM model comparisons and hierarchical multiple regression procedures to the survey data collected from 1,432 urban participants in China. The results showed that age, experience, and location had strong moderating effects on the MDS acceptance model in urban China. This study also revealed that gender and income exert evident confounding effects over MDS acceptance decisions. Important results and implications were also discussed.", "paper_title": "MOBILE DATA SERVICE DEMOGRAPHICS IN URBAN CHINA", "paper_id": "WOS:000274760600012"}
