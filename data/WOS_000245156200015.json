It is based on Daubechies' discrete wavelet transform (DWT-db), linear prediction coefficients (LPC), and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). Wavelets with different support-sizes and three LS-SVM kernels are compared. Particularly, the proposed approach, implemented with modest computer requirements, leads to an adequate larynx pathology classifier to identify nodules in vocal folds. It presents over 90% of classification accuracy and has a low order of computational complexity in relation to the speech signal's length.
