To illustrate the approach we consider two problems of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar [M. Mahajan, V. Raman, S. Sikdar, Parameterizing above or below guaranteed values, J. Comput. System Sci. 75 (2) (2009) 137-153]. We show that a generalization of one of the problems and three non-trivial special cases of the other problem admit kernels of quadratic size. As a byproduct we obtain a new probabilistic inequality that could be of independent interest. Our new inequality is dual to the Hypercontractive Inequality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
