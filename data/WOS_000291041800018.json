Pharmacol Biochem Behav 92:508, (2009)] revealed that geissospermine (GSP), the major alkaloid of the bark extract of Brazilian Geissospermum vellosii, inhibits acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in the brains of rats and electric eels (Electrophorus electricus). However, the binding mode (i.e., conformation and orientation) of this indole-indoline alkaloid into the AChE active site is unknown. Therefore, in order to propose a plausible binding mode between GSP and AChE, which might explain the observed experimental inhibitory activity, we performed comparative automatic molecular docking simulations using the AutoDock and Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) programs. A sample of ten crystal structures of the Pacific electric ray (Torpedo californica) TcAChE, in complex with ten diverse active site ligands, was selected as a robust re-docking validation test, and also for GSP docking. The MVD results indicate a preferential binding mode between GSP and AChE, in which GSP functional groups may perform specific interactions with residues in the enzyme active site, according to the ligand-protein contacts detected by the LPC/CSU server. Four hydrogen bonds were detected between GSP and Tyr121, Ser122, Ser200, and His440, in which the last two residues belong to the catalytic triad (Ser200I double dagger I double dagger I double dagger His440I double dagger I double dagger I double dagger Glu327). Hydrophobic and pi-pi stacking interactions were also detected between GSP and Phe330 and Trp84, respectively; these are involved in substrate stabilization at the active site. This study provides the basis to propose structural changes to the GSP structure, such as molecular simplification and isosteric replacement, in order to aid the design of new potential AChE inhibitors that are relevant to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "paper_title": "Docking of the alkaloid geissospermine into acetylcholinesterase: a natural scaffold targeting the treatment of Alzheimer's disease", "paper_id": "WOS:000291041800018"}
