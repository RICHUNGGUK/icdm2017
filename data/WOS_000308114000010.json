The substantial data on these protozoan parasites has not been utilized completely to develop potential therapeutic strategies against Leishmaniasis. Dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) plays a major role in the infective state of the parasite and hence the DHFR-TS based drugs remains of much interest to researchers working on Leishmaniasis. Although, crystal structures of DHFR-TS from different species including Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi are available, the experimentally determined structure of the Leishmania major DHFR-TS has not yet been reported in the Protein Data Bank. A high quality three dimensional structure of L.major DHFR-TS has been modeled through the homology modeling approach. Carefully refined and the energy minimized structure of the modeled protein was validated using a number of structure validation programs to confirm its structure quality. The modeled protein structure was used in the process of structure based virtual screening to figure out a potential lead structure against DHFR TS. The lead molecule identified has a binding affinity of 0.51 nM and clearly follows drug like properties.", "paper_title": "Probing the structure of Leishmania major DHFR TS and structure based virtual screening of peptide library for the identification of anti-leishmanial leads", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000010"}
