In this paper, we propose a new method based on an ensemble of K-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (HKNN) classifiers, where each HKNN is trained using a different physicochemical property of the amino acids. Moreover, we propose a new encoding technique that combines the amino acid indices together with the 2-Grams amino acid composition. A fusion of HKNN classifiers combined with the 'Sum rule' enables us to obtain an improvement over other state-of-the-art methods. The approach is demonstrated by building a learning system based on experimentally validated protein-protein interactions in human gastric bacterium Helicobacter pylori and in Human dataset.", "paper_title": "An ensemble of K-local hyperplanes for predicting protein-protein interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300009"}
