This is especially the case in the car, airplane, shipbuilding, textile, and shoe making industry. In order to manufacture such an object, a pattern has to be generated first. it has to be cut out from plane material and then bend to the final shape. The same problem can be found also in computer graphics, where flat patterns are used to decrease distortions in texture mapping. Therefore, it is important for designers and computer engineers to master the flat pattern generation. In literature, a great number of methods for pattern generation can be found and it is important to know their advantages and weaknesses. In this article, the application FlattGen is presented where the most important flattening methods can be seen and compared to each other. In this way, students can experiment and prepare themselves better for the future work.
