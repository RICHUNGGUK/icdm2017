The choice of an appropriate parameter in this family is crucial. We propose a modification of the classical discrepancy principle as an adaptive parameter selection. This varying discrepancy principle evaluates the misfit in some weighted norm, and it also has an incorporated emergency stop. These ingredients allow the order optimal reconstruction when the solution owns nice spectral resolution. Theoretical analysis is accompanied with numerical simulations, which highlight the features of the proposed varying discrepancy principle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
