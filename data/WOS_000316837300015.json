Previous work on the subject has delved on very specific types of systems. Here we obtain results for broader classes of dynamical systems (including those systems defined by Lipschitz/analytic functions). In particular we show that systems robust to infinitesimal perturbations only recognize recursive languages. We also show the converse direction: every recursive language can be robustly recognized by a computable system. By other words we show that robustness is equivalent to decidability.
