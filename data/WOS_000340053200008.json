Stochastic computation provides ultra-low-complexity hardware using simple logic gates. Clockless decoding eliminates global clocking, which eases the worst-case timing restrictions of synchronous stochastic decoders. The lack of synchronization might use outdated bits to update outputs in computation nodes; however, it does not significantly affect output probabilities. A timing model of clockless-computation behaviours under a 90 nm CMOS technology is used to simulate the BER performance of the proposed decoding scheme. Based on our models, the proposed decoding scheme significantly reduces error floors due to the \"lock-up\" problem and achieves superior BER performance compared with conventional synchronous stochastic decoders. The timing model includes metastability to verify the affect on BER performance.", "paper_title": "Clockless Stochastic Decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes: Architecture and Simulation Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000340053200008"}
