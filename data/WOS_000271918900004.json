A decision-tree methodology was employed to analyze the effect of process attributes on the result of the process execution. In the course of process execution, the level of risk is monitored in real-time, and an early warning can be issued depending on the change of the risk level. An algorithm for estimating the risk of ongoing processes in real-time was formulated. Comparison experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method detects the risks of business processes more precisely and even earlier than existing approaches.", "paper_title": "REAL-TIME RISK MEASUREMENT FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITY MONITORING (BAM)", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900004"}
