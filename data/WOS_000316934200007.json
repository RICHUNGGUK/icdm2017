It is highly challenging when facing to large-scale database with large variance. The retrieval systems rely on a key component, the predefined or learned similarity measures over images. We note that, the similarity measures can be potential improved if the data distribution information is exploited using a more sophisticated way. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure learning approach for image retrieval. The similarity measure, so called Fisher kernel, is derived from the probabilistic distribution of images and is the function over observed data, hidden variable and model parameters, where the hidden variables encode high level information which are powerful in discrimination and are failed to be exploited in previous methods. We further propose a discriminative learning method for the similarity measure, i.e., encouraging the learned similarity to take a large value for a pair of images with the same label and to take a small value for a pair of images with distinct labels. The learned similarity measure, fully exploiting the data distribution, is well adapted to dataset and would improve the retrieval system. We evaluate the proposed method on Corel-1000, Corel5k, Caltech101 and MIRFlickr 25,000 databases. The results show the competitive performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Learning Discriminative Fisher Kernel for Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000316934200007"}
