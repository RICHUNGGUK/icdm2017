The amount of information of today's websites, the continuous evolution of the medium and the heterogeneity of typical users' profiles, make the website design task particularly hard. The presented tools are mainly based on recent models of Web usage behavior, and involve various natural language and semantic similarity modeling methods. Validation studies of the presented tools have shown that they can support effectively various phases of the website design lifecycle including information structuring, hyperlink evaluation and assessment of alternative designs. In this paper, existing techniques are discussed, the aspects of Web design that (should and) could be better supported are identified and suggestions are made on extensions of existing approaches to better support the usability evaluation process.", "paper_title": "A SURVEY OF TOOLS SUPPORTING DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF WEBSITES BASED ON MODELS OF HUMAN INFORMATION INTERACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000285837000004"}
