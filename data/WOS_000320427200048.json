One of the most important components of the VIC method algorithm is the solution of the Poisson equation. Multigrid and full multigrid methods were chosen for its solution on GPU. Its speed-up was almost 12 times greater than for the direct Fast Poisson Solver for a single processor. The speed-up for the entire VIC method implementation on the GPU was 46 times.
