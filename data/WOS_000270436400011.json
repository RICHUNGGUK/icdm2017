The relationships between entropy-like functions and metrics defined on lattices are studied and we show the links that exists between various properties of entropies and properties of metrics. Applications to metrics defined on the lattice of partitions of finite sets are examined.", "paper_title": "Betweenness, Metrics and Entropies in Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000270436400011"}
