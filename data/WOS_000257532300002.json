The framework guarantees a precise control of topological changes introduced as a result of triangle insertion/removal operations and enables the definition of intuitive high-level operators for managing the mesh while keeping its topological integrity. An application is described in the implementation of an innovative approach for the detection of 2D objects from images that integrates the topological control enabled by geometric modeling with traditional image processing techniques.
