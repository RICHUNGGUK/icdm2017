This paper presents the detail of a system aiming at normalizing the orthography of French SMS messages: after discussing the linguistic peculiarities of these messages and possible approaches to their automatic normalization, we present, compare, and evaluate various instanciations of a normalization device based on weighted finite-state transducers. These experiments show that using an intermediate phonemic representation and training, our system outperforms an alternative normalization system based on phrase-based statistical machine translation techniques.", "paper_title": "Rewriting the orthography of SMS messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000278491400002"}
