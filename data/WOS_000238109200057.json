In this paper, we analytically model the traffic rate crossing the network channels of a hypercube network under different working conditions. The effect of different parameters on the shaping of non-uniformity and traffic imbalance over network channels, are considered and analytical models for each case are proposed.", "paper_title": "Analytic modeling of channel traffic in n-cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200057"}
