Data sensed by each sensor are, then, opportunistically transmitted to Mobile Nodes (MNs) that happen to be in contact. In the considered scenario, communications between MNs and sensors require paradigms with a minimal synchronization between devices, extremely fast and energy efficient, especially at the sensor side. To deal with the above issues, in [1] we proposed a hybrid protocol for data delivery from sensors to MNs, named Hybrid Adaptive Interleaved Data Protocol (HI). By combining Erasure Coding (EC) with an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) scheme, the proposed protocol maximizes the reliability of communications while minimizing the energy consumed by sensors. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the HI performance. We provide an analytical evaluation by defining a flexible model to derive the probability of data delivery and exploiting it to investigate the performance over a wide range of parameters. Moreover, we perform an experimental study to evaluate the HI effectiveness on real sensor platforms. Specifically, we analyze the impact of resource constraints imposed by sensors on data delivery and provide a careful characterization of its actual consumption of resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
