We show that these enhanced MAC mechanisms can effectively improve the network capacity by not only reducing the protocol overheads, but also smoothing the AP-bottleneck effect in an infrastructure-based WLAN. Voice and video capacity under various MAC mechanisms are compared as well.", "paper_title": "Supporting voice and video applications over IEEE 802.11n WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263983000004"}
