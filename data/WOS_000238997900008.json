Design/methodology/approach - This study applies findings in cognitive psychology of vision, neuropsychology of the hemispheric mechanisms and quantum mechanics in order to explain how the electrostatic force operates at distance between two charged particles. Findings - In addition to the quantum fields theory, which explains the electrostatic force by photons that carry this force between charged particles (and is related to the left-hemispheric cognitive mechanism) a dual theory is suggested that explains this force by interchanging of features between particles (and is related to the right-hemispheric cognitive mechanism). Originality/value - Like Fidelman's previous studies, this too demonstrates that cybernetic considerations which use cognitive psychological, neuropsychological and physical-knowledge can obtain testable and applicable physical theories.", "paper_title": "The electrostatic force and the annihilation of particles and antiparticles - A cybernetical approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900008"}
