They have shown promise for clustering time series and incrementally pattern maintaining. In this paper, we design a generalized dimension-reduction framework for recent-biased approximations, aiming at making traditional dimension-reduction techniques actionable in recent-biased time series analysis. The framework is designed in two ways: equi-segmented scheme and vari-segmented scheme., In both schemes, time series data are first partitioned into segments and a dimension-reduction technique is applied to each segment. Then, more coefficients are kept for more recent data while fewer kept for older data. Thus, more details are preserved for recent data and fewer coefficients are kept for the whole time series, which improves the efficiency. greatly. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and demonstrate that traditional dimension-reduction techniques, such as SVD, DIFT, DWT, PIP, PAA, and landmarks, can be embedded into our framework for recent-biased approximations over streaming time series.", "paper_title": "Generalized dimension-reduction framework for recent-biased time series analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000234653100007"}
