By dividing the time-varying delays into multiple nonuniformly subinterval and choosing an appropriate novel Lyapunov functional which contains some triple integral terms, new stability criteria are obtained and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The uncertain parameters are modeled as having a structured linear fractional form. Besides, the derivatives of the time delays are considered having different bounds in various delay intervals. Moreover, less conservative conditions are obtained by using the lower bound lemma together with Jensen inequality lemma. Furthermore, the criteria can be applicable to both fast and slow time-varying delays. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
