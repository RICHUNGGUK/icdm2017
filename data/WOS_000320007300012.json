Because of the mobility, randomness, and complexity of persons, it is difficult to achieve complete data awareness and data transmission in IoT. Therefore, research must be conducted on mobile-aware service models. In this work, we first discuss and quantify the social relationships of mobile nodes from multiple perspectives based on a summary of social characteristics. We then define various decision factors (DFs). Next, we construct a directed and weighted community by analyzing the activity patterns of mobile nodes. Finally, a mobile-aware service routing algorithm (MSRA) is proposed to determine appropriate service nodes through a trusted chain and optimal path tree. The simulation results indicate that the model has superior dynamic adaptability and service discovery efficiency compared to the existing models. The mobile-aware service model could be used to improve date acquisition techniques and the quality of mobile-aware service in the IoT.", "paper_title": "Research on a Mobile-aware Service Model in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000320007300012"}
