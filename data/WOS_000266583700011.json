In this work we present a class of acyclic automata for which it is possible to obtain in time O (n(2) log n) an equivalent regular expression of size O ( n). A characterisation of this class is made using properties of the underlying digraphs that correspond to the series-parallel digraphs class. Using this characterisation we present an algorithm for the generation of automata of this class and an enumerative formula for the underlying digraphs with a given number of vertices.", "paper_title": "Series-Parallel Automata and Short Regular Expressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583700011"}
