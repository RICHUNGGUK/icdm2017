Also, we present an iterative procedure based on quadrature formula to solve such equations. The error estimation of the proposed method is given in terms of uniform and partial modulus of continuity. Finally, some numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the accuracy of the method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
