Hence the detection of IFs means: (i) to detect not only all the appearing time but also all the disappearing time of IFs and (ii) to detect the appearing time of an IF before this IF disappears, and the disappearing time of an IF before the subsequent IF appears. Within a statistical framework, the detection of scalar IFs in continuous linear stochastic dynamic systems has been mainly studied. Based on the sliding window, an analytical residual is generated, and two hypothesis tests are implemented to detect the appearing and disappearing times of IFs. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition for the detectability of IFs is obtained, and the detection speed can be fast enough. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations fully verify that IFs can be successfully detected.", "paper_title": "Detecting scalar intermittent faults in linear stochastic dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000347548400001"}
