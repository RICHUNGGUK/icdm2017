The criteria which also ensure global exponential stability when the input u(t) is equal to 0 and is easy to be verified only with the connection weights of the recurrent neural networks. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Two algebraic criteria for input-to-state stability of recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100014"}
