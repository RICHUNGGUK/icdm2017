The model is investigated using equilibrium path following and bifurcation techniques. It is shown that a multiscale stability criterion is essential for correctly interpreting the stability of crystal equilibrium configurations under both thermal- and stress-loading conditions. A two-stage temperature-induced phase transformation is predicted from a cubic B2 phase to an orthorhombic Cmmm phase to a final orthorhombic B 19 phase. Under stress-loading conditions, martensitic transformations from the B2 austenite phase to a number of possible martensite phases are identified. These include reconstructive transformations to B 11, B33, and C2/m structures and proper transformation to a C2/m monoclinic phase which displays characteristic tension-compression asymmetry. The prediction of both temperature-induced and stress-induced proper martensitic transformations indicates the likelihood that the current model will exhibit shape memory behavior.", "paper_title": "Multiscale bifurcation and stability of multilattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000254987500017"}
