The transition probabilities in Markov chain are assumed to be partially unknown. In terms of linear matrix inequality approach, the delay-dependent criteria are proposed to ensure the underlying system to be regular, causal and stochastically stable. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent stability analysis for discrete-time singular Markovian jump systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000309129000010"}
