Two multifactor approaches have been used in pose feature extraction, including a deterministic multilinear approach and a probabilistic approach based on multifactor Gaussian process. These two approaches are compared in terms of the degrees of view-invariance, reconstruction capacity, performances in human pose and gesture recognition using real movement datasets. The experimental results show that the deterministic multilinear approach outperforms the probabilistic-based approach in movement recognition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
