Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of DOBIS/LIBIS data structure, data extraction, including data mining, and data conversion of bibliographic, non-bibliographic and bilingual data was carried out to provide maximum information to libraries about the complexities of source data and how to overcome them. Findings - The majority of the problems came from the lack of full MARC support in DOBIS/LIBIS and because of some local practices. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the KFUPM library experience in data conversion from DOBIS/LBIS to Horizon. Practical implications - This study will have implications for libraries still operating under legacy systems. They are expected to be informed by the KFUPM library experience and hopefully will work on migrating to a new system sooner than later. On the other hand, libraries in the Middle East will receive encouragement from the authors' experience and will feel some relief that, despite the complexities of bilingual data, they have a good example to follow. Originality/value - This is the first study of data conversion in the Middle East and has enormous value for libraries still struggling with legacy systems. Following the KFUPM library example, they can now plan for their own system and data migration.", "paper_title": "Data migration from DOBIS/LIBIS to Horizon: experiences from the KFUPM Library in Saudi Arabia", "paper_id": "WOS:000236038000007"}
