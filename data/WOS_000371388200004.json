However, due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in biological tissues, FMT suffers from a low spatial resolution, which limits its capability of resolving the distribution of fluorescent biomarkers. In this paper, we investigate the effect of functional and structural a priori information on the accuracy of FMT reconstruction by a hybrid FMT and X-ray computed tomography imaging system. The results from numerical simulation and phantom experiments suggest that the fluorescence targets embedded in heterogeneous medium can be localized when structural a priori information is utilized to constrain the reconstruction process. In addition, both the functional and structural a priori information are essential for the recovery of fluorophore concentration.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of a Priori Information on Reconstruction of Fluorescence Molecular Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200004"}
