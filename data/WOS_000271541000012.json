Bending, membrane behavior and changes of curvature are simulated by using an axisymmetrical thin shell element of three nodes associated with a new piecewise linear (PWL) yield surface. The results obtained show better upper bounds when compared to other numerical and analytical solutions reported in the literature. Finally, an a posteriori error measure is re-written to include the new displacement rate and PWL strain rate fields, resulting in an adaptive scheme for refining the finite element mesh.
