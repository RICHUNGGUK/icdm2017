The proposed algorithm first finds the characteristic scale and the location of the interest points using Harris-Laplacian interest point detector. We then apply the Hilbert transform to each component and get the amplitude and the instantaneous frequency as the feature vectors. Then independent components analysis is used to model the image subspace and reduces the dimension of the feature vectors. The aim of this algorithm is to find a meaningful image subspace and more compact descriptors. Combination the proposed descriptors with an effective interest point detector, the proposed algorithm has a more accurate matching rate besides the robustness towards image deformations.", "paper_title": "Representation interest point using empirical mode decomposition and independent components analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800041"}
