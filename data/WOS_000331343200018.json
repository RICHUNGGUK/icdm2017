Second-order analog filters are categorized into the following three cases: complex conjugate poles, distinct real poles, and multiple real poles. For each case, simple formulas are derived for the synthesis of the balanced realizations of second-order analog filters. As a result, we obtain closed form expressions of the balanced realizations of second-order analog filters.", "paper_title": "Closed Form Expressions of Balanced Realizations of Second-Order Analog Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200018"}
