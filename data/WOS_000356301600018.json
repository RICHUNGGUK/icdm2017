We present different constructions for constant dimension codes with minimum injection distance 2 or k - 1, where k is the constant dimension. Furthermore, we present a construction of new codes from old codes for any minimum distance. Then, we construct nonconstant dimension codes from these codes. Some examples of codes obtained by these constructions are the largest known codes for the given parameters.", "paper_title": "Subspace Codes Based on Graph Matchings, Ferrers Diagrams, and Pending Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600018"}
