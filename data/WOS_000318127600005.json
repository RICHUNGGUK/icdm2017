Design/methodology/approach - Online survey data collected from 1,344 users are analysed the structural equation modelling (SEM) method. Findings - Results reveal that satisfaction is the most crucial factor contributing to user intention to use LTE services. Other factors, including perceived usefulness, attitude, and system and quality, also have notable impacts on user intention. Furthermore, system and service quality is affected by both perceived processing speed and perceived mobility, while perceived usefulness is primarily influenced by perceived adaptivity. In addition, four factors (perceived usefulness, adaptivity, processing speed, and system and service quality) are found to be major determinants the user attitudes toward the services. Originality/value - The present study provides valuable insights to understanding key factors affect user perceptions of and intention to use LTE services.", "paper_title": "User acceptance of long-term. evolution (LTE) services An application of extended technology acceptance model", "paper_id": "WOS:000318127600005"}
