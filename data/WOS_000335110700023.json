For optimum performance of a controller, the appropriate selection of its parameters is of utmost importance. Furthermore, when the initial conditions of the system change, the controller with the previous parameters would be not optimum in the new conditions. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, an online optimal Decoupled Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) approach is introduced. Firstly, to determine the optimum parameters of DSMC, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied. Next, to adapt the optimal controller to any initial condition, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximation is utilized. Finally, the proposed online optimal DSMC is successfully applied to a ball and beam system. The comparative studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
