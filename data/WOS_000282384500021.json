In the bivariate case, the marginal probability density functions f(1)(x) and f(2)(y) are related to their joint distribution f(x,y) via horizontal and vertical line integrals. Interestingly, this is also the case of a very limited angle X-ray cr problem where f(x,y) is an image representing the distribution of the material density and f(1)(x), f(2)(Y) are the horizontal and vertical line integrals. The problem of determining f(x,y) from f(1)(x) and f(2)(Y) is an ill-posed undetermined inverse problem. In statistics the notion of copula is exactly introduced to characterize all the possible solutions to the problem of reconstructing a bivariate density from its marginals. In this paper, we elaborate on the possible link between copula and a and try to see whether we can use the methods used in one domain into the other. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
