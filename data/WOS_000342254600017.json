This is usually counteracted by increasing the controller complexity, for instance by adding notch filters. The height of the resonance frequencies of the non-rigid body dynamics and the amount of damping significantly affect the achievable bandwidth. This paper describes a method to add damping to the flexible behavior of a motion stage, by using tuned mass-dampers with an over-critical damping value in contrast to a regular TMD with 10-20% damping. This over-critical damping results in a robust damper mechanism which is insensitive for parameter variations in terms of stiffness and damping. The main result is a significant modal damping increase over a broad band of resonant frequencies, with only four dampers added. This results in a bandwidth improvement of over 150% in z-direction, which leads to a disturbance suppression of over 10 times for both force and displacement disturbances. A damper test setup has been realized and tested to validate the possibility to create dampers with this over-critical damping behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
