Over the last few decades, permutation flow shop problems have widely been studied and solved as a static problem. However, in many practical systems, permutation flow shop problems are not really static, but rather dynamic, where the challenge is to schedule n different products that must be produced on a permutation shop floor in a cyclical pattern. In this paper, we have considered a make-to-stock production system, where three related issues must be considered: the length of a production cycle, the batch size of each product, and the order of the products in each cycle. To deal with these tasks, we have proposed a genetic algorithm based lot scheduling approach with an objective of minimizing the sum of the setup and holding costs. The proposed algorithm has been tested using scenarios from a real-world sanitaryware production system, and the experimental results illustrates that the proposed algorithm can obtain better results in comparison to traditional reactive approaches.
