In this paper, we propose a new soft set model, called generalized vague soft set, which is an extension of the generalized fuzzy soft set. We also define some basic operations and discuss their some properties on generalized vague fuzzy soft set. Based on the proposed intersection and union operations, we further investigate the lattice structures of generalized vague soft set and obtain two lattice structures, and it is proved that the two lattices are bounded contributive lattices.", "paper_title": "Generalized vague soft set and its lattice structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603500005"}
