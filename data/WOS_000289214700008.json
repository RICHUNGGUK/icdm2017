The paper gathers well-known general-purpose preferences representation and elicitation methods from the literature. It also reviews preference-driven multimedia adaptation. Subsequently, a representation model for multimedia adaptation preferences is developed, which combines and extends existing methods. This model is later on incorporated into the MPEG-21 framework. To demonstrate the suitability of this proposal, a description of how this model can be applied to represent and carry out multimedia adaptation decisions has been developed.", "paper_title": "A model for preference-driven multimedia adaptation decision-making in the MPEG-21 framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000289214700008"}
