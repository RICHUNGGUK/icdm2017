The issues of the operation of various architectures used to solve vision problems, from the pipeline of dedicated operators to general purpose MIMD machines. passing through specialized SIMD machines and processors with extended instruction sets, and parallelization tools. from parallel library to parallel programming languages, are reviewed. In this context. a discussion of open issues and directions for future research is provided. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
