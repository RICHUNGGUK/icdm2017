The controller is built upon the Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Control (BELBIC) concept proposed by Caro Lucas [Lucas, C., Shahmirzadi, D., & Sheikholeslami, N. (2004). Introducing BELBIC: Brain emotional learning based intelligent controller. International Journal of Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing, 10, 11-21]. First the structure of BELBIC is analyzed to further understand its features. Next, different types of emotional signals, required by BELBIC, are experimentally evaluated to meet the challenges in position tracking of pneumatic actuators. The best performing BELBIC structure is then experimentally compared with a previously developed robust proportional integral controller. It is also successfully applied to a force reflecting tele-operated application of pneumatic actuator.", "paper_title": "EMOTIONAL LEARNING BASED POSITION CONTROL OF PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340132500009"}
