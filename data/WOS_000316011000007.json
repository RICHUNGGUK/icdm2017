Unlike existing packet selection algorithms, Weight Pick introduces the concept of a dynamic combination number in performing network coding. Based on this concept, a base station dynamically determines the number of packets combined or encoded in a retransmission packet based on the current packet receiving status of users and the combination number for each retransmission packet can be different. In packet selection, Weight Pick attempts to find an encoding combination whose weight is not less than (C - 1) for every user, where C is the combination number of that retransmission packet. Simulation results show that Weight Pick can significantly improve the retransmission performance as compared with existing packet selection algorithms in terms of both packet loss ratio and packet transmission delay.", "paper_title": "Weight Pick: an efficient packet selection algorithm for network coding based multicast retransmission in mobile communication networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316011000007"}
