In this study, the ROMs in both the knee joint and CPM device during CPM treatment were measured using a motion analysis system for three different CPM devices. Additionally, the trajectories of the angles at the knee for hip joint misalignments were evaluated using kinematic models of the three CPM devices. The results showed that discrepancies in ROM between the knee joints and the CPM device settings during CPM treatment were revealed regardless of the CPM device and that the effect of misalignment is dependent on the design of the CPM device. The present technology could be applied for the development of a better design configuration for the CPM device to reduce the discrepancy in ROM at the knee joint.", "paper_title": "Reduction of knee range of motion during continuous passive motion due to misaligned hip joint centre", "paper_id": "WOS:000306667300003"}
