Two types of fluid and structural discretizations are investigated: finite-difference/finite-difference as well as the more traditional finite-volume/finite-element (FV/FE) configuration. In either case, the material properties and grid spacing are treated as uniform within each domain. A theoretical stability analysis and corresponding numerical tests show that greater stability is associated with the algorithm in which the fluid domain is passed a Dirichlet condition and the solid domain a von Neumann condition and that the stability of the coupled scheme may be strongly affected by the interface velocity. Furthermore, it shows that the interface velocity has a larger destabilizing effect on the FV/FE discretization than on a finite-difference/finite-difference discretization.
