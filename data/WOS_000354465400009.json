Classical tests include the Bonferroni test and the Simes test. So far, the most efficient methods for this problem are known as the combined p-value tests, such as the Fisher's product test, the truncated product method, the rank truncated product test, the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) method and Zhang et al.'s [A combined p-value test for multiple hypothesis testing. J Stat Plan Inference. 2013;143:764-770] test that extends the ARTP method. Our method is based on Zhang et al.'s [A combined p-value test for multiple hypothesis testing. J Stat Plan Inference. 2013;143:764-770] test and modifies it by using different critical percentile parameter tau(j) for the statistic [GRAPHICS] with each j=1, horizontal ellipsis , n. Simulation studies show that the sizes of our test are stable at the significance level and the powers are superior to commonly used methods.", "paper_title": "A modified combined p-value multiple test", "paper_id": "WOS:000354465400009"}
