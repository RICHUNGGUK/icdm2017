But there are many difficulties to realize object replication in efficiently. In this paper, we discuss the architecture of object storage system with object replication, and analyze key question of dynamic replication such as replica granularity, When to replicate storage object and Where to place the replicas etc.. In the theory, we give the formulas of these question, the analysis prove these formulas are reasonable.", "paper_title": "Dynamic replication strategies for object storage systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000006"}
