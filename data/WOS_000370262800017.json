It is obvious that the traditional stand-alone store has no ability to satisfy the performance requirements, and the use of single core CPU is unable to content the severe requirement of speed. Consequently, multi-machine parallel acceleration technique based on MPI (cooperated with multi-core parallel acceleration technique based on OpenMP) can effectively solve all above problems. In this paper, a parallel distributed acceleration framework based on MPI and Open MP technology was given. Experimental tests were carried to verify our proposal. Finally, some suggestions to speed up the data processing was given.", "paper_title": "Parallel Distributed Acceleration Based on MPI and OpenMP Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800017"}
