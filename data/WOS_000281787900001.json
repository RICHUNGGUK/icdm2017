In some applications, the segmented areas associated with different events overlap spatially and temporally forming random clumps. In order to study the shape-size features and durations of the events, it is a usual practice to analyze only isolated episodes. However, this sample is biased, because faster and smaller events tend to be isolated. We model the images as a realization of a cylindrical temporal Boolean model. We evaluate the bias introduced when ruling out non-isolated episodes. We propose an estimator of the duration distribution and perform a simulation study to assess its accuracy. The method is applied to fluorescent-tagged proteins image sequences. Results show that this procedure is effective for analyzing dynamic processes where spatial and temporal overlapping occurs.", "paper_title": "Estimating the Duration of Overlapping Events from Image Sequences Using Cylindrical Temporal Boolean Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000281787900001"}
