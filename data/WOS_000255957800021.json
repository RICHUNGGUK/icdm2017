Using a multi-camera tracking system the real-time processing is one of the most important issues to be considered. As we know, using multiple cameras the system will record a huge volume of video data. Therefore, we need a system that is able to track quickly the location of a human motion in every frame under minimizing processing time. The detail outcome and result from experiments of the method are discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Multi-camera tracking system for human motions in different areas and situations", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800021"}
