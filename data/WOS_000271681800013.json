A robust DWT-based copyright verification scheme with Fuzzy ART that does not require the original image for ownership verification is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme, which combines DWT, Fuzzy ART, and the quantization process, converts an image into a short robust table with the embedded ownership information. Unlike general classification, such as k-mean and fuzzy c-means, the number of clusters can be adaptively decided by the vigilance parameter of Fuzzy ART. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against common image processing, geometric distortions, and intentional attacks. The original image is not required to extract the embedded ownership image. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
