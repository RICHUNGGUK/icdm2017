We develop two different methods to achieve subexponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on sparse directed graphs. We exemplify our approaches with two well studied problems. For the first problem, k-LEAF OUT-BRANCHING, which is to find an oriented spanning tree with at least k leaves, we obtain an algorithm solving the problem in time 2(O(root k log k))n + n(O(1)) on directed graphs whose underlying undirected graph excludes some fixed graph H as a minor. For the special case when the input directed graph is planar, the running time can be improved to 2(O(root k))n + n(O(1)). The second example is a generalization of the DIRECTED HAMILTONIAN PATH problem, namely k-INTERNAL OUT-BRANCHING, which is to find all oriented spanning tree with at least k internal vertices. We obtain an algorithm solving the problem in time 2(O(root k log k)) + n(O(1)) on directed graphs whose underlying undirected graph excludes some fixed apex graph H as a minor. Finally, we observe that on these classes of graphs, the k-DIRECTED PATH problem is solvable in time O((1 + epsilon)(k)n(f(epsilon))), for any epsilon > 0, where f is some function of epsilon. Our methods are based on non-trivial combinations of obstruction theorems for undirected graphs, kernelization, problem-specific combinatorial structures, and a layering technique similar to the one employed by Baker to obtain PTAS for planar graphs.
