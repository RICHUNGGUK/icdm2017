In our previous work, we have proposed a framework of Digital Reaction-Diffusion System (DRDS)-a model of a discrete-time discrete-space reaction-diffusion system useful for nonlinear signal processing tasks. In this paper, we design a special DRDS, called an \"excitable DRDS,\" which emulates excitable reaction-diffusion dynamics and produces traveling waves. we also demonstrate an application of the excitable DRDS to the shortest path search problem defined on two-dimensional (2-D) space with arbitrary boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "A shortest path search algorithm using an excitable digital reaction-diffusion system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000012"}
