We consider different classes of boson deformations and found that intensity measurement on coherent or thermal states would be suitable for their detection making, at least in principle, tests of boson deformation feasible with current quantum optical technology. On the other hand, we found that the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) is vanishing with the deformation itself for all the considered classes of deformations and probe signals, thus making any estimation procedure of photon deformation inherently inefficient. A partial way out is provided by the polynomial dependence of the QSNR on the average number of photons, which suggests that, in principle, it would be possible to detect deformation by intensity measurements on high-energy thermal states.", "paper_title": "Quantum limits to estimation of photon deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900010"}
