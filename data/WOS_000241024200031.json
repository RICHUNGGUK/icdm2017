There, we assumed that the observation is complete in the sense that all revision inputs during the time of observation were known to us. Here, we drop this assumption and investigate the case where there are intermediate inputs we have no information about. The focus will be on determining the core belief of the agent - a belief the agent commits to at all times.", "paper_title": "Reasoning about an agent based on its revision history with missing inputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241024200031"}
