Through the lens of the situational theory of publics, we shed light on how employees adapt to increasing communication demands. We uncovered active technology-mediated behavior such as information gaining, action, and social interaction seeking, and their association with perceived risk (i.e., message, information and action). Findings suggest that technology-mediated communication behaviors are not only enabled by the use of ICTs but behavior also involves appropriate structuring of single and multiple ICTs to manage problems encountered during communication.
