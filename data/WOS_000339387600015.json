The controlled pulse and image overlay technique are introduced for the programming of memristor crossbars and promising a better performance for noise reduction. The time-slot technique is helpful for improving the processing speed of image. Simulink and numerical simulations have been employed to demonstrate the useful applications of the proposed circuit structure in image learning.", "paper_title": "Memristor crossbar-based unsupervised image learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387600015"}
