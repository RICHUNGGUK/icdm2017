Participating students were asked to complete assignments on the Internet. The findings reveal that the levels of both information and strategic Internet skills have much room for improvement. Of the variables that influenced these skills, the level of education was most important, whereas the years of Internet experience and the number of hours spent online weekly did not have any effect. Among the most important specific information and skills related to problems the secondary students experienced were defining proper search queries, evaluating the information found, maintaining focus, or taking the appropriate steps to reach the final goal. Overall, the secondary students' performance calls into question whether they possess a sufficient level of information and strategic skills for using the Internet for homework or school projects.
