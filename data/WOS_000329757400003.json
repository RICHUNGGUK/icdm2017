Specifically, it first developed a static E-Healthcare Information Security Risk (EHISR) model to present thirty-three security risk factors by identifying information security threats and their sources in e-healthcare. Second, a dynamic E-Healthcare Information Flow (EHIF) model was developed to logically link these information risk factors in the EHISR model. Pattern analysis showed that information security risks could be classified into two levels, and versatility analysis showed that the overall security risks for eight information flows were close with a range from 55% to 86%. Third, one quantifiable approach based on a relative-weighted assessment model was developed to demonstrate how to assess the information security risks in e-healthcare. This quantitative security risk measurement establishes a reference point for assessing e-healthcare security risks and assists managers in selecting a reliable information flow infrastructure with a lower security risk level.", "paper_title": "Development of an E-Healthcare Information Security Risk Assessment Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000329757400003"}
