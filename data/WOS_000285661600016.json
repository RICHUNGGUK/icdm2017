Analytical continuation of the S-matrix element is performed by constructing a type-II Pade approximant from given physical values (Bessis et al. (1994) [421: Vrinceanu et al. (2000) [24]; Sokolovski and Msezane (2004) [23]). The algorithm involves iterative 'preconditioning' of the numerical data by extracting its rapidly oscillating potential phase component. The code has the capability of adding non-analytical noise to the numerical data in order to select 'true' physical poles, investigate their stability and evaluate the accuracy of the reconstruction. It has an option of employing multiple-precision (MPFUN) package (Bailey (1993) [451) developed by D.H. Bailey wherever double precision calculations fail due to a large number of input partial waves (energies) involved. The code has been successfully tested on several models, as well as the F + H-2 -> HE + H, F + HD : HE + D, Cl + HCI CIH + Cl and H + D-2 -> HD + D reactions. Some detailed examples are given in the text.

The data can then be used for quantitative analysis of interference patterns observed in elastic, inelastic and reactive integral and differential cross sections. Solution method: The S-matrix element is analytically continued in the complex plane of either energy or angular momentum with the help of Pade approximation of type II. Resonance (complex energy or Regge) poles are identified and their residues evaluated. Unusual features: Use of multiple precision MPFUN package (Bailey (1993) [45]). (Distributed with the PADE II code.) Running time: From several seconds to several minutes depending on the precision level chosen and the number of iterations performed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
