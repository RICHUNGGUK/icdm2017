In this scheme, two study processes are executed respectively to obtain the characteristics of the errors in every link first; and then, according to the study results and the selection rule inferred by us, this scheme select,; a better error recovery scheme for every path. Simulation results show that compared with traditional simple retransmission scheme and hybrid single-error-correction, multi-error-retransmission scheme, this scheme greatly improves the throughput and cuts down the energy consumption with little area increase.", "paper_title": "Study-Based Error Recovery Scheme for Networks-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300010"}
