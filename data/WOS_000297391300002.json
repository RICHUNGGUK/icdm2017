Thus, distinguishing between substrates and non-substrates of BCRP is important not only for clinical use but also for drug discovery and development. In this study, a prediction model of the substrates and non-substrates of BCRP was developed using a modified support vector machine (SVM) method, namely GA-CG-SVM. The overall prediction accuracy of the established GA-CG-SVM model is 91.3% for the training set and 85.0% for an independent validation set. For comparison, two other machine learning methods, namely, C4.5 DT and k-NN, were also adopted to build prediction models. The results show that the GA-CG-SVM model is significantly superior to C4.5 DT and k-NN models in terms of the prediction accuracy. To sum up, the prediction model of BCRP substrates and non-substrates generated by the GA-CG-SVM method is sufficiently good and could be used as a screening tool for identifying the substrates and non-substrates of BCRP.
