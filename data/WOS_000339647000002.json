A pivotal role of Sgk1 in carcinogenesis and in resistance to anticancer therapy has been suggested. With the aim of identifying new Sgk1 modulators, 322 pyrazolo-pyrimidine derivatives have been virtually screened with respect to a crystallographic model of Sgk1. The top five ranked compounds have been evaluated demonstrating Sgk1 inhibition in vitro and selectivity compared to RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt1).", "paper_title": "In Silico Identification and Biological Evaluation of Novel Selective Serum/Glucocorticoid-Inducible Kinase 1 Inhibitors Based on the Pyrazolo-Pyrimidine Scaffold", "paper_id": "WOS:000339647000002"}
