Case studies are conducted for both TENCENT and Qihoo 360, with their customers being simulated as agents in a model for products selection. The result of different competition strategies of the two enterprises is obtained from the virtual market. The results indicate that cross-border competition is unable to improve the market share of the two leading Internet content providers. The findings suggest that keeping one of the three proposed Nash equilibriums is the recommended strategy for companies involved in cross-border competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
