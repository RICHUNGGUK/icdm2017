An n-vertex graph G is said to be hypoenergetic if E(G) < n. We formulate a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for an n-vertex tree with maximum vertex degree Delta being hypoenergetic. Based on it we show that: (a) if Delta = 3, then there exist hypoenergetic trees for n = 4 and n = 7; (b) if Delta = 4, then there exist hypoenergetic trees for all n >= 5, such that n equivalent to k (mod 4), k = 0, 1, 3; (c) if Delta >= 5, then there exist hypoenergetic trees for all n >= Delta + 1. We prove that hypoenergetic trees with Delta = 3 exist only for n = 4 and n = 7 (a single such tree for each value of n). Computer search indicates that there exist hypoenergetic trees with Delta = 4 also for n equivalent to 2 (mod 4).", "paper_title": "Hypoenergetic trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200013"}
