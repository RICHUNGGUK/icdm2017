Consider a class of risk processes {(X-epsilon(t)) : 8 > 0} derived from (X(t)) via scaling in a slow Markov walk sense, and let psi(epsilon)(u),(u) be the corresponding ruin probability. In this paper we prove sample path large deviations for (X-epsilon(t)) as epsilon -> 0. As a consequence, we give exact asymptotics for log psi(epsilon)(u) and we determine a most likely path leading to ruin. Finally, using importance sampling, we find an asymptotically efficient law for the simulation of psi(epsilon)(u).", "paper_title": "A class of risk processes with reserve-dependent premium rate: sample path large deviations and importance sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000246108900001"}
