Currently there are several different ways to calculate the citation rates, each with limitations to be improved. This paper provides a new analysis approach for the ranking and citation of published journals. Because cited half-life is the number of publication years from the current year that account for 50% of the current citations published by a journal in its article references, it can evaluate the age of the majority of cited articles. Through using the cited half-life as the sample time variable, we can seek the normalized value of citations and the citable items. This value can avoid the impacts from different journals or different fields. A more radical improvement is suggested in the impact factor, and relative impact factor, which can measure effectively not only the short-time performance of the journals but also the long-time performance. Based on this, relative R-impact (RRI) is proposed to improve R-impact effectively.", "paper_title": "Relative R-Impact Based on Normalization Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000266877400010"}
