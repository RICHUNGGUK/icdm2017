Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) is the most used distortion metric in video coding implementation and consumes a relative large area in the motion estimation hardware. This paper presents the standard-cells synthesis and a comprehensive analysis of various parallel hardware architectures alternatives for SAD calculation, focusing on different design constraints such as high-performance (maximum throughput) and the tradeoff between high-performance and low-power dissipation (namely an isoperformance target). Low-power techniques supported by commercial standard-cells tools are exercised in this design, such as clock gating, multi-threshold (VT) and a combination of slow and fast standard-cells. We achieved significant power reduction for the architectures with lower frequencies and higher parallelism, slow cells and mainly with only one pipeline stage.", "paper_title": "Synthesis and comparison of low-power high-throughput architectures for SAD calculation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400023"}
