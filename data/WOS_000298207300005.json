NAM is a hierarchical image representation method and it aims to provide faster operations and less storage requirement. By taking a rectangle sub-pattern, for example, we describe the idea of NAM and its encoding algorithm. In addition, an approach for adaptive area histogram equalization for image contrast enhancement based on a NAM image is presented. The contrast enhancement approach is designed to meet the NAM image representation and it can be duplicated with faster operation. The complexity analysis and the experimental results show that the NAM based algorithm for image contrast enhancement is faster and more effective than that based on matrix image.
