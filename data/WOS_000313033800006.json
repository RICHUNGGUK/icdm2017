However, choosing the number of hidden states remains an open question and the inclusion of random effects also deserves more research, as it is a recent addition to the fixed-effect HMM in many application fields. We present a Bayesian mixed HMM with an unknown number of hidden states and fixed covariates. The model is fitted using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, avoiding the need to select the number of hidden states. We show through simulations that the estimations produced are more precise than those from a fixed-effect HMM and illustrate its practical application to the analysis of DNA copy number data, a field where HMMs are widely used.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian HMM with random effects and an unknown number of states for DNA copy number analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000313033800006"}
