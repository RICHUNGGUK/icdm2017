We show that this holds for all TxtEx-learnable computable families of c.e. sets, and prove that, in general, the converse is not true. In fact there is a computable family A of c.e. sets such that all computable numberings of A are computably equivalent and A is not TxtEx-learnable. Moreover, we construct a computable family of c.e. sets which is not TxIBC-learnable though all of its computable numberings are 0'-equivalent. We also give a natural example of a computable TxtBC-learnable family of c.e. sets which possesses non-0'-equivalent computable numberings. So, for the computable families of c.e. sets, the properties of TxtBC-learnability and 0'-equivalence of all computable numberings are independent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
