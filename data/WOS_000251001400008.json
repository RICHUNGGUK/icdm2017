But keeping the smoothness between the adjacent patches is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a method for stitching several surface patches, which is a key step in complicated surface modeling, with polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-spline for short). The method is simple and can be easily applied to complex surface modeling. With the method, spline surfaces can be constructed efficiently and adaptively to fit genus-zero meshes after their spherical parameterization is obtained, where only small sized linear systems of equations are involved.", "paper_title": "Surface modeling with polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251001400008"}
