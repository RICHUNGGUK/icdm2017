Many heuristics have been developed for this NP-complete problem including the Cuthill-McKee (CM) and the Gibbs, Poole and Stockmeyer (GPS) algorithms. Recently, heuristics such as Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and GRASP have been used, where Tabu Search and the GRASP with Path Relinking achieved significantly better solution quality than the CM and GPS algorithms. Experimentation shows that our method achieves the best solution quality when compared with these while being much faster than newly-developed algorithms.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for bandwidth minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008500007"}
