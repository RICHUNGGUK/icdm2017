Automated classification of the components is desirable to deal with the large amount of data in a 3-D CT image. Classification by pixel intensity achieves a performance only 25% of the way from baseline to perfect. The poor performance is explained by an overlap in the range of intensities present in the different components. An improved method of semiautomated classification is presented, based on local histograms of the intensity. This achieves a performance 60% of the way from baseline to perfect.
