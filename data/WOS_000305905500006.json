The dynamics of the model and the role of each one of the parameters are explained. The whole set of parameters is explored to check their importance in the numerical simulation results. The model captures the beneficial impact of the adequate treatment on the prevalence of tuberculosis. Nevertheless, depending on the treatment parameters range, it also captures the emergence of drug resistance. Drug resistance emergence is particularly likely to occur for parameter values corresponding to less efficacious treatment, as usually found in developing countries.", "paper_title": "EXPLORATION OF THE PARAMETER SPACE IN AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF TUBERCULOSIS SPREAD: EMERGENCE OF DRUG RESISTANCE IN DEVELOPING VS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305905500006"}
