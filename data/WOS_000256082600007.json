Among those promising technologies, new gate structures as high-k gate dielectric and metal gate, strain channel carrier mobility enhancement technology, and novel non-planar MOSFET structures are all possible candidate technologies. In this paper, we will specify our discussion on the research progress of high-k-metal gate and non-planar MOSFET-technologies that are suitable to 32 nm technology node and beyond.", "paper_title": "Novel devices and process for 32 nm CMOS technology and beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082600007"}
