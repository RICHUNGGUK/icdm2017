On the other hand, the zooms of T corresponding to its non-trivial Archimedean components are t-subnorms that largely determine T. Fixing one out of four basic types of cancellativity (cancellativity, conditional cancellativity, weak cancellativity and weak conditional cancellativity) we figure out which less restrictive type of cancellativity expresses that all maximal Archimedean zooms of T satisfy the given cancellativity property. We lay bare the mutual relationships between all these types of cancellativity and solve an open problem posed by Klement et al. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
