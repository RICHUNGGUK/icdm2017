Its modular structure allows users to configure their tailored learning scenarios, which exploit specific properties of the envisioned applications. As has been shown earlier, exploiting application-specific structural features enables optimizations that may lead to performance gains of several orders of magnitude, a necessary precondition to make automata learning applicable to realistic scenarios. The demonstration of the LearnLib will include the extrapolation of a behavioral model for a realistic (legacy) system, and the statistical analysis of different variants of automata learning algorithms on the basis of random generated models.", "paper_title": "LearnLib: A library for automata learning and experimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236901100028"}
