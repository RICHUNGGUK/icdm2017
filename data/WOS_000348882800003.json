We address this problem in a general setting where the agents communication actions are parametrized by data from an infinite domain and possibly subject to constraints. For this purpose, we define parametrized automata (PAs), where transitions are guarded by conjunction of equalities and disequalities. We solve the service composition problem by showing that the simulation preorder of PAs is decidable and devising a procedure to synthesize a mediator out of a simulation preorder. We also show that the Nonemptiness problem of PAs is PSPACE-complete. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
