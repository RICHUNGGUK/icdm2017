The fuzzy inverse model construction method has the ability of uniquely determining the inverse relationship for each input-output pair. It is derived in a straightforward way and the required input variables can be simultaneously obtained by the fuzzy inferencing calculation to realize the desired output value. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to find the inverse kinematics solutions for complex multiple degree-of-freedom industrial robot manipulators.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Inverse Model Construction Method for General Monotonic Multi-Input-Single-Output (MISO) Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046700009"}
