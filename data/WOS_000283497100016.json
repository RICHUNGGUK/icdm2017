The chaotic circuit, which is used as the core of the random bit generator generates double-scroll attractor the frequency spectrum of which spans up to 80 MHz. The chaotic circuit was fabricated using a 0: 35 mu m CMOS process and the chip area, excluding pads, is 0.06 mm(2). Power consumption of the integrated chip is 8 mW. Binary data obtained from the presented random bit generator pass the full NIST-800-22 test suite.", "paper_title": "AN ADC BASED RANDOM BIT GENERATOR BASED ON A DOUBLE SCROLL CHAOTIC CIRCUIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100016"}
