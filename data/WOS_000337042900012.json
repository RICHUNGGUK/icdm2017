The SVM is based on the value-at-risk (VaR) measure, which discards a specified percentage of data viewed as outliers (extreme samples), and is referred to as -SVM. Computational experiments show that compared to the -SVM, the VaR-SVM has a superior out-of-sample performance on datasets with outliers.", "paper_title": "Value-at-risk support vector machine: stability to outliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900012"}
