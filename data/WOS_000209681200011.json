We investigate a cooperative multicast scheme which allows the users to function as relays. The secure outage behavior of this scheme is studied and the analytical expression of secure outage probability is derived. Numerical results show that the proposed cooperative multicast scheme outperforms the direct multicast without cooperation in terms of secure outage probability.", "paper_title": "Outage Analysis of Cooperative Secrecy Multicast Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200011"}
