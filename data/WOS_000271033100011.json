Attention is focused on the design of gain-scheduled guaranteed cost controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and a parameter-dependent cost performance is also satisfied. By parameter-dependent Lyapunov approach, a sufficient condition is proposed for designing gain-scheduled state feedback controller, in which the controller gain is dependent on the scheduling parameters. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "GAIN-SCHEDULED GUARANTEED COST CONTROL OF LPV SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING STATE AND INPUT DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100011"}
