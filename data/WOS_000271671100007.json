We consider steady Stokes equations in the free region, coupled across a fixed interface to Darcy equations in the porous substrate. Recently, the numerical solution of this system was obtained using the boundary integral formulation combined with a regularization-correction procedure. The correction process also results in the improvement of the condition number of the linear system. In this paper, an appropriate preconditioner based on the singular part of corrections is introduced to improve the convergence of a Krylov subspace method applied to solve the integral formulation.
