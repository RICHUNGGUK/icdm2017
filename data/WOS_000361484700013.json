This paper introduces nonlinear dimensioning factors in the design of CLSC and uses ant colony optimization to optimize the design of the supply chain. The proposed algorithm is called SCAnt-NLDesign. The modelled nonlinear dimensioning factors are: cost variations in transportation distances between facilities (tapering principle), scale economies related to transported quantities, and scale economies regarding the facilities' capacity. Results show that the proposed SCAnt-NLDesign algorithm reduced the total cost in 44%, when compared to a linear formulation of a CLSC. Note also that a mixed integer linear programming implementation of the nonlinear CLSC was not able to get closed to the optimal solution, given worse results than the linear CLSC.", "paper_title": "Designing closed-loop supply chains with nonlinear dimensioning factors using ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000361484700013"}
