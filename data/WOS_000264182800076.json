Surprisingly, there seems to be little argument about managing presentational knowledge assets, which are widely used by knowledge workers to present their ideas, proposals, findings and reports. This paper develops the management model and related IT enabling tools that support users to better exploit and transfer presentational knowledge assets. The solution integrates text extractor, slideshow generator, knowledge repository, content-based retrieval and ontology-enabled search engine along with the goal of portraying the search results in a visual navigation form. The performance satisfaction of the proposed system was proved statistically by conducting the user's survey of effectiveness and usability. This solution has demonstrated to be a feasible way for better managing contents, prompting cognitive learning, improving presentation production and presentational knowledge transformation, and consequently facilitates the value leverage of the presentational knowledge assets.
