Interval type-2 fuzzy controllers can outperform conventional type-1 fuzzy controllers when the problem has a high degree of uncertainty. However, designing interval type-2 fuzzy controllers is more difficult because there are more parameters involved. In this paper, interval type-2 fuzzy systems are approximated with the average of two type-1 fuzzy systems, which has been shown to give good results in control if the type-1 fuzzy systems can be obtained appropriately. An evolutionary algorithm is applied to find the optimal interval type-2 fuzzy system as mentioned above. The human evolutionary model is applied for optimizing the interval type-2 fuzzy controller for a particular non-linear plant and results are compared against an optimal type-1 fuzzy controller. A comparative study of simulation results of the type-2 and type-1 fuzzy controllers, under different noise levels, is also presented. Simulation results show that interval type-2 fuzzy controllers obtained with the evolutionary algorithm outperform type-1 fuzzy controllers.", "paper_title": "Optimization of interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers using evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000290768000011"}
