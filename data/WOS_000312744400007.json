Specifically, we deal with two types of PUs having different capabilities: a dumb (peak interference-power tolerable) PU and a more sophisticated (average interference-power tolerable) PU. For such PU models, we first formulate two optimization problems that maximize the capacity of unlicensed secondary user (SU) while maintaining the quality of service of PU under the assumption that both intra- and inter-system CSI are fully available. However, due to loose cooperation between SU and PU, it may be difficult or even infeasible for SU to obtain the full inter-system CSI. Thus, under the partial inter-system CSI setting, we also formulate another two optimization problems by introducing interference-power outage constraints. We propose optimal and efficient suboptimal power allocation policies for these four problems. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the spectral efficiency achieved by SU with partial inter-system CSI is less than half of what is achieved with full inter-system CSI within a reasonable range of outage probability (e.g., less than 10 %). Further, it is shown that the average interference-power tolerable PU can help to increase the saturated spectral efficiency of SU by about 20 and 50 % in both cases of full and partial inter-system CSI, respectively.", "paper_title": "Power allocation policies with full and partial inter-system channel state information for cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312744400007"}
