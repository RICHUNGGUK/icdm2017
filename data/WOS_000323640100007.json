The most sensitive part of the AES is the non-linear SubBytes operation, in particular, the inversion in GF(2(8)), the Galois field of 2(8) elements. In hardware implementations, it is well known that the use of the tower of extensions leads to a more efficient inversion. We propose to use a random isomorphism instead of a fixed one. Then, we study the effect of this randomization in terms of security and efficiency. Considering the field extension GF(2(8))/GF(2(4)), the inverse operation leads to computation of its norm in GF(2(4)). Hence, in order to thwart side-channel attack, we manage to spread the values of norms over GF(2(4)). Combined with a technique of boolean masking in tower fields, our countermeasure strengthens resistance against first-order differential side-channel attacks.", "paper_title": "AES side-channel countermeasure using random tower field constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000323640100007"}
