This model represents the network planning problem and helps to solve it entirely without dividing it into several subproblems. The objective of the model is to minimize the cost of the network while maximizing its survivability. The model has been compared to a sequential model with the same constraints, which consists in solving the subproblems sequentially, and to a global model without reliability constraints. The results show that the proposed model performs on an average 25% better than the other models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
