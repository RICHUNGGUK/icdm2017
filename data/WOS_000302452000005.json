Emerging applications of DTN include rural DTN, vehicular DTN and pocket DIN. The development of DTN raises a number of security-related challenges due to inconsistent network access and unreliable end-to-end network path. One of the challenges is initial secure context establishment as it is unrealistic to assume that public key infrastructure (PKI) is always globally present and available, hence, the public key management becomes an open problem for DTN. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a dynamic virtual digraph (DVD) model for public key distribution study by extending graph theory and then present a public key distribution scheme for pocket DIN based on two-channel cryptography. By distinguishing between owners and carriers, public key exchange and authentication issues in the decentralized pocket DIN environment can be solved by a two-channel cryptography process and our simulation results have proven it.
