It is an effective and efficient way to experimentally investigate some aspects of a protein structure when NMR and X-ray crystallography data are lacking. Results: We introduce MSX-3D, a tool specifically geared to validate protein models using mass spectrometry. In addition to classical peptides identifications, it allows an interactive 3D visualization of the distance constraints derived from a cross-linking experiment.", "paper_title": "MSX-3D: a tool to validate 3D protein models using mass spectrometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168600021"}
