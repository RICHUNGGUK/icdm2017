The proposed method takes advantage of the available structural information to perform a geometrical matching with the environment information provided by measurements collected by a laser range finder. In contrast to other global self-localization algorithms like Monte Carlo or SLAM, GEMA(2) provides a linear cost with respect the number of measures collected, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested in a mobile robot with limited computational resources showing a fast converge from global self-localization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
