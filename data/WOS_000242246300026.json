Various large-scale experiments and curation efforts have led to preliminary versions of complete cellular networks for a number of organisms. To grapple with these networks, we developed TopNet-like Yale Network Analyzer (tYNA), a Web system for managing, comparing and mining multiple networks, both directed and undirected. tYNA efficiently implements methods that have proven useful in network analysis, including identifying defective cliques, finding small network motifs (such as feed-forward loops), calculating global statistics (such as the clustering coefficient and eccentricity), and identifying hubs and bottlenecks. It also allows one to manage a large number of private and public networks using a flexible tagging system, to filter them based on a variety of criteria, and to visualize them through an interactive graphical interface. A number of commonly used biological datasets have been pre-loaded into tYNA, standardized and grouped into different categories.", "paper_title": "The tYNA platform for comparative interactomics: a web tool for managing, comparing and mining multiple networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242246300026"}
