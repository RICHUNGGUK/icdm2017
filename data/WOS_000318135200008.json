We extend this class to CNF formulas for which this type of Davis-Putnam resolution still applies and show that testing membership in this class is NP-complete. We compare the class of beta-acyclic formulas and this superclass with a number of known polynomial formula classes. We then study the parameterized complexity of SAT for \"almost\" beta-acyclic instances, using as parameter the formula's distance from being beta-acyclic. As distance we use the size of a smallest strong backdoor set and the beta-hypertree width. As a by-product we obtain the W[1]-hardness of SAT parameterized by the (undirected) clique-width of the incidence graph, which disproves a conjecture by Fischer, Makowsky, and Ravve.
