Poor system knowledge and inappropriate selection of security measures may lead to unexpected financial and data losses. This paper proposes a novel Risk Assessment and Optimisation Model (RAOM) to solve a security countermeasure selection problem, where variables such as financial cost and risk may affect a final decision. A Multi-Objective Tabu Search (MOTS) algorithm has been developed to construct an efficient frontier of non-dominated solutions, which can satisfy organisational security needs in a cost-effective manner.
