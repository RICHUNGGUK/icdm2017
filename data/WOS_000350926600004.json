The ability to learn powerful features automatically is increasingly important as the volume of data and range of applications of machine learning methods continues to grow. This paper proposes a new deep architecture that uses support vector machines (SVMs) with class probability output networks (CPONs) to provide better generalization power for pattern classification problems. As a result, deep features are extracted without additional feature engineering steps, using multiple layers of the SVM classifiers with CPONs. The proposed structure closely approaches the ideal Bayes classifier as the number of layers increases. Using a simulation of classification problems, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
