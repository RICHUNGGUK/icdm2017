The test results of the subjects whom an occupational therapist in attendance assessed to be able to drive a car showed values almost the same as the data of the healthy subjects. The effectiveness of the system was suggested in the preliminary experiments and a case study.", "paper_title": "Trial usage of rehabilitation system: Simple driving simulator for the driving skill evaluation of people with cerebrovascular disease: CVD", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000137"}
