In this paper we present a metric vector-based algorithm to detect intrusion while introducing the sample distance for both discrete and continuous data in order to improve the algorithm on heterogeneous dataset. Experiments on MIT lab Data show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "Intrusion detection based on data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300090"}
