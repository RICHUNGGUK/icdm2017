In the paper, a new ROI coding method called Compensation-based Partial Bitplane Alternating Shift (CPBA-Shift) is described. The proposed method divides all bitplanes of ROI and background (BG) coefficients into two portions-Alternating Shift Portion (ASP) and Compensation Shift Portion (CSP). In ASP, partial the most significant bitplanes of ROI and BG coefficients are shifted by bitplane-by-bitplane. In CSP, the least significant bitplanes of ROI and BG coefficients are scaled using compensation scheme according to the compression quality in ROI and BG. Simulation experiments show that the new method, in addition to alleviating the drawbacks of both ROI coding methods in JPEG2000, can support arbitrarily shaped multiple ROI coding with different degrees of interest without coding the shapes information.", "paper_title": "New region of interest medical image coding for JPEG2000: Compensation-based partial bitplane alternating shift", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900048"}
