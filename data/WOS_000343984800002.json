Our method combines input modalities (i.e., hand and foot) and provides a coordinated output to both modalities along with audio and video. Human foot gesture is detected and tracked using contour-based template detection (CTD) and Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) algorithm. 3D foot pose is estimated from passive homography matrix of the camera. 3D stereoscopic and vibrotactile are used to enhance the immersive feeling. We developed a multimodal football game based on the multimodal approach as a proof-of-concept. We confirm our systems user satisfaction through a user study.", "paper_title": "Multimodal Hand and Foot Gesture Interaction for Handheld Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343984800002"}
