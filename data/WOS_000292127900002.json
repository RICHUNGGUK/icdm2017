It is remarkable that ICT's carbon imprint is of the order of 2% of the world total, comparable to the carbon imprint of air travel. Thus, it is imperative to address energy savings in ICT and, in particular, in data centres and networks. This paper follows up on our previous work that seeks novel ways to reduce the energy consumption in packet networks which constitute the backbone of the Internet and of the information society as a whole. Here we discuss the use of routing control as a means to reduce energy consumption while remaining aware of QoS considerations, and propose a method that uses a queueing theoretic analysis and optimization technique to distribute traffic so as to reduce a cost function that comprises both energy and QoS. A method using G-networks is developed to incorporate both the effect of user traffic and the overhead in QoS and energy consumption introduced by the control traffic that will be needed to carry out the re-routing decisions. For an N-node network, we show that this approach results in an algorithm which has O(N-3) time complexity. Because this approach may be too costly in computational overhead and delays, we also propose another approach that uses load balancing and which would be much simpler to implement.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Energy-Aware Routing in Packet Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292127900002"}
