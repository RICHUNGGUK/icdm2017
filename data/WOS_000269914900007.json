The liveness check is performed by measuring the degree of synchrony between the lips and the voice extracted from a video sequence. Three new methods for asynchrony detection based on co-inertia analysis (CoIA) and a fourth based on coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs) are derived. Experimental comparisons are made with several methods previously used in the literature for asynchrony detection and speaker location. The reported results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed new methods based on both CoIA and CHMMs as asynchrony detection methods.", "paper_title": "Audio-visual speech asynchrony detection using co-inertia analysis and coupled hidden markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000269914900007"}
