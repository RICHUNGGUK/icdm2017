This class of regression models includes all symmetric continuous distributions, and has a wide range of practical applications in various fields such as engineering, biology, medicine and economics, among others. The variety of distributions with different kurtosis coefficients than the normal may give more flexibility in the choice of an appropriate distribution, particularly to accommodate outlying and influential observations. We derive a joint iterative process for estimating the mean and dispersion parameters. We also present simulation studies for the biases of the MLEs.", "paper_title": "Corrected maximum likelihood estimators in heteroscedastic symmetric nonlinear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000276634700008"}
