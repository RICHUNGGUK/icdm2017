However, we propose a class of RC codes with short code lengths in this paper. Particularly, we develop a computational approach to design online-generated RC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes available on noisy channels. We first propose a diagonal-tailed encoding to generate Quasi-regular low-density generator matrix codes. Then, an optimal encoding profile for RC codes is achieved with a linear interpolation approach that is based on the fixed-rate quasi-regular LDPC codes. Finally, we evaluate the rateless and fixed-rate performances of the proposed RC codes by extensive simulation results on various code rates with different modulations.
