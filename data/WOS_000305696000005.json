We examine the unique attributes of OHS use, such as flexibility, productivity, and work overload, along with the impact of these attributes on work-to-life conflict and other work-related outcomes. The findings of this study show that an increased work overload due to OHS use results in greater work-to-life conflict, which creates job stress and user resistance to OHS; however, productivity gained due to OHS use can reduce work overload. Our findings indicate that business organizations can minimize negative effects of OHS by promoting an organizational culture that supports segmentation of work and attempts to minimize work-to-life conflict and its consequences. Results also provide guidance to scholars seeking a comprehensive research model on the use of smartphones traversing work and home.", "paper_title": "A New Open Door: The Smartphone's Impact on Work-to-Life Conflict, Stress, and Resistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000305696000005"}
