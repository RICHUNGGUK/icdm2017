These mechanisms can be classified as periodic and aperiodic, where aperiodic mechanisms can be further divided into event- and self-triggered schemes. We focus on aperiodic triggering schemes and cover most of the work done with an emphasis on the theoretical results. A glance at the existing work shows a need to organize the scattered theoretical results on the subject, which will provide a basis for interested researchers and also facilitate to visualize open problems.
