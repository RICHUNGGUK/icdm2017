Although e-learning applications are popular, there is minimal research on instructors' attitudes toward these teaching materials. The purpose of this research is to explore instructors' behavioral intentions toward the Multimedia Teaching Materials usage. Accordingly, a questionnaire based on an integrated theoretical framework has been delivered to 100 instructors from different FIFA federations. Three main streams of research provide the basis for this framework: the Technology Acceptance Model, the Motivational Model and the Social Cognitive Model, combined with other variables used in educational technology acceptance research. Perceived usefulness, followed by perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use and the multimedia instruction quality explain most of the instructors' behavioral intention to use the Multimedia Teaching Materials.
