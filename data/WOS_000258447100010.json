It further extends the study by implementing the system architecture with the proposed data model to support the dynamic tracing task. Design/methodology/approach - Typical processes of supply chain in manufacturing industries using bill of material data to extract and define information requirements are followed. The data elements are systematically selected and explained in the proposed model step by step. Findings - This paper found that existing Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) data management scheme has to be modified so as to provide end-to-end traceability. Research limitations/implications - Validation of the proposed model and system architecture should be done through actual implementation in industrial settings. Practical implications - The paper gives an insight to many system managers and executors in how full traceability along the supply chain can actually be realized. Originality/value - Several studies have discussed the traceability issues but failed to construct a system and methodologies to obtain the full traceability range. However, this paper contributes by presenting the specific methodological steps which can provide powerful solutions to build a system for traceability, exploiting RFID technology.", "paper_title": "RFID-based traceability in the supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000258447100010"}
