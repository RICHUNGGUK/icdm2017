The study is carried out by exploiting two different approaches. In the first approach a population balance equation (PBE) model is devised, where crystal nucleation and growth phenomena are developed taking into account rigorous first principle assumptions. The second approach is based on a phenomenological stochastic formulation leading to a global Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) governed by a limited number of parameters, describing the time evolution of the probability density function representing the crystal PSD. Validations against experimental data are presented for the NaCl-water-ethanol ternary system. The pros and cons of both approaches are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
