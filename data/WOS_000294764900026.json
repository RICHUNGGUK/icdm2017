In this paper, we focus on probabilistic versions of two problems frequently encountered in discrete event systems, namely, the reachability and forbidden-state problems. Our main concern is to see whether there exists a (or for every) non-blocking or fair control policy under which a given finite-or infinite-state system can be guided to reach (or avoid) a set of goal states with probability one. For finite-state systems, we devise algorithmic approaches which result in polynomial time solutions to the two problems. For infinite-state systems modelled as Petri nets, the problems are undecidable in general. For the class of persistent Petri nets, we establish a valuation approach through which the convergence behavior of a system is characterized, which in turn yields solutions to the reachability and forbidden-state problems.", "paper_title": "On Almost-Sure Properties of Probabilistic Discrete Event Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900026"}
