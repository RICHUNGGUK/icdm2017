Let DN be the number of different digital discs consisting of N points ( different up to translation). The upper bound D-N = O(N-2) was shown recently; no corresponding lower bound is known. In this paper, we refine the upper bound to D-N = O(N), which seems to be the true order of magnitude, and we show that the average (D) over bar (N) = (D-1 + D-2 + ... + D-N)/N has upper and lower bounds which are of polynomial growth in N.", "paper_title": "The number of N-point digital discs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241988300012"}
