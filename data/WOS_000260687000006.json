Previous solutions have been limited to the case where all input points are adjacent in discrete space (they form one non-convex polygon). In this paper, we propose a cellular automaton capable of solving the two-dimensional 45-convex hull problem exactly for a set of arbitrary input points. The proposed automaton finds the desired convex hull in O(root n) running time (where n is the number of cells in the automaton), which is optimal. It uses three states and one transition rule change during execution.", "paper_title": "An Exact and Optimal Local Solution to the Two-Dimensional Convex Hull of Arbitrary Points Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000260687000006"}
