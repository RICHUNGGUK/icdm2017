In the framework of conventional relations of the least squares method, it is necessary to process matrices with large dimensions which have no pronounced banded or diagonal structure. A recurrent procedure equivalent to the least squares method in the considered problem is proposed; this procedure deals with matrices of small dimensions. The quantities characterizing the quality of the obtained estimate (precision dilution factors) are determined.", "paper_title": "Recurrent form of the least squares method in the problem of processing phase satellite navigation measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000277372600015"}
