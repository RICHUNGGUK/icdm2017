The result of this classification is a table of 22 codes with these properties. Many have relatively large minimum distance in comparison to their length and number of code words. We construct an additional five neighbour-transitive codes with minimum distance two admitting such a group. All 27 codes are -designs with at least two.", "paper_title": "Sporadic neighbour-transitive codes in Johnson graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000335983500010"}
