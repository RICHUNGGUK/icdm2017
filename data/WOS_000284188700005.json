A conventional cooperative relaying scheme has a source, a destination, and a single relay. This cooperative scheme can support one symbol transmission per time slot, and is called full rate transmission. However, existing full rate cooperative relay approaches provide asymmetrical gain for different transmitted symbols. In this paper, we propose a cooperative relaying scheme that is assisted with dual relays and provides full transmission rate with the same macro-diversity to each symbol. We also address equalization for the dual relay transmission system in addition to addressing the issues concerning the improvement of system performance in terms of optimal power allocations.", "paper_title": "A Full Rate Dual Relay Cooperative Approach for Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000284188700005"}
