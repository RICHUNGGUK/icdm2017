The theoretical developments for such a model are presented, considering an isotropic damage model for the continuum and a Coulomb-type criterion for the localized part. Design/methodology/approach- This is achieved by activating subsequently diffuse and localized damage mechanisms. Localized phenomena are taken into account by meanns of the introduction of a displacement discontinuity at the element level. Finding - It was found that, with such an approach, the final crack direction is predicted quite well, in fact much better than the prediction made by the fracture mechanics type of models considering combination of only elastic response and softening. Originality/value The presented model has the potential to describe complex damage phenomena in a cyclic and/or non-proportional loading program, such as crack closing and re-opning, cohesive resistance deterioration due to tangential sliding by using only a few parameters compared to the traditonal models for cyclic loading.", "paper_title": "Novel anisotropic continuum-discrete damage model capable of representing localized failure of massive structures: Part I: theoretical formulation and numerical implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264968100006"}
