The handshake-component-based design is suitable for large-scale, complex asynchronous circuit because of its understandability. This paper proposes an area-efficient architecture of an FPGA that is suitable for handshake-component-based asynchronous circuit. Moreover, the Four-Phase Dual-Rail encoding is employed to construct circuits robust to delay variation because the data paths are programmable in FPGA. The FPGA based on the proposed architecture is implemented in a 65 nm process. Its evaluation results show that the proposed FPGA can implement handshake components efficiently.", "paper_title": "Architecture of an Asynchronous FPGA for Handshake-Component-Based Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700007"}
