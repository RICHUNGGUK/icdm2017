In this paper we introduce the model of pushdown compressor, based on pushdown transducers that compute a single injective function while keeping the widest generality regarding stack computation. We also consider online compression algorithms that use at most polylogarithmic space (plogon). These algorithms correspond to compressors in the data stream model. We compare the performance of these two families of compressors with each other and with the general purpose Lempel-Ziv algorithm. This comparison is made without any a priori assumption on the data's source and considering the asymptotic compression ratio for infinite sequences. We prove that in all cases they are incomparable.", "paper_title": "Polylog Space Compression, Pushdown Compression, and Lempel-Ziv Are Incomparable", "paper_id": "WOS:000290436700001"}
