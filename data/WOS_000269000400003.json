This paper presents a computerized method for analyzing the tolerances in disk cam mechanisms with a roller follower. By employing the concept of simulated higher-pair contact analysis, the kinematic deviation of the follower motion arising from the tolerance amount of each design parameter can be determined numerically. The offset translating roller follower and the oscillating roller follower cases are given to illustrate the proposed method. The tolerance analysis results show that, owing to the combined effects of various design parameters, the position accuracy of the follower motion may degrade considerably. But, the tolerance amounts of the design parameters may also have a compensating effect to enhance the relative accuracy of the follower motion between its high and low dwell positions. Hence, it is possible to find the optimal tolerance combination for balancing the kinematic accuracy and the tolerance amounts of disk cam mechanisms with a roller follower.", "paper_title": "Computerized tolerance analysis of disk cam mechanisms with a roller follower", "paper_id": "WOS:000269000400003"}
