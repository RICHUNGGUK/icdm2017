Contrary to current approaches, the multivariate structure will be described through a local measure of association, the partial correlation, in order to improve the diagnosis features without compromising detection speed. It will also be used to infer the relevant causal structure active at each scale, providing a fine map for the complex behavior of the system. The scale-dependent causal networks will be incorporated in multiscale monitoring through data-driven sensitivity enhancing transformations (SETs). The results obtained demonstrate that the use of SET is a major factor in detecting process upsets. In fact, it was observed that even single-scale monitoring methodologies can achieve comparable detection capabilities as their multiscale counterparts as long as a proper SET is employed. However, the multiscale approach still proved to be useful because it led to good results using a much simpler SET model of the system. Therefore, the application of wavelet transforms is advantageous for systems that are difficult to model, providing a good compromise between modeling complexity and monitoring performance.
