Several methods (filtering, tracking, segmentation) dedicated to the analysis of 3D + t datasets of zebrafish embryogenesis are introduced and validated through a synthetic dataset. Then, we illustrate the application of these methods to the analysis of datasets of zebrafish early development acquired with various microscopy techniques. This processing paradigm produces spatio-temporal coherent results as it benefits from the intrinsic redundancy of the temporal dimension, and minimizes the needs for human intervention in semi-automatic algorithms.", "paper_title": "3D+t Morphological Processing: Applications to Embryogenesis Image Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100015"}
