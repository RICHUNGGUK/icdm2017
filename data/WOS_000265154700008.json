Chaotic sequences were adopted to improve the security of the proposed watermarking scheme. Simulations under various conditions were given to verify the effectiveness of the audio watermarking scheme. The results show the proposed scheme is secure, and the watermark is imperceptible and robust against various audio signal processing attacks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
