The approach models and formulates the ICS problem as a combinational optimization problem with multiple constraints and objectives. An integrated evolutionary framework is proposed for simultaneously considering crew pairing and crew rostering subproblems. To improve the efficiency of the Pareto set explorer, the solution methodology applies a novel variant of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), one of the most popular multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms. The proposed variant features problem-dependent constraint handling and a bounded front policy to reserve diverse individuals. The proposed approach is verified and validated in a case study of a real-world short-haul airline crew scheduling problem. The experimental results obtained by the proposed integrated approach are then compared with a real-world airline plan generated by the conventional sequential method. An aircraft schedule recovery problem is also studied to compare solution performance between the conventional NSGA-II method and the proposed NSGA-II variant. The comparison results confirm that the proposed variant obtains solutions that are superior in two aspects: First, the proposed NSGA-II variant obtains better convergence in the studied problems compared with the original version; second, the results explored by the variant enable decision makers to select from multiple crew schedules, which are superior to the real-world airline crew plan while considering the same objectives and constraints.", "paper_title": "Integrated Short-Haul Airline Crew Scheduling Using Multiobjective Optimization Genetic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000323498000006"}
