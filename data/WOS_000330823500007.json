In this work, we investigate a counter-intuitive phenomenon: with respect to alphabets of size 2 and 3, pattern languages can be regular or context-free in an unexpected way. For this regularity and context-freeness of pattern languages, we give several sufficient and necessary conditions and improve known results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
