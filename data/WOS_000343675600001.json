It will be shown that there exist cost matrices whose use in combination with a suitable classifier allows for improving the results of some popular data-level techniques. The well known FURIA algorithm is extended to take advantage of this definition. A numerical study is carried out to compare the proposed cost-sensitive FURIA to other state-of-the-art classification algorithms, based on fuzzy rules and on other classical machine learning methods, on 64 different imbalanced datasets.", "paper_title": "Cost-Sensitive Learning of Fuzzy Rules for Imbalanced Classification Problems Using FURIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000343675600001"}
