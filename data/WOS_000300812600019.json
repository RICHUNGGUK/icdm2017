These conflicting objectives typically give rise to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. To enhance real-time decision making efficient approaches are required for determining the Pareto set in a fast and accurate way. Hereto, the current paper illustrates the use of the freely available toolkit ACADO Multi-Objective (www.acadotoolkit.org) on several chemical examples. The rationale behind ACADO Multi-Objective is the integration of direct optimal control methods with scalarisation-based multi-objective methods enabling the exploitation of fast deterministic gradient-based optimisation routines.
