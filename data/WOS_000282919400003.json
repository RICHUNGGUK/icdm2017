The proposed bi-criteria four-factor fluctuation smoothing rule has some innovative characteristics. First, the remaining cycle time of a job is accurately estimated by applying the fuzzy c-means and fuzzy back propagation network (FCM-FBPN) approach. Second, two tailored nonlinear forms of the fluctuation smoothing rules are obtained to enhance the balancing and responsiveness. Third, the two tailored nonlinear fluctuation smoothing rules are merged into a bi-criteria rule to consider two performance measures (average cycle time and cycle time variation) at the same time. Finally, the content of the bi-criteria rule can be tailored for a wafer fabrication factory with four adjustable factors. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, production simulation was applied. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology is a Pareto optimal solution by reducing the average cycle time and cycle time standard deviation at the same time.", "paper_title": "A BI-CRITERIA FOUR-FACTOR FLUCTUATION SMOOTHING RULE FOR SCHEDULING JOBS IN A WAFER FABRICATION FACTORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400003"}
