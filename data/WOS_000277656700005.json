The non-dimensional mathematical model used in this paper presents a conceptual substitution of the real system of the mega container crane boom and provides understanding and prediction of its dynamic behaviour under the action of a moving trolley. The paper discusses the procedure for setting up the nondimensional mathematical model of the crane boom as a necessary condition for an estimation of structural and trolley drive parameters, such as the effects of stiffness, mass, spatial position of structural segments as well as trolley velocity and acceleration, on the dynamic values of deflection under the moving mass. The results obtained by the simulation of the trolley motion alongside the QCC boom during container transfer from quay-to-ship are implemented in the parameter sensitivity analysis in order to obtain mutual influences of the dynamic parameters.", "paper_title": "Parameter sensitivity analysis of non-dimensional models of quayside container cranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000277656700005"}
