A syntactic algorithm of a two-dimensional object vectorization and recognition is proposed. An algorithm of two-dimensional map recognition has been introduced as well. The algorithms have been tested by using both artificial data and real data - the satellite image. They have turned out to be effective. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
