Geographical information systems (GIS) are good examples of such large-scale applications as they frequently handle huge amounts of spatial data. In this paper we develop efficient external-memory algorithms for a number of important problems involving line segments in the plane, including trapezoid decomposition, hatched planar point location, triangulation, red-blue line segment intersection reporting, and general line segment intersection reporting. In GIS systems the first three problems are useful for rendering and modeling, and the latter two are frequently used for overlaying Maps and extracting information from them.", "paper_title": "External-memory algorithms for processing line segments in geographic information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243363900001"}
