This property is applied to construct resilient RSBFs of order 1 (1-resilient for simplicity) on pq variables, where p and q are both prime consistently in this letter. The results show that construction and counting of I-resilient RSBFs on pq variables are equivalent to solving an equation system and counting the solutions. At last, the counting of all I-resilient RSBFs on pq variables is also proposed.", "paper_title": "Construction and Counting of 1-Resilient Rotation Symmetric Boolean Functions on pq Variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700020"}
