We formulate this problem as a split feasibility problem, propose an algorithmic framework based on Bregman projections, and prove a general convergence result for this framework. Convergence of the linearized Bregman method will be obtained as a special case. Our approach also allows for several generalizations such as other objective functions, incremental iterations, incorporation of non-Gaussian noise models, and box constraints.", "paper_title": "The Linearized Bregman Method via Split Feasibility Problems: Analysis and Generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000338782900022"}
