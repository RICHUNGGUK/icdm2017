The T-S fuzzy model consists of N time-delay T-S fuzzy subsystems, and a decentralized H-infinity filter is designed for each subsystem. Based on the delay-dependent piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (DDPLKF) and with an improved free-weighting matrix technique, the delay-dependent stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance index are guaranteed for the overall filtering error system. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a filter is established by using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are numerically feasible. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Decentralized H-infinity Filtering for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Interconnected Systems With Time-Varying Delay Based on the T-S Fuzzy Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000304905500003"}
