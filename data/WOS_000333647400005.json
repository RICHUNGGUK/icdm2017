Motivated by the infeasible assumptions of perfect synchronization and prior noise knowledge in most of the existing spectrum sensing algorithms, a robust orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal sensing scheme, with the use of a noise power insensitive threshold, is investigated in this paper. Identification of primary OFDM signals is achieved by sliding the local pilot reference over the received signals and measuring the frequency domain correlations. The necessity of prior noise power knowledge for the sensing threshold determination is removed by employing the proposed interference insensitive test metric, which is a ratio of uniformly distorted correlations. As a result, no noise power information is required in the sensing process. In addition, the effects of both timing and frequency offsets are mitigated with a novel extended time domain segmentation as well as multiple frequency domain correlations via a frequency sliding window. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and estimate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
