Until now, many researchers have proposed 2D non-separable CMFBs. Nevertheless, efficient direction-selective CMFBs have not been yet. Thanks to our new modulations with diagonal shifts, proposed CMFBs have several frequency supports including direction-selective ones which cannot be realized by conventional ones. In a simulation, we show design examples of proposed CMFBs and their various directional frequency supports.", "paper_title": "Two Dimensional M-Channel Non-separable Filter Banks Based on Cosine Modulated Filter Banks with Diagonal Shifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236400001"}
