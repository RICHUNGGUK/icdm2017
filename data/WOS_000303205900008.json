This paper builds upon the observation that power consumption and performance metrics of spatially close design configurations (or points) are statistically correlated. We propose to exploit the correlation by using a response surface model (RSM), i.e., a closed-form expression suitable for predicting the quality of nonsimulated design points. This model is useful during the design space exploration (DSE) phase to quickly converge to the Pareto set of the multiobjective problem without executing lengthy simulations. To this end, we introduce a multiobjective optimization heuristic which iteratively updates and queries the RSM to identify the design points with the highest expected improvement. The RSM allows to consolidate the Pareto set by reducing the number of simulations required, thus speeding up the exploration process. We compare the proposed heuristic with state-of-the-art approaches [conventional, RSM-based, and structured design of experiments (DoEs)]. Experimental results show that OSCAR is a faster heuristic with respect to state-of-the-art techniques such as response-surface Pareto iterative refinement ReSPIR and nondominated-sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II. In fact, OSCAR used a lower number of simulations to produce a similar solution, i.e., an average of 150 simulations instead of 320 simulations (NSGA-II) and 178 simulations (ReSPIR). When the number of design points is fixed to an average of 300, OSCAR achieves less than 0.6% in terms of average distance with respect to the reference solution while NSGA-II achieves 3.4%. Reported results also show that OSCAR can significantly improve structured DoE approaches by slightly increasing the number of experiments.", "paper_title": "OSCAR: An Optimization Methodology Exploiting Spatial Correlation in Multicore Design Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000303205900008"}
