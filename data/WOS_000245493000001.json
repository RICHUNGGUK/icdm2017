A subsidiary maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm is subsequently developed to dynamically select the most suitable MGGD parameters to be used in the component maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders at each decoding iteration to derive the more reliable metrics performance enhancement. Simulation results show that, for a wide range of block lengths, the proposed approach can enhance the overall turbo decoding performance for both parallel and serially concatenated codes in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rician, and Rayleigh fading channels.", "paper_title": "Subsidiary maximum likelihood iterative decoding based on extrinsic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000245493000001"}
