In online social media-sharing communities, the success of social interactions for content sharing and dissemination among completely unknown users depends on 'trust'. Therefore, providing a satisfactory trust model to evaluate the quality of content and to recommend personalized trustworthy content providers is vital for a successful online social media-sharing community. Current research on trust prediction strongly relies on a web of trust, which is directly collected from users. However, the web of trust is not always available in online communities and, even when it is available, it is often too sparse to accurately predict the trust value between two unacquainted people. Moreover, most of the extant trust research studies have not paid attention to the importance of distrust, even though distrust is a distinct concept from trust with different impacts on behavior. In this paper, we adopt the concepts of 'trust', 'distrust', and 'lack of confidence' in social relationships and propose a novel unifying framework to predict trust and distrust as well as to distinguish the confidently-made decisions (trust or distrust) from lack of confidence without a web of trust. This approach uses interaction histories among users including rating data that is available and much denser than explicit trust/distrust statements (i.e. a web of trust). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
