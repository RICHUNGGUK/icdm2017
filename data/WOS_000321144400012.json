By providing a good platform to enable more effective sharing of personal expertise and ACL treatments, our social health support system can allow: 1) ACL patients to identify the best matching social groups and locate the most suitable expertise for personal health management; and 2) clinicians to easily locate the best matching ACL patients and learn from well-done treatments, so that they can make better decisions for new ACL patients (who have similar ACL injuries and close social principles with those best matching ACL patients) and prescribe safer and more effective knee rehabilitation treatments.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Social Supports for Improving Personal Expertise on ACL Reconstruction and Rehabilitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321144400012"}
