This paper proposes a configuration scheme for connectivity-aware P2P networks which can reduce network traffic of cloud-based streaming servers through sharing of streaming video by utilizing information on connectivity status of mobile devices, and which can improve the quality of mobile cloud-based video streaming services by considering mobility of mobile devices and QoS which have not been considered in existing P2P schemes. Our proposed scheme reduces the amount of server traffic and the disconnection times of mobile devices significantly, compared to the non-P2P scheme and the AODV scheme. It also increases considerably the number of mobile devices to which a cloud-based streaming server can provide video streaming services simultaneously, compared to the two schemes.", "paper_title": "A configuration scheme for connectivity-aware mobile P2P networks for efficient mobile cloud-based video streaming services", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400010"}
