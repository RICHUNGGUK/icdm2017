The main challenge is to obtain pertinent global timing constraints from the timings in the components alone. To this end, we make use of auxiliary clocks to automatically generate new invariants which capture the constraints induced by the synchronisations between components. The method has been implemented in the RTD-Finder tool and successfully experimented on several benchmarks.", "paper_title": "COMPOSITIONAL VERIFICATION FOR TIMED SYSTEMS BASED ON AUTOMATIC INVARIANT GENERATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600015"}
