The image frames consist of blurred, decimated, and noisy versions of a HR image. The HR image is modeled as a Markov random field (MRF), and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation technique is used for the restoration. We show that with the periodic boundary condition, a HR image can be restored efficiently by using fast Fourier transforms. We also apply the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to restore HR images in the aperiodic boundary condition. Computer simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm for superresolution in medium field imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000246565700008"}
