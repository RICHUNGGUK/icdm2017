In order to provide secure and reliable online transactions, an effective electronic payment protocol is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel electronic payment protocol for digital product transactions with an offline arbiter to achieve fair exchange, automated dispute resolution, customer anonymity, and customer unlinkability. In our protocol a product token is adopted to eliminate the need of key management for digital product decryption in the offline arbiter. In addition, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based self-certified public key is utilized to further reduce computing overheads. According to our analysis, the efficiency of our protocol can be greatly increased in comparison with previous literatures.", "paper_title": "A Fair-Exchange E-Payment Protocol For Digital Products With Customer Unlinkability", "paper_id": "WOS:000313526300012"}
