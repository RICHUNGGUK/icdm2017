Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the analysis of 30 international eMarketplaces through case study methodology. Findings - Nine different business models are identified, which can be classified in terms of a service-provisioning model and supported processes between companies. For each business model, different CSFs are highlighted. Research limitations/implications - The study has been conducted on a sample of 30 significant international eMarketplaces. Future studies could apply the framework to other cases in specific industries. Originality/value - The paper offers an overview of the eMarketplace business models linking them with the most relevant CSFs. On one hand, the identified CSFs must be considered by managers and entrepreneurs launching new eMarketplaces or managing existing ones, in order to define the strategy, the business model, and the value proposition for the company users. On the other hand, managers facing the problem of adopting internet technology to support a B2b relationship with business partners must learn to distinguish between the different B2b business models, in order to understand their impact on processes and more precisely evaluate the potential value offered by a B2b electronic intermediary.", "paper_title": "B2b eMarketplaces A classification framework to analyse business models and critical success factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000285567500001"}
