Although those systems can observe scenes of individual cameras separately, it is difficult to figure out what happened to the target moving across multiple cameras. This paper first proposes Video Diary Service (VDS) to solve this problem. VDS is an automatic video-oriented diary service, which keeps track of users' lives. In addition, VDS can identify social networking relationships among the users, as well as record videos of the users. By exploiting these properties of VDS, we extend VDS into a new surveillance system called S-VDS. S-VDS is a target-centric surveillance system which focuses on the target, not the area, with its comprehensive information including the location, time, social relationship, and preferences. We then develop the basic functions of the proposed system and demonstrate its feasibility. We also illustrate three applications (i.e., a remote healthcare system, an anti-crime system, and a system for finding missing children), where the proposed system can enhance security and safety by considering individual surveillance purposes.", "paper_title": "A target-centric surveillance system based on localization and social networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418700012"}
