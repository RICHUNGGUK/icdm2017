A bootstrapped switch with an additional control circuit is proposed to compensate charge loss in conventional bootstrapped switch circuit. Simulation results using 0.18-mu m CMOS process parameters show that the proposed circuit reduces the bootstrap capacitance down to 25% for the conventional circuit.", "paper_title": "Reduction of bootstrapped switch area consumption using pre-charge phase", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200006"}
