This study constructed and verified a research model, based on interaction theory and the cultural lens model, that focuses on the relationship between users' cultural profiles and post-adoption beliefs in the context of the mobile Internet. The results of large-scale on-line surveys in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan indicate that four cultural factors-uncertainty avoidance, individualism, contextuality, and time perception-have a significant influence on users' post-adoption perceptions of mobile Internet services.", "paper_title": "Culture-technology fit: Effects of cultural characteristics on the post-adoption beliefs of mobile Internet users", "paper_id": "WOS:000248268700002"}
