For example, the union of two relativelyMartin-Lof random sets is not Martin-Lof random but is random with respect to the Bernoulli measure lambda(3/4) under which any number belongs to the set with probability 3/4. Conversely, any lambda(3/4) random set is the union of two Martin-Lof random sets. Unions and intersections of random closed sets are also studied.", "paper_title": "Effective Randomness of Unions and Intersections", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087100004"}
