A key goal of surveillance is to detect behaviors that can be considered anomalous. As a result, an extensive body of research in automated surveillance has been developed, often with the goal of automatic detection of anomalies. Research into anomaly detection in automated surveillance covers a wide range of domains, employing a vast array of techniques. This review presents an overview of recent research approaches on the topic of anomaly detection in automated surveillance. The reviewed studies are analyzed across five aspects: surveillance target, anomaly definitions and assumptions, types of sensors used and the feature extraction processes, learning methods, and modeling algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Review of Anomaly Detection in Automated Surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000312885400011"}
