As scaling progresses, several new challenges follow. Among them, the most noticeable two are process variations and leakage current of the circuit. To tackle the problems of process variations and leakage current, an effective way is to use a body-biasing technique. In substance, using the RBB technique can minimize leakage current but increase the delay of a gate. Contrary to RBB, the FBB technique decreases the delay but increases leakage current of a gate. In the previous work, a single body-biasing is applied to the whole circuit. In a slow circuit, since the FBB is applied to the whole circuit, the leakage current of all gates in the circuit increases dramatically. On the other hand, in a fast circuit, RBB is applied to decrease the leakage current. However, without violating the timing specification, the value of body-biasing is restricted by the critical paths, and the saving of leakage current is limited. In this article, we propose a design flow to partition the circuit into subcircuits so that each subcircuit can be applied its individual RBB or FBB. Experiments show that our method is able to save leakage current from 42% to 47% as compared to designs not using a body-biasing technique. Under process variations, our method can save 42% to 49% leakage on fast circuits and 20% to 35% on slow circuits.", "paper_title": "Leakage Reduction, Delay Compensation Using Partition-Based Tunable Body-Biasing Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000269276100006"}
