In this paper, a novel soft subspace clustering with a multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEASSC) is proposed to this problem. This clustering method considers two types of criteria as multiple objectives and optimizes them simultaneously by using a modified multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with new encoding and operators. An indicator called projection similarity validity index (PSVIndex) is designed to select the best solution and cluster number. Experiments on many datasets demonstrate the usefulness of MOEASSC and PSVIndex, and show that our algorithm is insensitive to its parameters and is scalable to large datasets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
