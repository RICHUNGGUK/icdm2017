By using the Lyapunov technique and Razumikhin method, we characterize theoretically the aggregated effects of impulse and stability properties of impulse-free version and then analyze the stabilizing mechanism and destabilizing mechanism of impulses, respectively. The present approaches allow us to estimate the feasible upper bounds of impulse strengths and can also extend to the more general impulsive nonlinear systems with delays. To demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results, several numerical examples are given. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
