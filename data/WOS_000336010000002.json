The numerical model considered the couplings of the stress distribution, with two-phase fluid flows, and the mesh element damage. The hardening of grout in soil is described by a time-dependent Young's modulus and viscosity. Crack initiation, branching, propagation, and grout vein growth in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils can be numerically reproduced. Although the method is developed particularly for simulating fracture grouting, the processes of compaction grouting and permeation grouting can also be numerically simulated. Some grouting cases have been simulated with results similar to the experimental results. This further confirms the adequacy and the power of the numerical approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
