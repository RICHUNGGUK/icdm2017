The task-scheduling problem is NP-Complete in general, which led us to the development of a heuristic for the associated optimization problem. In this work we present a dynamic adaptive approach to schedule dependent tasks onto a grid based on the Xavantes grid middleware. The developed dynamic approach is applied to the Path Clustering Heuristic, and introduces the concept of rounds, which take turns sending tasks to execution and evaluating the performance of the resources. The adaptive extension changes the size of rounds during the process execution, taking task attributes and resources performance as parameters, and it can be adopted in other task schedulers. The experiments show that the dynamic round-based and adaptive schedule can minimize the effects of performance losses while executing processes on the grid.
