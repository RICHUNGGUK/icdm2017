Firstly, a method for estimating the temperature of burden surface based on heterogeneous single information is proposed. Then an approach of multi-source information fusion based on reliability theory and Kalman Filter is presented. Lastly, the system implementation and industrial application is introduced. The result from a 2200 m(3) BF indicates that this system can directly and accurately reflect the real-time state of burden surface temperature distribution. This paper provides an effective solution to control and monitor the process of complicated metallurgy.", "paper_title": "A TEMPERATURE FIELD DETECTION SYSTEM FOR BLAST FURNACE BASED ON MULTI-SOURCE INFORMATION FUSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000329179800013"}
