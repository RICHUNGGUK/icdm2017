Its original computing model is the catalytic P system. Although it was proven already in 2005 that catalytic P systems with two catalysts are computationally universal [2], no simple example of such a P system generating a non-semilinear set was known. The present paper fills this gap and provides such an example with 54 rules. It is expected, however, that this number of rules can be reduced and the minimal number of rules to generate a non-semilinear set in a catalytic P system with two catalysts remains open.", "paper_title": "A Catalytic P System with Two Catalysts Generating a Non-Semilinear Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000328194800001"}
