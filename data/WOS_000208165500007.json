To elucidate the environmental dependency of genes, we analyzed the effects of gene deletions by Phenotype MicroArray (TM) (PM), a system for quantitative screening of thousands of phenotypes in a high-throughput manner. Here, we proposed a new statistical approach to minimize error inherent in measurements of low respiration rates and find which mutants showed significant phenotypic changes in comparison to the wild-type. We show analyzing results from comprehensive PM assays of 298 single-gene knockout mutants in the Keio collection and two additional mutants under 1,920 different conditions. We focused on isozymes of these genes as simple duplications and analyzed correlations between phenotype changes and protein expression levels. Our results revealed divergence of the environmental dependency of the gene among the knockout genes and have also given some insights into possibilities of alternative pathways and availabilities of information on protein synthesis patterns to classify or predict functions of target genes from systematic phenotype screening.", "paper_title": "ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCY OF GENE KNOCKOUTS ON PHENOTYPE MICROARRAY ANALYSIS IN ESCHERICHIA COLI", "paper_id": "WOS:000208165500007"}
