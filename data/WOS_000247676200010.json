A feature adjustment method is proposed to solve the conflicts, an enhanced naming mechanism for the collaborative feature modeling to preserve the design intentions, and a process for the non-locked multi-client collaborative design. The algorithms have been implemented in a prototype system integrating C++, Java3D and VRML, and CORBA technologies. Flexibility and efficiency in collaborative feature modeling environment have been achieved in our system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
