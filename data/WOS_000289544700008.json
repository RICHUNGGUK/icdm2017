This paper focuses on the load-transfer mechanism of the former interface through experimental push-out tests and numerical simulation of the tests. The study is divided into two parts. In the first part, a series of push-out tests have been carried out on four types of specimens (with studs + confinement (Case I); no stud + confinement (Case II); no stud + no confinement (Case III); and studs + no confinement (Case IV)). The second part is a numerical study based on three-dimensional finite element technique, which takes into account possible damage and cracking in grout, as well as bond-slip along the interface. It is shown that the numerical predictions of the four cases compare favorably with the corresponding test results, including the load-displacement response and the development of cracks. Furthermore, parametric study has been carried out to investigate the influence of various factors, including the studs, the casing confinement, the grout fracture energy, and the dilation property of steel-grout interface. Lastly, some implications, based on the test and numerical results, on the design of socketed steel H-piles are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
