Once we have shown the difficulties in the approach of the former, we deal with it as a particular case of the second. Furthermore, because of the peculiar characteristics of the considered process, we prove that these two problems can be formulated as a first-passage-time problem through a constant boundary. Finally, we conclude with an application to the growth of rabbits, in which we obtain the density functions of the inflection time and the time at which a rabbit achieves the half of its total growth.", "paper_title": "Some time random variables related to a Gompertz-type diffusion process", "paper_id": "WOS:000256797100001"}
