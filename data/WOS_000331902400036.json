Both of them only require local channel state information and no symbol extension is needed. Then, Ning et al. showed that when only one stream of information symbols is sent by each user, interference alignment may achieve receive diversity using the max-SINR algorithm. This result was, however, derived only based on an assumption. In this paper, using a different approach, we prove that interference alignment using the max-SINR algorithm indeed achieves receive diversity without the assumption used by Ning et al. The result in this paper not only completes the proof of the result by Ning et al., but also generalizes it by allowing more than one stream of information symbols to be sent by each user.", "paper_title": "A Diversity Analysis for Distributed Interference Alignment Using the Max-SINR Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000331902400036"}
