A large-scale electric power outage, which could be caused by major equipment failures or the disaster, makes only part of servers available and significantly degrades the whole infrastructure performance. With limited power recovery resources (e.g., generators), we recovery the power supply progressively over multiple time periods. Under these scenarios, we propose a dynamic Virtual Infrastructure (VI) planning. In order to save link bandwidth and active servers, we integrate traffic grooming with server consolidation to construct virtual networks. In order to reduce the blocking rate, we utilize anycast routing and resource balancing to reconfigure virtual networks. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy.
