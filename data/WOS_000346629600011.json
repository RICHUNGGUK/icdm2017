As the number of sequenced genomes rapidly grows, the vast majority of proteins can only be annotated computationally. Nature often brings several domains together to form multi-domain and multi-functional proteins with a vast number of possibilities, and each domain may fulfill its own function independently or in a concerted manner with its neighbors. Thus, it is evident that the protein function prediction problem is naturally and inherently Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) learning tasks. Based on the state-of-the-art MIML algorithm MIMLNN, we propose a novel ensemble MIML learning framework EnMIMLNN and design three algorithms for this task by combining the advantage of three kinds of Hausdorff distance metrics. Experiments on seven real-world organisms covering the biological three-domain system, i.e., archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote, show that the EnMIMLNN algorithms are superior to most state-of-the-art MIML and Multi-Label learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Genome-Wide Protein Function Prediction through Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000346629600011"}
