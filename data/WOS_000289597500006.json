ESWENO schemes up to eighth order were developed that are stable in the energy norm for systems of linear hyperbolic equations. Herein, boundary closures are developed for the fourth-order ESWENO scheme that maintain, wherever possible, the WENO stencil biasing properties and satisfy the summation-by-parts (SBP) operator convention, thereby ensuring stability in an L-2 norm. Second-order and third-order boundary closures are developed that are stable in diagonal and block norms, respectively, and achieve third- and fourth-order global accuracy for hyperbolic systems. A novel set of non-uniform flux interpolation points is necessary near the boundaries to simultaneously achieve (1) accuracy, (2) the SBP convention, and (3) WENO stencil biasing mechanics.
