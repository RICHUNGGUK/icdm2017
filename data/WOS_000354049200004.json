Algorithm MWCDS-C stabilizes in O(n(4)) steps using an unfair central daemon and space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits at each node for an arbitrary connected graph with n, nodes; it uses a designated node while other nodes are identical and anonymous. Algorithm MWCDS-D stabilizes using an unfair distributed daemon with identical time and space complexities, but it assumes unique node IDs. In the literature, the best reported stabilization time for a minimal weakly connected dominating set algorithm is O(nmA) under a distributed daemon [1], where m is the number of edges and A is the number of moves to construct a breadth- first tree.", "paper_title": "New Self-Stabilizing Algorithms for Minimal Weakly Connected Dominating Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049200004"}
