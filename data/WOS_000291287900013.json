APPCCM supports strong data consistency semantics through integrated cache consistency and mobility management. The objective of APPCCM is to minimize the overall network cost incurred due to data query/update processing, cache consistency management, and mobility management. In APPCCM, data objects can be adaptively cached at the mesh clients directly or at mesh routers dynamically selected by APPCCM. APPCCM is adaptive, per-user and per-object as the decision regarding where to cache a data object accessed by a mesh client is made dynamically, depending on the mesh client's mobility and data query/update characteristics, and the network's conditions. We develop analytical models for evaluating the performance of APPCCM and devise a computational procedure for dynamically calculating the overall network cost incurred. We demonstrate via both model-based analysis and simulation validation that APPCCM outperforms non-adaptive cache consistency management schemes that always cache data objects at the mesh client, or at the mesh client's current serving mesh router for mobile data access in wireless mesh networks.
