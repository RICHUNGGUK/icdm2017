Through the deployment of Mobi-TOP, a mobile content sharing application, it was found that perceived gratification factors for mobile content contribution were different from those for mobile content retrieval. In particular, factors which had significant positive effects on content contribution stemmed from leisure/entertainment and easy access. Factors fuelling content retrieval included the efficient provision of information resources/services and the need for high quality information, both of which tend to be information-centric. Interestingly, gratification factors for mobile content contribution were also found to have significant effects on mobile content retrieval intention and vice versa. Specifically, the access gratification factor had a significant positive effect on content retrieval intention while the self-gratification factor for content contribution had a significant negative effect on content retrieval intention.
