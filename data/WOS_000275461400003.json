In the paper we describe the information terms semantics, we define a natural deduction calculus for BCDL and we show it is sound and complete. As a first application of proof-theoretical properties of the calculus, we show how it fulfills the proofs-as-programs paradigm. Finally, we discuss the role of generators, the main element distinguishing our formalisation from the usual ones.", "paper_title": "BCDL: Basic Constructive Description Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000275461400003"}
