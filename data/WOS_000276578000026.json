However, CRT and GCRT must compute the modular operation with a large number in the final step, which is a time-consuming operation. Instead, the Aryabhata Remainder Theorem (ART) reduces the computation time without computing such large modular operation. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previously published works discuss any variation of ART. Therefore, this study proposes the Generalized Aryabhata Remainder Theorem (GART) which is the first work that discusses the generalized version of ART. Unlike the time complexities of the GCRT, which is O(n(2).t(2)), GART is just O(n.t(2)), where n is the number of moduli and t is the number of bits in each modulus. Therefore, the proposed GART is more efficient than GCRT.", "paper_title": "GENERALIZED ARYABHATA REMAINDER THEOREM", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000026"}
