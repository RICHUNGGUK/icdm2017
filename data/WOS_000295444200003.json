Compared with single-medoid based approaches, our recently proposed fuzzy clustering with multiple-weighted medoids has shown superior performance in clustering via experimental study. In this paper. we present a new version of fuzzy relational clustering in this family called fuzzy clustering with multi-medoids (FMMdd). Based on the new objective function of FMMdd, update equations can be derived more conveniently. Moreover, a unified view of FMMdd and two existing fuzzy relational approaches fuzzy c-medoids (FCMdd) and assignment-prototype (A-P) can be established, which allows us to conduct further analytical study to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach as well as the limitations of existing ones. The robustness of FMMdd is also investigated. Our theoretical and numerical studies show that the proposed approach produces good quality of clusters with rich cluster-based information and it is less sensitive to noise. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
