A split capacitor array technique is applied to decrease the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) settling time. Moreover, the design optimizes the logic delay of the SAR controller, resulting in a better match between the internal clock signal and the DAC settling time. The proposed ADC is simulated in SMIC 65 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology. It consumes 2.15 mW and achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 49.89 dB, translating into a figure-of-merit of 16.9 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "An 8-bit 500-MS/s asynchronous single-channel SAR ADC in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000351741400011"}
