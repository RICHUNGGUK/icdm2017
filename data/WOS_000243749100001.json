Data visualization techniques offer a solution to this issue. Such methods are especially useful in spatial data domains such as medical scan data and geophysical data. However, to properly see trends in data or to relate data from multiple sources, multiple-data set visualization techniques must be used. In research with the time-line paradigm, we have integrated multiple streaming data sources into a single visual interface. Data visualization takes place on several levels, from the visualization of query results in a time-line fashion to using multiple visualization techniques to view, analyze, and compare the data from the results. A significant contribution of this research effort is the extension and combination of existing research efforts into the visualization of multiple-data sets to create new and more flexible techniques. We specifically address visualization issues regarding clarity, speed, and interactivity. The developed visualization tools have also led recently to the visualization querying paradigm and challenge highlighted herein. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
