To better address the integration of multidisciplinary engineering knowledge within a knowledge based engineering (KBE) framework, the KNOMAD methodology has been devised. KNOMAD stands for Knowledge Nurture for Optimal Multidisciplinary Analysis and Design and is a methodology for the analytical utilization, development and evolution of multi-disciplinary engineering knowledge within the design and production realms. The KNOMAD acronym can also be used to highlight KNOMAD's formalized process of: (K)nowledge capture; (N)ormalisation; (O)rganisation; (M)odeling; (A)nalysis; and (D)elivery. These implementation steps are taken and repeated as part of the knowledge life cycle and in this context KNOMAD nurtures the whole Knowledge Management across that life cycle. The main contribution of the paper is to highlight the development of the KNOMAD methodology and to substantiate its individual steps with sufficient detail to support the application of KNOMAD in practice. A discipline-specific case study shows the potential of the KNOMAD methodology.
