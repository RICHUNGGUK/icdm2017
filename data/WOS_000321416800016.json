Given a base network with only two-way links, and the candidate lane addition and link construction projects, the problem is to find the optimal combination of one-way and two-way links, the optimal selection of network capacity expansion projects, and the optimal lane allocations on two-way links to optimize the reserve capacity of the network, and two new travel time related performance measures. The problem is considered in two variations; in the first scenario, two-way links may have different numbers of lanes in each direction and in the second scenario, two-way links must have equal number of lanes in each direction. The proposed variations are formulated as mixed-integer programming problems with equilibrium constraints. A hybrid genetic algorithm, an evolutionary simulated annealing, and a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm are proposed to solve these two new problems. A new measure is also proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the three algorithms. Computational results for both problems are presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
