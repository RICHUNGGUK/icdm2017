In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits a hidden Bayesian network, constructed from wavelet coefficients, to model the prior probability of the original image. Then, we use the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, which estimates a coefficient based on all the coefficients of an image, as the maximum-a-posterior (MAP) estimator to derive the denoised wavelet coefficients. We show that if the network is a spanning tree, the standard BP algorithm can perform MAP estimation efficiently. Our experiment results demonstrate that, in terms of the peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and perceptual quality, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several images, particularly in the textured regions, with various amounts of white Gaussian noise.", "paper_title": "Wavelet Bayesian Network Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000318016600002"}
