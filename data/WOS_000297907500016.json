Some numerical examples are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed element. The numerical results show that the 21-node element has much better performance than that of the isoparametric 20-node Serendipity element especially for the distorted meshes, and it is comparable to the 27-node Lagrange element. It has also been demonstrated that the spline finite element method is an efficient tool for developing high accuracy elements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
