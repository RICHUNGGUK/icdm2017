In addition to that, if traffic is measured at multiple points in the network at the same time, it becomes necessary to merge the observations in order to obtain network-wide statistics. When doing so, packets must be accounted for only once, even if they traverse more than one measurement point. Today's standard technique, sampling-based traffic accounting, results in large approximation errors. Here, we describe an approach named Distributed Probabilistic Counting (DPC). DPC is based on a probabilistic data representation. It provides accurate traffic statistics at very low per-packet effort, and is able to merge measurement from multiple network locations while counting each distinct packet only once.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Parallel Measurement of Network Traffic at Multiple Locations", "paper_id": "WOS:000299430700002"}
