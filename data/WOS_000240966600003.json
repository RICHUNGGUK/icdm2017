We give a formal definition for it and propose a concrete provably secure scheme with a proof of security and a brief analysis of efficiency. Assuming the intractabilities of the Discrete Logarithm Problem and the ROS-Problem, the proposed scheme is unforgeable under adaptive chosen-message attack.", "paper_title": "Provably secure convertible user designating confirmer partially blind signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240966600003"}
