Traditionally, shop floor operational policies concerning maintenance scheduling, quality control and production scheduling have been considered and optimized independently. However, these three aspects of operations planning do have an interaction effect on each other and hence need to be considered jointly for improving the system performance. In this paper, a model is developed for joint optimization of these three aspects in a manufacturing system. First, a model has been developed for integrating maintenance scheduling and process quality control policy decisions. It provided an optimal preventive maintenance interval and control chart parameters that minimize expected cost per unit time. Subsequently, the optimal preventive maintenance interval is integrated with the production schedule in order to determine the optimal batch sequence that will minimize penalty-cost incurred due to schedule delay. An example is presented to illustrate the proposed model. It also compares the system performance employing the proposed integrated approach with that obtained by considering maintenance, quality and production scheduling independently. Substantial economic benefits are seen in the joint optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
