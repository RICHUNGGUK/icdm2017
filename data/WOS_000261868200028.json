A reversible data hiding method can extract the cover image without any distortion from the stego-image after the hidden data have been extracted. This paper proposes a new interpolation and a data hiding method. The proposed scaling-up neighbor mean interpolation method has a low-time complexity and high-calculation speed. The proposed data hiding method is based on interpolation. Comparison on data hiding methods is divided into reversible or not. Our experimental results show the proposed method can embed a large amount of secret data while keeping a very high visual quality, the PSNR is guaranteed to be higher than 35 dB compared with other reversible data hiding methods. And also capacity is larger than any other reversible data hiding methods and comparable to other data hiding methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
