We use this to show the strictness of the quantifier rank hierarchies for various logics ranging from existential (or universal) fragments of first-order logic to infinitary logics augmented with arbitrary classes of generalized quantifiers of bounded arity. The sentence above is also shown to be equivalent to a first-order sentence with at most n+2 variables (free and bound). This gives the strictness of the quantifier rank hierarchies for various logics with only n+2 variables. The proofs use the bijective Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game and a modification of the building blocks of Hella.", "paper_title": "Rank Hierarchies for Generalized Quantifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000289165700008"}
