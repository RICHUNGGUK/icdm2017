The model considers the temporary limit conditions as access control of home device or user location information considering the characteristics of members who could limit the use of resource. In addition, the model provides authentication policy which authenticates not only devices but also domains and access control policy which considers inheritance of role. Finally, the model can be applied various and scalable access control policies which are suitable to the characteristics of intelligent digital environment as considering the user location information as a temporary limit condition.", "paper_title": "uiH-PMAC model suitable for ubi-home gateway in ubiquitous intelligent environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600099"}
