We previously proposed a test for detecting social novelty using trios composed of two familiar mice and one unfamiliar mouse of the same strain, moving freely in a small neutral open field. The previous study showed that social interactions in trios of same-strain males were correctly measured by the duration of approach between two males, and the time spent in proximity to another individual. The present study used trios of two familiar male mice of the same strain and an intruder of a different strain to evaluate the robustness of the protocol in encounters involving strains with different motor activity levels. The results validated the methods and showed subtle inter-strain differences in reactions to the presence of an intruder. The frequency and mean duration of the proximity episodes showed an inter-strain difference in social interactions with the intruder: B6 increased the duration of contacts without changing the frequency, whereas 129S2 increased the frequency of contacts but these were of a shorter duration. The results are discussed in relation to a possible effect of strain differences on anxiety levels or, more generally, the influence of genetic background on the social behaviour of mice.
