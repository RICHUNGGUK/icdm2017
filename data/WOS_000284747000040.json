This problem greatly affects performance of a manufacturing system. It is assumed in this paper that there are multiple products to be produced on several machines. Alternative processing routes are considered for each product and the problem is to determine the processing route of each product and the location of each machine to minimize the total distance traveled by the materials within the shop floor. This paper presents a mixed-integer non-linear mathematical programming formulation to find optimal solution of this problem. A technique is used to linearize the formulated non-linear model. However, due to the NP-hardness of this problem, even the linearized model cannot be optimally solved by the conventional mathematical programming methods in a reasonable time. Therefore, a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the linearized model. The effectiveness of the GA approach is evaluated with numerical examples. The results show that the proposed GA is both effective and efficient in solving the attempted problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
