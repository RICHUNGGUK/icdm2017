Normally, there is a trade-off between precision and computational cost. In this study, we present a framework combined with block matching algorithm (BMA) and phase shift method with prior estimation (PSPE). BMA is first applied to the RF signals, the axial and lateral displacements obtained are then used as a prior estimates of the PS method to calculate a more precision axial displacements. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with synthetic ultrasound RF data, and it is found that both SNRe and CNRe of our method are significantly higher than those of phase-shift as a prior estimation (PSPE) method. Elasticity phantom and clinical data are also used to verify the usefulness of our algorithm, respectively. The results show that our method is robust to image the complex tissue motions.
