The considerable influence of the presence of rings of various types with respect to the above endpoint has been detected. The mechanistic interpretation and the domain of applicability of the QSARs are discussed. Methods to select new potential gamma-secretase inhibitors are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
