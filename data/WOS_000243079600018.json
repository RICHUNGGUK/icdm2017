First, the overlapping grid method based on Lagrange interpolating polynomials is described and a theoretical analysis of the interpolation operator is then carried out. It shows that the interpolation generates spurious modes that depend on the wavenumbers of the signal. Besides it also gives the optimal conditions in which interpolation can be applied. Then an application to the simulation of the aeroacoustic noise generated by the vortex shedding behind a cylinder is presented. During this simulation, it appears that interpolation can create some spurious acoustic modes in regions where hydrodynamic fluctuations are significant, as predicted by the theoretical analysis. It is shown that these spurious modes disappear when a refined Cartesian grid is used (26 points per wavelength of the vortex shedding were found to be adequate in this study). At last, the simulation of the aerodynamic noise of a three element high-lift wing profile has then been carried out. For this application, the main acoustic source at the slat trailing edge is represented analytically. The propagation of the generated acoustic wave is simulated with a mean flow at rest and with a steady turbulent mean flow computed by RANS. The first application allows us to assess the method by comparing the results to a reference solution. The second one shows that the influence of a non-uniform mean flow on the directivity of an acoustic source can be observed in complex geometries. This application therefore shows that the proposed coupling method is well adapted to complex geometries that are usually met in industrial applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
