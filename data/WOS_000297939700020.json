In this paper, we address some questions that become relevant in Bell-type tests involving systems with local dimension greater than 2. For CHSH-Bell tests within 2D subspaces of such high-dimensional systems, it has been suggested that experimental violation of Tsirelson's bound indicates that more than 2D entanglement was present. We explain that the overstepping of Tsirelson's bound is due to violation of fair sampling, and can in general be reproduced by a separable state, if fair sampling is violated. For a class of Bell-type inequalities generalized to d-dimensional systems, we then consider what level of violation is required to guarantee d-dimensional entanglement of the tested state, when fair sampling is satisfied. We find that this can be used as an experimentally feasible test of d-dimensional entanglement for up to quite high values of d.", "paper_title": "ON BELL INEQUALITY VIOLATIONS WITH HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700020"}
