In this paper we present an ontology of cancer therapies originally developed to bridge the gap between an oncologic Electronic Patient Record (EPR) and a guideline-based decision support system. We show an application of the ontology complemented by rules to classify therapies recorded in the EPR. The results show how such an ontology can be used also to discover possible problems of data consistency in the EPR. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
