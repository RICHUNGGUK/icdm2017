In particular, the closed-form expression of the outage probability for the proposed scheme over Rayleigh fading channels is derived. Asymptotic performance analysis for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also presented. It is shown that the SSC scheme is capable of realizing full diversity order, and even achieving the same outage performance as the best-relay selection (BRS), when reasonable switching thresholds are set. Simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Outage Probability of Switch and Stay Combining in Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200009"}
