Based on the W3C definition, it shows that the object resource provide additional information about the subject resource. Since providing additional information can take various forms, the definition is generic. In the other words, the rdfs:seeAlso link can present different meanings to the users and it can represents different kind of patterns and relationships between web resources. These patterns are unknown and have to be specified to help organizations, and individuals to interlink, and publish their datasets on Web of Data using the rdfs:seeAlso link. In this paper, we investigate to the traditional usages of seealso and then present a methodology to specify the patterns of rdfs:seeAlso usages in Semantic Web. The results of our investigation show that the discovered patterns constitute a significant portion of rdfs:seeAlso usages in Web of Data.", "paper_title": "DISCOVERY OF RDFS:SEEALSO PATTERNS IN SEMANTIC WEB", "paper_id": "WOS:000337801600001"}
