A thermodynamics based constitutive relationship is presented coupling anisotropic damage and elasticity, the main idea of the model being that damage anisotropy is responsible for the dissymmetry tension/compression. A strain written damage criterion is considered (Mazars criterion extended to anisotropy in the initial model). The biaxial behavior of a family of anisotropic damage model is analyzed through the effects of yield surface modifications by the introduction of new equivalent strains.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic damage modelling of biaxial behaviour and rupture of concrete structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000259269000010"}
