The original wild is designed to hide content authorship information. Such design may hinder users from being aware of task conflict, resulting in low-efficient conflict management and decreased group performance. This study aims at increasing users' awareness of task conflict to facilitate wiki-based collaboration. Design/methodology/approach - A visual feedback dialog box is designed to increase users' awareness of task conflict. A survey-based comparative study is conducted by using original wild and modified wiki (the new design). A total of 301 participants are invited. Structural equation model (SEM) is used to analyze survey data. Findings - Most users are willing to solve conflict issues, and the dialog box can increase users' awareness of task conflict. Conflict awareness can promote user's participation, gain better conflict resolution and improve group performance. The dialog box can enhance the influence of conflict awareness on user participation and conflict resolution, but reduce the influence of conflict awareness on group performance. Research limitations/implications - Only undergraduate students are invited, some typical variables are not included. The design needs improvement. Originality/value - A new wiki tool is designed. The influence of conflict awareness is explored while previous studies largely ignore this variable.", "paper_title": "Supporting group collaboration in Wiki by increasing the awareness of task conflict", "paper_id": "WOS:000327047700002"}
