However, no anatomically accurate, complex paediatric chest finite element (FE) component model is available for a 10-year old in the published literature. In this study, a 10-year-old thorax FE model was developed based on internal and external geometries segmented from medical images. The model was then validated against published data measured during cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed on paediatric subjects.", "paper_title": "Development of a 10-year-old paediatric thorax finite element model validated against cardiopulmonary resuscitation data", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018600003"}
