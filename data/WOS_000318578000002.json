In this work, the security level of the proposed TPS scheme has been significantly enhanced by using improved short signatures and interactive secret-sharing. Our analysis indicates that the proposed scheme achieves the six accepted security properties that are required for a strong-secure TPS scheme. It can also resist a severe attack against TPS, i.e., original signer changing attack.", "paper_title": "A SECURE THRESHOLD PROXY SIGNATURE SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578000002"}
