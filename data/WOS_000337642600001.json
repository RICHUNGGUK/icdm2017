The procedure is based on a new method of sampling the process, which combines the Brownian bridge construction with conditioning on integrals along paths of the process. The key element in our method is the identification of a low-dimensional vector of variables that reduces the dimension of the integration problem more effectively than the Brownian bridge. We illustrate the method by applying it in conjunction with low-discrepancy sequences to the problem of pricing Asian options. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
