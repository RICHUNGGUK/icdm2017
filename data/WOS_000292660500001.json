Drawing on theories in psychology, we conducted an experiment to examine the impact of psychological climate (the individual's perceptions of the environment) on decision-making performance. Controlling for settings of GDSS session, we found that individual performance depended on two dimensions of the psychological climate. First, GDSS users perceiving a higher level of psychological safety made more effective and efficient decisions. Second, GDSS users perceiving higher level of psychological meaningfulness made better decisions if they had a clear understanding of the decision goal. Our study therefore highlighted the importance of individual psychological perceptions in a GDSS context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
