SEM is an advanced statistical technique in the social and behavioral sciences to verify the hypothesized relationships, but it is seldom combined with other machine-learning algorithms. To overcome the difficulty of constructing a BN structure when learning from data, this study uses SEM to aid BN in discovering a suitable network architecture for prediction. 159 valid samples were collected from college students with online English learning experience. Compared with other prediction methods, the SEM-BN approach yielded better results than those of back-propagation neural networks (BPN) and classification & regression trees (CART).", "paper_title": "The Discovery of Network Structure for E-Learning Participation Prediction: An Integrated Bayesian Networks Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900009"}
