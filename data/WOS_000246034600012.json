It is therefore not surprising that wireless technology is being embraced with increasing vigor. For real-time applications, user satisfaction is closely linked to quantities such as queue length, packet loss probability, and delay. System performance is therefore related to, not only Shannon capacity, but also quality of service (QoS) requirements. This work studies the problem of resource allocation in the context of stringent QoS constraints. The joint impact of spectral bandwidth, power, and code rate is considered. Analytical expressions for the probability of buffer overflow, its associated exponential decay rate, and the effective capacity are obtained. Fundamental performance limits for Markov wireless channel models are identified. It is found that, even with an unlimited power and spectral bandwidth budget, only a finite arrival rate can be supported for a QoS constraint defined in terms of exponential decay rate.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation and quality of service evaluation for wireless communication systems using fluid models", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600012"}
