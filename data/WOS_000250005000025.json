The annotation of these putative ncRNAs, however, remains a difficult problem. Here we describe an SVM-based approach that, in conjunction with a non-stringent filter for consensus secondary structures, is capable of efficiently recognizing microRNA precursors in multiple sequence alignments. The software was applied to recent genome-wide RNAz surveys of mammals, urochordates, and nematodes.", "paper_title": "Hairpins in a Haystack: recognizing microRNA precursors in comparative genomics data", "paper_id": "WOS:000250005000025"}
