Over the past few years, several learning based detection methods using various supervised two-class techniques have been presented. Although satisfactory results can be obtained, a lot of manual labor is needed to construct the training set. To overcome this drawback, this letter proposes a player detection method based on one-class SVM (OCSVM) using automatically generated training data. The proposed method is evaluated using several video clips captured from World Cup 2010, and experimental results show that our approach achieves a high detection rate while keeping the training set construction's cost low.", "paper_title": "A Fully Automatic Player Detection Method Based on One-Class SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600025"}
