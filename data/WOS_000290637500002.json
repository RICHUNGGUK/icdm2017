One of the main issues that has to be handled is the variability of such delays. Latency-insensitive circuits offer a form of elasticity that tolerates variations in those delays. This flexibility usually requires the addition of a control layer that synchronizes the flow of information. This paper proposes a method for eliminating the complexity of the control layer, replacing it by a set of iterative schedulers that decide when to activate computations. Unlike previous approaches, this can be achieved with low complexity algorithms and without extra circuitry.", "paper_title": "A Scheduling Strategy for Synchronous Elastic Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290637500002"}
