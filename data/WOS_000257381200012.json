As a consequence we find an exact expression for the rate of regularity of set-valued mappings associated with so-called constraint systems. It turns out that the rate is equal to the upper bound of Robinson-type estimates over all norms in the graph space of the homogenized mapping majorizing the norm of the underlying space. We further introduce a concept of a perfectly regular mapping and find some criteria for perfect regularity.", "paper_title": "Regularity estimates for convex multifunctions", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381200012"}
