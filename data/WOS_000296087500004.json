This study presented a set of intelligent interconnection network systems for electric appliances, which can measure the power consumption of household appliances through a current sensing device based on OSGi platform. The system establishes the characteristics and categories of related electric appliances, and searches the corresponding cluster data and eliminates noise for recognition functionality and error detection mechanism of electric appliances by applying the clustering algorithm. The system also integrates household appliance control network services so as to control them according to users' power consumption plans or through mobile devices, thus realizing a bidirectional monitoring service. When the system detects an abnormal operating state, it can automatically shut off electric appliances to avoid accidents. In practical tests, the system reached a recognition rate of 95%, and could successfully control general household appliances through the ZigBee network.", "paper_title": "Home Energy Management System for Interconnecting and Sensing of Electric Appliances", "paper_id": "WOS:000296087500004"}
