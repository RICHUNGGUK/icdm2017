Among all the tracking technologies, RF-based technology is an emerging research field facing many challenges. Although we proposed the original idea, until now there is no method achieving scalability without sacrificing latency and accuracy. In this paper, we put forward a real-time tracking system RASS, which can achieve this goal and is promising in the applications like the safeguard system. Our basic idea is to divide the tracking field into different areas, with adjacent areas using different communication channels. So, the interference among different areas can be prevented. For each area, three communicating nodes are deployed on the ceiling as a regular triangle to monitor this area. In each triangle area, we use a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to locate the object. This model simulates the relationship between the signal dynamics caused by the object and the object position. It not only considers the ideal case of signal dynamics caused by the object, but also utilizes their irregular information. As a result, it can reach the tracking accuracy to around 1 m by just using three nodes in a triangle area with 4 m in each side. The experiments show that the tracking latency of the proposed RASS system is bounded by only about 0.26 m. Our system scales well to a large deployment field without sacrificing the latency and accuracy.", "paper_title": "RASS: A Real-Time, Accurate, and Scalable System for Tracking Transceiver-Free Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000316754600014"}
