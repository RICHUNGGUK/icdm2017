A node's service profile consists of a set of services (i.e., sensing and actuation capabilities) that it provides and the quality-of-service (QoS) parameters associated with those services (delay, accuracy, freshness, etc.). mu RACER uses an efficient service-aware routing approach that aggressively reduces downstream traffic (from the sink to the network's nodes) by translating service profiles into efficient paths for queries. To support QoS, mu RACER dynamically adapts each node's routing behavior and service profile according to the current context of that node, i.e., number of pending queries and number and type of messages to be routed. Finally, mu RACER improves end-to-end reliability through a scalable reputation-based approach in which each node is able to locally estimate the next hop of the most reliable path to the sink. Service-and context-aware reliable routing enhances the network's efficiency and effectiveness (satisfaction of applications' QoS requirements). We implemented mu RACER on top of TinyOS and conducted several experiments that confirmed mu RACER's ability with regard to each of its design objectives.", "paper_title": "mu RACER: A Reliable Adaptive Service-Driven Efficient Routing Protocol Suite for Sensor-Actuator Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264523500002"}
