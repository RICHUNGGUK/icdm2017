Using past theories on adoption studies, a three-level framework was developed. This framework helped to formulate a new research model. A quantitative survey was conducted to identify the important factors affecting the intention of customers to adopt information-oriented online legal services in Hong Kong. Findings indicated that there is a hierarchical relationship among the four constructs. Perceived usefulness was the most important belief that drove people to adopt the online services. Perceived risk and trust were less important at present, probably because online legal services are still somewhat immature and mainly focus on less risky areas, such as information dissemination and marketing.
