Our results include the following: Almost every Boolean function has PTF degree at most n/2 + O(root n log n). Together with results of Anthony and Alon, this establishes a conjecture of Wang and Williams [C. Wang, A.C. Williams, The threshold order of a Boolean function, Discrete Appl. Math. 31 (1991) 51-69] and Aspnes, Beige], Furst, and Rudich [J. Aspnes, R. Beigel, M. Furst, S. Rudich, The expressive power of voting polynomials, Combinatorica 14 (2) (1994) 1-14] up to lower order terms. Every Boolean function has PTF density at most (1-1/O(n))2(n). This improves a result of Gotsman [C. Gotsman, On Boolean functions, polynomials and algebraic threshold functions, Technical Report TR-89-18, Department of Computer Science, Hebrew University, 1989]. Every Boolean function has weak PTF density at most o(1)2(n). This gives a negative answer to a question posed by Saks [M. Saks. Slicing the hypercube, in: London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., vol. 187, 1993, pp. 211-257]. PTF degree [log(2)m] + 1 is necessary and sufficient for Boolean functions with sparsity m. This answers a question of Beigel [R. Beige], personal communication, 2000]. We also give new extremal bounds on polynomials which approximate Boolean functions in the too norm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
