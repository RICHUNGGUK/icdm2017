We show that for a multigraph G with m edges and orientable genus g, the edge expansion of G can be determined in time m(O(g)). We show that the same is true for various other similar measures of edge connectivity.", "paper_title": "DETERMINING EDGE EXPANSION AND OTHER CONNECTIVITY MEASURES OF GRAPHS OF BOUNDED GENUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700013"}
