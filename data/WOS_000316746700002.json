Therefore, this article reports a study carried out to evaluate the degree of correspondence and correlation between post-release defects (i.e., field defects) and warnings issued by FindBugs, a bug finding tool widely used in Java systems. The study aimed to evaluate two types of relations: static correspondence (when warnings contribute to find the static program locations changed to remove field defects) and statistical correlation (when warnings serve as early indicators for future field defects). As a result, we have concluded that there is no static correspondence between field defects and warnings. However, statistical tests showed that there is a moderate level of correlation between warnings and such kinds of software defects.", "paper_title": "Static correspondence and correlation between field defects and warnings reported by a bug finding tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000316746700002"}
