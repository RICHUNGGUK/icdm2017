But this concept is not used in problems with more than one criterion. The main purpose of this paper is to validate the existence of such a set of variables in bi-criteria {0-1}-knapsack instances. Numerical experiments were performed on five types of {0, 1}-knapsack instances. The results are presented for the supported and non-supported solutions as well as for the entire set of efficient solutions. A description of an approximate and an exact method is also presented.
