The phosphate group P=O bond vibration region (similar to 1270 to 1290 cm(-1)) revealed the largest frequency variation with hydration, with a frequency red shift reflecting the direct hydrogen bond formation between the P=O of Sarin and water. Small variations to the P-F stretch (similar to 810 to 815 cm(-1)) and the C-O-P vibrational modes (similar to 995 to 1004 cm(-1)) showed that the water interactions with these functional groups were minor, and that the structures of Sarin were not extensively perturbed in the hydrated complexes. Increasing the number of explicit hydration waters produced only small vibrational changes in the lowest free energy complexes. These minor changes were consistent with a single water-phosphate hydrogen bond being the dominant structure, though a second water-phosphate hydrogen bond was observed in some complexes and was identified by an additional red shift of the P=O bond vibration. The H2O center dot H2O vibrational modes (similar to 3450 to 3660 cm(-1)) increased in complexity with higher hydration levels and reflect the extended hydrogen bonding networks formed between the explicit waters in the hydrated Sarin clusters.", "paper_title": "Infrared signature of micro-hydration in the organophosphate Sarin: an ab initio study", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458400020"}
