With kernel methods KFDA can perform efficient classification in kernel feature space. Through some nonlinear mapping the input data can be mapped implicitly into a high-dimensional kernel feature space where nonlinear pattern now appears linear. Different from fuzzy discriminant analysis (FDA) which is based on Euclidean distance, KFDA uses kernel-induced distance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed classifier compares favorably with FDA. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
