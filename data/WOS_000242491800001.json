Different handsets may introduce different degrees of distortion to the speech signals. This paper attempts to combine a handset selector with (1) handset-specific transformations, (2) reinforced learning, and (3) stochastic feature transformation to reduce the effect caused by the acoustic distortion. Specifically, during training, the clean speaker models and background models are firstly transformed by MLLR-based hand set-specific transformations using a small amount of distorted speech data. Then reinforced learning is applied to adapt the transformed models to hand set-dependent speaker models and handset-dependent background models using stochastically transformed speaker patterns. During a verification session, a GMM-based handset classifier is used to identify the most likely handset used by the claimant; then the corresponding handset-dependent speaker and background model pairs are used for verification. Experimental results based on 150 speakers of the HTIMIT corpus show that environment adaptation based on the combination of MLLR, reinforced learning and feature transformation outperforms CMS, Hnorm, Tnorm, and speaker-model synthesis.
