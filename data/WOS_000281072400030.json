Advertising budget problem appears such as how to determine the total budget level for an advertising campaign. In this paper, an optimization method is proposed to deal with the advertising budget problem of mixed-media advertising. Different from the existing methods which take the maximal advertising effect as objectives, the proposed method formulates advertising budget problem as a nonlinear programming problem with the objective of minimizing advertising budget under the constraint on response goal achievement. A novel media mix model is constructed to deal with the duplication among selected media. Furthermore, a Bayesian estimation method dedicated to parameterizing the media mix model is proposed. A genetic algorithm, is adopted to find the optimal solution of advertising budget problem. Finally, a case study on real project is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "ADVERTISING BUDGET OPTIMIZATION BASED ON STATISTICAL LEARNING AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400030"}
