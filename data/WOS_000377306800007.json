When channels vary within a physical transmission frame, the above improvement is substantially suppressed. To remedy this, this letter develops new FFR patterns for multi-cell OFDMA systems with frequency or time division duplexing (FDD/TDD) in time-varying channels. Simulation results show notable performance gains of the proposed schemes over the existing ones.", "paper_title": "New Fractional Frequency Reuse Patterns for Multi-Cell Systems in Time-Varying Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800007"}
