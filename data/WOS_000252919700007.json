In this model the Monte Carlo algorithm is applied to evaluate the particle coordinates and momentum deviation depending on time and parameters of the target. One has to mention that due to statistical character of the pellet distribution in the target the analytical techniques are not applicable. This is also true for the particle distribution in the stored beam, which is influenced by various effects (such as a cooling process, intra-beam scattering, betatron oscillation, space charge effect). In this case only the Monte Carlo technique to model energy straggling in combination with the pellet distribution in the target should be considered.
