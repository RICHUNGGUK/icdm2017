In theory the operating system could support such investigations both in terms of tools for analysis of data and by making the system data readily accessible for analysis. Conventional operating systems such as Windows and UNIX derivatives offer some memory-related tools that are geared towards the analysis of system crashes, rather than forensic investigations. In this paper we demonstrate how techniques developed for persistent operating systems, where lifetime of data is independent of the method of its creation and storage, could support computer forensics investigations delivering higher efficiency and accuracy. It is proposed that some of the features offered by persistent systems could be built into conventional operating systems to make illicit activities easier to identify and analyse. We further propose a new technique for forensically sound acquisition of memory based on the persistence paradigm. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
