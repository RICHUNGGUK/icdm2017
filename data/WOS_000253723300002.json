Here we present a general method of analysis which makes optimal use of all available data, and allows the use of inverse dynamic analysis in cases where external force data is incomplete. The method was evaluated for the analysis of running on a partially instrumented treadmill. It was found that results correlate well with those of a conventional analysis where all external forces are known.", "paper_title": "A weighted least squares method for inverse dynamic analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000253723300002"}
