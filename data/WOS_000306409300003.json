The coefficients of the numerator polynomial, however, are more difficult to characterise. It is known that they are contained in a bounded convex set that is the intersection of an uncountably infinite number of linear half-spaces. In order to determine whether a given vector of numerator coefficients is contained in this set (i.e. the vector corresponds to an ME distribution) we present a semi-infinite programming algorithm that minimises a convex distance function over the set. In addition, in the event that the given vector does not correspond to an ME distribution, the algorithm returns a closest vector which does correspond to one.", "paper_title": "A semi-infinite programming approach to identifying matrix-exponential distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409300003"}
