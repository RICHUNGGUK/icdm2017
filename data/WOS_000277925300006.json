Formulas gamma with this property are called distributive queries because they naturally arise in Chan's seminal approach to temporal logic query solving [Chan 2000]. As recognizing distributive LTL queries is PSPACE-complete, we consider distributive fragments of LTL defined by templates as in Buccafurri et al. [2001]. Our main result is a syntactic characterization of distributive LTL queries in terms of LTL templates: we construct a context-free template grammar LTLQ(x) which guarantees that all specifications obtained from LTLQ(x) are distributive, and all templates not obtained from LTLQ(x) have simple nondistributive instantiations.", "paper_title": "On the Distributivity of LTL Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000277925300006"}
