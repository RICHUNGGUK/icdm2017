To deal with these issues, an analytical performance model consisting of stochastic sub-models is proposed. Furthermore, to obtain outputs of the sub-models and the overall result, a Markov reward approach is applied. Closed-form solutions of the sub-models are also presented. Specifically, this study models a type of MCC known as mobile network operator cloud (MNOC) in which the mobile devices receive services from the MNOC via 3G connection. The performance of such a class of MCC is affected by a varied set of parameters, such as handoff failure and workload. The model illustrates the impact of the parameters on two important performance measures: request rejection probability and mean response delay. Using the SHARPE software package, the model is solved and numerical results presented. Moreover, the analytical results are verified through discrete-event simulation.", "paper_title": "Analytical performance model for mobile network operator cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000365185400011"}
