First, we propose a new approximating model in which the channel is assumed to be static in sub-blocks vary each other. Based on this model, we derive a new 2-orthogonal-sub-blocked frequency domain equalization method. Then, we derive the conditions of the channel under which the equalization method can be applied to the 2-orthogonal-sub-blocked systems. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can improve the anti-Doppler ability of SC-FDLE and at the same time keep its high efficiency and low complexity.", "paper_title": "A sub-block orthogonal single carrier frequency domain equalization system in fast Rayleigh fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500012"}
