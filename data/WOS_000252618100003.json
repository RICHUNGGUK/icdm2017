The suggested approach consists in replacing the subjective notion of importance of a subset of attributes by that of information content of a subset of attributes, which can be estimated from the set of profiles by means of an entropy measure. An example of the application of the proposed methodology is given: in the absence of initial preferences, the approach is applied to the evaluation of students.
