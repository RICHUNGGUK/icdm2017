By imposing a special set of conditions on this class of codes, it was recently shown that the resulting codes, for this class, can be obtained as elements in a family of codes introduced by Vega in [7]. Now, by using a different set of conditions, the aim of this paper is to present an extended version for the class of codes studied by Ma et al.", "paper_title": "The Weight Distribution of an Extended Class of Reducible Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000048"}
