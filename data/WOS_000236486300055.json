In our studies, the ICA is applied to processing on saccade-related EEG signals in order to predict saccadic eye movements because an ensemble averaging, which is a conventional processing method of EEG signals, is not suitable for real-time processing. We have already detected saccade-related independent components. (ICs) by ICA. However, features of saccade-related EEG signals and saccade-related ICs were not compared. In this paper, saccade-related EEG signals and saccade-related ICs in visually and auditorily guided saccade task are compared in the point of the latency between starting time of a saccade and time when a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value and in the point of the peak scale where a saccade-related EEG signal or an IC has maximum value.", "paper_title": "Analysis on EEG signals in visually and auditorily guided saccade task by FICAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300055"}
