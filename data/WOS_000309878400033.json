However, the relationship between individual measures and overall evaluation of the quality of life is highly complex. The effectiveness of integrating fuzzy-connective-based aggregation network with real-valued genetic algorithm (GA) in quality of life evaluation is investigated. The fuzzy-connective-based aggregation network aggregates the relative status or achievement among states in quality of life-related variables through a hierarchical decision-making structure. The aggregation network then produces an overall quality of life evaluation from various aspects. Integration with real-valued GA helps avoid stopping at local solutions, as experienced by conventional fuzzy-connective-based aggregation networks. The drawbacks in binary GA are also prevented. The effectiveness and applicability of integrating fuzzy-connective-based aggregation networks with real-valued GA for quality of life evaluation is confirmed through statistical analysis.", "paper_title": "Integrated fuzzy-connective-based aggregation network with real-valued genetic algorithm for quality of life evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400033"}
