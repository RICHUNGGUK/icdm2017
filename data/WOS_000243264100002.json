Exploiting the network structure of the problem, we develop exact and approximate models and solution approaches, and compare their results using data provided by an airline. We show that quality results can be generated using the exact approach or the heuristic approach, with the heuristic approach capable of generating good solutions very quickly. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
