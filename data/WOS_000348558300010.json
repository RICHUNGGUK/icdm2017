But it cannot handle imprecise data. Imprecise data, for example, can be expressed in the form of the interval data or mixtures of interval data and exact data. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes three new interval DEA models from different points of view. Two examples are presented to illustrate and validate these models.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED INTERVAL DEA MODELS WITH COMMON WEIGHT", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558300010"}
