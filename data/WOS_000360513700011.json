Based on the classical thermoelasticity theory, boundary-domain integral equations for dynamic coupled thermoelastic problems are derived using the weighted residual method. The elastostatic and steady-state heat conduction fundamental solutions are employed in deriving the integral equations for dynamic coupled thermoelastic problems and this approach leads to domain integrals appearing in the resulting integral equations. The radial integral method (RIM) is employed to transform the domain integrals into boundary integrals and thus the boundary-only integral equations formulation can be achieved. It is then discretized into a system of time-dependent algebraic equations, which is solved by the standard Newmark time-integration scheme. Numerical results for several examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the present formulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
