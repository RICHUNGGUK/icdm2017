The study focuses on evaluating how learning is affected when different resampling algorithms transform the originally imbalanced data into artificially balanced class distributions. Experiments over 17 real data sets using eight different classifiers, four resampling algorithms and four performance evaluation measures show that over-sampling the minority class consistently outperforms under-sampling the majority class when data sets are strongly imbalanced, whereas there are not significant differences for databases with a low imbalance. Results also indicate that the classifier has a very poor influence on the effectiveness of the resampling strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
