We propose the generalized interpolation scheme for the isoparametric formulation of three-dimensional beam finite elements and the numerical procedure is developed for elastoplastic large deformation analysis. The formulation is general and effective for other thin-walled section beam finite elements. To show the validity of the formulation proposed, a 2-node three-dimensional L-section beam finite element is implemented in an analysis code. As numerical examples, we first perform elastic small and large deformation analyses of a cantilever beam structure subjected to various tip loadings, and elastoplastic large deformation analysis of the same structure under reversed cyclic tip loading. We then analyze the failures of simply supported beam structures of different lengths and slenderness ratios under elastoplastic large deformation. The same problems are solved using refined shell finite element models of the structures. The numerical results of the L-section beam finite element developed here are compared with the solutions obtained using shell finite element analyses. We also discuss the numerical solutions in detail. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
