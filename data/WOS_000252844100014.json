This paper suggests lower bounds on the degrees of (t, k)-diagnosability of multiprocessor systems under both the PMC and the MM* models. As a consequence, grids and tori of d dimensions are shown to be (O(N(d/d+ 1)), Omega(d))- diagnosable and (O(N(d/d+ 1)), Omega(2d))- diagnosable, respectively, where N is the number of processors.", "paper_title": "(t, k)-diagnosability of multiprocessor systems with applications to grids and tori", "paper_id": "WOS:000252844100014"}
