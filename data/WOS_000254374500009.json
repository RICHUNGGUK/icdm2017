Most existing approaches rely on hand-crafted grammar rules to identify semantic relationships among the recognized mathematical symbols. They could easily fail when writing errors occurred. Moreover, they assume the availability of the whole mathematical expression before being able to analyze the semantic information of the expression. To tackle these problems, we propose a progressive structural analysis (PSA) approach for dynamic recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions. The proposed PSA approach is able to provide analysis result immediately after each written input symbol. This has an advantage that users are able to detect any recognition errors immediately and correct only the mis-recognized symbols rather than the whole expression. Experiments conducted on 57 most commonly used mathematical expressions have shown that the PSA approach is able to achieve very good performance results. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
