By extending the switching technique of McKay and Wormald to k-graphs, we show that, for some range of d = d(n) and a constant c > 0, if m similar to cnd, then one can couple H-(k)(n, m) and H-(k)(n, d) so that the latter contains the former with probability tending to one as n -> infinity. In view of known results on the existence of a loose Hamilton cycle in H-(k)(n, m), we conclude that H-(k)(n, d) contains a loose Hamilton cycle when d >> log n (or just d >= C log n, if k = 3) and d = o(n(1/ 2)).", "paper_title": "Loose Hamilton Cycles in Regular Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348381100005"}
