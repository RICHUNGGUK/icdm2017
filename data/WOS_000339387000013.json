This paper presents an efficient method of active image betrayal checking based on a new type of watermarking in addition to the user-specific fingerprint. The implemented organization's watermarking, as a 'fingerprint' for a group of staffs, with a codeword length far shorter than that of the user-specific fingerprint, is extracted from a suspected image at the first stage of betrayal checking, for the purpose of reducing the number of suspected images by a great deal. Then, only the remaining suspected images are subjected to the time-consuming user-specific fingerprint checking. Experimental tests confirmed the improved efficiency of this method.", "paper_title": "Image betrayal checking based on organization's watermarking in Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000013"}
