Based on the result of surface clustering and the given texture sample, we define a global texture energy function on the point set surface for direct texture synthesis. The color texture completion is performed by minimizing a constrained global energy using the existing texture on the surface as the input texture sample. We convert the issue of context-based geometry completion into a task of texture completion on the surface. The geometric detail is then peeled and converted into a piece of signed grayscale texture on the base surface of the point set surface. We fill the holes on the base surface by smoothed extrapolation and the geometric details over these patches are reconstructed by a process of gray-scale texture completion. Experiments show that our method is flexible, efficient and easy to implement. It provides a practical texture synthesis and geometry completion tool for 3D point set surfaces.", "paper_title": "Appearance and geometry completion with constrained texture synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600003"}
