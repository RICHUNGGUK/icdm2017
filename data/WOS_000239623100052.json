Color table generalization is introduced as a means to achieve a larger independence of the lighting situation. Camera calibration is necessary to deal with the weaknesses of the new platform used in the league, the Sony Aibo ERS-7. Since the robot camera uses a rolling shutter, motion compensation is required to improve the information extracted from the camera images.", "paper_title": "Improving percept reliability in the Sony Four-Legged Robot League", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100052"}
