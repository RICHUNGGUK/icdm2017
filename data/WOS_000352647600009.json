Thus, system designers and developers consider the human characteristics at first when they think and design their system. For this consideration, user oriented learning system was introduced in education area. Especially, AEHS aims to provide learning contents that fits the individual learning style of users. That is, AEHS analyzes users' learning patterns and their learning process and according to the analyzed learning performance, the system identifies the most appropriate process for each user. But, in AEHS, it is difficult for users to choose learning contents fitted for their preference or learning ability. Also, system development process has many changes from traditional ways to new technology, ubiquitous and cloud computing. This change is to provide more convenient and efficient system process to developers and users. In this paper, we proposed AEHS considering user's characteristics in cloud computing environment. For this environment, we use the process as a service for learning system. In order to consider user's characteristics, we use a method that enables users to choose a content delivery and a difficulty level of the learning contents according to their styles such as gender, learning experience and preferences. For this process, we added the module, learning contents preference and learning difficulty preference, to user profile of AEHS.", "paper_title": "Service based AEHS for human centric learning environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000352647600009"}
