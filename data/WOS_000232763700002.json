Based on the analysis of three deficiencies of classical topic distillation algorithm HITS, this paper presents an improved model and algorithm named s-HITSc. Given a query topic, the improved algorithm can model a neighborhood graph at site granularity, compute the relevance weights of the nodes to the topic with content analysis, and apply weighted I/O operations in its iterative hyperlink analysis. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that s-HITSc can control topic drift and identify more reasonable and meaningful authority and hub sites on a given topic.", "paper_title": "s-HITSc: an improved model and algorithm for topic distillation on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000232763700002"}
