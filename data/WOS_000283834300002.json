In this paper, manifold learning method is proposed to map the gene expression data to a low dimensional space, and then explore the intrinsic structure of the features so as to classify the microarray data more accurately. The proposed algorithm can project the gene expression data into a subspace with high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Experimental results on six DNA microarray datasets demonstrated that our method is efficient for discriminant feature extraction and gene expression data classification. This work is a meaningful attempt to analyze microarray data using manifold learning method; there should be much room for the application of manifold learning to bioinformatics due to its performance.
