In this article, the previously proposed MISO control system is advanced to a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) control system through integration of a set of model-based fuzzy controllers that are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the global asymptotical stability is guaranteed and the performance on transient responses is also satisfied. The set of model-based fuzzy controllers is divided into two groups: lower level controllers and a higher level coordinator. The lower level fuzzy controllers are designed using acceleration and drift responses; while velocity information is used for the higher level controller. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an eight-story building structure employing magnetorheological (MR) dampers is studied. It is demonstrated from comparison of the uncontrolled and semi-active controlled responses that the proposed design framework is effective in vibration reduction of a building structure equipped with MR dampers.", "paper_title": "Model-Based Multi-input, Multi-output Supervisory Semi-active Nonlinear Fuzzy Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000277418200008"}
