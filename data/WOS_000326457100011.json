Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) play an important role in supporting V2V and V2I communications (also called V2X communications) in a variety of urban environments with distinct topological characteristics. In fact, obstacles such as big buildings, moving vehicles, trees, advertisement boards, traffic lights, etc. may block the radio signals in V2X communications. Their impact has been neglected in VANET research. In this paper, we present a realistic and efficient radio propagation model to handle different sizes of static and moving obstacles for V2X communications. In the proposed model, buildings and large moving vehicles are modeled as static and moving obstacles, and taken into account their impact on the packet reception rate, Line-of-sight (LOS) obstruction, and received signal power. We use unsymmetrical city map which has many dead-end roads and open faces. Each dead-end road and open faces are joined to the nearest edge making a polygon to model realistic obstacles. The simulation results of proposed model demonstrates better performance compared to some existing models, that shows proposed model can reflect more realistic simulation environments.", "paper_title": "Realistic and Efficient Radio Propagation Model for V2X Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000326457100011"}
