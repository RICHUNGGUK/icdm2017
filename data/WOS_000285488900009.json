The proposed algorithms are based on greedy heuristics suggested by several battery characteristics and Lagrange multipliers. To construct the proposed algorithms, we use the battery characteristics in the early stage of scheduling more properly. As a consequence, the proposed algorithms show superior results on synthetic examples of periodic and aperiodic tasks from the task sets which are excerpted from the comparative work, on uni- and multi-processor platforms, respectively. In particular, for some large task sets, the proposed algorithms enable previously unschedulable task sets due to battery exhaustion to be schedulable.", "paper_title": "Static Task Scheduling Algorithms Based on Greedy Heuristics for Battery-Powered DVS Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900009"}
