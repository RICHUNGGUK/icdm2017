First, we design a new algorithm, fuzzy conjugate algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA). In the algorithm, we obtain an optimal learning constant eta by GA and the experiment indicates the new algorithm always converges. Because the algorithm based on GA is a little slow in every iteration step, we propose to get the learning constant eta by quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) in place of GA to decrease time spent in every iteration step. The PFNN tuned by the proposed learning algorithm is applied to approximation realization of fuzzy inference rules, and some experiments demonstrate the whole process.
