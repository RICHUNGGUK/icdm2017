We use this framework to describe several well-known projective and non-projective dependency parsers, build correctness proofs, and establish formal relationships between them. We then use the framework to define new polynomial-time parsing algorithms for various mildly non-projective dependency formalisms, including well-nested structures with their gap degree bounded by a constant k in time O(n(5+2k)), and a new class that includes all gap degree k structures present in several natural language treebanks (which we call mildly ill-nested structures for gap degree k) in time O(n(4+3k)). Finally, we illustrate how the parsing schema framework can be applied to Link Grammar, a dependency-related formalism.", "paper_title": "Dependency Parsing Schemata and Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Parsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000294295200004"}
