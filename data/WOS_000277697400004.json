The wide-angle camera provides large but low resolution coverage and detects and tracks all moving objects in the scene. Based on the output of the wide-angle camera, the system generates spatiotemporal observation requests for each moving object, which are candidates for close-up views using PTZ cameras. Due to the fact that there are usually much more objects than the number of PTZ cameras, the system first assigns a subset of the requests/objects to each PTZ camera. The PTZ cameras then select the parameter settings that best satisfy the assigned competing requests to provide high resolution views of the moving objects. We propose an approximation algorithm to solve the request assignment and the camera parameter selection problems in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated in both simulation and physical experiment. In comparison with an existing work using simulation, it shows that in heavy traffic scenarios, our algorithm increases the number of observed objects by over 210%.", "paper_title": "Systems and algorithms for autonomous and scalable crowd surveillance using robotic PTZ cameras assisted by a wide-angle camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000277697400004"}
