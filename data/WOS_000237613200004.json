The objective is to design the almost global adaptive asymptotical controllers in probability u(0) and u(1) for the systems by using discontinuous control. A switching control law u(0) is designed to almost globally asymptotically stabilize the state x(0) in both the singular x(0) (t(0))=0 case and the non-singular x(0) (t(0))not equal 0 case. Then the state scaling technique is introduced for the discontinuous feedback into the (x(1), x(2), ..., x(n))-subsystem. Thereby, by using backstepping technique the global adaptive asymptotical control law u(1) has been presented for (x(1), x(2), ..., x(n))-subsystem for both different u(0) in non-singular x(0) (t(0))not equal 0 case and the singular case x(0) (t(0))=0. The control algorithm validity is proved by simulation.", "paper_title": "Adaptive robust control of nonholonomic systems with stochastic disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000237613200004"}
