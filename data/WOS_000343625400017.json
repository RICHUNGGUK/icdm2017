However, there is no existing literature studying how the superimposed mesh structure would influence the image registration process. We study this problem in this paper, and propose a dynamic meshing strategy to generate mesh structure for image registration. To construct such a dynamic mesh during image registration, three steps are performed. Firstly, a density field that measures the importance of a pixel/voxel's displacement to the registration process is computed. Secondly, an efficient contraction-optimization scheme is applied to compute a discrete Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation of the density field. Thirdly, the final mesh structure is constructed by its dual triangulation, with some post-processing to preserve the image boundary. In each iteration of the deformable image registration, the mesh structure is efficiently updated with GPU-based parallel implementation. We conduct experiments of the new dynamic mesh-guided registration framework on both synthetic and real medical images, and compare our results with the other state-of-the-art FEM-based image registration methods.
