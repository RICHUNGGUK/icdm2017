However, thermal IR has other limitations such as being opaque to glass. As a result, thermal IR imagery is very sensitive to facial occlusion caused by eyeglasses. Fusion of the visible and thermal IR images is an effective way to solve this problem. In this paper, using the face reconstruction information of the visible images, we propose two thermal image reconstruction algorithms, called the visible information aided eyeglasses removing algorithm (VIAER) and the refined visible information aided eyeglasses removing algorithm (refined VIAER). Experiments on publicly available data set show the excellent performance of our algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
