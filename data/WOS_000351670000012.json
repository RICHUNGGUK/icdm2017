Thus, security for the smart grid has emerged as an important issue. Recently, Hur proposed an attribute based data sharing for smart grid which unfortunately is vulnerable to the denial of service (DoS) attack. Moreover, it does not support the user revocation property and the grid system manager cannot prevent the revoked user of having access to the shared data in the storage center. For these weaknesses, we suggest an efficient revocable data sharing scheme which is immune against DoS attack. In addition, we present the security analyses and comparisons indicating the efficiency and security of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A revocable attribute based data sharing scheme resilient to DoS attacks in smart grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000351670000012"}
