In reality, the observations are truncated and grouped (rounded). This must be formally taken into account for accurate modelling, and it is shown how this leads to convenient closed-form expressions for the likelihood in this model. In a Bayesian framework, \"noninformative\" benchmark priors, which only require the choice of a single scalar prior hyperparameter, are specified. Conditions for the existence of the posterior distribution are derived when rounding and various forms of truncation are considered. The main application focus is on modelling microbiological data obtained with flow cytometry. However, the model is also applied to data often used to illustrate other skewed distributions, and it is shown that our modelling compares favourably with the popular skew-Student models. Further examples with simulated data illustrate the wide applicability of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
