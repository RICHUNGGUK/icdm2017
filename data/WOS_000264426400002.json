The proposed model is called segmentation and classification with receptive fields (SCRF) which is based on the concept of receptive fields that analyzes pieces of an image considering not only a pixel or a group of pixels, but also the relationship between them and their neighbors. In order to work with the SCRF model, we propose a new artificial neural network, called I-PyraNet, which is a hybrid implementation of the recently described PyraNet and the nonclassical receptive fields inhibition. Furthermore, the model and the neural network are combined to accomplish a satellite image segmentation task.", "paper_title": "NONCLASSICAL RECEPTIVE FIELD INHIBITION APPLIED TO IMAGE SEGMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400002"}
