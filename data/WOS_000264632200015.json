The first scheme, namely, the combined design Jointly optimizes the adaptation, CSIT (channel state information at the transmitter) feedback as well as index assignment strategies. The second scheme, namely, the decoupled design, focuses on the index assignment problem given an error-free limited feedback design. Simulation results show that the proposed framework has significant capacity gain compared to the naive design (designed assuming there is no feedback error). Furthermore, for large number of feedback bits C(fb), we show that under two-nearest constellation feedback channel assumption, the MIMO capacity loss (due to noisy feedback) of the proposed robust design scales like O(P(c)2(-)C(fb)/t+1) for some positive integer t. Hence, the penalty due to noisy limited feedback in the proposed robust design approaches zero as C(fb), increases.", "paper_title": "Robust Precoder Adaptation for MIMO Links With Noisy Limited Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200015"}
