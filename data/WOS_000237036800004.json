We present a set of functions that bring together previous approaches and allow us to locate the work that has been developed to enhance these systems concerning those functions. We describe some new proposals, based on experimental research work, for improving some of these functions so that they can be taken into account in the development of design support systems to help the designer or group of designers reach a suitable solution in a more effective way.
