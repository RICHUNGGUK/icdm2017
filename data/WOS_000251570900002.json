The result is an extension of concepts in neural systems towards phenomenal intentionality: the lack of which is a common starting point for critiques of AI. Here the argument is developed at four interacting grain levels of description and the associated analysis. The visual domain is highlighted due to its dominance in discussions involving inner mental states. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
