An unsolved problem in [19] is whether S(n)(3, n - 3) or C(n)(n - 5) has the third maximal Laplacian Estrada index among all trees on n vertices, where S(n)(3, n - 3) is the double tree formed by adding an edge between the centers of the stars S(3) and S(n-3) and C(n)(n - 5) is the tree formed by attaching n - 5 pendent vertices to the center of a path P(5). In this paper, we partially answer this problem, and prove that LEE(S(n)(3, n - 3)) > LEE(C(n)(n - 5)) and C(n)(n - 5) cannot have the third maximal Laplacian Estrada index among all trees on n vertices.", "paper_title": "A note on the Laplacian Estrada index of trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500017"}
