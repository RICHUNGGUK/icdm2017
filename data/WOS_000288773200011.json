The proposed WGP evolves on genetic programming (GP), an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology that employs a binary tree topology and optimized functional operators. Weight coefficients were introduced to each GP linkage in the tree in order to create a new weighted genetic programming (WGP) approach. The proposed WGP offers two distinct advantages, including: (1) a balance of influences is struck between the two front input branches and (2) weights are incorporated throughout generated formulas. Resulting formulas contain a certain quantity of optimized functions and weights. Genetic algorithms are employed to accomplish WGP optimization of function selection and proper weighting tasks. Case studies herein focused on a reference study of squat wall strength. Results demonstrated that the proposed WGP provides accurate results and formula outputs. This paper further utilized WGP to tune referenced formulas, which yielded a final formula that combined the positive attributes of both WGP and analytical models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
