Let C be a binary [n, k] linear code with parity-check matrix H, where the rows of H may be dependent. A stopping set S of C with parity-check matrix H is a subset of column indices of H such that the restriction of H to S does not contain a row of weight one. The stopping set distribution {T(i)(H)}(i=0)(n) enumerates the number of stopping sets with size i of C with parity-check matrix H. Note that stopping sets and stopping set distribution are related to the parity-check matrix H of. Let H* be the parity-check matrix of which is formed by all the nonzero codewords of its dual code C. A parity-check matrix H is called BEC-optimal if T(i)(H) = T(i)(H*), i = 0, 1, ... , n and H has the smallest number of rows. In this paper, we study stopping sets, stopping set distributions and BEC-optimal parity-check matrices of binary linear codes. Using finite geometry in combinatorics, we obtain BEC-optimal parity-check matrices and then determine the stopping set distributions for the Simplex codes, the Hamming codes, the first order Reed-Muller codes, and the extended Hamming codes, which are some Reed-Muller codes or their shortening or puncturing versions.", "paper_title": "Stopping Set Distributions of Some Reed-Muller Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800037"}
