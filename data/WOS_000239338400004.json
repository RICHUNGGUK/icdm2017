In contrast with the discrete-time case the generalization is no longer straightforward. A discrete-time transformation will therefore be developed first. Next, results from Part I can be adopted. The conditions, the technicalities and the results will be studied in detail for a reliability application that initiated the research. This concerns a reliability network with dependent components that can breakdown. A secure analytic performance bound is obtained.", "paper_title": "Monotonicity and comparison results for nonnegative dynamic systems - Part II: Continuous-time case", "paper_id": "WOS:000239338400004"}
