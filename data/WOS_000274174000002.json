Entity matching frameworks provide several methods and their combination to effectively solve different match tasks. In this paper, we comparatively analyze 11 proposed frameworks for entity matching. Our study considers both frameworks which do or do not utilize training data to semiautomatically find an entity matching strategy to solve a given match task. Moreover, we consider support for blocking and the combination of different match algorithms. We further study how the different frameworks have been evaluated. The study aims at exploring the current state of the art in research prototypes of entity matching frameworks and their evaluations. The proposed criteria should be helpful to identify promising framework approaches and enable categorizing and comparatively assessing additional entity matching frameworks and their evaluations.
