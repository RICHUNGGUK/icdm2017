The results show that -NO2 or -NH2 is an effective substituent for increasing the gas-phase HOFs of the title compounds, especially -NO2 group. As the numbers of substitutents increase, their HOFs enhance obviously. Increasing the length of original chain is helpful for improving their HOFs. The substitution of -NO2 is useful for enhancing their detonation performances and the effects of the length of original chains on detonation properties are coupled with those of the substituents. An analysis of the BDE of the weakest bonds indicates that the substitution of the -NH2 groups and replacing the -NO2 groups of N-NO2 by the -NH2 groups are favorable for improving their thermal stability, while the substitution of -NO2 and increasing the length of original chain decrease their thermal stability. Considering the detonation performance and thermal stability, seven compounds may be considered as the potential candidates of high energy density compounds.", "paper_title": "Theoretical design of energetic nitrogen-rich derivatives of 1,7-diamino-1,7-dinitrimino-2,4,6-trinitro-2,4,6-triazaheptane", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600003"}
