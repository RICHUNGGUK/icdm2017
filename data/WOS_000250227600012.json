This article presents automated systemlevel design techniques for application development on such architectures. We propose integer linear programming formulations and heuristic techniques for process allocation and data mapping on SMP and block-multithreading-based network processors. The techniques incorporate process transformations and multithreading-aware data mapping to maximize the throughput of the application. The article presents experimental results that evaluate the techniques by implementing network processing applications on the Intel IXP 2400 architecture.", "paper_title": "ILP and heuristic techniques for system-level design on network processor architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000250227600012"}
