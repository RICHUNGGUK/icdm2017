A vertex analysis approach is proposed for solving multiple fuzzy sets in the MFSP model. Solutions under a set of alpha-cut levels can be generated by solving a series of deterministic submodels. The developed method is applied to the planning of a case study for water-resources management. Dynamics and uncertainties of water availability (and thus water allocation and shortage) could be taken into account through generation of a set of representative scenarios within a multistage context. Moreover, penalties are exercised with recourse against any infeasibility, which permits in-depth analyses of various policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic consequences when the promised water-allocation targets are violated. The modeling results can help to generate a range of alternatives under various system conditions, and thus help decision makers to identify desired water-resources management policies under uncertainty.
