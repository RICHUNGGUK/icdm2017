However, its real-time implementation suffers from long latency, heavy computation, and high memory storage because of its frame level computation with iterated Gaussian blur operations. Thus, this paper proposes a layer parallel SIFT (LPSIFT) with integral image, and its parallel hardware design with an on-the-fly feature extraction flow for real-time application needs. Compared with the original SIFT algorithm, the proposed approach reduces the computational amount by 90% and memory usage by 95%. The final implementation uses 580-K gate count with 90-nm CMOS technology, and offers 6000 feature points/frame for VGA images at 30 frames/s and similar to 2000 feature points/frame for 1920x1080 images at 30 frames/s at the clock rate of 100 MHz.", "paper_title": "Fast SIFT Design for Real-Time Visual Feature Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600020"}
