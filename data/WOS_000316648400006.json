We exhibit new results in the theory of border polynomials of parametric semi-algebraic systems: in particular a geometric characterization of its \"true boundary\" (Definition 1). In order to optimize the corresponding decomposition algorithms, we also propose a technique, that we call relaxation, which can simplify the decomposition process and reduce the number of components in the output.
