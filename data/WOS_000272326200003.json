Based on this system model and the basic concepts, we propose two Opportunistic channel selection algorithms to optimize the throughput of the secondary user: minimum collision rate channel selection algorithm and minimum handoff rate channel selection algorithm. According to the two algorithms, we, respectively, present the channel selection scheme based on minimum collision rate algorithm (CSS-MCRA) and the channel selection scheme based on minimum handoff rate algorithm (CSS-MHRA) under the constraint that the collision probability is bounded below collision tolerable level. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both show that, on one hand, both CSS-MCRA scheme and CSS-MHRA can follow the constraint of collision tolerable level; on the other hand, the performance of CSS-MCRA scheme is better than that of CSS-MHRA scheme if handoff latency is zero or very low, while the performance of CSS-MHRA scheme is better than that of CSS-MCRA scheme if handoff latency is long enough.
