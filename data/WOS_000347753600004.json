The new proposed technique combines the properties of predictive coding and discrete wavelet coding. In contrast to JPEG2000, the image data values are pre-processed using predictive coding to remove interpixel redundancy. The error values, which are the difference between the original and the predicted values, are discrete wavelet coding transformed. In this case, a nonlinear neural network predictor is utilised in the predictive coding system. The simulation results indicated that the proposed technique can achieve good compressed images at high decomposition levels in comparison to JPEG2000. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
