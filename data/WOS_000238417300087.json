The Agent performs I/O access according to the mapped address. High network latency, poor performance and low scalability are the main problems of this method. This article introduces an improved design and implementation of an out-of-band virtualization system, in which each Agent maintains a copy of the metadata and performs the address mapping by itself, so as to improve performance, reliability and scalability. This article discusses the on-line extension of a logical volume and the related problems such as synchronization. This function improves the ability of uninterrupted service. The system was tested on the UFS of Solaris 10 and the results showed that the performance of a stripe volume consisting of four disks exceeded that of a linear volume by an average of 103.65%.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of an out-of-band virtualization system on Solaris 10", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300087"}
