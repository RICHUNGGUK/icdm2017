The proposed algorithm requires minimal user intervention at the end diastolic frame of the image sequence for specifying the candidate points of the contour. The region of interest is identified by fitting an ellipse in the region defined by the specified points. Subsequently, the ellipse centre is used for originating the radial lines for filtering. A weighted radial edge filter is employed for the detection of edge points. The outliers are corrected by global as well as local statistics. Dropout regions are recovered by incorporating the important temporal information from the previous frame by means of recursive least squares adaptive filter. This ensures fairly accurate segmentation of the cardiac structures for further determination of the functional cardiac parameters. The proposed algorithm was applied to 10 data-sets over a full cardiac cycle and the results were validated by comparing computer-generated boundaries to those manually outlined by two experts using Hausdorff distance (HD) measure, radial mean square error (rmse) and contour similarity index. The rmse was 1.83 mm with a HD of 5.12 +/- 1.21 mm. We have also compared our results with two existing approaches, level set and optical flow. The results indicate an improvement when compared with ground truth due to incorporation of temporal clues. The weighted radial edge filtering algorithm in conjunction with adaptive dropout recovery offers semi-automatic segmentation of heart chambers in 2D echocardiography sequences for accurate assessment of global left ventricular function to guide therapy and staging of the cardiovascular diseases.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of left ventricle in short-axis echocardiographic sequences by weighted radial edge filtering and adaptive recovery of dropout regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433600003"}
