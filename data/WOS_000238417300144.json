The objective of games networks is to provide a theoretical framework which suits to modular dynamics resulting from different local interactions between various agents and which enables us to describe complex system in a modular way. Games networks describes situations where an agent can be involved in several different games, with several different other agents, at the same time. In particular, we focus on the determination of global equilibria, resulting from the composition of local equilibria for each game of the network. However, several games networks can represent the same dynamics. We define the notion of dependence between agents, which allows us to compute a games network normal form. This normal form emphasizes the elementary modules which compose the games network.", "paper_title": "Elementary modules in games networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300144"}
