MotifSuite, a user-friendly web interface streamlines this analysis flow. Its core consists of two post-processing procedures that allow prioritizing the motif detection output. The tools offered by MotifSuite are built around the well-established motif detection tool MotifSampler and can also be used in combination with any other probabilistic motif detection tool. Elaborate guidelines on each of its applications have been provided.", "paper_title": "MotifSuite: workflow for probabilistic motif detection and assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000306136100022"}
