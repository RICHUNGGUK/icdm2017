The frequency response of the waveguide is analyzed using a modal technique. The results show that when at least one of the dielectrics is a DNG material the cutoff frequency of the waveguide is much more lower than the cutoff frequency of the DPS loaded or the empty waveguide. This interesting property means that very low frequency signals could be guided by structures that have very small size. Properties of composite right- and left-handed wave propagation are also observed as well as the characteristic stop-band between the frequency regions in which RH and LH wave propagation occurs.", "paper_title": "Modal analysis of the microwave frequency response and composite right-/left-handed operation of a rectangular waveguide loaded with double positive and double negative materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000248241600007"}
