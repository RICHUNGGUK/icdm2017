In this paper, we propose an enhanced algorithm called Node Label Order First (NLOF), which can maintain asymmetrical information and guarantee availability of the compressed topology. Besides, a decoding algorithm to restore the compressed topology named Average Proportional point (AP) is also proposed, which not only retains the space complexity of the aggregation process but also improves the accuracy of the restored information. Simulation results show that combing NLOF with AP can balance the contradiction between space complexity of the aggregation algorithm and routing accuracy.", "paper_title": "Topology aggregation and decoding algorithms based on a minimum spanning tree in asymmetric multi-domain optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286471800005"}
