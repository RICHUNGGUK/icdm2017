As well as it being easily identified by humans, its analysis process demands a high level of sophistication and computer complexity. This paper presents a novel approach for texture analysis, based on analyzing the complexity of the surface generated from a texture, in order to describe and characterize it. The proposed method produces a texture signature which is able to efficiently characterize different texture classes. The paper also illustrates a novel method performance on an experiment using texture images of leaves. Leaf identification is a difficult and complex task due to the nature of plants, which presents a huge pattern variation. The high classification rate yielded shows the potential of the method, improving on traditional texture techniques, such as Gabor filters and Fourier analysis.", "paper_title": "PLANT LEAF IDENTIFICATION BASED ON VOLUMETRIC FRACTAL DIMENSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776400005"}
