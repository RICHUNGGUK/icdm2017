Design/methodology/approach - From a CAD software 3D representation of the model, including the electric wiring and considering the current in the electrical circuits, the software evaluates the magnetic field intensity for power-line frequencies at different heights. Findings - Two application examples are presented consisting of a cabling layout in a lab room with three phase illumination and power socket circuits and a computer room above a power transformer room. The results were compared with measured values showing a good agreement between them. Originality/value - Shows that with this software it is possible to anticipate areas where magnetic field values might reach abnormally high values and to analyze alternative wiring layouts in order to keep the magnetic field values as low as possible.", "paper_title": "EasyMAG - magnetic field toolbox calculator for electrical installation project", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900026"}
