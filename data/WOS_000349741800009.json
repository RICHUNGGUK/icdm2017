For both problems, we study natural parameterizations and classify them with the tools provided by Parameterized Complexity. Somewhat surprisingly, in both cases, rather simple FPT algorithms can be shown to be optimal, mostly assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
