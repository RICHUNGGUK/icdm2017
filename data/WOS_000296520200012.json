The resulting family of polynomials carries combinatorial information on a class of independence systems defined over the vertex set of a finite graph. Specifically, we offer a recursion formula and examples of the co-2-plex polynomial on certain graphs. In addition, we characterize the class of graphs whose co-2-plex polynomial will have all real roots.", "paper_title": "Co-2-plex polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200012"}
