The density of a path P = (v(1), v(2).....v(k)) is defined as Sigma(k)(i=1) val(i)/Sigma(k)(i=1)w(i). The weight of P, denoted by w(P), is Sigma(k)(i=1)w(i). Given a tree of n nodes, two integers w(min) and w(max), and a length lower bound L, we present a pseudo-polynomial O(w(max)nL)-time algorithm to find a maximum-density path P in T such that W-min <= w(P) <= w(max) and the length of P is at least L.
