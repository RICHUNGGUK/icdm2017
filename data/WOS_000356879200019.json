Static read circuits and memory cells with nonminimum channel length are introduced to improve the ultralow-voltage performance. The chip of this register file is fabricated in 65-nm LP CMOS process and occupies the area of 0.019 mm(2). Test results show that the minimum operation voltage is 320 mV with its corresponding max frequency 110 KHz. The minimum energy consumption is 0.94 pJ/cycle at the point of 400 mV, 850 KHz, corresponding to 0.15 fJ/port/bit/cycle after normalization. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, it improves energy efficiency by 25% and saves the area by 58.7%.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of Highly Energy/Area-Efficient Multiported Register Files With Read Word-Line Sharing Strategy in 65-nm CMOS Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000356879200019"}
