Outliers are observations expressed by sets of literals that feature unexpected properties. These observations are not explicitly provided in input (as it happens with abduction) but, rather, they are hidden in the given knowledge base. Unfortunately, in the two related formalisms for specifying defaults - Reiter's default logic and extended disjunctive logic programs - the most general outlier detection problems turn out to lie at the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. In this note, we analyze the complexity of outlier detection for two very simple classes of default theories, namely NU and DNU, for which the entailment problem is solvable in polynomial time. We show that, for these classes, checking for the existence of an outlier is anyway intractable. This result contributes to further showing the inherent intractability of outlier detection in default reasoning. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
