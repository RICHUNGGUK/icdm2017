In this article we give an explicit upper bound of the difference |k(P) - k(d)(P)| between the curvature k(P) at P of the curve and the discrete curvature in terms of the polygonal line's data, the supremums over Gamma of the curvature function k and its derivative k', and a new geometrical invariant, the return factor Omega(Gamma). One consequence of this upper bound is that it is not needed to know precisely which curve is passing through the vertices of the polygonal line P to have a pointwise information on its curvature.
