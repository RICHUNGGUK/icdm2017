Scale space extrema on shape index images and texture images are detected and matched, through which resolution and noise insensitive face matching is achieved without complex preprocessing and normalization. An outlier removal strategy is designed to eliminate incorrect matching points while keeping relevant ones. Six different scale invariant similarity measures are proposed and fused at the score level, which increases the robustness against expression variations. Systematical experiments are conducted on the FRGC v2.0 database, achieving in the neutral vs. all experiment a verification rate of 90.7% with un-normalized similarity scores, and 96.3% with normalized similarity scores at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.1%, and 96.2% rank-1 identification rate, which are comparable to the state of the art, and promising considering the significantly reduced preprocessing requirement.
