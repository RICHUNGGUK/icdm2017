By taking discrete Fourier transform of the sensor outputs, time delay estimation corresponds to finding the frequency of a noisy sinusoid with time-varying amplitude. The generalized weighted linear predictor is utilized to estimate the time delay and it is shown that its estimation accuracy attains Cramer-Rao lower bound.", "paper_title": "Time Delay Estimator Based on Frequency Estimation Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100030"}
