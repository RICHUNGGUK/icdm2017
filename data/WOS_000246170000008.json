For n <= t <= 2(n-1), an (n, t)-antipodal Gray code is a Gray code in which the complement of any string appears t steps away from the string, clockwise or counterclockwise. Killian and Savage proved that an (n, n)-antipodal Gray code exists when n is a power of 2 or n = 3, and does not exist for n = 6 or odd n > 3. Motivated by these results, we prove that for odd n >= 3, an (n, t)-antipodal Gray code exists if and only if t = 2(n-1) - 1. For even n, we establish two recursive constructions for (n, t) codes from smaller (n', t'). Consequently, various (n, t)-antipodal Gray codes are found for even n's. Examples are for t = 2(n-1) - 2(k) with k odd and 1 <= k <= n - 3 when n >= 4, for t = 2(n-k) when n >= 2k with 1 <= k <= 3, for t = n when n = 2(k) >= 2 (an alternative proof for Killian and Savage's result) ...etc. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
