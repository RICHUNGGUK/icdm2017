How to effectively improve the road capacity is becoming the key problem in the research of traffic flow. As the core part of the next generation intelligent transportation systems, the feedback strategy has attracted much attention. In recent years, researchers have proposed many effective strategies. In this paper, a strategy called speed of last vehicle feedback strategy is introduced, and simulated in a two-route scenario with one exit. Result shows that compared with other strategies, this strategy has certain advantages on average flux - a criteria describing traffic capacity of traffic systems. More importantly, the implementation of this strategy is very simple.", "paper_title": "SPEED OF LAST VEHICLE FEEDBACK STRATEGY IN INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293854100007"}
