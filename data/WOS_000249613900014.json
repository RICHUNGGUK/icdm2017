Color images that are corrupted with impulse noise are generally filtered by applying a grayscale algorithm on each color component separately or using a vector-based approach where each pixel is considered as a single vector. The first approach causes artefacts especially on edge and texture pixels. Vector-based methods were successfully introduced to overcome this problem. Nevertheless, they tend to cluster the noise and to receive a lower noise reduction performance. In this paper, we discuss an alternative technique which gives a good noise reduction performance while much less artefacts are introduced. The main difference between the proposed method and other classical noise reduction methods is that the color information is taken into account to develop 1) a better impulse noise detection method and 2) a noise reduction method that filters only the corrupted pixels while preserving the color and the edge sharpness. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a significant improvement on other existing filters.", "paper_title": "A new fuzzy color correlated impulse noise reduction method", "paper_id": "WOS:000249613900014"}
