This paper presents a new method for music style classification with a novel Bayesian-inference-based decision tree (BDT) model. A database of total 320 music staffs collected from CDs and the Internet is used for the experiment. For classification three features including the number of sharp octave (NSO), the number of simple meters (NSM), and the music playing speed (MPS) are extracted. Following that, a comparative evaluation between BDT and traditional decision tree (DT) model is carried out on the database. The results show that the classification accuracy rate of BDT far superior to existing DT model.", "paper_title": "Music style classification with a novel Bayesian model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200016"}
