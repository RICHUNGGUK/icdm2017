The method detects critical numerical fluxes which may lead to negative density and pressure, and for such critical fluxes imposes a simple flux limiter by combining the high-order numerical flux with the first-order Lax-Friedrichs flux to satisfy a sufficient condition for preserving positivity. Though an extra time-step size condition is required to maintain the formal order of accuracy, it is less restrictive than those in previous works. A number of numerical examples suggest that this method, when applied on an essentially non-oscillatory scheme, can be used to prevent positivity failure when the flow involves vacuum or near vacuum and very strong discontinuities.
