The analysis of this model allows to address questions like equivalence of puzzles, difficulty of tasks and optimality of solutions using topological, metric and symmetry properties of the corresponding graphs. The mathematical model serves as a base for a computer program to administer tower puzzles in a variety of psychological test situations. It is suitable for bedside use and is equipped with numerous devices for post-processing of recorded data. Among these features is the graphical representation of the projection of the path taken by a test person onto the state graph. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
