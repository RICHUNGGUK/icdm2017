The equations are Laplace transformed, and the nonlinear terms are represented by He's polynomials. The solutions are obtained in the form of rapidly convergent series with elegantly computable terms. This approach, in contrast to classical perturbation techniques, is valid even for systems without any small/large parameters and therefore can be applied more widely than traditional perturbation techniques, especially when there do not exist any small/large quantities. A good agreement of the novel method solution with the existing solutions is presented graphically and in tabulated forms to study the efficiency and accuracy of IHPTM. This study demonstrates the general validity and the great potential of the IHPTM for solving strongly nonlinear problems.", "paper_title": "An efficient iterated method for mathematical biology model", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200013"}
