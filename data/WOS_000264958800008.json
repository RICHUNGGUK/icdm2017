Many of the decisions depend on the patient's preferences. Shared decision-making, which explicitly involves tire patients and their preferences, is therefore imperative, but requires also a Sufficient explanatory infrastructure. We introduce a distributed application, PANDEX, that, by Using decision-analytic methods, assists patients and care providers to reach optimal decisions. Based on a generic architecture, the PANDEX prototype, which focuses on the domain of genetic prenatal consultation, is designed to calculate the optimal treatment strategy based on the patient's clinical data and preferences. A major focus of Our study was on developing several types of in-depth sensitivity and importance analysis methods and on the implementation of the respective graphical tools embedded in the system, to help the patient fully understand the recommended strategy. A preliminary assessment of PANDEX by six genetic Consultants demonstrated a relative unwillingness to work with PANDEX (mean = 2.16 +/- 0.98 (SD), on a scale of 1-5), but a tendency to agree with its recommended strategies (mean = 3.48 +/- 1.4) and with its capability to provide insights into the recommended strategies (3.28 +/- 1.23). PANDEX was considered by the Consultants to be a potentially useful tool for patients. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
