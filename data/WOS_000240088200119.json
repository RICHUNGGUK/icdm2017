In this paper, we present our RTRC system that has good classification accuracy when concept drifts and enough samples are scanned in data stream. By using Markov chain and least-square method, the system is able to predict not only on which the next concept is but also on when the concept is to drift. Experimental results confirm the advantages of our system over Weighted Bagging and CVFDT, two representative systems in streaming data mining.", "paper_title": "Improving the performance of data stream classifiers by mining recurring contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200119"}
