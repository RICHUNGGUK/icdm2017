The proposed MITS algorithm exhibits several distinguishing features, such as integrating an Iterated Tabu Search (ITS) algorithm with a multistart method and a problem specific perturbation operator. Tested on two sets of 66 public benchmark instances widely used in the literature, the MITS algorithm achieves highly competitive results compared with the best performing algorithms, improving the previous best known results for 22 instances while matching the previous best known results for 39 ones. Furthermore, two important features of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
