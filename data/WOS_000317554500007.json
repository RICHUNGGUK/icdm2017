The visual psychophysics literature has demonstrated the importance of interdependence among parts of the scene. Yet, the majority of methods in scene understanding remain local. Pictorial structures have arisen as a fundamental parts-based model for some vision problems, such as articulated object detection. However, the form of classical pictorial structures limits their applicability for global problems, such as semantic pixel labeling. In this paper, we propose an extension of the pictorial structures approach, called pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures, or PS3, to overcome this limitation. Our model extends the classical form in two ways: first, it defines parts directly based on pixel-support rather than in a parametric form, and second, it specifies a space of plausible parts-based scene models and permits one to be used for inference on any given image. PS3 makes strides toward unifying object-level and pixel-level modeling of scene elements. In this paper, we implement the first half of our model and rely upon external knowledge to provide an initial graph structure for a given image. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of this new parts-based view of scene modeling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
