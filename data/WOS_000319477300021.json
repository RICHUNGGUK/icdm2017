Recent research into efficiently compressing sequence data has focused largely on improving compression ratios. Yet, the throughputs of current methods now lag far behind the I/O bandwidths of modern storage systems. As biologists move their analyses to high-performance systems with greater I/O bandwidth, low-throughput compression becomes a limiting factor. To address this gap, we present a new storage model called SeqDB, which offers high-throughput compression of sequence data with minimal sacrifice in compression ratio. It achieves this by combining the existing multithreaded Blosc compressor with a new data-parallel byte-packing scheme, called SeqPack, which interleaves sequence data and quality scores.", "paper_title": "High-Throughput Compression of FASTQ Data with SeqDB", "paper_id": "WOS:000319477300021"}
