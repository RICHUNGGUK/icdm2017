This paper briefs a number of applications of a new evolutionary optimization algorithm, first presented by N. Shafiabady and M. Teshnehlab (referred hereinafter as \"S.T.\" algorithm), which is efficient and quick in comparison with other popular conventional algorithms. The optimal solutions to a problem via S. T. algorithm, are found remarkably fast due to that the said algorithm is appropriate for online applications in compare with other conventional algorithms.", "paper_title": "SOME APPLICATIONS OF ST (SHAFIABADY-TESHNEHLAB) EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100020"}
