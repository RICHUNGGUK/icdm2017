In this paper the sustainable supplier selection criteria and sub-criteria are determined and based on those criteria and sub-criteria a methodology is proposed onto evaluation and ranking of a given set of suppliers. In the evaluation process, decision makers' opinions on the importance of deciding the criteria and sub-criteria, in addition to their preference of the suppliers' performance with respect to sub-criteria are considered in linguistic terms. To handle the subjectivity of decision makers' assessments, fuzzy logic has been applied and a new ranking method on the basis of fuzzy inference system (FIS) is proposed for supplier selection problem. Finally, an illustrative example is utilized to show the feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
