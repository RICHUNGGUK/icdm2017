This paper describes the use of a modified GA as an optimization method in structural engineering for minimizing the production costs of slabs using precast prestressed concrete joists. The work initially identifies and describes the multiple costs involved in the production of these slabs and then combines them into a function subjected to 28 equality and inequality constraints. The experiments conducted address the minimization of this function using GA, where constraints are treated using a penalty technique. In addition, results obtained with a conventional optimization method are presented, for comparison. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
