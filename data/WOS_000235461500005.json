Currently, interactions cannot be reliably predicted on a proteome-wide scale but direct and indirect evidence for interactions is increasingly available from high-throughput interaction detection methods, gene expression microarrays, and protein annotation projects. In this paper we propose an association mining approach to integrating these diverse types of evidence. We apply this approach to a number of datasets consisting of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs annotated with different types of evidence. We identify patterns that distinguish interacting and non-interacting protein pairs, and use these patterns to assign a confidence level to proposed interactions.", "paper_title": "Predicting protein-protein interactions by association mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000235461500005"}
