An important application is the case of umbilical cables used in remotely operated vehicles. The primary basis for the formulation is to assume that the continuous flexibility is represented by a discrete approach, consisting of rigid links connected by elastic joints, allowing movement in three dimensions. Each elastic joint allows three independent movements, called elevation, azimuth and torsion (twist). A significant contribution of the proposed formalism is the development of a compact equation that allows obtaining the Lagrangian of the system directly and automatically, regardless of the number of links chosen to form a chain of rigid bodies connected by flexible joints to represent the continuous flexibility of the cable. This formulation allows the construction of an algorithm for obtaining the equations of the dynamic model of flexible cables.", "paper_title": "A new formalism for the dynamic modelling of cables", "paper_id": "WOS:000317658200005"}
