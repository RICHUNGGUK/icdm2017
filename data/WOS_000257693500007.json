In this study, we propose a method to measure deformation fields of biological tissues based on local feature tracking. First, we use correlation score (cs) based method to obtain a candidate matches set. Secondly, relaxation technique is used to disambiguate matches. Next, the dense deformation fields is calculated using linear interpolation approach within Delaunay triangles net. To test the validity of our approach, we apply the proposed approach to MR images of a volunteer's calf. Moreover, the reverse movement of selected check points is used to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the results. Preliminary experiment results of this paper reveal that the proposed approach is effective.", "paper_title": "A feature matching-based approach to deformation fields measurement from MR images of non-rigid object", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500007"}
