Hastily formed networks can provide communication services in an ad hoc manner. These networks are challenging due to the chaotic context where intermittent connection is the norm and the identity and number of participants cannot be assumed. In such environments malicious actors may try to disrupt the communications to create more chaos for their own benefit. This paper proposes a general security framework for monitoring and reacting to disruptive attacks. It includes a collection of functions to detect anomalies, diagnose them, and perform mitigation. The measures are deployed in each node in a fully distributed fashion, but their collective impact is a significant resilience to attacks, so that the actors can disseminate information under adverse conditions. The approach has been evaluated in the context of a simulated disaster area network with a manycast dissemination protocol, Random Walk Gossip, with a store-and-forward mechanism. A challenging threat model where adversaries may attempt to reduce message dissemination or drain network resources without spending much of their own energy has been adopted.", "paper_title": "Surviving Attacks in Challenged Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308754300011"}
