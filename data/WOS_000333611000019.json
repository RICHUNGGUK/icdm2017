Compared to the conventional setup, this integrated circuit offers potential merits such as higher cost effectiveness, smaller dimensions, lower voltage and power requirements, and better circuit integration. It was designed and fabricated in an optically-enhanced Austriamicrosystems 0.35 mu m CMOS process technology. Results from simulations and experiments have shown that the solid-state detector can operate with a maximum transimpedance gain of 170 dBa\"broken vertical bar and minimum bandwidth of 3.6 MHz. It can detect signals with optical power as low as 10 nW while giving a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of 24 dB regardless of gain configuration.", "paper_title": "An integrated solid-state solution for secondary electron detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000019"}
