Cryptographic circuit specifications are first refined and then mapped to a secure power-balanced library consisting of novel mixed 1-of-2 and 1-of-4 components based on N-nary logic. Logic optimisation tools are then applied to generate secure synchronous circuits for layout generation. The circuits generated are more efficient than balanced circuits generated by alternative techniques. A new method is presented for evaluating the security of such circuits. A security metric is introduced, which is based on the common selection function that is widely used in differential power analysis (DPA) attacks and a correlation measure similar to the one used in correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks. The metric enables the construction of a library of robust cryptograhic components including S-boxes that are more resistant to attack.", "paper_title": "Design and security evaluation of balanced 1-of-n circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000301335600007"}
