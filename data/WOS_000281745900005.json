The integration of simulations has been addressed by some agent oriented methodologies, generally defining mappings from the original Multi-Agent specification to concrete simulators like Repast or Sesame. This paper contributes with a deeper integration where the methodology becomes a generator of ad hoc simulators for the MAS under development. This is possible with the aid of Model Driven Engineering principles which derives executable Multi-Agent Systems automatically from a Multi-Agent System specification. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
