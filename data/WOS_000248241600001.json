These models can predict the wideband self-resonance characteristics in the air gap regions. Also, it is pointed out that the Heinrich's equation is applicable to compute the per-unit-length parameters of the uniform FGCPWs, though it was rarely used in the past 10 years. It is shown that Heinrich's equation can be used to capture the frequency-de pendent distributed resistance and inductance in a real chip environment. Using our proposed models with Heinrich's equation, numerical calculations are performed to show the effects of metallization surface conductivity and thickness of both capacitive and inductive series-connected FGCPW geometries on their frequency-dependent series resistances, series inductances and shunt capacitances.", "paper_title": "Wideband description of the finite-ground coplanar waveauide-type structures with discontinuities", "paper_id": "WOS:000248241600001"}
