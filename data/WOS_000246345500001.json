Because of the conflict between resolution and tracking range, however, single-view tracking is not robust and accurate. This paper presents a distributed multi-view tracking system using collaborative signal processing (CSP) in distributed wireless sensor networks (DWSNs). In the proposed tracking system, target detection and classification algorithms are based on single-node processing and target tracking is performed in sink node, whereas target localization algorithm is carried out by CSP between multisensor. For conquering the disadvantages of clien/server based centralized data fusion, a progressive distributed data fusion are proposed. Finally, an indoor target tracking experiment is illustrated, and then tracking performance, execution time and energy consumption of progressive distributed data fusion are compared with client/server based centralized data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the CSP based distributed multi-view tracking system in DWSNs can accomplish multi-target extraction, classification, localization, tracking and association quickly and accurately with little congestion, energy consumption and execution time.
