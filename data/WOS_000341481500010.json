In the model the masonry is discretized as an assemblage of rigid blocks, which interact via no-tension contact surfaces with Coulomb friction. A concave contact formulation is adopted and an iterative solution procedure is used to allow the underlying non-associative friction problem to be solved. Second order cone programming (SOCP) is used to allow direct modelling of the conic failure surface. The formulation is validated against various numerical benchmark problems and then successfully applied to masonry walls and a small-scale masonry building tested experimentally.
