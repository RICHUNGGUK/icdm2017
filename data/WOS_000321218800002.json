While there is evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that olfactory cues help users in information recall tasks, there is a lack of work when the targeted information is one contained in a multimedia presentation, which is precisely the focus of this article. Accordingly, we present the results of two experimental studies. The first study measured the impact of olfactory media variation on the user's ability to perceive, synthesize, and analyze the informational content of olfactory-enhanced multimedia videos; the second study measured the impact of information content, and an information recall task in respect of user perception of the relevance, sense of reality, and acceptability of the olfactory media content, as well as the overall enjoyment of the experience. Results show that the use of olfactory media content, both pleasant and unpleasant, in multimedia displays does not significantly impact on information assimilation in a negative way. Moreover, the addition of a performance task may enhance the user's understanding of the correlation between the characteristic odor(s) and the scenario under consideration, as well as enable users to consciously learn the odors.", "paper_title": "Information Recall Task Impact in Olfaction-Enhanced Multimedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000321218800002"}
