We improve on this result by decreasing the bound to O(dgn), and also prove that our result is tight within a constant factor. Our proof is constructive and yields an algorithm with time complexity O(dgn). As a consequence of our main result, we show a relation between the planar crossing number and the surface crossing number.", "paper_title": "Planar Crossing Numbers of Graphs of Bounded Genus", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400007"}
