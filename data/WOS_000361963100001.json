The aim of the paper is to outline a systematic approach of developing a CIM model (domain model, precisely) on the basis of a selected domain ontology. There are presented some hints how ontology concepts can be expressed in domain model. Elaborated example realizes some difficulties in proposed approach, e.g. the domain knowledge is spread over many ontologies, some facts are defined at very general level (their interpretation is more difficult), ontology may contain many irrelevant elements. Nevertheless, we are believed that applying ontology in conscious way can help to achieve higher compliance of the domain model with the application domain.", "paper_title": "DOMAIN MODELING IN THE CONTEXT OF ONTOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000361963100001"}
