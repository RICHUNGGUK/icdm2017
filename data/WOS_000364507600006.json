By using the \"tolerance approach\" and the fuzzy set theory, we also show that solving the fuzzy mathematical program problem with fuzzy implicit variational inequality constraints is equivalent to solving a fuzzy implicit complementarity constrained optimization problem, and the fuzzy implicit complementarity constrained optimization problem can be converted to a regular nonlinear parametric programming problem. Further, a new smoothing approach based on a version of the \"method of centres\" with entropic regularization for solving the resulting optimization problem and our main results are presented and a numerical example is provided to illustrate our main results applying quasi-Newton line search of MATLAB software.", "paper_title": "Solving implicit mathematical programs with fuzzy variational inequality constraints based on the method of centres with entropic regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000364507600006"}
