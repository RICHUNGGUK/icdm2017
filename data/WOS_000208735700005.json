These MCLs rely on characteristics such as pneumatic parameters to create pressure and flow, and pipe dimensions to replicate the resistance, compliance and fluid inertia of the natural cardiovascular system. A mathematical simulation was developed in SIMULINK to simulate an existing MCL. Model validation was achieved by applying the physical MCL characteristics to the simulation and comparing the resulting pressure traces. These characteristics were subsequently altered to improve and thus predict the performance of a more accurate physical system. The simulation was successful in simulating the physical MCL, and proved to be a useful tool in the development of improved cardiovascular device test rigs.", "paper_title": "Simulation and enhancement of a cardiovascular device test rig", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735700005"}
