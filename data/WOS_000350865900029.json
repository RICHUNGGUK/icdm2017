Among the various measures, Birnbaum importance plays an extremely important role because many importance measures have been defined under its illumination and have relationships with it. A lot of work has been done for Birnbaum importance in consecutive-k systems since the systems were introduced. Because the problems in practice are increasingly complicated, in 2007, Zhao et al. proposed consecutive-k systems with sparse d, which is an extension of the current consecutive-k systems. In this paper, we study Birnbaum importance for linear consecutive-k-out-of-n systems with sparse d. Some equations on Birnbaum importance are proposed. With these equations, the ranking of components in the system on the basis of Birnbaum importance is given; and then some patterns of ranking are presented. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results obtained in this paper.", "paper_title": "Birnbaum Importance for Linear Consecutive-k-out-of-n Systems With Sparse d", "paper_id": "WOS:000350865900029"}
