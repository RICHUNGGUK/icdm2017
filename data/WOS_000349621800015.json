We show how applications like company and friend recommendation could significantly benefit from incorporating social and spatial proximity, and study a query type that captures these two-fold semantics. We develop highly scalable algorithms for its processing, and enhance them with elaborate optimizations. Finally, we use real social network data to empirically verify the efficiency and efficacy of our solutions.", "paper_title": "Joint Search by Social and Spatial Proximity", "paper_id": "WOS:000349621800015"}
