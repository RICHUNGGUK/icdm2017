We have successfully implemented ridgelets on the circular disk containing the pattern and applied Fourier transform on the resulting ridgelet coefficients to extract rotation-invariant features for pattern recognition. The descriptor is very robust to Gaussian noise even when the noise level is high. Experimental results show that the new descriptor is a very good choice for pattern recognition.", "paper_title": "Rotation invariant feature extraction using Ridgelet and Fourier transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237866500007"}
