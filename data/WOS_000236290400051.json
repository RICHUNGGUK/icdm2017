Instead of 2D coordinates, a one-dimensional distance sequence extracted from the original map is used as the cover data to achieve the shape-preserving ability. The statistical feature of the cover data is utilized for data embedding. Experiment results indicate the scheme's better performance in invisibility, as well as its robustness to certain attacks.", "paper_title": "A shape-preserving method for watermarking 2D vector maps based on statistic detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400051"}
