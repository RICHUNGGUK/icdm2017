Based on the concepts of fuzzy process and fuzzy differential equation, we present some concepts of stability for fuzzy differential equations. Furthermore we propose the sufficient and necessary conditions of stability for fuzzy linear differential equations.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of fuzzy linear differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277413800003"}
