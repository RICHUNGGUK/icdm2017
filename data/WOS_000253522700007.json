Inspiring from the reconfiguration characteristics similar to those found in biological cellular organisms, this paper presents a new digital circuit based on embryonic cellular array, which is capable of implementing self-repairing. The inner architecture and the self-repairing mechanism of this new circuit are expounded, and a design of cells in the array by LUT (look-up table) is particularized in detailed. Lastly, a parallel multiplication circuit is proposed as an example to show the effectiveness and the application of this design in terms of functionality and fault-tolerance.", "paper_title": "The research of self-repairing digital circuit based on embryonic cellular array", "paper_id": "WOS:000253522700007"}
