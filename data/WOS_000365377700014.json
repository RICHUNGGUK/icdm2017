However, filtering can also remove correct examples and examples containing valuable information, which could be useful for learning. This fact usually implies a margin of improvement on the noise detection accuracy for almost any noise filter. This paper proposes a scheme to improve the performance of noise filters in multi-class classification problems, based on decomposing the dataset into multiple binary subproblems. Decomposition strategies have proven to be successful in improving classification performance in multi-class problems by generating simpler binary subproblems. Similarly, we adapt the principles of the One-vs-One decomposition strategy to noise filtering, making the noise identification process simpler. In order to integrate the filtering results achieved in the binary subproblems, our proposal uses a soft voting approach considering a reliability level based on the aggregation of the noise degree prediction calculated for each binary classifier. The experimental results show that the One-vs-One decomposition strategy usually increases the performance of the noise filters studied, which can detect more accurately the noisy examples.
