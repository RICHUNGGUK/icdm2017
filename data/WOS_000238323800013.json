Among them, locality preserving projection (LPP) is one of the most promising feature extraction techniques. However, when LPP is applied to the classification tasks, it shows some limitations, such as the ignorance of the label information. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method, called locally discriminating projection (LDP). LDP utilizes class information to guide the procedure of feature extraction. In LDP, the local structure of the original data is constructed according to a certain kind of similarity between data points, which takes special consideration of both the local information and the class information. The similarity has several good properties which help to discover the true intrinsic structure of the data, and make LDP a robust technique for the classification tasks. We compare the proposed LDP approach with LPP, as well as other feature extraction methods, such as PCA and LDA, on the public available data sets, FERET and AR. Experimental results suggest that LDP provides a better representation of the class information and achieves much higher recognition accuracies. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
