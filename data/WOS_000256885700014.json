The collaborative tracking framework probabilistically combines measurements from an offline-trained generic face model with measurements from online-learned specific face appearance models in a dnamic Bayesian nework. In this framework, generic face models provide the knowledge of the whole face class, while specific face models provide information on individual faces being tracked. Their combination, therefore, provides robust measurements for multiview face tracking. We introduce a mixture of probabilistic principal component analysis (MPPCA) model to represent the appearance of a specific face under multiple views, and we also present an online EM algorithm to incrementally update the MPPCA model using tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate that the collaborative tracking and online learning methods can handle large pose changes and are robust to distractions from the background.", "paper_title": "Robust face tracking via collaboration of generic and specific models", "paper_id": "WOS:000256885700014"}
