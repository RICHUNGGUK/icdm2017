The fundamental concept of the WCA is inspired by the observation of water cycle process, and movement of rivers and streams to the sea in the real world. Several benchmark functions have been used to evaluate the performance of the WCA optimizer for the MOPs. The obtained optimization results based on the considered test functions and comparisons with other well-known methods illustrate and clarify the robustness and efficiency of the WCA and its exploratory capability for solving the MOPs.", "paper_title": "Water cycle algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361728200015"}
