Using a survey with 24 items designed to measure each of the areas described by the TPACK framework, and measuring the responses of 596 online teachers from across the United States, data suggest that while the framework is helpful from an organizational standpoint, it is difficult to separate out each of the domains, calling into question their existence in practice. Three major factors become evident, but rather than being comprised of pedagogy, content, and technology, the only clear domain that distinguishes itself is that of technology. This research examines the validity of the TPACK model and suggests that measuring each of these domains is complicated and convoluted, potentially due to the notion that they are not separate.
