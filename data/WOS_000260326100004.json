The availability of space and load in workshops should thus be examined in scheduling the production process. The variety of material, facilities, and information resources makes the spatial planning difficult. In the present work, a spatial planning and scheduling system is developed to support spatial planning and scheduling in block assembly shops, and the workload balance of workshops. The requirements and functions of the system are described and functional components are designed and implemented, based on an object-oriented methodology. The integrated environment is presented in this paper. This system can be expanded to any workshop that requires spatial planning and scheduling.", "paper_title": "Development of integrated and interactive spatial planning system of assembly blocks in shipbuilding", "paper_id": "WOS:000260326100004"}
