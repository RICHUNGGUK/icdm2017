The multiquadratic function is chosen as the transfer function of the neurons. The nonlinear algebraic equation systems for weights training are solved by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in numerical examples by approximating several functions and solving nonlinear PDEs. The result of numerical experiments shows that the IRBFNs with the adaptive procedure requires less neurons to attain the desired accuracy than conventional radial basis function networks.
