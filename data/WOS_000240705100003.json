Contour matching in natural images in the absence of foreground-background segmentation is difficult. Usually an asymmetric approach is adopted, where a contour is said to match well if it aligns with a subset of the image's gradients. This leads to problems as the contour can match with a portion of an object's outline and ignore the remainder. We present a model for using edge continuity to address this issue. Pairs of edge elements in the image are linked with affinities if they are likely to belong to the same object. A contour that matches with a set of image gradients is constrained to also match with other gradients having high affinities with the chosen ones. Experimental results show that this improves matching performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
