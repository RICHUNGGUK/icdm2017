Therefore, among all knowledge forms, storing formal decision events in a knowledge-explicit way is considered an important development. Set of an experience knowledge structure is a vehicle able to acquire explicit knowledge of formal decision events. The purpose of this article is to show an effective form of transformation of a set of experience into a shareable and understandable shape able to travel among different systems. A transportable set of experience could be applied in many technologies, and in consequence, it can advance the notion of administering knowledge in the current decision-making environment.", "paper_title": "Extending set of experience knowledge structure into a transportable of language extensible markup language", "paper_id": "WOS:000235611100002"}
