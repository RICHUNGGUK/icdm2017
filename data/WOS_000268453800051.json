Terms and vectorized graph connectionists are extracted from the graph representation of document by employing weighted feature extraction method. We then develop a new dual wing harmonium model projecting these multiple features into low dimensional latent topics with different probability distributions assumption. Contrastive divergence algorithm is used for efficient learning and inference. We perform extensive experimental verification, and the comparative results suggest that the proposed method is accurate and computationally efficient for document retrieval. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
