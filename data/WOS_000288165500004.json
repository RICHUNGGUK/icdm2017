We propose here an on-chip offset generator for producing the constant offset and analyse its limitations. Experimental tests on the 122 x 22 mu m(2) offset generator fabricated in 130 nm CMOS process show that it can be used to test the INL of 12-b DACs and ADCs. The generator is rail-to-rail capable so that almost the whole input/output range of converters can be tested. Moreover, if the proposed offset generator is used in a ratiometric test setup as proposed here as well, the influence of a reference voltage drift on measurement accuracy is cancelled out. Because of its small size, simple design, rail-to-rail capability and immunity to reference voltage changes, the proposed offset generator is well suited for built-in self-test usage.", "paper_title": "On-chip offset generator for accurate integral non-linearity testing of A/D converters and D/A-A/D converter pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500004"}
