We use role mappings between RBAC systems to implement trans-system access control, analyze security violation of interoperation with role mappings, and formalize definitions of secure interoperation. A minimum detection method according to the feature of RBAC system in distributed environment is introduced in detail. This method reduces complexity by decreasing the amount of roles involved in detection. Finally, we analyze security violation further based on the minimum detection method to help administrators eliminate security violation.", "paper_title": "Security violation detection for RBAC based interoperation in distributed environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000256860900025"}
