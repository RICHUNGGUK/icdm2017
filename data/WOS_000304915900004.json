One result we prove using this lemma is that if vertical bar A vertical bar = theta N and vertical bar A + A vertical bar <= (1 - epsilon)N, 0 < epsilon < 1, then this level-set contains an arithmetic progression of length at least N-c, c = c(theta, epsilon, gamma) > 0. It is perhaps possible to obtain such a result using Green's arithmetic regularity lemma (in combination with some ideas of Bourgain [6]); however, our method of proof allows us to obtain non-tower-type quantitative dependence between the constant c and the parameters theta and epsilon. For various reasons (discussed in the paper) one might think, wrongly, that such results would only be possible for level-sets involving triple and higher convolutions.", "paper_title": "Some Properties of Lower Level-Sets of Convolutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000304915900004"}
