This IC can losslessly encode HDTV 720p resolution at 30 frames/s in real time. Three techniques are adopted: line-based discrete wavelet transform, parallel embedded block coding, and precompression rate-distortion optimization. The line-based discrete wavelet transform achieves the minimum external memory access, while the internal memory is reduced by a proper memory access scheme. The parallel embedded block coding increases the throughput and reduces the memory bandwidth with similar hardware cost comparing to conventional architectures. By accurately estimating bit rates, the precompression rate-distortion optimization reduces the required computational power and processing time of the embedded block coding since the code-blocks are truncated before compression. Experimental results show that this encoder has the highest throughput with the smallest area compared with other designs in the literature.", "paper_title": "High-performance JPEG 2000 encoder with rate-distortion optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239420300001"}
