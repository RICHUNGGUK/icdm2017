In the SDE, population is divided into several memeplexes and each memeplex is improved by the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The OBL by comparing the fitness of an individual to its opposite and retaining the fitter one in the population accelerates search process. The objective of this paper is to introduce new versions of the DE which, on one hand, use the partitioning and shuffling concepts of SDE to compensate for the limited amount of search moves of the original DE and, on the other hand, employ the OBL to accelerate the DE without making premature convergence. Four versions of DE algorithm are proposed based on the OBL and SDE strategies. All algorithms similarly use the opposition-based population initialization to achieve fitter initial individuals and their difference is in applying opposition-based generation jumping. Experiments on 25 benchmark functions designed for the special session on real-parameter optimization of CEC2005 and non-parametric analysis of obtained results demonstrate that the performances of the proposed algorithms are better than the SDE. The fourth version of proposed algorithm has a significant difference compared to the SDE in terms of all considered aspects. The emphasis of comparison results is to obtain some successful performances on unsolved functions for the first time, which so far have not been reported any successful runs on them. In a later part of the comparative experiments, performance comparisons of the proposed algorithm with some modern DE algorithms reported in the literature confirm a significantly better performance of our proposed algorithm, especially on high-dimensional functions.", "paper_title": "Opposition-based learning in the shuffled differential evolution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000306354600002"}
