In this paper, we investigate how these methods can be extended to provide a general non-parametric cross-entropy framework based on phi-divergence distance measures. We show how the chi(2) distance, in particular, yields a viable alternative to the Kullback-Leibler distance. The theory is illustrated with various examples from density estimation, rare-event simulation and continuous multi-extremal optimization.", "paper_title": "Generalized cross-entropy methods with applications to rare-event simulation and optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000253614100004"}
