The new method has been tested on Met-Enkephelin peptide, which is a paradigmatic example of multiple-minima problem, 1POLY, 1ROP and the three helix protein 1BDC. The experimental results show as the multistage approach is a competitive and effective search method in the conformational search space of real proteins, in terms of quality solution and computational cost comparing the results of the current state-of-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Lipschitzian pattern search and immunological algorithm with quasi-Newton method for the protein folding problem: An innovative multistage approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800038"}
