Based on dwell time switching signals and multiple Lyapunov functional method, stabilisation conditions are well obtained in the context of linear matrix inequalities. To estimate attractive regions as large as possible, the feasibility problems are translated into optimisation problems. In addition, the corresponding results are presented for linear time-delay systems and switched delay-free systems, which improve and supplement some existing ones in the literature. Finally, numerical examples and simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and values of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Stabilisation for switched linear systems with time-varying delay and input saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300018"}
