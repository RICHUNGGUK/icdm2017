Each node in the SPCN comprises both \"slow\" and \"fast\" dynamics that reflects the singular perturbation behavior. General sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. All nodes in the SPCN have the same structures and properties. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed SPCN is synchronized if certain matrix inequalities are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that dynamics (both slow and fast) of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, a matrix inequality approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness and merits of the proposed synchronization scheme and state estimation formulation. It is worth mentioning that our main results are still valid even if the slow subsystems within the network are unstable.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Approach to Global Synchronization and State Estimation for Nonlinear Singularly Perturbed Complex Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100018"}
