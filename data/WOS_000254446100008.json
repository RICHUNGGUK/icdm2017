The presented scheme is proved to be information-theoretically hiding and computationally binding in the defined model. Finally, to argue the usefulness of this work, we also sketch out some new applications based on this new primitive.", "paper_title": "Biased bit commitment and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000254446100008"}
