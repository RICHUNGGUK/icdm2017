No matter how differentiable able the function A is (even analytic), in general the singular values lose all smoothness at points where they coalesce. In this work, we propose and implement algorithms which locate points in Omega where the singular values coalesce. Our algorithms are based on the interplay between coalescing singular values in Omega, and the periodicity of the SVD-factors as one completes a loop along Gamma. (C) 2008 IMACS.
