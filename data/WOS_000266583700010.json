In this paper, we propose an information hiding scheme based on quantization-based embedding technique to conceal information in gray-scale image. The proposed scheme was tested with a variety of gray images. According to the experimental results, hidden information can be extracted correctly and quickly from the stego image. In addition, the stego image has only a little distortion compared with the cover image. The proposed scheme can not only hide a large amount of information in the cover image, but can also repair the stego image such that the repaired image is almost the same as the cover image.", "paper_title": "An Information-Hiding Scheme Based on Quantization-Based Embedding Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583700010"}
