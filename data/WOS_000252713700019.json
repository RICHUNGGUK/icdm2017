Here we show how this approach can be used to improve docking accuracy and efficiency, in cases where a complex structure of a ligand with the target protein is known. In cases where a known ligand exists, yet the complex structure is unknown it is possible to make use of the advantages offered by this approach, by combining it with standard ligand docking.", "paper_title": "Similarity based docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000252713700019"}
