First, we calculate the counter values between any two questions, where the counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions. Then, we consider four kinds of association rules between two questions to mine some information. Finally, we calculate the relevance degree between two concepts derived from the association rule to construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of Chen and Bai's (2010) and Lee et al.'s method (2009). It provides us with a useful way to construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems based on data mining techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
