It will be shown that the sup -T product E o F of two T-indistinguishability operators is also a T-indistinguishability operator if and only if E and F are permutable T-indistinguishability operators (i.e., Eo F = F o E). This property will be related to the study of fuzzy subgroups, fuzzy normal subgroups and vague groups. The aggregation of fuzzy subgroups will also be analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
