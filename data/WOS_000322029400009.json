Attention is focused on the design of the desired filter to guarantee an induced l(2) performance for the filtering error system. A new comparison model is proposed by employing a new approximation for the time-varying delay state, and then, sufficient conditions for the obtained filtering error system are derived by this comparison model. A desired filter is constructed by solving a convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Induced l(2) Filtering of Fuzzy Stochastic Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000322029400009"}
