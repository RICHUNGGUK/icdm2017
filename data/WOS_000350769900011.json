We show that both thermal noise coefficient (gamma) and device noise corner frequency (f(co)) are dependent on the g(m)/I-D of a transistor. We derive expressions to demonstrate the relationship between the normalized noise power spectral density technique and the technique based on gamma and f(co). We conclude this letter with examples to demonstrate the practical implication of our study. Our results show that while both techniques discussed in this letter can be used to compute noise numerically, using gamma and f(co) to separate thermal noise from flicker noise provides additional insight for optimizing noise.", "paper_title": "A Unified Explanation of g(m)/I-D-Based Noise Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000350769900011"}
