A method for designing robust reliable controller is presented by means of the multiple Lyapunov functions technique so that the energy-like functional does not have to decrease along the switching instants. The proposed controller is reliable in that it can guarantee the closed loop asymptotic stablility of switched delay systerns in the case of the possible presence of Failures of partial actuators. Delay independent results Of file reliable controller design are presented in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Robust reliable control of switched uncertain systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000243527200001"}
