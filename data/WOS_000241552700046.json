In this approach, the fractal code defines a set of spatial domain similarity constraints. We also show how such a reformulation in terms of POCS allows additional contraints to be imposed during fractal image decoding. Two applications are presented: image construction with an incomplete fractal code and image denoising.", "paper_title": "Fractal image coding as projections onto convex sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700046"}
