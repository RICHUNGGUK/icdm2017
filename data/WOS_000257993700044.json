A FDI system was developed which is based on adaptive fuzzy rules. A number of optimisation strategies were then applied; it wits found that an evolutionary algorithm not only produced the best results but did so with relatively little processing effort and with excellent consistency. The adaptive fuzzy system, thus optimised, was tested against a neural network, which was trained to produce analogue outputs as an indication of fault magnitude. The fuzzy solution produced the best accuracy. We can conclude that ail adaptive fuzzy inference system for FDI, using an evolutionary algorithm to learn front examples, can provide an accurate and readily comprehensible solution to diagnosing and evaluating fluid process plant faults.
