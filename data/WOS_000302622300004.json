For traffic load distribution over heterogeneous RATs (Radio Access Technologies), heterogeneous link resources need to be commonly measured and fairly compared. To this end, an airtime cost model is considered as a common resource measure. The model can be used to estimate channel time consumed for a successful packet transmission. As a traffic split mechanism, an airtime-balance method is proposed. Using the airtime cost model, the offered traffic load (in Mbps) is converted into airtime cost required for its transmission, and IP packets are distributed to multiple RATs so that airtime is equally balanced between RATs.", "paper_title": "Splitting downlink multimedia traffic over WiMAX and WiFi heterogeneous links based on airtime-balance", "paper_id": "WOS:000302622300004"}
