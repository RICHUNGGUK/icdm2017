The method is based on the use of fuzzy implications. A literature analysis has shown that there is no algorithm that would enable the identification of attribute relationships in fuzzy relational schemas. This fact was the motive for development a new methodology in the analysis of fuzzy functional dependencies over a given set of attributes. Solving this, not so new problem, is not only research challenge having theoretical importance, but it also has practical significance. Possible applications of the proposed methodology include GIS, data mining, information retrieval, reducing data redundancy in fuzzy relations through implementation of logical database model, estimation of missing values etc. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
