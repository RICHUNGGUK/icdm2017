The geometry from the image plane is transferred to the Cartesian lattice by means of using the original image's line-integrals to calculate the line-sums of the discrete image to be reconstructed. Such a transformation of geometry allows for the 2D discrete paired transform, whose complete set of functions is defined by directions, to be effectively used in the exact reconstruction of the original image. The model of image reconstruction is described, and both examples and experimental results of implementation of the proposed method are provided for reconstruction on the Cartesian lattice of size 2(r) x 2(r), where r >= 2.", "paper_title": "Image Reconstruction From Finite Number of Projections: Method of Transferring Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300014"}
