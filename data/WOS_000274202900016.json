However, the dynamic parallel machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times still remains under-represented in the research literature. in this study, an iterated greedy heuristic for this problem is presented. Extensive computational experiments reveal that the proposed heuristic is highly effective as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on the same benchmark problem data set. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
