The goal is to replace time-consuming simulations based on abstract models of the system with real-time experiments under real-world conditions. GPU-like architecture is a promising approach to fully exploit the potential of FPGA-based acceleration platforms. In this article, an application-specific GPU-like architecture and a complete compilation framework for decoding LDPC codes are proposed. The interest in an application-specific GPU in comparison with current GPUs is detailed. Finally, real-time experimentations demonstrate the potential of the GPU-like decoder to investigate both algorithmic and architectural issues.", "paper_title": "GPU-Like On-Chip System for Decoding LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000346219200022"}
