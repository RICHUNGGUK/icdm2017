In particular, the importance of probabilistic aspects of anonymity has recently been highlighted by many authors. Several different notions of \"probabilistic anonymity\" have been studied so far, but proof methods for such probabilistic notions have not yet been elaborated. In this paper we introduce a simulation-based proof method for one notion of probabilistic anonymity introduced by Bhargava and Palamidessi, called strong probabilistic anonymity. The method is a probabilistic adaptation of the one by Kawabe, Sakurada et al. for non-deterministic anonymity; anonymity of a protocol is proved by finding a forward/backward simulation between certain automata. For the jump from non-determinism to probability we exploit a generic, coalgebraic theory of traces and simulations developed by Hasuo. Jacobs and Sokolova. In particular, an appropriate notion of probabilistic simulation is obtained as an instantiation of the generic definition, for which soundness theorem comes for free. Additionally, we show how we can use a similar idea to verify a weaker notion of probabilistic anonymity called probable innocence. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
