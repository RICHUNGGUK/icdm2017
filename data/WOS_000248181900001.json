Those words are the fixed points of the morphisms of the type phi(A) = A(p) B, phi(B) = A(q) for p epsilon N, q epsilon N, p >= q, where beta = p+root p(2)+4q/2. We will prove that such word is t-balanced with t = 1+[(p - 1)/(p + 1 - q)]. Finally, in the case that p < q it is known [B. Adamczewski, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 273 (2002) 197 - 224] that the fixed point of the substitution phi(A) = A(p) B, phi(B) = A(q) is not m- balanced for any m. We exhibit an infinite sequence of pairs of words with the unbalance property.", "paper_title": "Balance properties of the fixed point of the substitution associated to quadratic simple pisot numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000248181900001"}
