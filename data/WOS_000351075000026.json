Systems modeling is no longer viewed as simply a \"good idea\" but is becoming an increasingly important part of any systems engineering project. The application of MBSE is becoming well understood at the systems level; however, there is a lack of research and subsequent industrial application at the system of systems (SoS) level. This paper presents a model-based approach to requirements engineering for SoSs. The approach is derived from an MBSE approach to requirements engineering and therefore represents current best practice in SoSs in terms of established standards and research. This paper builds upon and is an evolution of the initial foundations for model-based requirements engineering for systems of systems that were published in an earlier paper.", "paper_title": "A Model-Based Approach for Requirements Engineering for Systems of Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351075000026"}
