The method for approximately inverting TCQ in the absence of the least significant bits is improved. Experimental results, presented using the optimal rate control algorithm and different embedded TCQ formulations, show that modified embedded TCQ yields significant performance improvement compared to the original one in JPEG2000.", "paper_title": "Embedded trellis coded quantization for JPEG2000", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100008"}
