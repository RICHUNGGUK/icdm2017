Gompertz distribution is considered as a lifetime model. The posterior means and posterior variances are derived using the squared-error loss function. The Bayes estimates cannot be obtained in explicit forms. Approximate Bayes estimates are computed using the method of Lindley [D.V. Lindley, Approximate Bayesian methods, Trabajos Estadistica 31 (1980), pp. 223-237]. The advantage of this proposed method is shown. The approximate Bayes estimates obtained under the assumption of non-informative priors are compared with their maximum likelihood counterparts using Monte Carlo simulation.", "paper_title": "Bayes estimation of Gompertz distribution parameters and acceleration factor under partially accelerated life tests with type-I censoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000283061500006"}
