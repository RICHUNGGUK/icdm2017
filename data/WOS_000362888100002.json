To mimic this aspect of the biological visual system the PC/BC-DIM neural network is used as an omni-directional basis function network for learning and performing sensory-sensory and sensory-motor transformations without using any hard-coded geometric information. A hierarchical PC/BC-DIM network is used to learn a head-centred representation of visual targets by dividing the whole problem into independent subtasks. The learned head-centred representation is then used to generate saccade and vergence motor commands. The performance of the proposed system is tested using the iCub humanoid robot simulator.", "paper_title": "A neural model of binocular saccade planning and vergence control", "paper_id": "WOS:000362888100002"}
