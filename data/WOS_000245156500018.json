By this statistic, we can identify most of the noisy pixels in the corrupted images. Combining it with an edge-preserving regularization, we obtain a powerful two-stage method for denoising random-valued impulse noise, even for noise levels as high as 60%. Simulation results show that our method is significantly better than a number of existing techniques in terms of image restoration and noise detection.", "paper_title": "A detection statistic for random-valued impulse noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000245156500018"}
