The main characteristics of Elckerlyc are that (1) it is designed specifically for continuous interaction with tight temporal coordination between the behavior of a VH and its interaction partner; (2) it provides a mix between the precise temporal and spatial control offered by procedural animation and the physical realism of physical simulation; and (3) it is designed to be highly modular and extensible, implementing the architecture proposed in SAIBA.", "paper_title": "Elckerlyc A BML Realizer for continuous, multimodal interaction with a Virtual Human", "paper_id": "WOS:000208480400003"}
