Due to the variety of mathematical structures of thermodynamic models and the possibilities of object-oriented modelling languages, powerful libraries are often very complex and hard to understand. The scope of the presented library lies on good readability and usability for both users and model designers. The basic structure and design concepts of the library are outlined and also the most important model concepts are explained. The heat pump system is modelled and simulation results are compared with test stand measurements. Simulation results are used to analyse the design of the system and to get information about possible further improvements.", "paper_title": "Modelling of heat pumps with an object-oriented model library for thermodynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283369600003"}
