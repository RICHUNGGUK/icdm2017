While more examples have been found for this counterintuitive \"nonlocality without entanglement\" phenomenon, a complete and computationally verifiable characterization for all such sets of states remains unknown. In this paper, we give such a characterization for both C(3) circle times C(3) and C(2) circle times C(2) circle times C(2). As a consequence, we show that in both spaces, there is no additional set of a fundamentally different structure than those of the known instances.", "paper_title": "Characterizing Locally Indistinguishable Orthogonal Product States", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500028"}
