We determine the value of k. We also prove that (a), the threshold of the k-core being balanced coincides with the threshold that the average degree of the k-core is at most 2(k-1), for all sufficiently large k; (b) with high probability, there is a subgraph of G(n,c/n) whose density is significantly denser than any of its nonempty cores, for almost all sufficiently large c > 0.
