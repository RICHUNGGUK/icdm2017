Typically, AmI frameworks are based on distributed context-aware approaches that, by using collections of invisible and interconnected devices, elicit and analyze environmental knowledge for delivering an appropriate set of services. Emotion-aware AmI (AmE) enhances the conventional idea of intelligent environment by exploiting theories from psychology and social sciences for suitably analyzing human emotional status and achieving a higher users' satisfaction. This work proposes a novel approach of combining emotion-aware idea with a neuro-fuzzy framework to train a collection of intelligent FML-based agents aimed at delivering efficient, personalized and interoperable emotion services in an AmE environment. As will be shown in experimental results, where a usability study and a confirmation of expectations test have been performed, the proposed approach is capable of anticipating user's requirements and improving the performance of a conventional AmI framework.
