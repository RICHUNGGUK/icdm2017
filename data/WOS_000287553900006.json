This has direct applications to an effective form of cancer treatment. Using several insights, we extend previous results to obtain constant-factor improvements in the approximation guarantees. We show that these improvements yield better performance by providing an experimental evaluation of all known approximation algorithms using both synthetic and real-world clinical data. Our algorithms are superior for 76% of instances and we argue for their utility alongside the heuristic approaches used in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
