In many of such domains, the huge number of repetitions make the goal of extesionally storing and accessing such data very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, based on an intensional representation of periodic data. The representation model we propose captures the notion of periodic granularity provided by the temporal database glossary, and is an extension of the TSQL2 temporal relational data model. We define the algebraic operators, and introduce access algorithms to cope with them, proving that they are correct with respect to the traditional extesional approach. We also provide an experimental evaluation of our approach.", "paper_title": "An intensional approach for periodic data in relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000324118000002"}
