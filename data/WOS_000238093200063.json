Apart from two simple approaches, we propose distributed hash-join and index-join algorithms for implementation of range-join operations in sensor networks. Through extensive simulations, we show that hash-join as well as index-join approaches significantly outperform the simple approaches, even for moderately sized networks. Our experiments also reveal that although both approach scale well, the index-join algorithm performs better than the hash-join algorithm especially in large sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Communication-efficient implementation of range-joins in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093200063"}
