Our approach integrates adaptive sampling-based simplification, visibility culling, out-of-core data management and level-of-detail. We use a unified scene graph representation for acceleration techniques. In preprocessing, we subdivide large objects, and build a BVH clustering hierarchy. We make use of a novel adaptive sampling method to generate LOD models: AdaptiveVoxels. The AdaptiveVoxels reduces the preprocessing cost and our out-of-core rendering algorithm improves rendering efficiency. We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC. We can render massive CAD and isosurface models, consisting of hundreds of millions of triangles interactively with little loss in image quality.", "paper_title": "Adaptive voxels: interactive rendering of massive 3D models", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800003"}
