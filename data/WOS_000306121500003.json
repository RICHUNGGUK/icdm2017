It is shown that this technique is an efficient method to obtain the response of a nonlinear microwave amplifier when it is excited by multi-carrier modulated signals. This method indeed extended ET-HB method to characterize the multi-carrier modulated signals by using multi-tone HB simulation. To accelerate the simulation speed two formulation of ET-MHB are presented. They called ET-MDHB and ET-FMHB. These formulas provide a compact form which simplify and accelerate the computer simulations. Then, the proposed methods are applied to analyze a nonlinear microwave amplifier. The circuit is investigated under excitation of single-tone modulated, 4-tone un-modulated, and 4-tone digitally modulated signals. The results show the accuracy, time efficiency, and simplicity of the new formulations.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear analysis of microwave amplifiers excited by multicarrier modulated signals using envelop transient technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121500003"}
