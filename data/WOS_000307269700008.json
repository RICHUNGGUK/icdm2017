Delphi techniques were used to collect in-depth data from 20 industry experts. The major implication of the study is that there are great differences between operational and managerial user behaviour in reacting to integration technologies. Operational users resist systems primarily due to self-interest, and they tend to resist the system by passively communicating negative feelings across the organisation and by making careless mistakes. Managerial users, mainly due to concerns about overall benefits to the organisation, tend to actively disrupt project implementation and operation and accept inferior-quality performance. Directive strategies in smoothing the system transition are perceived to be more effective in managing resistance from operational users. Participative strategies are perceived to be effective in managing resistance from managerial users. Organisations applying business integration systems need to distinguish between different types of users and apply dual strategies in managing the business integration.", "paper_title": "Dual strategy for managing user resistance with business integration systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000307269700008"}
