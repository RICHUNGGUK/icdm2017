Upon isolating and subtracting the dominant signal from a base signal containing varying types and amounts of noise, even though we purposefully excluded any identical matches in the dataset, the signal separation system successfully built a resulting foreign set of synthesized sounds that the classifier correctly recognized. Herein, this paper presents a system that classifies and separates two harmonic signals with added noise. This novel methodology incorporates Knowledge Discovery, MPEG7-based segmentation and Inverse Fourier Transforms.", "paper_title": "Blind signal separation of similar pitches and instruments in a noisy polyphonic domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800026"}
