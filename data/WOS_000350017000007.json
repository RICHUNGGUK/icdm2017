These systems involve individuals playing key roles, such as workers in manufacturing systems, soldiers in military operations, and investors in stock markets. The complexity simulating such systems is due to the need for modeling individual and group behavior and the integration of psychological and socio-technical aspects that can affect individual and HCS global performance. Although several models have been proposed to simulate such systems, most of them suffer from limitations pertaining to the integration of some factors, an inadequacy that will be discussed and elaborated on in this paper. The current study presents a new model for HCS simulation based on recent social and psychological theories. A model implementation example involving the simulation of a manufacturing system, considered as a HCS, is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
