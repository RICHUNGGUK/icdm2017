Apart from some flaws in the initial propositions, corrected in a later stage, there are no known weaknesses of the core of these algorithms. Two variants, F-FCSR-H and F-FCSR-16, were proposed in the eSTREAM project, and F-FCSR-H v2 is one of the ciphers selected for the eSTREAM portfolio. In this paper we present a new and severe cryptanalytic attack on the F-FCSR stream cipher family. We give the details of the attack when applied to F-FCSR-H v2 and F-FCSR-16. The attack requires a few Mbytes of received sequence, and the complexity is low enough to allow the attack to be performed on a single PC within seconds.", "paper_title": "Breaking the Stream Ciphers F-FCSR-H and F-FCSR-16 in Real Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000289212500001"}
