This is evident from the numerous research results published recently in major journals and conferences in the area of handwriting recognition. Features and classifications techniques utilized in recent research work have diversified noticeably compared to the past. Moreover, more efforts have been diverted, in last few years, to construct different databases for Arabic handwriting recognition. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Arabic handwriting recognition. The article starts with a summary of the characteristics of Arabic text, followed by a general model for an Arabic text recognition system. Then the used databases for Arabic text recognition are discussed. Research works on preprocessing phase, like text representation, baseline detection, line, word, character, and subcharacter segmentation algorithms, are presented. Different feature extraction techniques used in Arabic handwriting recognition are identified and discussed. Different classification approaches, like HMM, ANN, SVM, k-NN, syntactical methods, etc., are discussed in the context of Arabic handwriting recognition. Works on Arabic lexicon construction and spell checking are presented in the postprocessing phase. Several summary tables of published research work are provided for used Arabic text databases and reported results on Arabic character, word, numerals, and text recognition. These tables summarize the features, classifiers, data, and reported recognition accuracy for each technique. Finally, we discuss some future research directions in Arabic handwriting recognition.", "paper_title": "Offline Arabic Handwritten Text Recognition: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000316004300011"}
