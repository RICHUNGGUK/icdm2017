We consider the number of customers in the system, the maximum workload during a busy period, and the length of a busy period. We also briefly treat the analogous model in which any customer enters the system and leaves at the end of his patience time or at the end of his virtual sojourn time, whichever occurs first.", "paper_title": "The M/G/1+G queue revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000290543000002"}
