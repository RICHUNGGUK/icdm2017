The documents comparison using the conventional clustering techniques is based on the surface similarities of words or extracted morphemes. This leads to non-semantic clusters usually. In this paper, Farsi, also known as Persian, has been taken into account with regards to the fact that the amount of electronic Farsi texts are growing rapidly. The documents are enriched by using semantic relationships - synonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy-extracted from FarsNet lexical ontology. A WSD procedure is proposed to decrease uncertainty. After preprocessing routines, three clustering algorithms including Bisecting K-means, LSI and PLSI based clustering is applied on the pre-categorized Persian Hamshahri corpus. Experimental results show the improvement of clustering quality when text data is enriched by the semantic relations especially using PLSI based approach.", "paper_title": "A New Experience in Persian Text Clustering using FarsNet Ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000348091300017"}
