More specifically, the classification of the final state reached by the system at the end of an accident scenario is performed by Fuzzy C-Means clustering the Functional Principal Components (FPCs) of selected relevant process variables. The approach allows capturing the characteristics of the process evolution determined by the occurrence, timing, and magnitudes of the fault events. An illustrative case study is considered, regarding the fault scenarios of the digital I&C system of the Lead Bismuth Eutectic eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (LBE-XADS). The results obtained are compared with those of the Kth Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifiers.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy C-Means Clustering of Signal Functional Principal Components for Post-Processing Dynamic Scenarios of a Nuclear Power Plant Digital Instrumentation and Control System", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317100007"}
