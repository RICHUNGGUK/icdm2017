Due to the essential complexity of the problem, most of the research focuses on the single-machine setting. In this paper, we address a total completion time scheduling problem in the m-machine permutation flow shop. First of all, we propose a dominance rule and an efficient lower bound to speed up the searching for the optimal solution. Second, several deterioration patterns, which include an increasing, a decreasing, a constant, a V-shaped, and a A-shaped one, are investigated in order to study the impact of the deterioration rates. Finally, the performance of some well-known heuristics under various deterioration patterns is evaluated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
