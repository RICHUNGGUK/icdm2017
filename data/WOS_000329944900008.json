The performance of traditional Web service description language (WSDL)-based Web service clustering is not satisfied, due to the singleness of data source. Recently, Web service search engines such as Seekda! allow users to manually annotate Web services using tags, which describe functions of Web services or provide additional contextual and semantical information. In this paper, we cluster Web services by utilizing both WSDL documents and tags. To handle the clustering performance limitation caused by uneven tag distribution and noisy tags, we propose a hybrid Web service tag recommendation strategy, named WSTRec, which employs tag co-occurrence, tag mining, and semantic relevance measurement for tag recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted based on our real-world dataset, which consists of 15,968 Web services. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed service clustering and tag recommendation strategies. Specifically, compared with traditional WSDL-based Web service clustering approaches, the proposed approach produces gains in both precision and recall for up to 14% in most cases.", "paper_title": "Clustering Web services to facilitate service discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000329944900008"}
