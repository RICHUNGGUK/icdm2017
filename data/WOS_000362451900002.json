The method is fully two-way coupled in the sense that the bubbly field affects the continuous fluid and vice versa. A hybrid projection approach is used in which staggered contravariant velocities at cell faces are computed for transport and pressure-velocity coupling while the momentum equation is solved on a collocated grid arrangement. Conservation of mass is formulated such that a strong coupling between void fraction, pressure, and velocity is achieved within a partitioned approach, solving each field separately. A pressure-velocity projection solver is iterated together with a predictor stage for the void fraction to achieve a robust coupling. The implementation is described for general curvilinear grids detailing particulars in the neighborhood to overset interfaces or a free surface. A balanced forced method to avoid the generation of spurious currents is extended for curvilinear grids. The overall methodology allows simulation of high void fraction flows and is stable even when strong packing forces accounting for bubble collisions are included. Convergence and stability in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) configurations is evaluated. Finally, a full-scale simulation of the bubbly flow around a flat-bottom boat is performed demonstrating the applicability of the methodology to complex problems of engineering interest.
