A number of algorithms have been proposed to process twig queries based on region encoding. While each element in source document is given two or more numbers in region-encoding-form index, the size of index grows linearly to the source document. The algorithms based on region encoding perform worse when the source document grows large. In this paper, we address the problem by putting forward a novel index structure, called Clustered Absolute Path Index (CAPI for brief). This index can extremely reduce the size of index and grows slowly as the source document grows large. Based on CAPI, we design novel join algorithms, called Path-Match to process queries without branches, Branch-Filter and RelatedPath-Join to process queries with branches. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms based on CAPI outperform twig join significantly and have good scalability.", "paper_title": "Clustered absolute path index for XML document: On efficient processing of twig queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100001"}
