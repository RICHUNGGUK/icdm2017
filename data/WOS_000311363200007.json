FPN is still a serious problem, despite recent advances in IRFPA technology. This paper proposes new scene-based correction algorithms for continuous compensation of bias and gain nonuniformity in FPA sensors. The proposed schemes use recursive least-square and affine projection techniques that jointly compensate for both the bias and gain of each image pixel, presenting rapid convergence and robustness to noise. The synthetic and real IRFPA videos experimentally show that the proposed solutions are competitive with the state-of-the-art in FPN reduction, by presenting recovered images with higher fidelity.", "paper_title": "Recursive Algorithms for Bias and Gain Nonuniformity Correction in Infrared Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000311363200007"}
