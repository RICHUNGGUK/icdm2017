We utilize a skeleton representation that offers a new mechanism for identifying and measuring handles. Our method presents two unique advantages over previous approaches. First, handle removal is guaranteed not to introduce invalid geometry or additional handles. Second, by using an adaptive grid structure, our method is capable of processing huge models efficiently at high resolutions.", "paper_title": "Topology repair of solid models using skeletons", "paper_id": "WOS:000247006000004"}
