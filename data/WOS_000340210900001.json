This paper reports the results of three focus groups which took place with a total of 14 different individuals who moved to Canada in the past 10 years from countries in Asia, Central America, and Africa. Focus group discussions found that the participants appreciate the library system but were largely unaware of the range of library services available.", "paper_title": "New Immigrants' Perceptions and Awareness of Public Library Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000340210900001"}
