In general, the spectra approximate mean spectrum S in least square framework. Unfortunately, the existing MSC methods have a limited capability in nonlinear component modeling. In this paper, we propose regularized multivariate scatter correction (RMSC), which has taken nonlinear components into MSC model as well as regularization function for the weight vector w. The weighted sum of mappings of observed spectrum is used to approximate the mean spectrum. By using gradient projection sparse representation, vector w is obtained for RMSC. Results show a substantial decrease in Root Mean Square Error of Prediction of quantitative analysis and improvement in classification precision. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
