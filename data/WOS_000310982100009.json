Two types of systems have been designed to provide conferencing services: 1) a conferencing system using session control over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and 2) an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) conferencing system. The IMS conferencing system was developed to adapt to a server-based centralized system, whereas the benefits of the P2P operational model in providing such conference services are widely acknowledged. However, each system provides conferencing services only to its own users. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interworking model to support multimedia conferencing service between the P2P environment and IMS networks. We also introduce protocol architecture and some service scenarios. To verify this system model and the design architecture, we perform an actual implementation and show experienced test results.", "paper_title": "Conferencing Service Interworking in Peer-to-Peer and IMS Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310982100009"}
