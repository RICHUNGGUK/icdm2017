Efficiently leveraging this node level channel information in order to provide timely end-to-end delivery over the network is a key concern for CR based routing protocols. In addition, the primary users (PUs) of the licensed band affect the channels to varying extents, depending on the proportion of the transmission power that gets leaked into the adjacent channels. This also affects the geographical region, in which, the channel is rendered unusable for the CR users. In this paper, a geographic forwarding based SpEctrum Aware Routing protocol for Cognitive ad-Hoc networks (SEARCH), is proposed that (i) jointly undertakes path and channel selection to avoid regions of PU activity during route formation, (ii) adapts to the newly discovered and lost spectrum opportunity during route operation, and (iii) considers various cases of node mobility in a distributed environment by predictive Kalman filtering. Specifically, the optimal paths found by geographic forwarding on each channel are combined at the destination with an aim to minimize the hop count. By binding the route to regions found free of PU activity, rather than particular CR users, the effect of the PU activity is mitigated. To the best of our knowledge, SEARCH takes the first steps towards a completely decentralized, CR routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks and our approach is thoroughly evaluated through analytical formulations and simulation study.
