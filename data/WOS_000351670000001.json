The vehicle communication stack is thus redesigned differently from the traditional TCP/IP architecture in order to accommodate these diversities. The network layer bears the function of the reliable routing and delivery of packets from sources to destinations over a highly dynamic path. We investigate the network layer within the vehicle communication stack and present an abstraction approach, with aims at filling the gap between the simplified and the very detailed models by incorporating more realistic routing protocols and network topologies. We study how the network dynamics, as monitored by multiple network performance indicators (e.g. transmission delay, path length, throughput, and loss rate), is affected by various combinations of routing algorithms, packet sizes, moving speeds, communication ranges, processing rates, boundary conditions, and movement patterns. The proposed suite can be modified and expanded easily to incorporate more features of the real VANET, e.g. traffic light control.", "paper_title": "Network-layer abstraction and simulation of vehicle communication stack", "paper_id": "WOS:000351670000001"}
