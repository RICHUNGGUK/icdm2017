There are two different forms of this three-qubit state that is used for QIS depending on the distribution of the particles among the three parties. There is also a special type of four-qubit state that can be used for QIS using the above channel We explicitly construct the quantum channel, Alice's measurement basis and the analytic form of the unitary operations required by the receiver for such a purpose.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM INFORMATION SPLITTING USING A PAIR OF GHZ STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000359177600010"}
