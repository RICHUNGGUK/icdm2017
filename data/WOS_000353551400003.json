However, only a limited number of methodologies refers to how to move from a conceptual model to an executable simulation model. Besides, existing M&S methodologies do not typically provide a formal method for model transformations between the models in different stages of the development process. Hence, in the current M&S practice, model continuity is usually not fulfilled. In this article, a model-driven development framework for M&S is presented to bridge the gap between different stages of a simulation study and to obtain model continuity. The applicability of the framework is illustrated with a prototype modeling environment and a case study in the discrete event simulation domain.", "paper_title": "Model Continuity in Discrete Event Simulation: A Framework for Model-Driven Development of Simulation Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000353551400003"}
