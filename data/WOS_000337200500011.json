Objective: To visualize 3D incompressible flow by 3 two-dimensional plots. Method: It is argued that such divergence-free projections satisfying all the velocity boundary conditions are unique for a given velocity field. It is shown that the projected fields and their vector potentials can be calculated using divergence-free Galerkin bases. Results: Using natural convection flow in a laterally heated cube as an example, it is shown that the projections proposed allow for a better understanding of similarities and differences of three-dimensional flows and their two-dimensional likenesses. An arbitrary choice of projection planes is further illustrated by a lid-driven flow in a cube, where the lid moves parallel either to a sidewall or a diagonal plane. Conclusion: A new method for visualization of 3D incompressible flows is developed and described. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
