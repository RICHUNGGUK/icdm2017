Load models with variable parameters of intensity, foot contact ratio, frequency and damping are developed and applied as pattern loads. Panel response in terms of deflections and accelerations are evaluated and used to assess the panel for suitable occupancies. Results indicate the occurrence of multimodal vibration in these structures and the importance of applying pattern loads to capture these modes. Vibration caused by the higher harmonics of the activity frequency can also cause discomfort and excessive deflections in the floor panels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
