Compared with multi-stage or multi-bit design, the single loop, single bit Delta-Sigma modulator has relaxed requirement for the building blocks under low-voltage operation, which make it possible to get high conversion rate by increasing sampling frequency. In this study, a low voltage, high speed 4th-order Delta-Sigma modulator using input feed-forward is presented. Implemented with 0.13-mu m CMOS technology and 1.0-V supply voltage, the discrete-time Delta-Sigma modulator achieves 2.5-MS/s conversion rate and 82-dB dynamic range, with the sampling frequency of 160-MHz and OSR of 64.", "paper_title": "A 1-V, 82-dB, 2.5-MS/s, single loop, single bit delta-sigma modulator in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400002"}
