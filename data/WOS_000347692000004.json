These criteria are then applied to three source location algorithms. Chemical leaks from underground structures such as pipelines and storage tanks can be particularly difficult to trace because most things that take place below ground are inaccessible and hidden from view. Automated systems able to locate the sources of such leaks would be very beneficial. An essential component of such systems is their sensory control algorithms. Some of the available source location algorithms suitable for the underground environment have been compared in simulation. However, there has been no comprehensive attempt to propose evaluation criteria and apply them more generally. In this paper three search algorithms are described and evaluated using the proposed criteria. The algorithms are also demonstrated to be effective when tested on a physical burrowing robot searching for a buried chemical source.", "paper_title": "Comparing search algorithms for robotic underground chemical source location", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692000004"}
