In this paper, we study a circuit-switched network where the rates of external arrivals at the network are time-dependent functions. The circuit-switched network is modelled as a nonstationary queueing network with population constraints, which is analyzed approximately in order to obtain the blocking probability functions. Using this method we model two circuit-switched networks, namely, a traffic-groomed tandem optical network and a single-orbit LEO satellite network.
