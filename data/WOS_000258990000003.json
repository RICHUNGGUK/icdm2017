First, buoyancy-corrected k-epsilon models are applied in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations, then large eddy simulation (LES) using a standard Smagorinsky model is examined. Good results are produced using the buoyancy-corrected models, in particular, excellent agreement is achieved for the radial profiles of the streamwise velocity. However, the predictions are very sensitive to the choice of the buoyancy constant, C(3 epsilon), in the models. The present LES calculations show that the puffing frequency is accurately predicted. Predictions for the time-averaged velocities are within experimental uncertainty at all locations. The predicted plume concentrations are in good agreement at the base of the plume, but the centerline values are overpredicted farther downstream. The higher-order statistics are best predicted with the finest mesh. A sensitivity analysis oil grid refinement, values of the Smagorinsky constant and the Schmidt number are included.
