We place each wireless/wire-line channel in one WDM slot to carry a 2.5 Gb/s orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal and reuse downstream wavelengths of the wireless and wire-line channels for uplink by an on-off-keying modulation format signal. For the independent design for wireless and wire-line channels, the layouts of wireless or wire-line channels are flexible for different applications.", "paper_title": "WDM-RoF-PON Architecture for Flexible Wireless and Wire-Line Layout", "paper_id": "WOS:000274196200004"}
