CENSREC-3, as an outcome of the IPSJ-SIG SLP Noisy Speech Recognition Evaluation Working Group. CENSREC-3, which is a sequel to AURORA-2J. has been designed as the evaluation framework of isolated word recognition in real car-driving environments. Speech data were collected using two microphones, a close-talking microphone and a hands-free microphone. under 16 carefully controlled driving conditions, i.e.,combinations of three car speeds and six car conditions. CENSREC-3 provides six evaluation environments designed using speech data collected in these conditions.", "paper_title": "CENSREC-3: An evaluation framework for Japanese speech recognition in real car-driving environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507400009"}
