Role assignment and transfer regulations are important to accomplish it. This paper discusses the general role transfer problem; proposes a role specification mechanism; builds a set of terminologies for role transfer based on a revised Environment-Class, Agent, Role, Group, and Object model; and presents algorithms to validate role transfer while maintaining group viability. The contributions include formulating the problem of role transfer in a generalized form, developing a set of algorithms, and presenting a solution when group members are insufficient.", "paper_title": "Role Transfer Problems and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000260899700021"}
