We propose a runtime virtual machine (VM) mapping framework in a cluster or data center to save energy. The new framework can make reconfiguration decisions on time with the consideration of a low influence on the performance. In the GreenMap framework, one probabilistic, heuristic algorithm is designed for the optimization problem: mapping VMs onto a set of physical machines (PMs) under the constraint of multi-dimensional resource consumptions. Experimental measurements show that the new method can reduce the power consumption by up to 69.2% over base, with few performance penalties. The effectiveness and performance insights are also analytically verified. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
