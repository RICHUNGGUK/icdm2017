Specifically, we propose multipath extensions to a well-studied single path routing protocol known as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV). The resulting protocol is referred to as ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV). The protocol guarantees loop freedom and disjointness of alternate paths. Performance comparison of AOMDV with AODV using ns-2 simulations shows that AOMDV is able to effectively cope with mobility-induced route failures. In particular, it reduces the packet loss by up to 40% and achieves a remarkable improvement in the end-to-end delay (often more than a factor of two). AOMDV also reduces routing overhead by about 30% by reducing the frequency of route discovery operations.
