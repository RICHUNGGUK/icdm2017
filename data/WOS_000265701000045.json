As an illustrative example, the maximum SIR distribution of a mobile receiver surrounded by three base stations (BS) is determined in a closed-form formula for Rayleigh fading channels, and its accuracy is confirmed using simulation results.", "paper_title": "Maximum Signal-to-Interference Ratio for Receivers Communicating with Multiple Transmission Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000045"}
