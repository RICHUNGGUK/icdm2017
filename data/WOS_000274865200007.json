This combination is based on rule templates, instantiating at run-time a set of ABox OWL 2 RL/RDF Jena rules dedicated to a particular TBox that is handled by Pellet. The goal of DLEJena is to handle efficiently, through instantiated rules, the OWL 2 RL ontologies under direct semantics, where classes and properties cannot be at the same time individuals. The TBox semantics are treated by Pellet, reusing in that way efficient and sophisticated TBox DL reasoning algorithms. The experimental evaluation shows that DLEJena achieves more scalable ABox reasoning than the direct implementation of the OWL 2 RL/RDF rule set in the Jena's production rule engine, which is the main target of the system. DLEJena can be also used as a generic framework for applying an arbitrary number of entailments beyond the OWL 2 RL profile. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
