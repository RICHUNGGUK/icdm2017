In order to determine the parameters of the ER-based prediction model, some optimization models have been proposed to train the ER-based prediction model. However, these models are implemented in an offline fashion and thus it is very expensive to train and retrain them when new information is available. This correspondence paper is concerned with developing the recursive algorithms for updating the ER-based prediction model from the probability-based point of view. Using the recursive expectation maximization algorithm, two recursive algorithms are proposed for updating the parameters of the ER-based prediction model under judgmental and numerical outputs, respectively. As such, the proposed algorithms can be used to fine tune the ER-based prediction model online once new information becomes available. We verify the proposed method via a realistic example with missile reliability data.", "paper_title": "Online Updating With a Probability-Based Prediction Model Using Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Reliability Forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000296017400018"}
