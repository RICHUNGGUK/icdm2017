We prove coalescence for two elementary rules and show that there exists infinitely many coalescing CA. We then conduct an experimental study on all elementary CA and show that some rules exhibit a phase transition, which belongs to the universality class of directed percolation.", "paper_title": "Coalescing cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300044"}
