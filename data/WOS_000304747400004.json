In this work, we exploit unidirectional links and employ the clustering technique to design an efficient multicast scheme with asymmetric link support in MANETs. By detecting and utilising unidirectional links, the performance of multicasting in MANETs with unidirectional links is improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher delivery ratio and incurs relatively moderate control overhead with respect to that of ODMRP and ODMRP-ASYM.", "paper_title": "A cluster-based multicast scheme with asymmetric link support in Mobile Ad hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304747400004"}
