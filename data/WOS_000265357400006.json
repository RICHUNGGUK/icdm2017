These structures can be exploited to achieve a high performance due to their versatility, which can reduce manufacturing cost, size, and weight. Using the spectral operator in the WCIP method permits to resolve this inhomogeneous problem. The use of the spectral operator keeps the advantages of the 2D mesh of the circuit plan. Two different examples are studied; the dispersion characteristics of a microstrip transmission line on inhomogeneous substrate and a microstrip T-resonator on a low temperature Co-fired ceramic (LTCC) with embedded vertical air cavities. Compared with measurement and the finite different method, the present technique is found to be efficient with 2D analysis and a required low memory. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
