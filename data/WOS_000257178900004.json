Quality of service (QoS) contracts and service level agreements are an integral part of any computational specification, which are specified in ODP in terms of environment contracts. Up until unified modeling language (UML) version 2, both the lack of precision in the UML definition and the semantic gap between the ODP concepts and the UML constructs hindered its application for ODP computational viewpoint modeling. With the advent of UML 2 the situation has changed, because its semantics have been more precisely defined and it now incorporates a whole new set of concepts more apt for modeling the structure and behavior of distributed systems. In this paper, we explore the benefits provided by the new extension mechanisms of UML for modeling the ODP computational specifications and, in particular, we show how ODP environment contracts can be modeled with this approach.", "paper_title": "Modeling ODP computational specifications using UML", "paper_id": "WOS:000257178900004"}
