These systems usually have a high number of non-functional requirements, resulting from the users' need of being aware of other users with whom to collaborate, that is, the workspace awareness. Objective: This paper aims at evaluating two Requirements Engineering languages i* and CSRML (an extension of in order to determine which is the most suitable one to specify requirements of collaborative systems, taking into account their special characteristics regarding collaboration and awareness. Method: We performed a family of experiments comprising an original experiment and two replicas. They were performed by 30, 45 and 9 Computer Science students, respectively, from Spain and Argentina. These subjects filled in two understandability questionnaires once they analyzed the requirements models of two systems: an e-learning collaborative system and a conference review system with some collaborative aspects support. Both models were specified by using the evaluated languages. Results: The statistical analysis of the family of experiments showed that the understandability was higher for the models specified with CSRML than for those specified with i*, especially for collaborative aspects. This result was also confirmed by the meta-analysis conducted. Conclusions: CSRML surpasses i* when modeling collaborative systems requirements models due to the specific expressiveness introduced to represent collaboration between users and awareness and the new resorts to manage actors and roles.
