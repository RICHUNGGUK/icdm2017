This paper presents a many-valued logic that enables effective reasoning about uncertainty and inconsistency in requirements specifications, motivating the election of six truth values and the definition of a new implication connective. The adequacy of this logic to support a formal development methodology is assessed through a comparison with Belnap's four-valued logic in combination with the classical implications.", "paper_title": "A six-valued logic to reason about uncertainty and inconsistency in requirements specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236613800005"}
