In the present work, the meshless method is used to solve the bending of plates, using a third order shear deformation theory. To avoid manually writing all the terms, the Symbolic Math Toolbox in Mat lab is used to symbolically manipulate expressions. The final terms are written as Mat lab functions to be used by the numerical main program. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
