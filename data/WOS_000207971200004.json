That is, we define the refinement degree and the correctness degree by the weakest precondition transformers. This kind of measurement indicates the degree that a program is refined by another and the degree that a program is correct with respect to a pair of precondition and postcondition. Some properties of this measurement, for example continuity, are discussed.", "paper_title": "Measurement of refinement and correctness", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971200004"}
