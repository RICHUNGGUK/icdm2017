It employs conceptual models of problem domains to drive configuration of an application generator suitable for a related set of applications, such as reservation and resource allocation. The tool supports a two-phase approach of configuring the general architecture for a domain, such as reservation-booking problems, then customisation and generation of specific applications. The tool also provides customisable natural language-style queries for spatial and temporal terms. Development and use of the tool to generate two applications, service engineer call allocation, and airline seat reservation, are reported with a specification exercise to configure the generic architecture to a new problem domain for monitoring-sensing applications. The application generator/tailoring tool is evaluated with novice end users and experts to demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
