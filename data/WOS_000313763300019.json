However, in many applications, there are usually not sufficient labeled training data for the construction of an accurate ranking model. It is therefore desirable to leverage existing training data from other tasks when learning the ranking function for a particular task, an important problem which we tackle in this article utilizing a boosting framework with transfer learning. In particular, we propose to adaptively learn transferable representations called super-features from the training data of both the target task and the auxiliary task. Those super-features and the coefficients for combining them are learned in an iterative stage-wise fashion. Unlike previous transfer learning methods, the super-features can be adaptively learned by weak learners from the data. Therefore, the proposed framework is sufficiently flexible to deal with complicated common structures among different learning tasks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed transfer learning method for two datasets from the Letor collection and one dataset collected from a commercial search engine, and we also compare our methods with several existing transfer learning methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can enhance the ranking functions of the target tasks utilizing the training data from the auxiliary tasks.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Auxiliary Data for Learning to Rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763300019"}
