In the proposed approach, re-identification is formulated as a patch-wise set-to-set matching problem, with each patch set being matched using a specifically learned Mahalanobis distance metric. The proposed approach has two advantages: (1) a patch-wise representation that moderates the ambiguousness of a non-rigid matching problem (of human body) to an approximate rigid one (of body parts); (2) a patch-wise learning algorithm that enables more constraints to be included in the learning process and results in distance metrics of high quality. We evaluate the proposed approach on popular benchmark datasets and confirm its competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Shot People Re-Identification by Patch-Wise Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200025"}
