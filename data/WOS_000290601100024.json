A computational method is developed for constructing such an optimal switching control law. The method proposed is then used to solve a practical problem, which arises from the study of the angular velocity tracking and synchronization of two spacecrafts during their formation flight. The results obtained are highly satisfactory.", "paper_title": "ON A CLASS OF NONLINEAR OPTIMAL SYNCHRONIZATION AND TRACKING CONTROL PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100024"}
