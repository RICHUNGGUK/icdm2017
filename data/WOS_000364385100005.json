In the process of determining the best supplier, the expert judgements might be vague or incomplete due to the inherent uncertainty and imprecision of their perception. In addition to that, the sub-criteria are relevant to each other in the selection of right supplier. In this paper, a novel methodology based on fuzzy set theory and analytic network process (FEANP) is developed to address both the uncertain information involved and the interrelationships among the attributes. This paper concludes with a case study describing the implementation of this model for a real-world supplier selection scenario. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model by comparing with existing method.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy extended analytic network process-based approach for global supplier selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000364385100005"}
