However, volume data contains infinitely many isosurfaces. Furthermore, a single isosurface might contain many connected components, or contours, with each representing a different object surface. Hence, it is often a tedious and time-consuming manual process to find and extract contours that are interesting to users. This paper describes a novel method for automatically extracting salient contours from volume data. For this purpose, we propose a contour gradient tree (CGT) that contains the information of salient contours and their saliency magnitude. We organize the CGT in a hierarchical way to generate a sequence of contours in saliency order. Our method was applied to various medical datasets. Experimental results show that our method can automatically extract salient contours that represent regions of interest in the data.", "paper_title": "Contour Gradient Tree for Automatic Extraction of Salient Object Surfaces from 3D Imaging Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600024"}
