First of all, some convergence theorems for the sum of fuzzy random variables in chance measure and expected value are proved respectively based on the arithmetics of continuous Archimedean triangular norms. Then, a law of large numbers for fuzzy random variables is established by using the obtained convergence theorems. The results of the derived law of large numbers can degenerate to the strong laws of large numbers for random variables and fuzzy variables, respectively.", "paper_title": "T-norm-based limit theorems for fuzzy random variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000279316300001"}
