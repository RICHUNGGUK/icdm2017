Double watermarks are employed, including a short one (perception Hash) for image integrity authentication and a long one for tamper localization and recovery. First, we embed the short watermark into the image in a reversible way. The embedding method is based on histogram modification of discrete Haar wavelet coefficients which is proposed in this paper. Then the long watermark, which is generated by CS sampling on the transformation coefficients of the non-overlapping image blocks, is registered to intellectual property rights (IRP) database for saving in a zero-watermarking way. At the authentication side, the receiver recovers the image after extracting the short watermark, and compares the Hash values generated from the recovered image with the short watermark for authentication. If the authentication is successful, the image can be completely restored to the original state in a reversible way; if the authentication fails, by utilizing the long watermark in the IRP database and CS reconstruction, it can achieve tamper localization and recovery. Meanwhile, experimental results show that the watermarked image has good imperceptibility. The proposed scheme is with good potential to be adopted for reversible image authentication.", "paper_title": "A reversible image authentication scheme based on compressive sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200015"}
