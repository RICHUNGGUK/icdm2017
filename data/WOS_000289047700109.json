Two requirement criteria, namely deadline and payment, are considered and formulated as a user utility maximization function. The optimization problem is decomposed into two parts: congestion control for network transmission rate adjustment and processor allocation for computational capacity adjustment. The parameters from the resource layer are abstracted and provided to a cross-layer optimizer to maximize user's utility function. The effectiveness and performance of the algorithm are evaluated via simulations. Comparison with other algorithms shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
