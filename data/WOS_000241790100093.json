It often degenerates the classification performance. In this paper, we propose an Ensemble of Under-Sampled SVMs or EUS SVMs. We applied the proposed method to two synthetic and six real data sets and we found that it outperformed other methods, especially when the number of patterns belonging to the minority class is very small.", "paper_title": "EUS SVMs: Ensemble of under-sampled SVMs for data imbalance problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100093"}
