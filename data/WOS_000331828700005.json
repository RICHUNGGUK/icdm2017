Our scheme precludes the use of any encryption technique. Applications include domains such as (i) protecting the privacy of storage locations where RFID tags are used for item identification, (ii) secure reading of RFID tags embedded in credit cards, (iii) protecting data transmitted through wireless networks, sensor networks, etc. By carefully managing jammers to produce noise, we show how to reduce the SINR of eavesdroppers to below a threshold for successful reception, without jeopardizing network performance. In this paper, we present algorithms targeted towards optimizing power consumption and number of jammers needed in several settings. Experimental simulations back up our results.", "paper_title": "Optimization Schemes for Protective Jamming", "paper_id": "WOS:000331828700005"}
