In this background, we have modeled the inhibition of 41 substituted phenols on germination rate of Cucumis sativus with extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices using different chemometric tools and compared the ETA relations with non-ETA models derived from different topological indices (Wiener W, Balaban J, Hosoya Z, Zagreb, molecular connectivity indices, E-state indices and kappa shape indices) and physicochemical parameters (AlogP98, MolRef, H_bond_acceptor, H-bond-donor, MW, logK(ow) and E-lumo). Different statistical tools used in this communication are stepwise regression analysis, multiple linear regression with factor analysis as the preprocessing step for variable selection (FA-MLR), multiple linear regression with genetic function approximation (GFA-MLR), partial least squares regression with factor analysis as the preprocessing step for variable selection (FA-PLS), genetic partial least squares (G/PLS) and principal component regression analysis (PCRA). The results show that the best statistical quality along with prediction statistics with ETA descriptors is found in case of GFA-MLR equation. In case of non-ETA descriptors, the best equation is obtained from PCRA considering both equation statistics and predictive ability. When combined descriptors were considered, FA-PLS gave the best equation. The best ETA equation (GFA-MLR) has better leave-one-out Q(2) value than the best non-ETA equation (PCRA). The results suggest that the ETA descriptors are sufficiently rich in chemical information to encode the structural features contributing significantly to the comparative inhibition activity of substituted phenols on germination rate of Cuicumis sativus.", "paper_title": "QSTR with extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices 8.(a) QSAR for the inhibition of substituted phenols on germination rate of Cucumis sativus using chemometric tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466000005"}
