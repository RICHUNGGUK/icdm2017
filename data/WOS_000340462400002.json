Using the theory introduced in Beggs et al. [2,3], we consider the scope and limits of polynomial time computations by such systems. We propose a general polynomial time Church-Turing Thesis for feasible computations by analogue-digital systems, having the non-uniform complexity class BPP//log* as theoretical upper bound. We show why BPP//log* should be replace P/poly, which was proposed by Siegelmann for neural nets [23,24]. Then we examine whether other sources of hypercomputation can be found in analogue-digital systems besides the oracle itself. We prove that the higher polytime limit P/poly can be attained via non-computable analogue-digital interface protocols.", "paper_title": "AN ANALOGUE-DIGITAL CHURCH-TURING THESIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340462400002"}
