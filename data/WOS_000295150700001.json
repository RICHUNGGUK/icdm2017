To perform a marketing campaign, advertisers provide their advertisements to Internet publishers and commissions are paid to the publishers of the advertisements based on the clicks made for the posted advertisements or the purchases of the products of which advertisements posted. Since the payment given to a publisher is proportional to the amount of clicks received for the advertisements posted by the publisher, dishonest publishers are motivated to inflate the number of clicks on the advertisements hosted on their web sites. Since the click frauds are critical for online advertising to be reliable, the online advertisers make the efforts to prevent them effectively. However, the methods used for click frauds are also becoming more complex and sophisticated. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting coalition attacks of click frauds. The coalition attacks of click fraud is one of the latest sophisticated techniques utilized for click frauds because the fraudsters can obtain not only more gain but also less probability of being detected by joining a coalition. We introduce new definitions for the coalition and propose the novel algorithm called CATCH to find such coalitions. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real-life data sets confirm that our notion of coalition allows us to detect coalitions much more effectively than that of previous work.
