We derive exact algorithms with respect to m, n, and r, the number of columns, rows, and vertices, respectively, that contain requests. Specifically, we give an O(mn(2) log m) time, O(r) space algorithm for general (nonuniform) meshes (assuming m >= n). For uniform meshes, we give two algorithms both using O(MN) space. One is an O(MN2) time algorithm, while the other is an algorithm running in O(MN log N) time with high probability and in O(MN2) time in the worst case assuming the weights are independent and identically distributed random variables satisfying certain natural conditions. These improve upon the previously best-known algorithm that runs in O(mn(2)r) time.
