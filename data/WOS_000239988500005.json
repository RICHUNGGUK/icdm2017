The model includes risk-reducing mechanisms corresponding to practical mechanisms like firewalls, stack checking, redundancy, and event tracking that are frequently used to reduce risks in real systems. We also define policy transformation operators that produce new policies that allow the behaviours of the old policy while potentially reducing the risk measure. Sequences of these operators can be used to find policies that are less risky but still implement the initial policy. An example is give for Grid computing.", "paper_title": "Reconfiguring role based access control policies using risk semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239988500005"}
