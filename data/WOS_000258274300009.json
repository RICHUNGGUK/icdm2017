The model incorporates concepts from the TOE framework and Information Technologies' relative advantage and perceived usefulness. From the analysis of data from a sample of 151 SMEs belonging to the computer industry, the main contribution of this work is confirmed: mere groupware adoption do not directly influence organizational performance. Only when groupware benefits related to participation are perceived and in certain contexts, groupware positively affects SMEs performance. Specifically, in those environments given to experimentation and tacit knowledge exchange, the use of participation-oriented groupware contributes to the improvement of organizational performance.", "paper_title": "Groupware uses and influence on performance in SMEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258274300009"}
