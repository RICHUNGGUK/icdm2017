We also propose a high frequency version at the cost of only two cycles of latency per message. Finally we present a multi-mode architecture able to perform either a SHA-384 or SHA-512 hash or to behave as two independent SHA-224 or SHA-256 operators. Such capability adds increased flexibility for applications ranging from a server running multiple streams to independent pseudorandom number generation. We also demonstrate that our architecture achieves a performance comparable to separate implementations while requiring much less hardware. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
