In this paper, a detail analysis including the classification, detection and correction of these ring artifacts is presented. At first, a novel idea for classifying rings into two categories, namely type I and type II rings, is proposed based on their statistical characteristics. The defective detector elements and the dusty scintillator screens result in type I ring and the mis-calibrated detector elements lead to type II ring. Unlike conventional approaches, we emphasize here on the separate detection and correction schemes for each type of rings for their effective removal. For the detection of type I ring, the histogram of the responses of the detector elements is used and a modified fast image inpainting algorithm is adopted to correct the responses of the defective pixels. On the other hand, to detect the type II ring, first a simple filtering scheme is presented based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to smooth the sum curve derived form the type I ring corrected projection data. The difference between the sum curve and its smoothed version is then used to detect their positions. Then, to remove the constant bias suffered by the responses of the mis-calibrated detector elements with view angle, an estimated dc shift is subtracted from them. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using real micro-CT images and is compared with three recently reported algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed technique as compared to the techniques reported in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
