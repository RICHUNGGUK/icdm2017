The results of the simulation showed that technical variance reduced the statistical power and the accuracy of the effect size estimate by a negligible magnitude. This finding therefore suggests that researchers' preconceptions concerning the unsuitability of web experiments for conducting research using response time as a dependent measure are misguided.", "paper_title": "Assessing the Effects of Technical Variance on the Statistical Outcomes of Web Experiments Measuring Response Times", "paper_id": "WOS:000305902500006"}
