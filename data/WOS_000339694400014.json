Collaborative transportation is a promising strategy that can help many enterprises survive and thrive in today's highly competitive market. To help decision makers establish and operate Virtual Enterprises more effectively, an innovative decision support system is proposed in this paper. First, new model for integration of partner selection and collaborative transportation scheduling in Virtual Enterprises is developed. This integrated optimisation problem is very dynamic in nature and it is required to optimise a number of interlinked sub-problems at the same time. Then, a novel Genetic Algorithm with a unique dynamic chromosome representation and genetic operations is developed to find an optimal solution to the integrated problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a representative case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
