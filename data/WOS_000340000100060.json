Similarity is measured by the differences between four types of features: color, shading, texture, and stroke. Feature weightings are learned from crowdsourced experiments. This perceptual similarity enables style-based search. Using our style-based search feature, we demonstrate an application that allows users to create stylistically-coherent clip art mash-ups.", "paper_title": "A Similarity Measure for Illustration Style", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100060"}
