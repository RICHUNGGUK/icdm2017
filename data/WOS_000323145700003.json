This is especially true for higher-order interactions. In conventional logistic regression, interactions are typically ignored. We propose a model selection procedure by implementing an association rules analysis. We do this by (1) exploring the combinations of input variables which have significant impacts to response (via association rules analysis); (2) selecting the potential (low- and high-order) interactions; (3) converting these potential interactions into new dummy variables; and (4) performing variable selections among all the input variables and the newly created dummy variables (interactions) to build up the optimal logistic regression model. Our model selection procedure establishes the optimal combination of main effects and potential interactions. The comparisons are made through thorough simulations. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in all cases. A real-life example is discussed in detail to demonstrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Model selection for logistic regression via association rules analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000323145700003"}
