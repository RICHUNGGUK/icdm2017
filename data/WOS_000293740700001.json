This malleability invites their use as tools for shaping or designing inputs used to drive a separate dynamical system of interest. By specifying an objective function and employing an evolutionary algorithm to manipulate the parameters governing the dynamics of the forcing system, the output of the driven system is made to approach an optimal response subject to desired constraints. The technique's versatility is demonstrated for two different applications: damage detection in structures and phase-locked loop disruption.", "paper_title": "Coupling Evolutionary Algorithms With Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: An Efficient Tool for Excitation Design and Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293740700001"}
