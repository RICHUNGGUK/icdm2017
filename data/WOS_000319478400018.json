Recent GPU developments mean that a PC equipped with multiple GPUs is a viable alternative to a high-cost supercomputer: the Fermi architecture of a single GPU supports uniform virtual addressing, providing a foundation for non-uniform memory access (NUMA) on multi-GPU platforms. Such hardware changes require the user to reconsider the parallel rendering algorithms. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the NUMA-aware image compositing problem, which is the key final stage in sort-last parallel rendering. Based on a proven radix-k strategy, we find one optimal compositing algorithm, which takes advantage of NUMA architecture on the multi-GPU platform. We quantitatively analyze different image compositing modes for practical image compositing, taking into account peer-to-peer communication costs between GPUs. Our experiments on various datasets show that our image compositing method is very fast, an image of a few megapixels can be composited in about 10 ms by eight GPUs.", "paper_title": "NUMA-aware image compositing on multi-GPU platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400018"}
