Its importance will only increase as urbanization continues around the world. In this article, we explore drivers' refueling behavior in urban areas. Compared to questionnaire-based methods of the past, we propose a complete data-driven system that pushes towards real-time sensing of individual refueling behavior and citywide petrol consumption. Our system provides the following: detection of individual refueling events (REs) from which refueling preference can be analyzed; estimates of gas station wait times from which recommendations can be made; an indication of overall fuel demand from which macroscale economic decisions can be made, and a spatial, temporal, and economic view of urban refueling characteristics. For individual behavior, we use reported trajectories from a fleet of GPS-equipped taxicabs to detect gas station visits. For time spent estimates, to solve the sparsity issue along time and stations, we propose context-aware tensor factorization (CATF), a factorization model that considers a variety of contextual factors (e.g., price, brand, and weather condition) that affect consumers' refueling decision. For fuel demand estimates, we apply a queue model to calculate the overall visits based on the time spent inside the station. We evaluated our system on large-scale and real-world datasets, which contain 4-month trajectories of 32,476 taxicabs, 689 gas stations, and the self-reported refueling details of 8,326 online users. The results show that our system can determine REs with an accuracy of more than 90%, estimate time spent with less than 2 minutes of error, and measure overall visits in the same order of magnitude with the records in the field study.", "paper_title": "Sensing the Pulse of Urban Refueling Behavior: A Perspective from Taxi Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000355670300009"}
