The characteristic nonlinear normal compression line for structured soils is described by defining a variable compressibility as a function of plastic straining. No reference to the 'intrinsic' reconstituted state is required. The effect of plastic anisotropy is investigated from virgin constant stress ratio consolidation tests, which provide an accurate description of the equilibrium states of soil fabric. The change of fabric anisotropy is correlated with the change of inclination of the yield and plastic potential surfaces via a pair of improved rotational hardening laws. Experiments on Otaniemi clay samples in both natural and reconstituted states are simulated. Comparisons of numerical predictions with experimental data illustrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed methodology to describe the mechanical behaviour of natural soft clays.
