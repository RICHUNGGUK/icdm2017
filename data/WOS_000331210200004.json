In this paper we prove in a purely algebraic way that the partial distances of a polarizing matrix constructed from the Kronecker product are simply expressed as a product of those of its component matrices. As a result, the exponent of the polarizing matrix is shown to be a weighted sum of the exponents of its component matrices.", "paper_title": "The exponent of a polarizing matrix constructed from the Kronecker product", "paper_id": "WOS:000331210200004"}
