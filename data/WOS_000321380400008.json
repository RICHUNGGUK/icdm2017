In the mean-field approximation, the system exhibits optical bistability for a wide range of parameters. The spectra are numerically calculated for differerent initial states, which show that a single peak in the spectrum splits because of the presence of the optomechanical coupling and the increase of the number of phonon. In addition, the peak position in the cavity field spectra changes due to the Kerr nonlinearity, while the cavity detuning is modified. The strength of spectra determines the size of the photon-phonon conversion capabilities. These results provides a theoretical basis for optical communication.", "paper_title": "THE SPECTRA AND OPTICAL BISTABILITY OF CAVITY FIELD COUPLED TO A MECHANICAL MIRROR", "paper_id": "WOS:000321380400008"}
