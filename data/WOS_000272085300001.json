Recently, various networked embedded systems are penetrating into our life; the unique characteristics of these systems pose many technological challenges. Specifically, the capabilities to interoperate across home appliances and personal digital devices are critical in a smart home environment. As a consequence, the SOA paradigm is introduced as a basis to enhance the service interoperability. However, the service availability is another important concern. In this paper, we focus on augmenting the smart home environment with high service availability. First, we point out the potential problems by adopting the universal plug and play (UPnP) quality of service (QoS) architecture to deliver services with QoS requirements in wireless home networks. After that, we propose a local detour mechanism to tolerate link congestions and node/link failures. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism is based on standard UPnP actions, so that modifications to the existing UPnP QoS architecture are not required. Compared with content-adaptive and resource-adaptive-based approaches operated on fixed service routing paths, our work not only guarantees content quality, but also tolerates topology changes in wireless home networks.", "paper_title": "Increasing Service Availability in a Wireless Home Network Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300001"}
