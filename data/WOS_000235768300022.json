The proposed AAM Fitting algorithm consists of two alternative procedures: the active contour fitting to find the contour sample that best fits the face image and then the active appearance model fitting over the best selected contour. Experimental results show that the proposed active contour based AAM provides better accuracy and convergence characteristics in terms of RMS error and convergence rate, respectively, than the existing robust AAM.", "paper_title": "Background robust face tracking using active contour technique combined active appearance model", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300022"}
