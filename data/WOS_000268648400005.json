Some of these numbers were first obtained by Schubert in his Kalkul der abzahlenden Geometrie. In our approach we construct several compactifications of U-nod, which can be obtained as a sequence of blow-ups of a suitable projective bundle K-nod. We also provide geometric interpretations of the degenerations that appear as exceptional divisors. The Computations have been carried out with the WIT system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
