For each associated component (projection), one can then apply deconvolution routines to smaller (and possibly better) conditioned matrix inversion problems than the matrix inversion problem for the entire image. We demonstrate this new scheme by adaptively deconvolving these components using a combination of regularized inversion and wavelet filtering techniques. This procedure allows us to provide image estimates based on a generalized ridgelet frame. We then devise methods for carrying out this scheme locally to provide estimates based on generalized multiscaled ridgelets which are then filtered and combined to form an estimate from a curvelet-like domain. The techniques presented here suggest a whole new paradigm for developing deconvolution algorithms that incorporate leading deconvolution schemes. Various experimental results show that our methods can perform significantly better than standard deconvolution techniques.", "paper_title": "Image Deconvolution Using a General Ridgelet and Curvelet Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101000012"}
