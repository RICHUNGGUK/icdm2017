This is the case for the model checking of open and closed systems and both controller and reactive synthesis. Interpreted in this context, these problems require one to find a strategy (i.e., a plan) to force the system to fulfill some desired goal, no matter what the opponent (e.g., the environment) does. A strategy essentially constrains the possible behaviors of the system to those that are compatible with the decisions dictated by the plan itself. Therefore, finding a strategy to meet some goal basically reduces to identifying a portion of the model of interest (i.e., one of its substructures) that satisfies that goal. In this view, the ability to reason about substructures becomes a crucial aspect for several fundamental problems. In this article, we present and study a new branching-time temporal logic, called Substructure Temporal Logic (STL star for short), whose distinctive feature is to allow for quantifying over the possible substructure of a given structure. The logic is obtained by adding four new temporal-like operators to CTL star, whose interpretation is given relative to the partial order induced by a suitable substructure relation. STL star turns out to be very expressive and allows one to capture in a very natural way many well-known problems, such as module checking, reactive synthesis, and reasoning about games in a wide sense. A formal account of the model-theoretic properties of the new logic and results about (un) decidability and complexity of related decision problems are also provided.", "paper_title": "Reasoning About Substructures and Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000357932800007"}
