Every BP-system has an underlying ordinary Petri net, a T-system. It further has a second ordinary net attached, a free-choice system. We prove that a BP-system is safe and live if the T-system and the free-choice system are safe and live and the free-choice system in addition has no frozen tokens. This result is the converse of a theorem of Genrich and Thiagarajan and proves an old conjecture. As a consequence we obtain two results about the existence of safe and live BP-systems with prescribed ordinary Petri nets. For the proof of these theorems we introduce the concept of a morphism between Petri nets as a means of comparing different Petri nets. We then apply the classical theory of free-choice systems.", "paper_title": "Free-Choice Petri Nets without Frozen Tokens, and Bipolar Synchronization Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276350300008"}
