We carry out molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of a set of six non-peptide small-molecule inhibitors with the MDM2. The relative binding free energies calculated using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method produce a good correlation with experimentally determined results. The study shows that the van der Waals energies are the largest component of the binding free energy for each complex, which indicates that the affinities of these inhibitors for MDM2 are dominated by shape complementarity. The A-ligands and the B-ligands are the same except for the conformation of 2,2-dimethylbutane group. The quantum mechanics and the binding free energies calculation also show the B-ligands are the more possible conformation of ligands. Detailed binding free energies between inhibitors and individual protein residues are calculated to provide insights into the inhibitor-protein binding model through interpretation of the structural and energetic results from the simulations. The study shows that G1, G2 and G3 group mimic the Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26 residues in p53 and their interactions with MDM2, but the binding model of G4 group differs from the original design strategy to mimic Leu22 residue in p53.", "paper_title": "A computational analysis of the binding model of MDM2 with inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000279710000004"}
