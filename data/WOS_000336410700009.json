By using the stochastic control theory, the general expression of utility indiffierence price on convertible bonds is obtained under the CIR interest rate model. Furthermore, using the proposed theoretical model, we present an empirical pricing study of China's market, using three convertible bonds and more than 70 months of daily market prices. The parameters value is estimated by the maximum likelihood method, and the prices of convertible bonds are simulated by the Monte Carlo approach. The empirical results indicate that the theoretical prices are higher than the actual market prices 0.24-4.58%, and the utility indiffierence prices are better than the Black-Scholes (BS) prices.", "paper_title": "Utility indiffierence pricing of convertible bonds", "paper_id": "WOS:000336410700009"}
