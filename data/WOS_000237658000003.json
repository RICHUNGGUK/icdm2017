For video indexing, video scene transition detection is an essential step to segment the video. Current techniques for scene change detection tend to suffer from a major limitation as most of them cannot identify scene transitions in the compressed domain. Since most video is expected to be stored in the compressed domain, scene transition detection in this domain is highly desirable. In this paper an algorithm for video scene change detection is proposed to overcome this limitation. In this scheme, properties of the B-frames are used as it is capable of measuring the correlation between two adjacent reference frames. The results show that this scheme performs better than schemes based on P-frames. Proposed scheme can be directly applied with compressed data with minimum decompression and hence it is computationally efficient and makes real time implementations possible. Results show that video scene transitions can be identified satisfactorily with the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Sudden scene change detection in compressed video using interpolated macroblocks in B-frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658000003"}
