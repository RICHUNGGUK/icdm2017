System migration tasks such as software reprogramming, however, will interrupt normal sensing and data processing operations of a sensor node. Although such tasks are occasionally invoked, the long time of such tasks may disable the network from detecting critical events, posing a severe threat to many sensitive applications. In this paper, we present the first formal study on the problem of downtime-free migration. We demonstrate that the downtime can be effectively eliminated, by partitioning the sensors into subsets, and let them perform migration tasks successively with the rest still performing normal services. We then present a series of effective algorithms, and further extend our solution to a practical distributed and localized implementation. The performance of these algorithms have been evaluated through extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve good balance between the sensing quality and system migration time.", "paper_title": "On Sensor Network Reconfiguration for Downtime-Free System Migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000263978900013"}
