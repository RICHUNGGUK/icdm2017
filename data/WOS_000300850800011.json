The bounds are valid when computed in rounding to nearest, no higher order terms are necessary, and they are best possible. For summation there is no restriction on the number of summands. The proofs are short by using a new tool for the estimation of errors in floating-point computations which cures drawbacks of the \"unit in the last place (ulp)\". The presented estimates are nice and simple, and closer to what one may expect.", "paper_title": "Error estimation of floating-point summation and dot product", "paper_id": "WOS:000300850800011"}
