Fundamental conditions for availability of system behaviors of such network systems are clarified in a form of P-level fixed point theorem for system of fuzzy-set-valued operators. Here, the proof of this theorem is accomplished in a weak topology introduced into the Banach space.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy estimation theory for available operation of extremely complicated large-scale network systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300018"}
