First we analyze the reason for the saturation problem of the elevators of near space vehicles. Based on the analysis results, we propose a class of compound control schemes of elevators and reaction control systems (RCS). In addition, two RCS configuration schemes are provided for the design course. Furthermore, comparisons and analysis of the two classes of RCS thrusters with combination logic and fault reconstruction are presented. By choosing the RCS thrusters power on logic deadzone appropriately, system oscillations generated by opening and closing the RCS thrusters frequently can be avoided. The six degrees of freedom simulation results are presented to show the efficiency of the designed control law.", "paper_title": "RCS COMPOUND CONTROL DESIGN FOR NEAR SPACE VEHICLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305169200028"}
