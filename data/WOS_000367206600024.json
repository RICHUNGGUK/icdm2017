However, traditional techniques treat data management as an isolated process on only selected individual nodes. In this article, we propose an aggressive data reduction architecture, which is based on error control within sensor segments and integrates three parallel dynamic control mechanisms. We demonstrate that this architecture not only achieves energy savings but also guarantees the data accuracy specified by the application. Furthermore, based on this architecture, we propose two implementations. The experimental results show that both implementations can raise the energy savings while keeping the error at an predefined and acceptable level. We observed that, compared with the basic implementation, the enhancement implementation achieves a relatively higher data accuracy. Moreover, the enhancement implementation is more suitable for the harsh environmental monitoring applications. Further, when both implementations achieve the same accuracy, the enhancement implementation saves more energy. Extensive experiments on realistic historical soil temperature data confirm the efficacy and efficiency of two implementations.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Data Reduction in Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000367206600024"}
