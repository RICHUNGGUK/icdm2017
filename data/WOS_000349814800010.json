This trust model calculates trust value of nodes through two kinds of trusts: private trust and interactive trust of a node. Private trust focuses on the past record of a node's sensing and its remaining energy. Interactive trust cares for the interaction of a node with its neighbors. This trust model can recognize faulty nodes inside a network, reduce their impaction to data acquisition, and select a trust routing for precise data transmission. A simulation is given and shows that this trust model has a higher performance than TMS and ECCR in some aspects. But it consumes more energy than ECCR for its comprehensive structure of data.", "paper_title": "A Comprehensive Trust Model Based on Multi-factors for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000349814800010"}
