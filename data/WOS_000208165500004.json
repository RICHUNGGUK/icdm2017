It is unclear, however, whether these genes appeared at the same time as the origin of seed plants and if all these genes are necessary and sufficient for seed development for all seed plants. By conducting a genome-wide comparative analysis of the putative AFL genes in various plant species, we found that the ABI3 homologous genes existed in all land plant genomes, but the FUS3 homologous were present only in seed plant genomes and the LEC2-like sequences only in dicot genomes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the AFL genes had undergone successive rounds of gene duplication and subsequent diversification during land plant evolution, resulting in the stepwise origin of the ABI3, FUS3 and LEC2 genes. Comparison of gene structure of the AFL genes revealed a trend of decreasing in the number of conserved domains from ABI3 to FUS3 and LEC2.", "paper_title": "STEPWISE ORIGIN AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSIFICATION OF THE AFL SUBFAMILY B3 GENES DURING LAND PLANT EVOLUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000208165500004"}
