The aim of this work is to provide a set of guidelines to develop a knowledge-based process asset libraries (PALs), using a Wiki (as a Web 2.0 technology), to store software engineering best practices. Fieldwork was carried out in a two-year training course of agile development process. This was validated in two phases (with and without PAL), each of which consisted of two stages: training and project. The study demonstrates that on the one hand, the learning process can be improved using a PAL-Wiki to transfer and share the software process knowledge, and on the other hand, junior software engineers developed software products with a greater degree of independence.", "paper_title": "Knowledge repository to improve agile development processes learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000284688500007"}
