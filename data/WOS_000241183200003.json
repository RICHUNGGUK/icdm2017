Using this method, the reflection, absorption and transmission coefficients of such plasmas for right-hand circularly waves are studied and the effects of the continuously changing external magnetic field on the power of the electromagnetic waves propagated in magnetized plasma slabs with fixed parameters are presented. Our method enables more detailed numerical analyses which are useful in practical applications pertaining to the control of the reflection or absorption coefficients of electromagnetic wave through a uniform magnetized plasma slab by adjusting the external magnetic field.
