Two kinds of incomplete measurements, namely measurements with random communication delays and measurements with stochastic packet losses, are simultaneously considered. By properly augmenting the states of the original system and the fault detection filter, the fault detection filter design problem can be formulated as an H(infinity) filtering problem. Attention is focused on the design of a fault detection filter such that, for all unknown input and incomplete measurements, the error between residual and weighted fault is made as small as possible. A sufficient condition for the existence of the desired fault detection filter is established in terms of a linear matrix inequality. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Networked fault detection with random communication delays and packet losses", "paper_id": "WOS:000258591600002"}
