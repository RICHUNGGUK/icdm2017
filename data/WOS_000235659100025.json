However, tip to now, little work has been done in WSAN, especially in security issues. In this paper, we first discuss several challenges in security of WSAN. Aiming at these challenges, we propose our key establishment scheme for heterogeneous nodes in WSAN. In our scheme, authentication and key establishment can be finished with just one round-trip communication, Further more, our scheme is especially designed for heterogeneous architectures. Capability of resource-rich actors are fully used. Finally, our scheme and existing schemes for Ad Hoc Networks and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) are compared and analyzed.", "paper_title": "Key establishment between heterogenous nodes in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100025"}
