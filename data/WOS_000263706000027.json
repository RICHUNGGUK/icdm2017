The model presented here combines the use of an evidential reasoning approach based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions with real options analysis. We discuss the combined use of both theories and show that combining the Dempster-Shafer theory with real options analysis provides flexible support that takes account of the multi-dimensional nature of implementation decisions. We also go into the fundamental requirements that need to be met when selecting a strategy for implementing an IT infrastructure. We conclude by outlining a number of the model's limitations.
