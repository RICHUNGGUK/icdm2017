Heuristic-ALJC includes also a simple acknowledgement based adaptation of the transmission rate and acts on the basis of feedback information about the overall network status estimated in terms of maximum allowable network throughput and link quality (lossiness). Heuristic-ALJC is implemented through two smartphone Apps (transmitter and receiver) and is suitable to be employed to transmit video streams over networks based on time varying and possibly lossy channels. A deep performance investigation, carried out through a real implementation of the Apps over Android smartphones, compares Heuristic-ALJC with static schemes.", "paper_title": "Smartphones Apps Implementing a Heuristic Joint Coding for Video Transmissions over Mobile Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340595900012"}
