A system in this class is composed of two parts: an uncertain linear switched part and a non-linear part, which are also switched systems. When all the subsystems are stabilisable and have an L-2-gain, the switched feedback control law and the switching law are designed respectively using average dwell-time method such that the corresponding closed-loop switched system is exponentially stable and achieves a weighted L-2-gain.", "paper_title": "Stabilisation and L-2-gain analysis for a class of uncertain switched non-linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033900008"}
