While many different types of queries have been studied on uncertain data, there is no previous work on answering RNN queries on uncertain data. In this paper, we formalize probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor query that is to retrieve the objects from the uncertain data that have higher probability than a given threshold to be the RNN of an uncertain query object. We develop an efficient algorithm based on various novel pruning approaches that solves the probabilistic RNN queries on multidimensional uncertain data. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is even more efficient than a sampling-based approximate algorithm for most of the cases and is highly scalable.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Reverse Nearest Neighbor Queries on Uncertain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000274654800007"}
