For base fields relevant to STBCs, these criteria are exploited, via Springer's theorem, to construct several explicit infinite families of (bi-) quaternion division algebras. These are used to obtain new 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 STBCs.", "paper_title": "Quadratic Forms and Space-Time Block Codes From Generalized Quaternion and Biquaternion Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800043"}
