Structural damage is detected from the changes in FRFs from the original intact state. The measurements are always contaminated by noise, and sufficient data are often difficult to obtain; making it difficult to detect damage with a finite number of data. To surmount this, we introduce hypothesis testing based on the bootstrap method to statistically prevent detection errors due to measurement noise. The proposed method iteratively zooms in on the damaged elements by excluding the elements which were assessed as undamaged from among the damage candidates, step by step. The proposed approach was applied to numerical simulations using a 2D frame structure and its efficiency was confirmed.", "paper_title": "Structural damage detection method using uncertain frequency response functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000235842400007"}
