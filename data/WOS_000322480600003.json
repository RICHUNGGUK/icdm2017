Reliability of service-oriented systems heavily depends on the remote Web services as well as the unpredictable Internet connections. Designing efficient and effective reliability prediction approaches of Web services has become an important research issue. In this article, we propose two personalized reliability prediction approaches of Web services, that is, neighborhood-based approach and model-based approach. The neighborhood-based approach employs past failure data of similar neighbors (either service users or Web services) to predict the Web service reliability. On the other hand, the model-based approach fits a factor model based on the available Web service failure data and use this factor model to make further reliability prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted with our real-world Web service datasets, which include about 23 millions invocation results on more than 3,000 real-world Web services. The experimental results show that our proposed reliability prediction approaches obtain better reliability prediction accuracy than other competing approaches.", "paper_title": "Personalized Reliability Prediction of Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000322480600003"}
