After a short review of the basic model and extensions, we compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of two research simulation codes based on the LB and the finite-element method (FEM) for two-dimensional incompressible laminar flow problems with complex geometries. We also study the influence of the Mach number on the solution, since LB methods are weakly compressible by nature, by comparing compressible and incompressible results obtained from the LB code and the commercial code CFX. Our results indicate, that for the quantities studied (lift, drag, pressure drop) our LB prototype is competitive for incompressible transient problems, but asymptotically slower for steady-state Stokes flow because the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the classical LB-method is not optimal compared to the multigrid solvers incorporated in the FEM and CFX code. For the weakly compressible case, the LB approach has a significant wall clock time advantage as compared to CFX. In addition, we demonstrate that the influence of the finite Mach number in LB simulations of incompressible flow is easily underestimated. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
