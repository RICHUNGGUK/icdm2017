In this paper, we address the problem of capacity provisioning in a network subject to demand uncertainty such that a network coded multicast is applied as the data delivery mechanism with limited budget to purchase extra capacity. We address some particular type of uncertainty sets that obtain a tractable constrained capacity provisioning problem. For this reason, we first formulate a mathematical model for the problem under uncertain demand. Then, a robust optimization model is proposed for the problem to optimize the worst-case system performance. The robustness and effectiveness of the developed model are demonstrated by numerical results. The robust solution achieves more than 10% reduction and is better than the deterministic solution in the worst case.", "paper_title": "Robust Capacity Planning in Network Coding under Demand Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000364202200005"}
