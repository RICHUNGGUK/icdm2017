On the microscale the motile particle is modeled as an operator stable Levy process with stationary, ergodic, Markov drift. The micro to meso and meso to macro scale homogenization is handled with generalized central limit theorems. On the mesoscale the Lagrangian drift (or the Lagrangian acceleration) is assumed Levy to account for the fractal character of many natural porous systems. Diffusion on the mesoscale is a result of the microscale asymptotics while diffusion on the macroscale results from the mesoscale asymptotics. Renormalized Fokker-Planck equations with time dependent dispersion tensors and fractional derivatives are presented at the macro scale. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
