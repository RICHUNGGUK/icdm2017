Further research found that the main limitation of SRC is the assumption of pixel-accurate alignment between the test image and the training set. A. Wagner used a series of linear programs that iteratively minimize the sparsity of the registration error. In this paper, we propose another face registration method called three-point positioning method. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves better performance.", "paper_title": "Registration Method of Sparse Representation Classification Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000304573100017"}
