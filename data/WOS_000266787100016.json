The formulation of the objective function for the minimization problem is based on the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the system. A novel strategy for the control of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) parameters based on the Nelder-Mead algorithm (Simplex method) is presented; consequently, the convergence of the PSOS becomes independent of the heuristic constants and its stability and confidence are enhanced. The formulated hybrid method performs better in different benchmark functions than the Simulated Annealing (SA) and the basic PSO (PSOb). Two damage identification problems, taking into consideration the effects of noisy and incomplete data, were studied: first, a 10-bar truss and second, a cracked free-free beam, both modeled with finite elements. In these cases, the damage location and extent were successfully determined. Finally, a non-linear oscillator (Duffing oscillator) was identified by PSOS providing good results.
