As in other evolutionary algorithms, first the population position diversity will be discussed followed by the discussion and definition of population velocity diversity which is different from that in other evolutionary algorithms since only PSO has the velocity parameter. Furthermore, a diversity measurement called cognitive diversity is discussed and defined, which can reveal clustering information about where the current population of particles intends to move towards. The diversity of the current population of particles and the cognitive diversity together tell what the convergence/divergence stage the current population of particles is at and which stage it moves towards.", "paper_title": "Monitoring of particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000207970900004"}
