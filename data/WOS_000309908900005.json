Testing serves as the most widely used approaches to determine that the intended functionalities are performed correctly and achieve the desired level of services; however, it is also a labor-intensive and expensive process during the whole software life cycle. Most current testing processes are often technique-centered, rather than organized to maximize business value. In this article, we extend and elaborate the 4+1 theoretical lenses of Value-based Software Engineering (VBSE) framework in the software testing process; propose a multi-objective feature prioritization strategy for testing planning and controlling, which aligns the internal testing process with value objectives coming from customers and markets. Our case study in a real-life business project shows that this method allows reasoning about the software testing process in different dimensions: it helps to manage the testing process effectively and efficiently, provides information for continuous internal software process improvement, and increases customer satisfaction, which makes winners of all success-critical stakeholders (SCSs) in the software testing process.
