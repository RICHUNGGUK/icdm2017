Our technique employs a new shadow pre-filtering method based on an extended exponential shadow mapping theory. The algorithm achieves faithful contact shadows by adopting an optimal approximation to exponential shadow reconstruction function. Benefiting from a novel overflow free summed area table tile grid data structure, numerical stability is guaranteed and error filtering response is avoided. By integrating an adaptive anisotropic filtering method, the proposed algorithm can produce high quality smooth shadows both in large penumbra areas and in high frequency sharp transitions, meanwhile guarantee cheap memory consumption and high performance.", "paper_title": "Exponential Soft Shadow Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000321946800012"}
