The usefulness of these devices rests on being able to extract properties of the surface from the sample. We show that, under certain sampling conditions, the minimum cycle basis of a nearest neighbor graph of the sample encodes topological information about the surface and yields bases for the trivial and non-trivial loops of the surface. We validate our results by experiments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Cycle bases of graphs and sampled manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000250909300004"}
