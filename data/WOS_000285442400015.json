Whereas the role of firms is clear for commercial OS projects, it still needs investigation for projects based on communities. This paper analyses the impact of firms' participation on popularity and internal software design quality for 643 SourceForge.net projects. Results show that firms' involvement improves the ranking of OS projects, but, on the other hand. puts corporate constraints to OS developing practices, thus leading to lower structural software design quality.
