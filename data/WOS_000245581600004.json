This CPG is simulated, in accordance with Ekeberg's original model, and optimised alternatives are generated with genetic algorithms (GAs). A two-phase GA is adopted: (1) to evolve neuron-descriptive parameters and synaptic weights of the neural oscillator for a single lamprey segment, (2) to generate interconnections between segments. Results demonstrate that Ekeberg's prototype is not a unique solution and that simpler versions with wider operational ranges can be generated. Evolved solutions outperform the swimming capabilities of a modelled biological organism, as an initial step in understanding how to control wave power devices, with similar motion to the lamprey.
