Based on regional target detection and fuzzy region rules, a fuzzy region-based multi-sensor image fusion approach is proposed in this paper. The similarity measure weight is adapted to this dynamic image fusion algorithm, while the tracking method uses the proposed multi-cue mean-shift tracking algorithm. Three experimental results using real world image sequences are evaluated using the steady state square root mean error. The fusion and tracking experiments indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient when aiming at a target moving from one area to a different area, which meets the robustness and real-time requirements.", "paper_title": "A multi-cue mean-shift target tracking approach based on fuzzified region dynamic image fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900009"}
