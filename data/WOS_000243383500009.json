The results include exact and asymptotic formulas for moments and an asymptotic distribution that can be expressed in terms of either the Brownian snake or ISE. The proofs are based on computing expectations for a subcritical binary Galton-Watson tree, and studying asymptotics as the Galton-Watson process approaches a critical one.", "paper_title": "Left and right pathlengths in random binary trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500009"}
