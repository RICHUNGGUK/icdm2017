In the past, the design of QR code generators only aimed to achieve high decodability and the produced QR codes usually look like random black-and-white patterns without visual semantics. In recent years, researchers have been tried to endow the QR code with aesthetic elements and QR code beautification has been formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the visual perception distortion subject to acceptable decoding rate. However, the visual quality of the QR code generated by existing methods still leaves much to be desired. In this work, we propose a two-stage approach to generate QR code with high quality visual content. In the first stage, a baseline QR code with reliable decodability but poor visual quality is first synthesized based on the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure. In the second stage, a rendering mechanism is designed to improve the visual quality while avoiding affecting the decodability of the QR code. The experimental results show that the proposed method substantially enhances the appearance of the QR code and the processing complexity is near real-time.", "paper_title": "Efficient QR Code Beautification With High Quality Visual Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583000012"}
