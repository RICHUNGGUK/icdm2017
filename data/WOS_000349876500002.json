It plots trajectories of both passive particles trapped near the ocean surface and oil slicks. Input data come from an operational configuration of the ROMS ocean model focused on the Euroregion Galicia (Spain) - North Portugal, however, this tool is easily adaptable to run with outputs coming from any operational high resolution ocean model configuration. The Prestige accident is used here in hindcast mode to demonstrate the main characteristics of Alavai. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
