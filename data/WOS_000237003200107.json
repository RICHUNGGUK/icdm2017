We report on the experiences with a regularity centred approach for grid based PDE software that aims to combine geometric flexibility with run time efficiency. An unstructured coarse grid that describes the problem geometry is repeatedly Subdivided in a regular fashion to yield a hierarchy of grids on which the approximation is Sought. By construction, the grid hierarchy is well suited for multilevel methods. The gain in run time performance that results from the exploitation of the patch wise regularity of the refined grids over standard implementations will be illustrated.", "paper_title": "Constructing flexible, yet run time efficient PDE solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200107"}
