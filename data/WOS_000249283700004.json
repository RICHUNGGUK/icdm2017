This combinatorial optimization problem arises in the context of discovering so-called cis-regulatory modules in regulatory DNA sequences. There are some similarities between this problem and the problem of finding cliques in graphs. These similarities are here utilized to develop novel branch-and-bound algorithms for the best barbeque problem. The algorithms are evaluated using random data. Compared with previously used algorithms, the new algorithms are capable of solving substantially larger instances, which are crucial for some application scenarios.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the combinatorial best barbeque problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000249283700004"}
