To remove the duplication-induced overhead, we propose a parallel scheme that disjointly re-distributes the overlapping mesh points among irregularly shaped subdomains. The essence is to replace the duplicated local computations by an increased volume of the inter-processor communication. Since the number of inter-processor messages remains the same, the bandwidth consumption by an increased number of data values can often be justified by the removal of a considerably larger number of floating-point operations and irregular memory accesses in unstructured applications. Obtainable gain in the resulting parallel performance is demonstrated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Improving the performance of large-scale unstructured PDE applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200085"}
