In this paper, this problem is tackled by a general family of models, called multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers (MBCs). This probabilistic graphical model organizes class and feature variables as three different subgraphs: class subgraph, feature subgraph, and bridge (from class to features) subgraph. Under the standard 0-1 loss function, the most probable explanation (MPE) must be computed, for which we provide theoretical results in both general MBCs and in MBCs decomposable into maximal connected components. Moreover, when computing the MPE, the vector of class values is covered by following a special ordering (gray code). Under other loss functions defined in accordance with a decomposable structure, we derive theoretical results on how to minimize the expected loss. Besides these inference issues, the paper presents flexible algorithms for learning MBC structures from data based on filter, wrapper and hybrid approaches. The cardinality of the search space is also given. New performance evaluation metrics adapted from the single-class setting are introduced. Experimental results with three benchmark data sets are encouraging, and they outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-label classification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
