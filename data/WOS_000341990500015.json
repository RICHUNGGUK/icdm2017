The construction of such a system that has high reliability is of great significance in ensuring the safe operation and all-weather operation of trains. This study analyses the collaborative needs of a highspeed railway dispatching system, and investigates the organizational coordination of the system in terms of a collaborative plan, organizational coordination, information coordination, etc. The coordination mechanism of a high-speed railway dispatching command system should be based on three perspectives: (1) The vertical hierarchical level of the high-speed railway dispatching system's coordination, (2) The primary and auxiliary synergies of the horizontal professional subsystem, and (3) The cooperation between dispatching stations, as well as between the high-speed railway and the existing line command system. In this paper, we propose a theory of coordination between a high-speed railway dispatching command system and the existing lines, as well as a method for its implementation. Together, this theory and method will provide theoretical guidance and technical support in the development of a dispatching command system.", "paper_title": "COLLABORATIVE MECHANISM OF HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY DISPATCHING SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000341990500015"}
