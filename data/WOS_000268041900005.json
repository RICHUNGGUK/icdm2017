The proposed algorithm locally computes Zernike moments and modifies them to embed watermarks, achieving robustness against cropping and local geometric attacks. Moreover, to deal with scaling attacks, the proposed algorithm extracts salient region parameters, which consist of an invariant centroid and a salient scale, and transmits them to the decoder. The parameters are used at the decoder to normalize a suspect image and detect watermarks. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm detects watermarks with low error rates, even if watermarked images are distorted by various geometric attacks as well as signal processing attacks.
