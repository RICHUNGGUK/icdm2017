The model is grounded in several well-established theories in Information Systems with influences from economics and market research and covers the diffusion of ontologies from three main perspectives: human, technology and environment (HTE). A case study research methodology was designed in order to collect and analyse empirical data in a qualitative manner based on the HTE model. During the first part of the study, individual and group interviews were conducted with 14 industry experts in four South Australian (SA) road authorities at state and local government level. The SA findings suggest that factors from the three dimensions, human, technology and environment, could act as either drivers or inhibitors of the diffusion process at various stages, operating as direct or indirect factors. A preliminary Ontology Diffusion Model (ODM) is proposed.", "paper_title": "A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE DIFFUSION OF ONTOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287427800006"}
