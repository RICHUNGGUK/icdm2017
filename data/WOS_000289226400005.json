The core of adaptive-impulsive synchronization of chaotic systems is to design suitable nonlinear adaptive-impulsive controllers to attain certain aims. Based on invariant principle of impulsive dynamical systems, nonlinear adaptive-impulsive controllers are derived to make the state of chaotic systems synchronized. Accordingly. concrete nonlinear adaptive-impulsive control scheme is designed for quantum cellular neural network (Quantum-CNN). Moreover, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear controllers, which is more effective than that in the previous literature. (C) 2010 IMACS.
