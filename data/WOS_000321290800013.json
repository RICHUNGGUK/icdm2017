In particular, we focus our attention on single and multi-tape Turing machines, which are described and observed through the lens of a new mathematical language, which is strongly based on three methodological ideas borrowed from physics and applied to mathematics, namely: the distinction between the object (we speak here about a mathematical object) of an observation and the instrument used for this observation; interrelations holding between the object and the tool used for the observation; the accuracy of the observation determined by the tool. Results of the observation executed by the traditional and new languages are compared and discussed.", "paper_title": "Single-tape and multi-tape Turing machines through the lens of the Grossone methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800013"}
