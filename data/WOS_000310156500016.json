In this paper, we give inapproximability results for the minimum and maximum weight problems of subgroup permutation codes under several well-known metrics. Based on previous works, we prove that under Hamming, Lee, Cayley, Kendall's tau, Ulam's, and l(p) distance metrics, 1) there is no polynomial-time 2(log1-epsilon n)-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight problem for any constant epsilon > 0 unless NP subset of DTIME(2(polylog(n)))(quasi-polynomial time), and 2) there is no polynomial-time r-approximation algorithm for the minimum weight problem for any constant r > 1 unless P = NP. Under L-infinity-metric, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum weight problem within factor 2 - epsilon for any constant epsilon > 0. We also prove that for any constant epsilon > 0, it is NP-hard to approximate the maximum weight within p root 3/2 - epsilon under l(p) distance metric, and within 3/2 - epsilon under Hamming, Lee, Cayley, Kendall's tau, and Ulam's distance metrics.
