The method considered here is by inducing motion on the (low resolution) image acquisition device which then generates a number of low resolution images - this is the data we use for the super resolution reconstruction. Our main concern is in investigating a number of motion types and providing the conditions which will guarantee the feasibility of the super resolution reconstruction from data available.
