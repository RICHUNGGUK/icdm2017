By making use of the results of high-dimensional Bell measurement, the sender and the receiver can encode and decode the message respectively by performing the modular addition and subtraction. Two mutually complementary bases are constructed; and according to the property of mutual complement, a method for checking security of the high-dimensional quantum channel is put forward. Some common attack strategies are analyzed, and the corresponding error rates are calculated. Then the upper bound of the threshold of error rate is deduced.", "paper_title": "Deterministic secure quantum communication without unitary operation based on high-dimensional entanglement swapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000299517500011"}
