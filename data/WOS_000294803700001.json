Many approaches, including cluster analysis and concept analysis, have been proposed to identify components from business models. These approaches classify business elements into a set of components by analyzing their properties. However, most of them do not consider the difference in their properties for the business elements, which may decrease the accuracy of the identification results. Furthermore, component identification by partitioning business elements cannot reflect which features are responsible for the generation of certain results. This paper deals with a new approach for component identification from business models using fuzzy formal concept analysis. First, the membership between business elements and their properties is quantified and transformed into a fuzzy formal context, from which the concept lattice is built using a refined incremental algorithm. Then the components are selected from the concepts according to the concept dispersion and distance. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency are validated by applying our approach in the real-life cases and experiments.", "paper_title": "Afuzzy formal concept analysis based approach for business component identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000294803700001"}
