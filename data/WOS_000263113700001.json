LoC design is a multidisciplinary approach of adapting classical biochemical assays to a miniaturized platform by exploiting advances in microelectronic and microfluidic technologies. By offering low cost and integrated devices, CMOS based LoCs could be amenable to a large number of biological and biochemical assays for disease diagnostics and biotechnology in the near future. While an exhaustive, all-encompassing review of CMOS-based LoCs is beyond the scope of this review, we have focused on the design and implementation of CMOS-based capacitive sensor LoCs for the most important biochemical applications. For each application, the corresponding biochemical sensing layer, interface circuit and microfluidic packaging technique are discussed based on the recent literature studies.", "paper_title": "CMOS based capacitive sensor laboratory-on-chip: a multidisciplinary approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000263113700001"}
