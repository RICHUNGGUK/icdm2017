To achieve this, we use the concept of superimposed information (SI), which enables users to (a) deal with information of varying granularity (sub-document to complete document), and (b) select or work with information elements at sub-document level while retaining the original context.", "paper_title": "SIERRA - A superimposed application for enhanced image description and retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500063"}
