With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture, and the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model is put forth, and the rules are defined. To improve the detect efficiency, classification and partition of event instance is utilized. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm that is considered as one of the contributions. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing. Complex event processing can improve operation efficiency and discover more actionable information, which is justified by the application.", "paper_title": "Architecture, implementation and application of complex event processing in enterprise information systems based on RFID", "paper_id": "WOS:000259569600005"}
