The Euler-Lagrange systems are heterogeneous and uncertain and contain bounded, exogenous disturbances. The network leader has a time-varying trajectory which is known to only a subset of the follower agents. A robust integral sign of the error-based decentralized control law is developed to yield semiglobal asymptotic agent synchronization and leader tracking.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Synchronization of a Leader-Follower Network of Uncertain Euler-Lagrange Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365085700008"}
