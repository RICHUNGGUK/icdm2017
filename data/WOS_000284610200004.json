Two new functional extensions for a Web server system supporting business-to-consumer (B2C) activity are proposed. The first new feature is an ability to differentiate the key customers of the Web store and to offer higher QoWS to more valued ones. The second new function concerns offering high QoWS to all customers finalizing their purchase transactions. A new approach to B2C service differentiation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis is presented. A simulation model of the B2C Web server system and some results of the system performance for our approach in comparison with first in-first out (FIFO) scheduling are discussed.", "paper_title": "BUSINESS-ORIENTED ADMISSION CONTROL AND REQUEST SCHEDULING FOR e-COMMERCE WEBSITES", "paper_id": "WOS:000284610200004"}
