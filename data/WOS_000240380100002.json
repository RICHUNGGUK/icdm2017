Despite a number of secure processor designs have been proposed, they typically made trade-offs between security and efficiency. This article proposes a new secure processor architecture called M-TREE, which offers a significant performance gain while without compromising security. The M-TREE architecture uses a novel hierarchical Message Authentication Code Tree (MACTree) for protecting applications' integrity at a minimal performance overhead. M-TREE also introduces a new one-time-pad class encryption mechanism that accelerates security computation over the existing block cipher-based schemes with high security guarantee. Based on the results of our performance simulation, the performance overhead of the M-TREE integrity check mechanism is as small as 14% in the worst case, a substantial improvement over the 60% slowdown reported by previously proposed techniques. Meanwhile, the overhead of M-TREE encryption scheme is approximately 30%, compared to 50%. of using block cipher encryption. In overall, our M-TREE architecture can provide a tamper-resistant and tamper-evident computing environment with low-performance impact, thereby offering a transparent and practical security computing platform.
