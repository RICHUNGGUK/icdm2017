This algorithm, as a macro-level brain imitation, has been inspired by some behavioral specifications of human brain and active learning ability. ALM is an adaptive recursive fuzzy learning algorithm, in which a complex Multi Input, Multi Output system can be represented as a fuzzy combination of several Single-Input, Single-Output systems. SISO systems as associative layer of algorithm capture partial spatial knowledge of sample data space, and enable a granular knowledge resolution tuning mechanism through the learning process. The knowledge in each sub-system and its effectiveness in the whole system would be extracted by Ink Drop Spread in brief IDS operator and consolidated using a Fuzzy Rule Base (FRB), in order to acquire expert knowledge. In this paper we investigate ALM as a conspicuous classifier in different types of classification problems. Also, a new ALM architecture to actively analyze ill-balanced image patterns is proposed. Different types of data sets are used as a benchmark, including a remote sensing image classification problem, to evaluate the ALM Classifier (ALMC). With active pattern generation ability and knowledge resolution tuning, ALMC has been distinguished from many conventional classification tools especially for complex structures and image patterns analysis. This work demonstrates that ALMC is a good noise robust and active classifier, which is adaptively adjusted through structural evolution and pattern evaluation mechanism. These remarkable capabilities, along with its straightforward learning process, make ALMC as a convenient soft computing tool to use in different types of low dimensional pattern recognition problems.", "paper_title": "Pattern analysis by active learning method classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000328936600006"}
