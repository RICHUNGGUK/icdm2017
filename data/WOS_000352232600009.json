In this paper, a novel crowdsourcing method is introduced. The proposed method is used for automatic AP localization and PPs estimation by employing an inertial navigation solution, such as Trusted Portable Navigator (T-PN). The proposed system runs on smartphones, from which it builds and updates the database autonomously and adaptively to account for the dynamic environment. A WiFi positioning method, based on the generated database, is also discussed. The proposed system is validated by both simulated and experimental tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
