The main goal is to achieve a satisfactory tracking performance while reducing network usage. To attain this objective, a self-triggered strategy that adjusts the triggering condition to the observed tracking error is implemented. After the theoretical justification, simulation results of a P3-DX mobile robot remotely controlled using TrueTime are presented. Also, the same adaptive self-triggered approach has been tested on a real robot. The experiments reinforce the relevant reduction on the generated network traffic compared to a periodic implementation and to a non-adaptive self-triggered approach, while the tracking performance is barely degraded.
