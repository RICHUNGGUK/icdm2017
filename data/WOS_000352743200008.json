The primary-backup (PB) approach is often used as a fault-tolerant scheduling technique to guarantee RT tasks to meet their deadline despite the presence of fault. We propose a novel scheduling algorithm using optimization approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) hybridized with knowledge from the real-time task scheduling domain for providing fault-tolerance (FT) in multiprocessor environment. Exhaustive simulation reveals that the new GA based primary-backup fault-tolerant scheduling (PBFTS) approach outperforms other faulttolerant scheduling schemes in terms of system utilization and efficiency.
