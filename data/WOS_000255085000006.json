An example of use of the SNS to monitor damage on a nine meter long wind turbine blade is also described. The blade is a complex anisotropic structure that was tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado, USA under quasi static loading to determine the strength and ability of the blade to withstand wind loading. The SNS along with piezoelectric sensors was installed to monitor the composite blade material during this testing. Multiple cracks originated during this test and were detected by the SNS well before the final failure of the blade. This testing provides confidence that SNS has the capability to monitor crack growth in complex anisotropic structures using piezoelectric sensors. The SNS is currently being extended to sense signals from other types of sensors including continuous sensors based on accelerometers, pressure sensors, piezoresistive, chemical, and biosensors. This would extend application of the SNS into biological and environmental systems where different types of sensors are used to measure chemicals and biological materials. It is predicted that the SNS can provide high accuracy, low cost, and simplicity for monitoring the health of many types of systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
