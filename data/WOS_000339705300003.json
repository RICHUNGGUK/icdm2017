To fit the computing demands of this trend along with nowadays fluky applications (e.g. social networks, media contents), Cloud systems require rapid resource changes. As a result, the workload management in a virtualized environment becomes a complex task. In this paper we propose a new proactive workload management model for virtualized resources to inspect the workload behavior of the running Virtual Machines, and to assent an appropriate scheduling and resource consolidation schema in order to improve the system efficiency, utilization, and throughput. We have carried out our model by modifying Xen Cloud Platform, then we tested the model performance through different representative benchmarks. The results show that the Proactive model can decrease the average response time remarkably. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
