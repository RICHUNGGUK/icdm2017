The proposal implies a significant perspective shift with respect to mainstream design practices, but yields large payoffs in terms of simplicity, flexibility, solution uniformity for different problems, and possibility to formally assess the results also in the presence of unpredictable run-time situations. A complete implementation example is illustrated, together with various comparative tests, and a methodological treatise of the matter.", "paper_title": "Task Scheduling: A Control-Theoretical Viewpoint for a General and Flexible Solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000346219200003"}
