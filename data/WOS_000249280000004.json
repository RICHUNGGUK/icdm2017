Clustering these data can facilitate different operations such as storage, retrieval, rule extraction and processing. In this paper, we propose a novel and heuristic algorithm for clustering tree structured data, called TreeCluster. This algorithm considers a representative tree for each cluster. It differs significantly from the traditional methods based on computing tree edit distance. TreeCluster compares each input tree T only with the representative trees of clusters and as a result allows a significant reduction of the running time. We show the efficiency of TreeCluster in terms of time complexity. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of TreeCluster algorithm in comparison with the pervious works. Our experimental results show that TreeCluster improves some cluster quality measures such as intra-cluster similarity, inter-cluster similarity, DUNN and DB.", "paper_title": "A heuristic algorithm for clustering rooted ordered trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000249280000004"}
