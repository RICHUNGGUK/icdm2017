A loss of asymptotic order is observed, but in the most relevant cases the overall asymptotic order remains higher than a truncated asymptotic expansion at similar computational effort. Theoretical results based on number theory underpinning the mechanisms behind this effect are presented.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Analysis of Numerical Steepest Descent with Path Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000282700700002"}
