A given function f is realized by a threshold logic network derived by replacing non-terminal nodes of a decision diagram for f by suitably determined threshold logic gates. Further, we show that the complexity of this realization can be reduced by converting the initial decision diagram for f into a Heterogeneous decision diagram whose non-terminal nodes are replaced by the conesponding threshold elements.", "paper_title": "Threshold Logic Realization of Discrete Functions through Heterogeneous Decision Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000337215100004"}
