By introducing a virtual target, synchronization with an error level, called quasi-synchronization, is analyzed in asymmetric and symmetric networks, respectively. Some sufficient quasi-synchronization conditions are presented and explicit expressions of error levels are derived to estimate the synchronization error. Finally, two networks with six different Chua's circuits are provided to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
