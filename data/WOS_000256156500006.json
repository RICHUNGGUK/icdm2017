We propose a methodology that allows realistic 3D morphomechanical modeling of the vessel, the plaque and the lumen at different stages of in vitro angioplasty. We elaborate on a novel device designed to guide angioplasty under controlled experimental conditions. The device allows to reproduce in vivo conditions as good as possible, i.e. axial in situ pre-stretch, 100 mmHg intraluminal pressure, 37 degrees C Tyrode solution, balloon inflation without external constraints using a high-pressure syringe and contrast medium. With a standard 1.5 T MR-system we accomplish multi-spectral images at different stages of the angioplasty experiment. After MR image acquisition the specimen is used for histopathological analysis and biomechanical tests. A segmentation process is used to generate NURBS-based 3D geometric models of the individual vessel and plaque components at different balloon pressures. Tissue components are segmented automatically using generalized gradient vector flow active contours. We investigated 10 human femoral arteries. The effects of balloon compression on the individual artery components is particularly described for two obstructed arteries with an intact collagenous cap, a pronounced lipid pool and with calcification. In both arteries we observe a significant increase in lumen area after angioplasty. Dissection between intima and media and reduction of the lipid pool are primary mechanisms of dilatation. This methodology provides a basis for studying plaque biomechanics under supra-physiological loading conditions. It has the potential to improve and validate finite element models of atherosclerotic plaques which may allow a better prediction of angioplasty procedures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
