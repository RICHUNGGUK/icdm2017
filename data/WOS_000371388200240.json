DML gates utilize two different modes of operation, dynamic and static, to selectively achieve either high-performance or low-energy operation. Custom designs of DML circuits have been shown to be very efficient. However, implementing DML circuits using the standard design flow and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools is very challenging, since DML gates operate in two different modes, each with its own characteristics and operating mechanisms. This paper shows, for the first time, that DML logic can be compatible with the standard design flow and optimized by various tools, such as synthesis and physical design. A DML cell library characterization methodology is also proposed to support the design flow. The methodology and flow were verified on a wide variety of benchmark designs with different gate counts and logic depths, and show that DML design is efficient under the standard design flow restrictions.", "paper_title": "Design Flow and Characterization Methodology for Dual Mode Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200240"}
