SCIMMkit provides a robust, integrated implementation of three previously validated algorithms [SCIMM (SNP-Conditional Mixture Modeling), SCIMM-Search and SCOUT (SNP-Conditional OUTlier detection)] for targeted interrogation of CNVs using Illumina Infinium II and GoldenGate SNP assays. SCIMMkit is applicable to standardized genome-wide SNP arrays and customized multiplexed SNP panels, providing economy, efficiency and flexibility in experimental design.", "paper_title": "Targeted interrogation of copy number variation using SCIMMkit", "paper_id": "WOS:000273116100017"}
