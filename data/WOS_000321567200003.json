The misalignment among the reference systems and the lack of synchronization among the devices are the main problems for the correct performance evaluation using Vicon as reference measurement system. We propose a genetic algorithm coupled with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to solve these issues. To validate the efficacy of the methodology, a performance comparison is implemented between the WB-3 ultra-miniaturized Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), developed by our group, with the commercial IMU InertiaCube3 (TM) by InterSense.", "paper_title": "A Methodology for the Performance Evaluation of Inertial Measurement Units", "paper_id": "WOS:000321567200003"}
