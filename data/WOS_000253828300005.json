The proposed VSIP has novel instructions and optimized hardware architectures for specific applications, such as intra prediction, in-loop deblocking filter, integer transform, etc. Moreover, VSIP has coprocessors for computation intensive parts in video signal processing, such as inter prediction and entropy coding. The proposed VSIP has much smaller area and can dramatically reduce the number of memory access compared with commercial DSP chips, which result in low power consumption. Moreover, the proposed hardware accelerators have small size, consume low power consumption, and thus, they can support real-time video processing. VSIP has been thoroughly verified using an FPGA board having the Xilinx(TM) Virtex II. VSIP can implement a real-time H.264/AVC decoder. The proposed VSIP is one of promising solutions for video signal processing.", "paper_title": "ASIP approach for implementation of H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000253828300005"}
