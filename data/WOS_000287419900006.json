A sliding surface is adopted to ensure the stability of the error dynamics in sliding mode control. In the neural sliding mode controller, a Gaussian radial basis function is utilized to online estimate the system dynamic function. The adaptation law of the control system is derived in the sense of Lyapunov function, thus the system can be guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. The proposed method allows us to arbitrarily adjust the desired scaling by controlling the slave system. It is not necessary to calculate the Lyapunov exponents and the eigen values of the Jacobian matrix, which makes it simple and convenient. Also, it is a systematic procedure for GPS of chaotic systems and it can be applied to a variety of chaotic systems no matter whether it contains external excitation or not. Note that it needs only one controller to realize GPS no matter how much dimensions the chaotic system contains and the controller is easy to be implemented. The proposed method is applied to three chaotic systems: Genesio system, Lure like system and Duffing system.
