Many works have been done to improve the algorithms for localization and prediction of a moving target with smart sensors. However, the results are frequently difficult to implement because of hardware limitations. In this paper, we propose a practical distributed sensor activation algorithm (DSA(2)) that enables reliable tracking with the simplest binary-detection sensors. In this algorithm, all sensors in the field are activated with a probability to detect targets or sleep to save energy, the schedule of which depends on their neighbor sensors' behaviors. Extensive simulations are also shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Great improvement in terms of energy-quality tradeoff and excellent robustness of the algorithm are also emphasized in the simulations.", "paper_title": "Distributed sensor activation algorithm for target tracking with binary sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287754100005"}
