They are significant for improving the behaviors of the systems. Based on the Petri net models of FMSs, this paper embeds deadlock control policies into heuristic search algorithm, and proposes a deadlock-free scheduling algorithm to minimize makespan for FMSs. Scheduling is performed as heuristic search in the reachability graph of the Petri net. The searching process is guided by a heuristic function based on firing count vectors of state equation for the Petri net. By using the one-step look-ahead method in the optimal deadlock control policy, the safety of a state is checked. Experimental results are provided to show effectiveness of the proposed heuristic search approach in deadlock-free scheduling for FMSs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
