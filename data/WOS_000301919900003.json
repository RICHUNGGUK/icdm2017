The invention of radio frequency identification (RFID) has provided an effective tool to manage wine production. This article reports on the design and the use of an RFID-based quality evaluation system to monitor the whole supply chain of wine. With the application of this system, all relevant information about wines before they are put on the market for sale can be recorded, processed and managed. This article proposes a method that combines k-nearest neighbours' algorithm and a simple artificial neural networks' technique to provide quality evaluation of the final wine. The quality evaluation system can also discover accidents in time to reduce losses and prevent counterfeit.", "paper_title": "A radio frequency identification-based quality evaluation system design for the wine industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000301919900003"}
