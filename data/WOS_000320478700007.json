The sensitivity of structural response to the presence of each element included in the finite element (FE) model is evaluated. The study aims to improve the suitability and computational efficiency of the ant colony optimization algorithm in dynamic topology optimization problems. The natural frequencies of the structure must be maximized yet satisfying a constraint on the final volume. Optimization results obtained in three test cases indicate that MACO is more efficient and robust than standard ACO in solving dynamic topology optimization problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
