These transmissions are scheduled using a matrix whose dimensions are frequency and time, where every matrix cell is a time slot on some carrier channel. The IEEE 802.16 standard mandates that: (i) every transmission occupies a rectangular set of cells, and (ii) transmissions must be scheduled according to a given order. We show that if the number of cells required by a transmission is not limited (up to the matrix size), the problem of maximizing matrix utilization is very hard to approximate. On the positive side we show that if the number of cells of every transmission is limited to some constant fraction of the matrix area, the problem can be approximated to within a constant factor. As far as we know this is the first paper that considers this sequential rectangle placement problem. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
