Then, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and utilizing inequality techniques, some sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the proposed network model is globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, when the parameter uncertainties appear in the IPCN, several robust global exponential stability conditions are also presented. Finally, two examples with numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our criteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
