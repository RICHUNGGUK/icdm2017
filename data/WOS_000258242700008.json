Each node of the network has a database that will answer queries of the form \"how do I find t?\" by responding with the first edge on a shortest path to t. It may happen that some nodes, called liars, give bad advice. We investigate a simple memoryless algorithm which follows the advice with some fixed probability q > 1/2 and otherwise chooses a random edge. If the degree of each node and number of liars k are bounded, we show that the expected number of edges traversed by the agent before finding t is bounded from above by O(d+r(k)), where d is the distance between the initial and target nodes and r = q/1-q. We also show that this expected number of steps can be significantly improved for particular topologies such as the complete graph and the torus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
