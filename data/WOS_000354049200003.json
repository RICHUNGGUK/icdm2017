Prefix-free deterministic finite automata have their own unique structural properties that are crucial for obtaining state complexity upper bounds that are improved from those for general regular languages. We present a tight lower bound construction for k-union using an alphabet of size k + 1 and for k-intersection using a binary alphabet. We prove that the state complexity upper bound for k-union cannot be reached by languages over an alphabet with less than k symbols. We also give a lower bound construction for k-union using a binary alphabet that is within a constant factor of the upper bound.", "paper_title": "State Complexity of k-Union and k-Intersection for Prefix-Free Regular Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049200003"}
