Since being short of global identifiers, it is hard to find all records referring to the same object in an integrated database. Traditional object identification techniques tend to use character-based or vector space model-based similarity computing in judging, but they cannot work well in merchandise databases. This paper brings forward a new approach to object identification. First, we use merchandise images to judge whether two records belong to the same object; then, we use Naive Bayesian Model to judge whether two merchandise names have similar meaning. We do experiments on data downloaded from shopping websites, and the results show good performance.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to clustering merchandise records", "paper_id": "WOS:000245374700008"}
