A typical learning problem requires one to make inferences about a subclass of objects (e.g. 'papers'), while using the remaining objects and relations to provide relevant information. We present a simple, unified mechanism for incorporating information from multiple object types and relations when learning on a targeted subset. In this scheme, all sources of relevant information are marginalized onto the target subclass via random walks. We show that marginalized random walks can be used as a general technique for combining multiple sources of information in relational data. With this approach, we formulate new algorithms for transduction and ranking in relational data, and quantify the performance of new schemes on real world data-achieving good results in many problems.", "paper_title": "Information marginalization on subgraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900017"}
