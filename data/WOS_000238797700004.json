As the indicators are not directly measurable, accurate approximations are used, namely patent shares for international presence, the technological specialisation index for national priorities, and the rate of assigned patents for potential economic benefits. The findings of the paper demonstrate the clear advantage Japan and France have out of the group of the top 12 foreign countries patenting in the USA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
