To overcome such challenges, we first explore the use of multiband RF/wireless-interconnects which can communicate simultaneously through multiple frequency bands with low power signal transmission, reconfigurable bandwidth and excellent mechanical flexibility and reliability. We then review recent advances in RF/wireless-interconnect in four different potential application domains, which include network-on-chips (NoCs), 3-dimensional integrated circuit (3DIC), advanced memory interface and ultra-high speed contactless connectors. Based on those developments, we further propose the future research direction on future inter- and intra-VLSI interconnect system through the comparison of performance and the proper communication range for all three types of interconnects, including communication data throughput, range and power consumption (pJ/bit) among the RF/wireless-interconnects, the optical interconnects and traditional parallel repeated bus.", "paper_title": "RF/wireless-interconnect: The next wave of connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000290269200010"}
