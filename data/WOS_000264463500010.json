Particularly, the flexibility is assumed to be a fuzzy goal. Then, several models based on maximizing total future profits under a level of satisfaction to each fuzzy goal are proposed. Furthermore, the model considering preference ranking to each fuzzy goal of constraints is proposed. Since these problems are basically formulated as nonlinear programming problems, the transformations into deterministic equivalent problems are introduced and the efficient solution methods are developed. A numerical example for product mix problem is given to illustrate our proposed models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
