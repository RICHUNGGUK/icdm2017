This system combining searching and retrieval algorithms was designed to extract QC measures from electronic discharge notes and to estimate the attainment rates to the current standards of care. It was developed on the patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and tested on the patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, both diseases sharing almost the same QC measures. The system was able to reach a reasonable agreement (kappa value) with medical experts from 0.65 (early reperfusion rate) to 0.97 (beta-blockers and lipid-lowering agents before discharge) for different QC measures in the test set, and then applied to evaluate QC in the patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The result has validated a new tool to reliably extract QC measures for cardiovascular diseases.", "paper_title": "Automated evaluation of electronic discharge notes to assess quality of care for cardiovascular diseases using Medical Language Extraction and Encoding System (MedLEE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000277580700003"}
