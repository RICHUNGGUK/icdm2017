Due to the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller has a simple architecture and easily designed, it was widely used in the industrial applications. However, the traditional PID controller usually needs some manual retuning before being used to practically application. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a self-learning PID control (SLPIDC) system which is composed of a PID controller and a fuzzy compensator. The PID controller which is used to online approximate an ideal controller is the main controller. The controller gain factors of the PID controller can automatically tune based on the gradient descent method. The fuzzy compensator is designed to dispel the approximation error between the ideal controller and PID controller upon the system stability in the Lyapunov sense. From the simulation results, it is verified that the chaotic behavior of two nonlinear identical chaotic gyros can be synchronized by the proposed SLPIDC scheme without the chattering phenomena in the control effort after the controller parameters learning.
