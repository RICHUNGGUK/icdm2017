This challenge becomes more acute as libraries grow, both in terms of size and organizational complexity, making the traditional humanities practice of intensive, manual annotation and markup infeasible. In this paper we describe an approach we have taken in adding a music collection to the Cervantes Project. We use metadata. and the organization of the various documents in the collection to facilitate automatic integration of new documents-establishing connection from existing resources to new documents as well as from the new documents to existing material.", "paper_title": "Expanding a humanities digital library: Musical references in Cervantes' works", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500014"}
