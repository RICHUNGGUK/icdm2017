The range of the parameters of the swarm model is determined for which chaos exists in the dynamics. The trajectories of the individuals are simulated, and the stable, limit cyclic, and chaotic behaviors are demonstrated. The existence of chaos in the swarm is determined by the maximum Lyapunov exponent. The computer simulation supports the results obtained by theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Chaotic Dynamics in Social Foraging Swarms-An Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308995000027"}
