The artificial agent, who will support the caregiver, is equipped with hardware and software resources that enable it to observe, analyze, infer and support, when needed, the assisted person. In this paper, we present the various stages of Technological assistance and propose a new algorithm for the step of activities models detection. We also explore an activity prediction step using time series. The experiments were conducted on real data recorded at LIARA smart home and the results are satisfactory.", "paper_title": "The behavioral profiling based on times series forecasting for smart homes assistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000363041900014"}
