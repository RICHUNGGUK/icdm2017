Here, we show an expected constant-round protocol for authenticated Byzantine agreement assuming honest majority (i.e., t < n/2), and relying only on the existence of a secure signature scheme and a public-key infrastructure (PKI). Combined with existing results, this gives the first expected constant-round protocol for secure computation with honest majority in a point-to-point network assuming only one-way functions and a PKI. Our key technical tool - a new primitive we introduce called moderated VSS - also yields a simpler proof of the Feldman-Micali result. We also show a simple technique for sequential composition of protocols without simultaneous termination (something that is inherent for Byzantine agreement protocols using o(n) rounds) for the case of t < n/2.", "paper_title": "On expected constant-round protocols for Byzantine agreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079900027"}
