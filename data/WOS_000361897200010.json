This paper discusses the design and implementation of GRAPPE which suggests the ranked list of optimal connecting routes between two people by interaction like SNS, phone calls, texts, mails. It is based on mutual intimacy index (MII) which indicate how closely two people are related. MII is calculated periodically when a user interact with other person by smartphone. In this study, we propose a simple two-ended search method for finding optimal routes between a source person and a destination person. For the real-time service it searches optimal path within 3 step-away relationship in human network that is effective in real life while existing services in SNS usually provide one-ended search on entire paths. Furthermore, we also use the pruning technique for efficient execution time.", "paper_title": "GRAPPE : a system for determining optimal connecting route to target person based on mutual intimacy index", "paper_id": "WOS:000361897200010"}
