In addition, the performance of OFDM is severely affected by strong co-channel interference and strong narrowband interference. To mitigate the limitations of OFDM, we propose a new multi-carrier transceiver based on frequency-shift filter. A frequency-shift filter can separate spectrally overlapping sub-carrier signals by exploiting the spectral correlation inherent in the cyclostationary modulated signals. To increase spectral efficiency, we increase the percentage of spectral overlap between two adjacent sub-channels. We derive an upper bound and a lower bound on the bit error rate performance of the proposed multi-carrier transceiver in additive white Gaussian noise channel and frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. Compared with OFDM, our simulation results show that the proposed multi-carrier transceiver is much less sensitive to CFO and has a lower peak-to-average ratio; moreover, without any additional interference suppression technique, the proposed transceiver has the advantage of being able to mitigate strong co-channel interference with CFO from the intended multi-carrier signal and mitigate strong narrowband interference in additive white Gaussian noise channel and in Rayleigh fading channel in which a large CFO between the transmitted signal and the received signal often occurs.
