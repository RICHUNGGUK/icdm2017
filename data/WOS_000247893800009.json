The basic building blocks are the BTF tiles. By constructing one set of BTF tiles, a wide variety of objects can be textured seamlessly without resynthesizing the BTF. The proposed framework nicely decouples the surface appearance from the geometry. With this appearance-geometry decoupling, one can build a library of BTF tile sets to instantaneously dress and render various objects under variable lighting and viewing conditions. The core of our framework is a novel method for synthesizing seamless high-dimensional BTF tiles, which are difficult for existing synthesis techniques. Its key is to shorten the cutting paths and broaden the choices of samples so as to increase the chance of synthesizing seamless BTF tiles. To tackle the enormous data, the tile synthesis process is performed in a compressed domain. This not only allows the handling of large BTF data during the synthesis, but also facilitates the compact storage of the BTF in a GPU memory during the rendering.", "paper_title": "Tileable BTF", "paper_id": "WOS:000247893800009"}
