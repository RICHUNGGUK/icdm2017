To maximize the employer's welfare, an uncertain price discrimination model in labor market is established. Moreover, a crisp equivalent form of the model is given, and the analytic solution is therefore obtained by employing variational method. This optimal solution shows that both the productivity and the wage are increasing with respect to the employee's capability.", "paper_title": "An uncertain price discrimination model in labor market", "paper_id": "WOS:000316334400006"}
