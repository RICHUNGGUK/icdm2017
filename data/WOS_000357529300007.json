We obtain an almost tight upper bound of O(n(2+epsilon)), for any epsilon > 0, on the maximum number of discrete changes that the Delaunay triangulation DT(P) of P experiences during this motion. Our analysis is cast in a purely topological setting, where we only assume that (i) any four points can be co-circular at most three times, and (ii) no triple of points can be collinear more than twice; these assumptions hold for unit speed motions.", "paper_title": "On Kinetic Delaunay Triangulations: A Near-Quadratic Bound for Unit Speed Motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529300007"}
