In the proposed method, when the sink loses the connection with the source, it does not rebuild an entire route but simply repairs the existing route based on local information. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm drastically improves the conventional routing protocols in terms of both energy and delay in case of mobile sink.", "paper_title": "A simple sink mobility support algorithm for routing protocols in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800118"}
