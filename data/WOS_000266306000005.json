The key assumption is that users sharing the same ratings on past items tend to agree on new items. Traditional collaborative filtering methods can mainly be divided into two classes: memory-based and model-based. The memory-based approaches generally suffer from two fundamental problems: sparsity and scalability, and the model-based approaches usually cost too much on establishing a model and have many parameters to be tuned. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for collaborative filtering by applying orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (ONMTF), which (1) alleviates the sparsity problem via matrix factorization; (2) solves the scalability problem by simultaneously clustering rows and columns of the user-item matrix. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that our algorithm is indeed more tolerant against both sparsity and scalability, and achieves good performance in the mean time.
