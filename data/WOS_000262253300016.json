The theoretical approach adopted here was based upon the fundamental relationships governing the electrical field, the equations of motion for both continuous and dispersed phases (with mutual coupling) and most importantly, the mass transfer between the phases with the accompanying enzymatic reaction. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were used for evaluating the reaction rate and its inter-relationship with the mass transport at the interface. A new algorithm was implemented using original FEM software involving the Lagrangian approach for both the particle/droplet tracking on one hand, and for the convection-dominated transport equations involving the cloud model on the other. The latter was further developed to account for the mass transport between the continuous and the dispersed phases. The model was verified using our own experimental data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
