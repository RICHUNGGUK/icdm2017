Furthermore, for each natural number k >= 2 let P-k = {a(nk) vertical bar n is an element of N}. By applying certain classical and recent results on Diophantine equations we show that L-RC = (F) over cap boolean AND(P-k), where L-RC is the family of all recursively enumerable languages. This allows us to answer to an open problem of S. Ginsburg and J. Goldstine in vertical bar 3 vertical bar. A general method to reduce certain restricted membership problems in language families to number theory (in particular to systems of Diophantine equations) is then considered. In the third part of the paper, we show that the (C) over cap boolean AND(REP) = (F) over cap boolean AND(BREP) = L-RE where REP = {(a(m)b)(n) vertical bar m, n is an element of N} and BREP = {(a(5)b)(n) vertical bar n is an element of N}. The results give an answer to two problems left open by P. Turakainen in [11]. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
