The proposed method uses an anisotropic Gaussian kernel to improve image interpolation, which causes blurred edges. The objective of this anisotropic Gaussian kernel-based probabilistic neural network is to provide high adaptivity of smoothness/sharpness during image/video interpolation. This APNN interpolation method adjusts the smoothing parameters for varied smooth/edge regions, and considers edge direction. This APNN uses a single neuron to estimate sharpness/smoothness. The proposed method achieves better sharpness enhancement at edge regions, and reveals the noise reduction at smooth region. This study also uses interpolating a slanted-edge image to reveal blurring and blocking effects. Finally, this study compares the performance of these proposed methods with other image interpolation methods.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Probabilistic Neural Network for Image Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332459300008"}
