Behavioristic characterizations of cognitive properties are criticized in favor of an organizational approach focused on the internal dynamic relationships that constitute cognitive systems. A definition of cognition as adaptive-autonomy in the embodied and situated neurodynamic domain is provided: the compensatory regulation of a web of stability dependencies between sensorimotor structures is created and preserved during a historical/developmental process. We highlight the functional role of emotional embodiment: internal bioregulatory processes coupled to the formation and adaptive regulation of neurodynamic autonomy. Finally, we discuss a \"minimally cognitive behavior program\" in evolutionary simulation modeling suggesting that much is to be learned from a complementary \"minimally cognitive organization program\".", "paper_title": "On what makes certain dynamical systems cognitive: A minimally cognitive organization program", "paper_id": "WOS:000237890200008"}
