Conference management systems (CMS) are used by conference organizers to invite appropriate reviewers and assign them to submitted papers. Typical CMS rely on paper bids entered by the reviewers and apply simple matching algorithms to compute the paper assignment. In this paper, we demonstrate our Reviewer Assignment System (RAS), which has advanced features compared to broadly used CMSs. First, RAS automatically extracts the profiles of reviewers and submissions in the form of topic vectors. These profiles can be used to automatically assign reviewers to papers without relying on a bidding process, which can be tedious and error-prone. Second, besides supporting classic assignment models (e.g., stable marriage and optimal assignment), RAS includes a recently published assignment model by our research group, which maximizes, for each paper, the coverage of its topics by the profiles of its reviewers. The features of the demonstration include (1) automatic extraction of paper and reviewer profiles, (2) assignment computation by different models, and (3) visualization of the results by different models, in order to assess their effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A Topic-based Reviewer Assignment System", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800049"}
