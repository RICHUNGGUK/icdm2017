Yet, the societal significance of the subject and the computational challenge it presents has caused the classification of medical datasets to be a popular research area. A new hybrid metaheuristic is presented for the classification task of medical datasets. The hybrid ant-bee colonies (HColonies) consists of two phases: an ant colony optimization (ACO) phase and an artificial bee colony (ABC) phase. The food sources of ABC are initialized into decision lists, constructed during the ACO phase using different subsets of the training data. The task of the ABC is to optimize the obtained decision lists. New variants of the ABC operators are proposed to suit the classification task. Results on a number of benchmark, real-world medical datasets show the usefulness of the proposed approach. Classification models obtained feature good predictive accuracy and relatively small model size.", "paper_title": "HColonies: a new hybrid metaheuristic for medical data classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000338214100018"}
