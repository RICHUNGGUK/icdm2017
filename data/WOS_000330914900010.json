The performance of the calibration model developed for the Vis-NIR sensor was compared with the performance of the calibration model developed with spectra obtained with a UV/Vis-NIR laboratory spectrometer. The calibration results obtained with the two devices were compared to determine the limitations of the sensor system with respect to the laboratory equipment. First, the spectra were correlated with the insoluble content analyzed in Wearcheckiberica's oil laboratories obtaining a calibration model based on Partial Least Squares-regression (PLSR). Once the pre-processing strategy had been defined, the most significant predictor variables were chosen with the help of Martens uncertainty test, interval Partial Least Squares (iPLS) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) variable selection techniques. Finally, the two models were compared based on the number of latent variables of each model of the values of the Root Mean Square Error of the Cross Validation (RMSECV), the Standard Error of Performance (SECV) and the Ratio of Prediction to Deviation (RPD).
