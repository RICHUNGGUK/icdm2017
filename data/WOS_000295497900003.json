In this paper, a sliding mode observer is used in conjunction with a disturbance observer to predict states of the slave system. Predicted states are then used in control formulation. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method avoids instability due to time delays in bilateral operation and provides satisfactory performance.", "paper_title": "Delay compensation in bilateral control using a sliding mode observer", "paper_id": "WOS:000295497900003"}
