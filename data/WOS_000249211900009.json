However, its running time is impractical for high throughput alignment of long sequences, for example, for the alignment of human and mouse genomes. In order to improve the performance and efficiency for alignment at genome scale, BLASTZ was implemented using the GLOBUS toolkit on a computing grid. A dynamic load balancing technique was introduced to achieve enhanced performance on a grid which consists of sources of heterogeneous characteristics, such as resources of different computational powers. The robustness of the implementation to disturbances due to other processes on the grid is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Grid-enabled BLASTZ: Application to comparative genomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000249211900009"}
