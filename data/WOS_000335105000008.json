The new method is based on nonlinear transformation of Gaussian random fields, where the correlation of the underlying Gaussian field is determined explicitly rather than through iterative methods. The reconstructed media can meet the binary-valued marginal probability distribution function and the two point correlation function of the reference media. The new method, whose main computation is completed using fast Fourier transform (FFT), is highly efficient and particularly suitable for reconstructing large size random media or a large number of samples. Its feasibility and performance are examined through a series of practical examples with comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods in random media reconstruction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
