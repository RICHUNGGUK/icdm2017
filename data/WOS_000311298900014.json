Since crisp black line artwork and lettering are the most important structural and stylistic elements in this important genre of color illustrations, our digitization process is geared towards faithful reconstruction of these elements. This is a challenging task, because commercial presses perform halftoning (screening) to approximate continuous tones and colors with overlapping grids of dots. Although a large number of inverse haftoning (descreening) methods exist, they typically blur the intricate black artwork. Our approach is specifically designed to descreen color comics, which typically reproduce color using screened CMY inks, but print the black artwork using non-screened solid black ink. After separating the scanned image into three screening grids, one for each of the CMY process inks, we use non-linear optimization to fit a parametric model describing each grid, and simultaneously recover the non-screened black ink layer, which is then vectorized. The result of this process is a high quality, compact, and rescalable digital representation of the original artwork.", "paper_title": "Digital Reconstruction of Halftoned Color Comics", "paper_id": "WOS:000311298900014"}
