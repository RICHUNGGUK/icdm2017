For this aim, previously we also extend a original method that build credal decision trees to one which works with continuous features and missing data. Through an experimental study, we prove that Bagging credal decision trees outperforms more complex Bagging approaches on data sets with class noise. Finally, using a bias-variance error decomposition analysis, we also justify the performance of the method of Bagging credal decision trees, showing that it achieves a stronger reduction of the variance error component.
