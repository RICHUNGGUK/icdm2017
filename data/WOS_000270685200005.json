Traditional sequence comparison methods fail to identify reliable homologies with low sequence identity, while the taxonomic methods are effective alternatives, but their prediction accuracies are around 70%, which are still relatively low for practical usage. Results: In this study, a simple and powerful method is presented for taxonomic fold recognition, which combines support vector machine (SVM) with autocross-covariance (ACC) transformation. The evolutionary information represented in the form of position-specific score matrices is converted into a series of fixed-length vectors by ACC transformation and these vectors are then input to a SVM classifier for fold recognition. The sequence-order effect can be effectively captured by this scheme. Experiments are performed on the widely used D-B dataset and the corresponding extended dataset, respectively. The proposed method, called ACCFold, gets an overall accuracy of 70.1% on the D-B dataset, which is higher than major existing taxonomic methods by 2-14%. Furthermore, the method achieves an overall accuracy of 87.6% on the extended dataset, which surpasses major existing taxonomic methods by 9-17%. Additionally, our method obtains an overall accuracy of 80.9% for 86-folds and 77.2% for 199-folds. These results demonstrate that the ACCFold method provides the state-of-the-art performance for taxonomic fold recognition.", "paper_title": "A new taxonomy-based protein fold recognition approach based on autocross-covariance transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200005"}
