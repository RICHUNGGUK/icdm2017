The design problem is formulated as a general constrained nonlinear optimization problem and is solved both mathematically and graphically. Ultimate strength and strength reduction factors are evaluated using ACI code provisions. The method provides a simple approach to determine optimal reinforcement under multiple loading combinations. The use of optimal reinforcement rather than conventional (symmetric) distributions of reinforcement can lower construction costs and environmental impacts.", "paper_title": "Optimum RC column reinforcement considering multiple load combinations", "paper_id": "WOS:000267368400003"}
