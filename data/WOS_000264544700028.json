While recent garment capture techniques are quite successful at capturing the low-frequency garment shape and motion over time, they often fail to capture the numerous high-frequency folds, reducing the realism of the reconstructed space-time models. In our work we propose a method for reintroducing fine folds into the captured models using data-driven dynamic wrinkling. We first estimate the shape and position of folds based on the original video footage used for capture and then wrinkle the surface based on those estimates using space-time deformation. Both steps utilize the unique geometric characteristics of garments in general, and garment folds specifically, to facilitate the modeling of believable folds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our wrinkling method on a variety of garments that have been captured using several recent techniques.", "paper_title": "Wrinkling Captured Garments Using Space-Time Data-Driven Deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700028"}
