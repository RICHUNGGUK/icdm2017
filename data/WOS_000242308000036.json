The system uses inductive logic programming to analyze experience in the source task, and transfers rules for when to take actions. The target task learner accepts these rules through an advice-taking algorithm, which allows learners to benefit from outside guidance that may be imperfect. Our system accepts a human-provided mapping, which specifies the similarities between the source and target tasks and may also include advice about the differences between them. Using three tasks in the RoboCup simulated soccer domain, we demonstrate that this system can speed up reinforcement learning substantially.", "paper_title": "Skill acquisition via transfer learning and advice taking", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000036"}
