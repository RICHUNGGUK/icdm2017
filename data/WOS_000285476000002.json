The modeling environment is designed to represent complexity in subsurface features, sensor models, and the integration of the sensors with the subsurface environment. The ability to model complex subsurface environments and any potential random distribution of subsurface properties allows for realistic modeling of heterogeneous subsurface environments such as bridged deck/pavement systems. Many applications can benefit from the modeling, simulation, and interpretation capabilities in the new modeling environment that supports improved understanding of system behavior through simulations to evaluate the ability of a particular modality to detect defects. While numerous modeling packages exist to simulate different wave-based modalities, the integrated sensor and media modeling environment is developed to, in a straightforward manner, physically represent the complex subsurface civil infrastructure environment. Physical modeling capabilities enable the object-oriented programming environment facility portability to other application domains as a generic volume serves as the boundaries for internal elements modeled to represent realistic changes in material properties and buried objects. Model development is demonstrated on a realistic bridge deck example.", "paper_title": "Integrated Sensor and Media Modeling Environment Developed and Applied to Ground-Penetrating Radar Investigation of Bridge Decks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285476000002"}
