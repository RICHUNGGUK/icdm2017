The resonator behaviors and guidelines are given to design FSCSLSIR dual-band bandpass filter (BPF) and -section loaded FSCSLSIR triband BPF. The proposed dual- and triband BPF have very compact sizes of 0.13 (gd) x 0.06 (gd) and 0.115 (gt) x 0.074 (gt), respectively. Moreover, good return loss, low insertion loss, and high band-to-band isolation can be observed, and the proposed FSCSLSIR dual-band BPF has an ultrawide stopband from 5.79 to 36 GHz. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
