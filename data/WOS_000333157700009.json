Our goal is to take advantage from the property of MDC to provide quantized and compressed independent and identically distributed (iid) descriptions and also from the benefit of network coding, which uses network resources efficiently to recover lost data in the network. Recently, p-cycle NC has been introduced to recover and protect any lost or distorted descriptions at the receiver part exactly without need of retransmission. So far, MDC have not been explored using this type of NC. Compressed and coded descriptions are transmitted through the network where p-cycle NC is applied. P-cycle based algorithm is proposed for single and multiple descriptions lost. Results show that in the fixed bit rate, the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) of our reconstructed image and also subjective evaluation is improved significantly compared to previous work which is averaging method joint with MDC in order to conceal lost descriptions.", "paper_title": "Multicasting Multiple Description Coding Using p-cycle Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000333157700009"}
