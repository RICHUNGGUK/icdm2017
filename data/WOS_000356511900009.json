The separated arterial signal is used to compute accurate arterial oxygen saturation. We have also introduced an algorithm for extracting the respiratory pattern from the extracted venous-related signal. In addition to real-time monitoring, respiratory rate is also extracted. Our experimental results from multiple subjects show that the proposed separation technique is extremely useful for extracting accurate arterial oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Specifically, the breathing rate is extracted with average root mean square deviation of 1.89 and average mean difference of -0.69.", "paper_title": "Separating Arterial and Venous-Related Components of Photoplethysmographic Signals for Accurate Extraction of Oxygen Saturation and Respiratory Rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000356511900009"}
