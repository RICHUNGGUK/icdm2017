Based on the concept of minimum-cost consensus, this paper proposes a novel framework to achieve minimum-cost consensus under aggregation operators. Analytical results indicate that the proposed framework reduces to the consensus model of Ben-Arieh et al. when the selected aggregation operator is the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator with weight vector (1/2, ... , 0, ... , 1/2)(T). Furthermore, this paper closely examines the minimum-cost consensus models with a linear cost function under the common aggregation operators (e.g., the weighted averaging operator and the OWA operator). Linear-programming-based approaches are also developed to solve these models. The results of this paper significantly contribute to efforts to develop the consensus model of Ben-Arieh et al.", "paper_title": "Minimum-Cost Consensus Models Under Aggregation Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000296017400016"}
