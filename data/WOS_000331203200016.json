We discuss the different aspects of the framework especially a generalized variational inference method with better approximations to the true marginals of a graphical model. Experimentally, we explain why the framework is robust and performs competitively on many diverse scene data sets, including several unseen scene types. We have obtained high pixel-level accuracies (approximate to 80%) in three of the four data sets, which include a benchmark data set known as the Stanford background data set. Our model obtained over 70% accuracy on the fourth data set, which contained a number of indoor and close-up images that are significantly different from our training examples.", "paper_title": "Labeling Spain With Stanford", "paper_id": "WOS:000331203200016"}
