The histogram-by operator can be represented as histogram-by clause in the SQL statement, and can be easily amenable to query optimization. As the application of the histogram-by operator, we introduce a multi-dimensional histogram query, which returns aggregate values of all ranges specified by the histogram-by clause. To process the query efficiently, we propose effective algorithms using aggregate Rtrees. Our experimental results show that our algorithms are reliable in terms of performance over the synthetic and realworld datasets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
