Our approach to compression and the architecture of the system are motivated by the commercial and multilingual nature of the project, that is, the need to output reasonable compressions and the ability to add new strategies, genres and languages easily. The compression module currently works for the Catalan and English languages and uses the Constraint Grammar engine for linguistic preprocessing and for the linguistically motivated compression rules, thus providing a homogenous format throughout the compression process. The compression rules were implemented based on a corpus of automatically aligned < script,subtitle > pairs of films for both languages. We performed for both languages an automatic quantitative evaluation of the compression using the aligned corpus and a qualitative manual evaluation of grammaticality and informativeness.", "paper_title": "A sentence compression module for machine-assisted subtitling", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700051"}
