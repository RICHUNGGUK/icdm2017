In this cross-domain network architecture, end users receive broadband services through a wireless, mesh front end that is connected to the optical backhaul through gateway nodes. In this article, we present the architecture and functional characteristics of a WOBAN prototype built in the Networks Lab at UC Davis. We discuss research challenges for hybrid networks based on our experimental observations.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network(WOBAN): Prototype Development and Research Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000266409400007"}
