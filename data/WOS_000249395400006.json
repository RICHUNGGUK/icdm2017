Estimated annual costs of obesity are $78.5 billion. Selfmonitoring is a critical skill for successful weight management. However, self-monitoring is labor-intensive, and compliance is often difficult. In this paper, the authors describe the Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling Mobile Energy Balance (PmEB) mobile phone application that allows users to self-monitor caloric balance in real time. The application was developed and applied in a four-phase iterative research and development methodology. A usability study and a preliminary feasibility study were conducted. The I month feasibility study measured compliance and satisfaction among a sample of 15 participants randomized to one of three groups: (1) a paper diary group, (2) a PmEB group with one daily prompt, and (3) a PmEB group with three daily prompts. PmEB scored highly on usability, compliance, and satisfaction. In addition, mobile phone group users scored PmEB the same as or better than Paper Group members scored the paper diary in nearly all categories. Thematic analysis of comments revealed very positive reviews of PmEB as well as areas for improvement. PmEB is both usable and feasible for weight management self-monitoring, and the iterative pilot study methodology was effective in improving its usability.", "paper_title": "Usability and feasibility of PmEB: A mobile phone application for monitoring real time caloric balance", "paper_id": "WOS:000249395400006"}
