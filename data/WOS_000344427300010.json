Specifically, the paper models a situation where policy makers set a limit on the production emission factor of a regulated industry and require firms to pay tax if they exceed that target. The efficiency of the policy is evaluated against other existing environmental policies using a social welfare mathematical programming model. A case study is built within the context of the cement industry and is used to carry out the analysis. The results show that the intensity-based carbon tax achieves the highest consumers' surplus and production quantities and the lowest prices. The policy is found to be effective in reducing CO2 emissions with little impact on social welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
