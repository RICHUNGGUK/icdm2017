Dual-population GA (DPGA) is a type of multipopulation GA (MPGA) that uses an additional population as a reservoir of diversity. The main population is similar to that of an ordinary GA and evolves to find good solutions. The reserve population evolves to maintain and provide diversity to the main population. While most MPGAs use migration as a means of information exchange between different populations, DPGA uses crossbreeding because the two populations have entirely different fitness functions. The reserve population cannot provide useful diversity to the main population unless the two maintain an appropriate distance. Therefore, DPGA adjusts the distance dynamically to achieve an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. The experimental results on various classes of problems using binary, real-valued, and order-based representations show that DPGA quite often outperforms not only the standard GAs but also other GAs having additional mechanisms of diversity preservation.", "paper_title": "A Dual-Population Genetic Algorithm for Adaptive Diversity Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000285059500003"}
