How can it train sensors, such as the auditory or tactile system, based on other sensory input such as the visual system? Supervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (supervised STDP) is a possible answer. Supervised STDP trains one modality using input from another one as \"supervisor.\" Quite complex time-dependent relationships between the senses can be learned. Here we prove that under very general conditions, supervised STDP converges to a stable configuration of synaptic weights leading to a reconstruction of primary sensory input.", "paper_title": "Supervised Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity: A Spatiotemporal Neuronal Learning Rule for Function Approximation and Decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330521500002"}
