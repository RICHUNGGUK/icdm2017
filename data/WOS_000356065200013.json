Our algorithm applies a principal component analysis and artificial neural networks to produce an induced classifier from the FX market. Our algorithm yields reasonable profits. In addition, we discuss a basic procedure that the currency-trading algorithm must follow.", "paper_title": "Using a principal component analysis for multi-currencies-trading in the foreign exchange market", "paper_id": "WOS:000356065200013"}
