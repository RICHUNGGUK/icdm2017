Because the routing resources of coarse-grain RA (CGRA) are less than those of fine-grain RA, and several functions are often defined in same one element of RA, it is difficult to find a good route. Therefore, it is more important for routing-algorithm of CGRA to have stronger ability of finding feasible and optimum path. In the paper, the improved max-min Ant System (MMAS) that added the ability of smell for ant is applied for the routing problem of CGRA. By several benchmarks on CTaiJi that is a new developed CGRA, The improved MMAS shows better ability to find the best solution than PathFinder that is often used now.", "paper_title": "A route system based on ant colony for coarse-grain reconfigurable architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100027"}
