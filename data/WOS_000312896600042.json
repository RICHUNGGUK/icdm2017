In this paper, by analyzing the weight of sigma(n,2t) and, we prove that wt(sigma(n,d)) < 2(n-1)holds in most cases, and so does the conjecture. According to the remainder modulo 4, we also consider the weight of sigma(n,d) from two aspects: n equivalent to 3(mod 4) and n not equivalent to 3(mod 4). In particular, our results not only cover the most known results, but also contain some new cases. Thus, we can reduce the conjecture to few remaining cases. We do not fully solve the conjecture, but we also consider the weight of sigma(n,2t+2s) and also give some experimental results on it.", "paper_title": "A Note on a Conjecture for Balanced Elementary Symmetric Boolean Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000312896600042"}
