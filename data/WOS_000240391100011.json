In particular, some of them require either a certain subset of players or a trusted third party (TTP) to remain online in order to generate the winning number(s), and some suffer from the forgery ticket attack. Based on various advanced cryptographic techniques, we propose a new e-lottery scheme that can satisfy all the identified requirements without the presence of TTP for generating the winning numbers, yet the result of this generation is publicly verifiable.
