The cost metric is characterized by a series of parameters that can represent distance, flow volume, and delivery deadlines. Derived through variations in problem parameters, we present 17 different problems and discuss their worst-case complexities. Fourteen of the problems are new to the literature. We show that some of the problems are N P-Complete and others are polynornially solvable. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
