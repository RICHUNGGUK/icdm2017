The program calculates the cross-section in (a) fixed order approach with exact next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) accuracy and (b) by including soft-gluon resummation for the hadronic cross-section in Mellin space with full next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The program offers the user significant flexibility through the large number (29) of available options. Top++ is written in C++. It has a very simple to use interface that is intuitive and directly reflects the physics. The running of the program requires no programming experience from the user.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 15 896 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 695 919 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++. Computer: any running a unix operating system. Program was developed and tested with GNU Compiler Collection, C++ compiler. Operating system: Linux; Mac OS X; can be adapted for other unix systems. RAM: typically less than 200 MB. Classification: 11.1. External routines: GNU Scientific Library (GSL); the Les Houches Accord pdf Interface (LHAPDF). Nature of problem: computation of the total cross-section in perturbative QCD. Solution method: numerical integration of the product of hard partonic cross-section (with or without soft gluon resummation) with two parton distribution functions. Additional comments: sub per-mill accuracy achievable in realistic time (program does not employ Monte Carlo methods). Running time: depending on the options. The program is optimized for speed.
