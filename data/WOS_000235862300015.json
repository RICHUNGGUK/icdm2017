The two methods approximately preserve the histogram of quantized DCT coefficients, aiming at secure JPEG steganography against histogram-based attacks. In comparison with F5 as a representative JPEG steganography, the proposed methods show high performance with regard to embedding rate, PSNR of stego image, and particularly histogram preservation.
