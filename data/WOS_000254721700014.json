It has emerged as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Inhibitors of HDACs become a new class of anticancer agents and have provoked much interest amongst pharmacologists and cancer researchers. To facilitate the discovery of specific HDACs inhibitors, a 3D chemical-feature-based QSAR pharmacophore model was developed and was well consistent with the structure-functional requirements for the binding of the HDAC inhibitors. Using this model, the interactions between the benzamide MS-275 and HDAC were explored. The result showed that the type and spatial location of chemical features encoded in the pharmacophore are in full agreement with the enzyme-inhibitor interaction pattern identified from molecular docking.
