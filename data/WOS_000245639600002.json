Moreover, we derive the transformation matrices that map the H-Bezier basis and the orthogonal basis forms into each other. An example for approximating the degree reduction of the H-Bezier curves is sketched to illustrate the utility of the orthogonal basis.", "paper_title": "An orthogonal basis for the hyperbolic hybrid polynomial space", "paper_id": "WOS:000245639600002"}
