Solutions can be singular, in which case standard numerical approaches fail. In this article we build a finite difference solver for the Monge-Ampere equation, which converges even for singular solutions. Regularity results are used to select a priori between a stable, provably convergent monotone discretization and an accurate finite difference discretization in different regions of the computational domain. This allows singular solutions to be computed using a stable method, and regular solutions to be computed more accurately. The resulting nonlinear equations are then solved by Newton's method. Computational results in two and three-dimensions validate the claims of accuracy and solution speed. A computational example is presented which demonstrates the necessity of the use of the monotone scheme near singularities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
