The considered VNetDC platform works at the Middleware layer of the underlying protocol stack. It aims at supporting real-time stream service (such as, for example, the emerging big data stream computing (BDSC) services) by adopting the software-as-a-service (SaaS) computing model. Our objective is the minimization of the overall computing-plus-communication energy consumption. The main new contributions of the paper are the following ones: (i) the computing-plus-communication resources are jointly allotted in an adaptive fashion by accounting in real-time for both the (possibly, unpredictable) time fluctuations of the offered workload and the reconfiguration costs of the considered VNetDC platform; (ii) hard per-job delay-constraints on the overall allowed computing-plus-communication latencies are enforced; and, (iii) to deal with the inherently nonconvex nature of the resulting resource optimization problem, a novel solving approach is developed, that leads to the lossless decomposition of the afforded problem into the cascade of two simpler sub-problems. The sensitivity of the energy consumption of the proposed scheduler on the allowed processing latency, as well as the peak-to-mean ratio (PMR) and the correlation coefficient (i.e., the smoothness) of the offered workload is numerically tested under both synthetically generated and real-world workload traces. Finally, as an index of the attained energy efficiency, we compare the energy consumption of the proposed scheduler with the corresponding ones of some benchmark static, hybrid and sequential schedulers and numerically evaluate the resulting percent energy gaps.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient adaptive networked datacenters for the QoS support of real-time applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000349259600003"}
