The numerical scheme as well as an analytical study is based upon a modified equivalent system that is written in a \"standard\" hyperbolic conservation form. Numerical examples, which include the difficult traffic signal control problem, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the WENO scheme in which the results are in good agreement with the analytical counterparts.
