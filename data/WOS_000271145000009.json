The method presented here is statistical in nature and employs, as a starting point, a manually obtained contour. By making use of this user-provided information, we obtain probabilistic silhouettes of all successive images. These silhouettes provide a prior distribution that is then used to compute the probability of a voxel being carved. This evidence combining setting allows us to make use of background pixel information. As a result, our method combines the advantages of shape-from-silhouette techniques and statistical space carving approaches. For the carving process, we propose a new voxelated space. The proposed space is a projective one that provides a colour mapping for the object voxels which is consistent in terms of pixel coverage with their projection onto the image planes for the imagery under consideration. We provide quantitative results and illustrate the utility of the method on real-world imagery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
