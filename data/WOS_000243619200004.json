However, conventional color transformation tools have a tradeoff between the quality of the resultant image and the amount of manual operation. To achieve a more detailed and natural result with less labor, we previously suggested a method [6] that performs an example-based color stylization of images using perceptual color categories. In this paper, we extend this method to make the algorithm more robust and to stylize the colors of video frame sequences. We present a variety of results, arguing that these images and videos convey a different, but coherent mood.", "paper_title": "Example-based color transformation of image and video using basic color categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000243619200004"}
