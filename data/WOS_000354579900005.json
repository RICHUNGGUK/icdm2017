Impenetrability, friction and the relevant complementarity conditions are expressed through a non-smooth equation, considered in the continuous setting. A weak formulation of this non-smooth complementarity equation is discretized through a standard Galerkin procedure, is linearized consistently and incorporated in a generalized Newton solution process. The resulting integral handling of contact and friction complementarity conditions, previously implemented for small deformations only, is extended in the present paper to large deformations. In total, the proposed method is relatively simple to implement, while its robustness is illustrated through numerical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
