We use a combination of techniques. Polynomials are packed into integers by Kronecker substitution; several modular operations are performed at once with machine integer or floating point arithmetic; normalization of modular images is avoided when possible; some conversions back to polynomial coefficients are avoided; the coefficients are recovered efficiently by preparing them before conversion. We discuss precisely the required control on sizes and degrees. We then present applications to polynomial multiplication, prime field linear algebra and small extension field arithmetic, where these techniques lead to practical gains of quite large constant factors.
