In this work, we formally present the definition of profile privacy leakage, which is a newly identified privacy leakage in social networks. However, applying existing methods straightforwardly cannot provide efficient privacy protection for the profiles meanwhile incurring a large amount of information loss. We propose k-obfuscation to protect profiles against graph property based attacks. We develop a general framework for obtaining k-obfuscation. In this framework, we propose a novel safe vertex-profile mapping mechanism, named as k-mapping. We also design a number of techniques to make the k-mapping method efficient meanwhile maintaining the data utilities. Extensive experiments on real datasets show the satisfactory performance of our methods in terms of privacy protection, efficiency, and practical utilities.
