Both distributed measurement form and collocated boundary measurement form are considered. A Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy PDE model is first applied to accurately represent the semilinear parabolic PDE system. Based on the T-S fuzzy PDE model, two types of fuzzy boundary controllers, which are easily implemented since only boundary actuators are used, are proposed to ensure the exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Sufficient conditions of exponential stabilization are established by employing the Lyapunov direct method and the vector-valued Wirtinger's inequality and presented in terms of standard linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed control methodology are demonstrated by the simulation results of two examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Boundary Control Design for a Class of Nonlinear Parabolic Distributed Parameter Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337128900014"}
