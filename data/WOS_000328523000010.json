The collaborative design and analysis are performed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of over 20 members from both academia and industry. This research is based on experiences of these team members who joined a successful e-SCM project, used as a case study in this research, between the world's largest semiconductor foundry and the world's largest assembly and testing service provider. This study adopts focus group methodology for collaborative design and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for collaborative analysis. The result of the design is a structured and comprehensive key processes model consisting of four dimensions: strategy and planning, manufacturing, logistics, and risk management (SMLR) with a total of 15 key processes included in these four dimensions. The resulting weightings from FAHP analysis can identify the most critical one dimension and four key processes since they account for approximately half of the overall weighting in their level. The SMLR model provides a structured and comprehensive reference model for future SC network management project executives, ensuring that all key processes are supported to avoid extremely costly failure. The resulting weightings provide these managers with the relative importance of these key processes and can help them make critical decisions in allocating limited resources to support the most critical processes. To confirm the results and further explore the managerial implications, a second session of focus group meeting was conducted and practices of the top three key processes in the semiconductor manufacturing industry were used to illustrate what actions can be performed to improve these processes and hence benefit the entire SC network. The research results can serve as a foundation for related academic researches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
