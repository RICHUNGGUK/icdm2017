To effectively deal with such a challenge, in this paper, new solution decomposition and minimization schemes are proposed, together with a new PBE analysis on solution existence and uniqueness. Moreover, a PBE finite element program package is developed in Python based on the FEniCS program library and GAMer, a molecular surface and volumetric mesh generation program package. Numerical tests on proteins and a nonlinear Born ball model with an analytical solution validate the new solution decomposition and minimization schemes, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new PBE finite element program package.
