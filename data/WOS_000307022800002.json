An artifact is constituted by a data component, holding all the data of interest for the service, and a lifecycle, which specifies the process that the service enacts. In this paper, we study artifact-centric services whose data component is a full-fledged relational database, queried through (first-order) conjunctive queries, and the lifecycle component is specified as sets of condition-action rules, where actions are tasks invocations, again based on conjunctive queries. Notably, the database can evolve in an unbounded way due to new values (unknown at verification time) inserted by tasks. The main result of the paper is that verification in this setting is decidable under a reasonable restriction on the form of tasks, called weak acyclicity, which we borrow from the recent literature on data exchange. In particular, we develop a sound, complete and terminating verification procedure for sophisticated temporal properties expressed in a first-order variant of mu-calculus.", "paper_title": "VERIFICATION OF CONJUNCTIVE ARTIFACT-CENTRIC SERVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000307022800002"}
