The purpose of this work was to develop a method for application of low frequency currents to the scalp, which delivered the maximum current without significant stimulation of skin or underlying brain. We propose a recessed electrode design which enabled current injection with an acceptable skin sensation to be increased from 100 mu A using EEG electrodes, to 1 mA in 16 normal volunteers. The effect of current delivered to the brain was assessed with an anatomically realistic finite element model of the adult head. The modelled peak cerebral current density was 0.3 A/m(2), which was 5 to 25-fold less than the threshold for stimulation of the brain estimated from literature review.", "paper_title": "Design of electrodes and current limits for low frequency electrical impedance tomography of the brain", "paper_id": "WOS:000248408700001"}
