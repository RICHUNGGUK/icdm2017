However, it is difficult to compare the actual rates against the appropriate rate, because calculating the actual rates requires life-long follow up of cancer patients. We have developed a method, refer-red to as the Multicohort Current Utilization Table (MCUT) method, to estimate the predicted lifetime utilization rates based on current medical practice. We implemented the method in SAS as a macro, and validated it by comparing the predicted and the actual utilization rates of radiotherapy in lung, breast, and prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Ontario, Canada. The MCUT method could be used to predict lifetime utilization rate of any medical services. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
