(Soft Comput 10:657-664, 2006) and Turunen (Arch Math Logic 40:467-473, 2001). It is proved in Haveshki et al. (2006) that if F is a maximal and (positive) implicative filter then it is a Boolean filter. In that paper there is an open problem Under what condition are Boolean filters positive implicative filters? One of our results gives an answer to the problem, that is, we need no more conditions. Moreover, we give simple characterizations of those filters by an identity form for all x, y(t(x, y) is an element of F), where t(x, y) is a term containing x, y.", "paper_title": "Filter theory of BL algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000251490200001"}
