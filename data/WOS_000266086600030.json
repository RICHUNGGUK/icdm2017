The marks awarded to the answers in the students' answerscripts are represented by interval-valued fuzzy sets. Each element in the universe of discourse belonging to all interval-valued fuzzy set is represented by an interval between zero and one. The degree of similarity between an interval-valued fuzzy mark and a standard interval-valued fuzzy set is calculated by a similarity function. An index of optimism lambda determined by the evaluator is used to indicate the degree of optimism of the evaluator, where lambda is an element of [0, 1]. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are more stable than Biswas's method for Students' answerscripts evaluation. They call evaluate Students' answerscripts in a more flexible and more intelligent manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
