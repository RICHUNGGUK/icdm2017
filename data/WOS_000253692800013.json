The criterion improves some previous criteria based on M-matrix and is easy to be verified with the connection weights of the recurrent neural networks with decreasing time-varying delays. In addition, the rate of exponential convergence can be estimated via a simple computation based on the criterion herein.", "paper_title": "An improved algebraic criterion for global exponential stability of recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000253692800013"}
