Users may have one or more different message accounts and devices. Before sending messages, the sender must make sure which message service the receipt currently uses. Any misjudgement may delay the time when the messages are received. To make users be able to receive messages anytime and anywhere with any kind of devices, we propose a Ubiquitous and Unified Multimedia Messaging (UMM) platform. The UMM platform integrates different message services and provides a more efficient way for message delivery. Our design does not modify the existing protocols of message services and need not involve the network operators. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the performance of the implemented platform. Our study shows that with a large number of message services the user subscribes and long message processing time in the network, the delayed message probability can be limited within 1.5%. This performance is considered satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Implementation and performance evaluation for a ubiquitous and unified multimedia messaging platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000262832400002"}
