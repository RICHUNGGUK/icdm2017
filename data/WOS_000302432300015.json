In the multihop transmission, WSMs are first received and stored in queues and then forwarded to the next hop. Unfortunately, WSMP does not specify any mechanism to avoid the messages loss resulted from queueing overflow. In this paper, a dual threshold-based queueing management which adjusts the message accepting rate upon the current queue length is proposed. The multihop transmission can be modeled as a tandem queueing network, and a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) can be applied to evaluate the proposed queueing management. Since the computational complexity increases with the number of hops, an approximation approach to resolve DTMC model is also presented. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of approximation and the effectiveness of the proposed queueing management. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
