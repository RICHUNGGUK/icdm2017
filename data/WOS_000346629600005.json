We propose two ways to build the itemset miner, VertexOne and VertexAll, in an attempt to find a balance between accuracy and run-times. The experiments show that VertexOne performs better, and finds almost the same itemsets as VertexAll in a much shorter time. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by applying it to find interesting patterns of amino acids in spatial proximity within a set of proteins based on their atomic coordinates in the protein molecular structure. Several patterns found by the cohesive structural itemset miner contain amino acids that frequently co-occur in the spatial structure, even if they are distant in the primary protein sequence and only brought together by protein folding. Further various indications were found that some of the discovered patterns seem to represent common underlying support structures within the proteins.", "paper_title": "Discovery of Spatially Cohesive Itemsets in Three-Dimensional Protein Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000346629600005"}
