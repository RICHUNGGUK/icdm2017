Requirements management but also requirement engineering has become a complex task because requirements have to be taken into account as soon as possible in the design process and permanently developed and monitored to both guide the design progress and assess its progress. The originality of the paper is in a new classification of design activities oriented towards requirement engineering and management. It highlights the necessity of explicitly elicitating the F-Requirement Relation network (FRRN) to support the activity of designers. Then this point of view is added to the classical points of view on project management and product representation to define a tree-dimension analyser able to define the main properties of the tools and methods on the market and then help require for new methods.", "paper_title": "Requirement-oriented activities in an engineering design process", "paper_id": "WOS:000254065800002"}
