The use of a parameterized metaheuristic facilitates experimentation with different metaheuristics and hybridation/combinations to adapt them to the particular problem we are working with. Due to the large number of experiments necessary for the metaheuristic selection and tuning, parallelism should be used to reduce the execution time. To obtain parallel versions of the metaheuristics and to adapt them to the characteristics of the parallel system, a unified parameterized shared-memory scheme is developed. Given a particular computational system and fixed parameters for the sequential metaheuristic, the appropriate selection of parameters in the unified parallel scheme eases the development of parallel efficient metaheuristics.", "paper_title": "A parameterized shared-memory scheme for parameterized metaheuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000296635800003"}
