Selection diversity is one of the most effective techniques utilizing random and independent variations of diverse channels to improve the performance of communication over fading channels. In this paper, we propose two packet scheduling schemes exploiting base station selection diversity in the downlink of CDMA cellular networks. The proposed schemes rely on the limited instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to select the best user from the best serving base station at each time slot. This technique increases the system throughput by increasing multiuser diversity gain and reducing the effective interference among adjacent base stations. Results of Monte Carlo simulations are given to demonstrate the improvement of system throughput using the proposed scheduling schemes. In addition, we investigate fairness issue of wireless scheduling schemes. Due to different characteristics of wireless scheduling schemes, the existing fairness indexes may result in misleading comparison among different schemes. We propose a new fairness index to compare the overall satisfaction of the network users for different scheduling schemes.
