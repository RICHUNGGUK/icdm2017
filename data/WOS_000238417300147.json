Building from a recent work by Barahona and Pecora [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 054101 (2002)], we use a simulated annealing algorithm to construct optimally-synchronizable networks. The resulting structures, known as entangled networks, are characterized by an extremely homogeneous and interwoven topology: degree, distance, and betweenness distributions are all very narrow, with short average distances, large loops, and small modularity. Entangled networks exhibit an excellent (almost optimal) performance with respect to other flow or connectivity properties such as robustness, random walk minimal first-passage times, and good searchability. All this converts entangled networks in a powerful concept with optimal properties in many respects.", "paper_title": "Synchronization in network structures: Entangled topology as optimal architecture for network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300147"}
