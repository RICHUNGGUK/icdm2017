Furthermore, we may forbid certain partnerships, that is, we are looking for a matching such that none of the matched pairs is forbidden, and yet, no blocking pair (forbidden or not) exists. To solve the above problem, we generalize the first algorithm for the ordinary stable roommates problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
