This study investigated a multi-response problem in terms of searching time, number of missing characters/buttons (NMCB), and visual fatigue by integrating the Taguchi method and the weighting method to optimize the Chinese interface design parameters such as display type, character size, font type, and text/background color combination in motion environments. The results indicated that subjects' visual performance was improved when using the optimum interface setting (LCD, 7.5 * 7.5 mm, Kai font and white/blue color combination) rather than the current interface setting.
