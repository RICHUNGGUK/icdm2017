Given an arbitrary geometric graph G, we define Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, relative neighborhood graphs, Gabriel graphs which are related to the graph structure and then study their complexities when G is a general geometric graph or G is some special graph derived from the application area of wireless networks. Besides being of fundamental interest these structures have applications in topology control for wireless networks.", "paper_title": "PROXIMITY STRUCTURES FOR GEOMETRIC GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283861500002"}
