We present the complete scientogram of the world for the Year 2002. It integrates the natural sciences, the social sciences, and arts and humanities. Its basic structure and the essential relationships therein are revealed, allowing us to simultaneously analyze the macrostructure, microstructure, and marrow of worldwide scientific output.", "paper_title": "Visualizing the marrow of science", "paper_id": "WOS:000251377600002"}
