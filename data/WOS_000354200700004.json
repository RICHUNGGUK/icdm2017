It is widely used to provide basic security services of authentication, confidentiality, and integrity of sensitive data. It is carried out in critical untrusted networks between client and server entities, such as e-commerce and online transactions. Despite multiple capabilities, TLS protocol is vulnerable to the malicious server attacks that may cause a serious threat to TLS-based e-commerce communications. This should be considered as the first problem of this protocol. The other problem of TLS is sending many messages during the handshake phase for providing a successful negotiation and a secure communication. So, this phase is the most complex and time-consuming phase of the TLS protocol. This causes decreasing of service capacity and using more time. We are going to propose a new protocol based on trust model called TSSL protocol in this paper. This model is used to conquer the disadvantages with security of the TLS protocol. Through this paper, it is going to be indicated that the proposed model has higher levels in both security and performance compared with the conventional TLS.
