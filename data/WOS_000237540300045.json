It's a better way to select the suitable grid resources constrained by QoS. In this paper we propose the application QoS model and metrics as the standard of resource selection. We also give consideration of the existence of data dependence between the tasks composing an application and apply it to the QoS model. And we solve the resource selection problem efficiently using novel neural networks.", "paper_title": "QoS-driven grid resource selection based on novel neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300045"}
