Through an empirical study of the use of a collaborative iPad game, Zody, we explore how assistive technologies can be used to support social relationships, even without intervention from adults. We discuss how specific design choices can encourage three levels of social relationship: membership, partnership, and friendship. This work contributes to research on both assistive technologies and collaborative gaming through a framework that describes how specific in-game elements can foster social skill development for children with ASD.", "paper_title": "Evaluating a Collaborative iPad Game's Impact on Social Relationships for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder", "paper_id": "WOS:000360083700003"}
