In the first part of the paper, two theorems concerning necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to this problem are presented. Due to the constructive form of the proof of these theorems, these results can be used to the development of techniques for the derivation of a control law transferring to the origin any state belonging to a given set of initial states while respecting the state and control constraints.", "paper_title": "An optimization approach to the design of constrained regulators for uncertain discrete-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242269300005"}
