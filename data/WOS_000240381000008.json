The algorithm aims to preserve two local shape properties: the Laplacian coordinates of the boundary curve and the local area of the shape interior, which are together represented in a non-quadratic energy function. An iterative Gauss-Newton method is used to minimize this nonlinear energy function. The result is an interactive shape deformation system that can achieve physically plausible results that are difficult to achieve with previous linear least squares methods. In addition to this algorithm that preserves local shape properties, we also introduce a scheme to preserve the global area of the shape, which is useful for deforming incompressible objects.", "paper_title": "2D shape deformation using nonlinear least squares optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000008"}
