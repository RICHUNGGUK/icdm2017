Here zeta(beta) is the Riemann zeta function of beta. We obtain this result by combining the Nemhauser and Trotter approach for MIN-VC with a new deterministic rounding procedure which achieves an approximation ratio of 3/2 on a subset of low degree vertices for which the expected contribution to the cost of the associated linear program is sufficiently large.
