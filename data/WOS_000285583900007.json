We have developed an extended Estelle, called Time-Estelle, suitable for specifying time-dependent performance characteristic of a multimedia system, and a method based on GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri Net) for analysing the performance of a protocol specified in Time-Estelle. This paper describes an application of this method to analyse the performance of an industrial multimedia protocol, the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) specified in Time-Estelle; it also presents the performance analysis results which are expressed in terms of blocking probability, packet dropping probability, channel utilisation and packet delay, with variations in time intervals.", "paper_title": "ANALYSING THE PERFORMANCE OF A RESOURCE RESERVATION PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION USING A GSPN METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000285583900007"}
