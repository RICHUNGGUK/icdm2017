This paper presents Triva, a software analysis tool that implements a novel technique to visualize the behavior of parallel applications. The proposed technique explores 3D graphics to show the application behavior together with a description of the resources, highlighting communication patterns, the network topology and a visual representation of a logical organization of the resources. We have used a real grid infrastructure to execute and trace applications composed of thousands of processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
