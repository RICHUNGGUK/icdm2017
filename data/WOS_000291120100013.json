It enlarges the section area and compacts the surrounding soil by high-powered shock wave pressure induced by an underwater electrical discharge. This study aims to establish a suitable numerical model for the simulation and prediction of ground borehole expansion induced by PDT. In order to examine the relationship between electricity and the characteristics of shock-waves generated by PDT, laboratory pulse discharge tests were performed using PDT equipment used in current practice. Then, based on the underwater explosion (UNDEX) model and a coupled acoustic-structural analysis scheme, the results of laboratory PDT tests were analyzed and numerically bench-marked to determine the equivalent UNDEX model parameters for providing shock loading input in a ground borehole expansion simulation. A series of expansion simulations for undrained clayey and sandy soils were performed, and the predicted borehole expansion behaviors were compared with the test results. Moreover, a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of soil properties on the expansion behavior. The results of the numerical work in this study appeared to be consistent with field test results published in the literature and showed that the soil characteristics related with packing, state of stresses, and degree of saturation were important when analyzing borehole expansion behavior.
