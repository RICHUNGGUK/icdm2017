Building an accurate correspondence between highly variable images requires a suitable dissimilarity measure. To date, most existing measures have used adapted distance based on a learned metric. Unfortunately, real-world human image data, which tends to show large intra-class variations and small inter-class differences, continues to prevent these measures from achieving satisfactory re-identification performance. Recognizing neighboring distribution can provide additional useful information to help tackle the deviation of the to-be-measured samples, we propose a novel dissimilarity measure from the neighborhood-wise relative information perspective, which can deliver the effectiveness of those well-distributed samples to the badly-distributed samples to make intra-class dissimilarities smaller than inter-class dissimilarities, in a learned discriminative space. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by explanation and experimentation.", "paper_title": "Person Re-Identification by Common-Near-Neighbor Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141300012"}
