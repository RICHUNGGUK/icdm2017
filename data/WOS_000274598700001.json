Whereas Price's taxonomy is directed to classifying features and characteristics of visualization systems, the new taxonomy focuses on evaluating current animation languages. The taxonomy can be used by algorithm visualization system designers as a tool to compare visualization system languages with each other as well as for designing and implementing new systems and language features. In addition, the taxonomy provides guidelines to the features that are needed for transferring animations between systems. This is an ongoing project that elaborates upon the work reported on in a briefer version of the taxonomy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
