To tackle the optimal design problem, two schemes are proposed, i.e., minimal backup path provisioning with topology augmentation (MBPP-TA), and global path pair provisioning with topology augmentation (GPPP-TA). Both schemes are formulated as integer linear programming (ILP) models, and are implemented using the proposed two-step linear programming (LP) approaches. Numerical results show that the two-step LP approaches achieve better solutions with significantly less execution time than the direct ILP approach. Moreover, results show that GPPP-TA provides better solutions than MBPP-TA at the cost of longer computation time.", "paper_title": "Incremental survivable network design with topology augmentation in SDH/SONET mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270743400013"}
