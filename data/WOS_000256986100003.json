The concepts refer to spatial and functional properties of typical indoor environments. Following different findings in spatial cognition, our model is composed of layers representing maps at different levels of abstraction. The complete system is integrated in a mobile robot endowed with laser and vision sensors for place and object recognition. The system also incorporates a linguistic framework that actively supports the map acquisition process, and which is used for situated dialogue. Finally, we discuss the capabilities of the integrated system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
