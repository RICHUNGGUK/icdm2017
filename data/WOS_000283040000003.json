Intensity-based method is popular in non-rigid registration, but it is sensitive to intensity variations and has problems with matching small structure features for the existence of speckles in ultrasound images. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm integrating the intensity and feature of ultrasound images. Both global shape information and local keypoint information extracted by scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) are incorporated into intensity similarity measure as the body force of viscous fluid model in a Bayesian framework. Experiments were performed on synthetic and clinical ultrasound images of breast and kidney. It is shown that shape and keypoint information significantly improves fluid model for non-rigid registration, especially for alignment of small structure features in accuracy.
