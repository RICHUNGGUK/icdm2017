A model with eight hypotheses was developed and tested using data collected from 250 Taiwanese manufacturing firms. Seven hypotheses find empirical support. The results show that intrafirm IT skills indeed can benefit interfirm collaboration and integration and thus, supply-chain performance. Our findings suggest that the value of skilled IT professionals for interfirm integration, supply-chain performance and collaborative relationships between firms is critical for realizing that value.
