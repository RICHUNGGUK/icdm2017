The time-dependent stretching velocity and the surface temperature are chosen. Series solutions of the governing boundary value problems are obtained by employing homotopy analysis method. Convergence of the obtained solution is explicitly discussed. The dependence of velocity and temperature profiles on the various quantities is shown and discussed by plotting graphs. Skin friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number tabulated and analyzed.
