The current investigation offers further refinement of their theory. Specifically, we examine what changes are taking place at the same organization regarding the unique challenges and barriers lacing women in the IS field. We compare and contrast the challenges and barriers evoked at two time periods. Our findings suggest a shift in the origins of the barriers for women in IS from societal to more organizational and interpersonal sources. Insights presented in this study can help employers mitigate these challenges and barriers through the implementation of programs and practices that are systemic in nature, focusing on reshaping assumptions, values and cultures.", "paper_title": "REVISITING THE BARRIERS FACING WOMEN IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208869000007"}
