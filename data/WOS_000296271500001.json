Like other computer programs, errors may occur in a CNC program, which may lead to scraps or even accidents. Therefore, NC programs need to be verified before actual machining commences. Computer-based NC machining simulation is an economic and safe verification method. So far, much research effort concerning NC machining simulation has been made. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of such research work and a clear understanding of the direction in the field. First, the definition, common errors, programming approaches and verification methods of NC programs are introduced. Then, the definitions of geometric and physical NC machining simulation are presented. Four categories of NC machining simulation methods are discussed. They are solid-based, object space-based, image space-based and Web-based NC machining simulations. Finally, future trends and concluding remarks are presented.", "paper_title": "Numerical control machining simulation: a comprehensive survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000296271500001"}
