We give highlights of AI and computational intelligence applications in the new field of general purpose computing on graphics hardware (GPGPU). In particular, we surveyed genetic programming (GP) use with GPU. We gave several applications from Bioinformatics and showed that how the fastest GP is based on an interpreter rather than compilation. Finally using GP to generate GPU CUDA kernel C++ code is sketched.", "paper_title": "Graphics processing units and genetic programming: an overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000292551100016"}
