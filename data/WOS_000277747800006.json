All design modules are packaged and implemented, and the experiments are conducted to study the effects of interactive deformation. The study compares the experimental results of haptic feedback by different force propagation methods, according to the Hounsfield unit (HU) of volume data. Additionally, the estimation of optimal propagation depth is illustrated by using a mass-spring model. Finally, by using the proposed scheme, a haptic-based medical simulation system for brain surgery is investigated. The integration test results with haptic feedback scenarios show that the proposed development scheme can certainly comply with the design modules, and the deformable simulation and haptic force reach a good agreement.
