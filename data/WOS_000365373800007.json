The core of our method is a new measure for pairwise comparison of DNA sequences. Next, according to this approach, we give an analogous measure to analysis of protein sequences based on differential amino acids. Our method does not require complex calculations and will be convenient for a fast comparison of biological sequences. Finally, to illustrate its utility, we construct phylogenetic tree for ND5 and ND6 protein sequences of nine species.", "paper_title": "A New Measure for Pairwise Comparison of Protein Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800007"}
