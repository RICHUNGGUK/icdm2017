The problem arises through the heterogeneity, distribution and sharing of the resources in different virtual organisations. Interoperability is a main issue for applications to function with the Grid. This paper proposes a matchmaking framework for service discovery in Grid environments based on three selection stages which are context, semantic and registry selection. It provides a better service discovery process by using semantic descriptions stored in ontologies which specify both the Grid services and the application knowledge. The framework permits Grid applications to specify the criteria a service request is matched with and enables interoperability for the matchmaking process. A proof of concept is done with a prototype implementation, and an enhancement of the matchmaking process is achieved with a similarity metric which allows quantifying the quality of a match. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the prototype system is given with an analysis and performance measurements to quantify the scalability of the prototype. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
