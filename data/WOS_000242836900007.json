The objective function of the total relevant costs considered in our model is mathematically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A complete search procedure is provided to find the optimal solution by employing the properties derived in this paper and the Nelder-Mead algorithm. Also, based on the search procedure developed in this paper, a decision support system is implemented on a personal computer to solve the proposed problem. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
