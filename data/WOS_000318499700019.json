The most compatible structure for field-programmable analog array is identified. A CCII adopting active current division networks are utilized for implementing the proposed filter leading to wide control of its coefficients. Programmability characteristics are demonstrated through experimental results obtained from integrated circuit chips fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process.", "paper_title": "Implementation of reconfigurable nth-order filter based on CCII", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700019"}
