Construction D, Construction , and Forney's code formula are classical constructions that produce such lattices explicitly from a family of nested binary linear codes. In this paper, we investigate these three closely related constructions along with the recently developed Construction of lattices from codes over the polynomial ring . We show that Construction by Code Formula produces a lattice packing if and only if the nested codes being used are closed under Schur product, thus proving the similarity of Construction D and Construction by Code Formula when applied to Reed-Muller codes. In addition, we relate Construction by Code Formula to Construction by finding a correspondence between nested binary codes and codes over . This proves that any lattice constructible using Construction by Code Formula is also constructible using Construction . Finally, we show that Construction produces a lattice if and only if the corresponding code over is closed under shifted Schur product.", "paper_title": "Connections between Construction D and related constructions of lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100012"}
