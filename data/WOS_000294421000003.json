Some controllers treat prefetches the same as demand requests, and others always prioritize demands over prefetches. However, none of these rigid policies result in the best performance because they do not take into account the usefulness of prefetches. If prefetches are useless, treating prefetches and demands equally can lead to significant performance loss and extra bandwidth consumption. In contrast, if prefetches are useful, prioritizing demands over prefetches can hurt performance by reducing DRAM throughput and delaying the service of useful requests. This paper proposes a new low hardware cost memory controller, called as Prefetch-Aware DRAM Controller (PADC), that aims to maximize the benefit of useful prefetches and minimize the harm caused by useless prefetches. The key idea is to 1) adaptively prioritize between demands and prefetches, and 2) drop useless prefetches to free up memory system resources, based on prefetch accuracy. Our evaluation shows that PADC significantly outperforms previous memory controllers with rigid prefetch handling policies. Across a wide range of multiprogrammed SPEC CPU 2000/2006 workloads, it improves system performance by 8.2 and 9.9 percent on four and eight-core systems while reducing DRAM bandwidth consumption by 10.7 and 9.4 percent, respectively.", "paper_title": "Prefetch-Aware Memory Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000294421000003"}
