Although great progress has been made in the development of gene-finding algorithms during the past decades, there is still room for further improvement. In particular, the issue of recognizing short exons in eukaryotes is still not solved satisfactorily. This article is devoted to assessing various linear and kernel-based classification algorithms and selecting the best combination of Z-curve features for further improvement of the issue. Eight state-of-the-art linear and kernel-based supervised pattern recognition techniques were used to identify the short (21-192 bp) coding sequences of human genes. By measuring the prediction accuracy, the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and the time consumption, partial least squares (PLS) and kernel partial least squares (KPLS) algorithms were verified to be the most optimal linear and kernel-based classifiers, respectively. A surprising result was that, by making good use of the interpretability of the PLS and the Z-curve methods, 93 Z-curve features were proved to be the best selective combination. Using them, the average recognition accuracy was improved as high as 7.7% by means of KPLS when compared with what was obtained by the Fisher discriminant analysis using 189 Z-curve variables (Gao and Zhang, 2004).
