To aid the image analysis process, we apply supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition techniques for computing enhanced visualizations of suspicious lesions in breast MRI data. These techniques represent art important component of future sophisticated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and support the visual exploration of spatial and temporal features of DCE-MRI data stemming from patients with confirmed lesion diagnosis. By taking into account the heterogeneity of cancerous tissue, these techniques reveal signals with malignant, benign and normal kinetics. They also provide a regional subclassification of pathological breast tissue, which is the basis for pseudo-color presentations of the image data. Intelligent medical systems Lire expected to have substantial implications in healthcare politics by contributing to the diagnosis of by contributing to the diagnosis of indeterminate breast lesions by non-invasive imaging.
