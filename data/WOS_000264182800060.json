Periodic docking facilities which can be recognized as the biggest logistical issue in the content of ship maintenance program are the critical processes from the viewpoint of ship owners. Hence, this process should be well-planned and organized to satisfy the various expectations such as quality of service, capacity limitations, and geographical advantages, by taking cost and time constraints into account. Hence, the selection problem with respect to several criteria to find the most suitable shipyards is getting more important for ship management companies. This paper investigates a systematic evaluation model on docking facilities of shipyards to provide a decision aid for technical ship managers and to perform this responsibility in an efficient manner. Multiple criteria fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) approach is used for selection among shipyards since FAD lets us de. ne the design interval of each criterion. The original contributions of the paper are seemed in both enhancing the theoretical frame of FAD in terms of managing group consensus and performing an application to a real case in maritime industry.
