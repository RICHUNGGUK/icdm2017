A reliable deployment should take temperature into account to avoid network connectivity problems resulting from poor wireless links when temperature increases. A good deployment needs also to adapt its operation and save resources when temperature decreases and wireless links improve. Taking into account the probabilistic nature of the wireless communication channel, we develop a mathematical model that provides the most energy efficient deployment in function of temperature without compromising the correct operation of the network by preserving both connectivity and coverage. We use our model to design three temperature-aware algorithms that seek to save energy (i) by putting some nodes in hibernate mode as in the Stop-Operate (SO) algorithm, or (ii) by using transmission power control as in Power-Control (PC), or (iii) by doing both techniques as in Stop-Operate Power-Control (SOPC). All proposed algorithms are fully distributed and solely rely on temperature readings without any information exchange between neighbors, which makes them low overhead and robust. Our results identify the optimal operation of each algorithm and show that a significant amount of energy can be saved by taking temperature into account.", "paper_title": "Joint Connectivity-Coverage Temperature-Aware Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356138700012"}
