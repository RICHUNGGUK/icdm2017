Although it has been widely investigated and shown feasible and efficient in cellular networks, there is little work for the ad hoc networks, especially in real protocol and algorithm design. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, namely, the Opportunistic Medium Access and Auto Rate (OMAR), to efficiently utilize the shared medium in IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc networks by taking advantage of diversity, distributed scheduling, and adaptivity. In an ad hoc network, especially in a heterogeneous ad hoc network or a mesh network, some nodes may need to communicate with multiple one-hop nodes. We allow such a node with a certain number of links to function as a clusterhead to locally coordinate multiuser communications. We introduce a CDF-based ( Cumulative Distribution Function) K-ary opportunistic splitting algorithm and a distributed stochastic scheduling algorithm to resolve intra and intercluster collisions, respectively. Fairness is formulated and solved in terms of social optimality within and across clusters. Analytical and simulation results show that our scheme can significantly improve communication efficiency while providing social fairness.", "paper_title": "OMAR: Utilizing multiuser diversity in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241195600010"}
