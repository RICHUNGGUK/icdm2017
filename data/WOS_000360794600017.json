To help protocol designers and developers efficiently find non-trivial bugs, we introduce SYMCONF, a practical conformance testing tool that generates high-coverage test input packets using a conformance test suite and symbolic execution. Our approach can be viewed as the combination of conformance testing and symbolic execution: 1) it first selects symbolic inputs from an existing conformance test suite; 2) it then symbolically executes a network protocol implementation with the symbolic inputs; and 3) it finally generates high-coverage test input packets using a conformance test suite. We demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology by applying SYMCONF to the generation of a stream of high quality test input packets for multiple implementations of two network protocols, the Kerberos Telnet protocol and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and discovering non-trivial security bugs in the protocols.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Conformance Testing Using Symbolic Execution for Network Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000360794600017"}
