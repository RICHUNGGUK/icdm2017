Hence there is need for developing frameworks for carrying out CDN simulations. In this article we present a modeling and simulation framework for CDNs, called CDNsim. CDNsim has been designated to provide a realistic simulation for CDNs, simulating the surrogate servers, the TCP/IP protocol, and the main CDN functions. The main advantages of this tool are its high performance, its extensibility, and its user interface, which is used to configure its parameters. CDNsim provides an automated environment for conducting experiments and extracting client, server, and network statistics. The purpose of CDNsim is to be used as a testbed for CDN evaluation and experimentation. This is quite useful to both the research community (to experiment with new CDN data management techniques), and for CDN developers (to evaluate profits on prior certain CDN installations).", "paper_title": "CDNsim: A Simulation Tool for Content Distribution Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362500004"}
