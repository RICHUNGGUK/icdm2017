When vehicles are in the fast-moving environment, this paper proposes a Dynamic ID scheme which can protect the privacy of vehicles' identity. In this paper, we divide the message transferring model into the uploading process and the downloading process. The uploading process has four stages, including the Connection establishment, the game, the detecting process and the messages sending process. In the four stages, this paper uses the Dynamic ID scheme, realizing the identity privacy. In the communication of ensuring the privacy, this paper builds a game model which is based on the reliability and the frequency of contacts, accomplishing the reliable transmission. Finally, the results of the simulation demonstrate that the presented method, the Identity Privacy-based Reliable Routing method (IPRR), cannot only increase the delivery ratio, but also reduce the end to end delay and the overhead ratio of the Network.", "paper_title": "Identity privacy-based reliable routing method in VANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209900007"}
