We prove that the deterministic parity decision tree complexity of any Boolean function is polynomially related to the non-deterministic complexity of the function or its complement. We also show that they are polynomially related to an analogue of the block sensitivity. We further study parity decision trees in their relations with an intermediate variant of the decision trees, as well as with communication complexity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
