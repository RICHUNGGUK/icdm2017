System integration, that is a major step in SoC design, requires taking into account communication and timing constraints to design and integrate dedicated hardware accelerator. In this paper, we propose a design flow based on formal models that allows high-level synthesis under input/output timing constraints of DSP algorithms. Based on a generic architecture, the presented method provides automatic generation of customized hardware components. We show the effectiveness of our approach in a case study of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm for turbo decoding. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
