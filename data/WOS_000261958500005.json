The paper presents a robust and effective approach for speech/music discrimination, which relies on a set of features derived from fundamental frequency (F0) estimation. Comparison between the proposed set of features and some commonly used timbral features is performed, aiming to assess the good discriminatory power of the proposed F0-based feature set. The classification scheme is composed of a classical Statistical Pattern Recognition classifier followed by a Fuzzy Rules Based System. Comparison with other well-proven classification schemes is also performed. Experimental results reveal that our speech/music discriminator is robust enough, making it suitable for a wide variety of multimedia applications.", "paper_title": "New speech/music discrimination approach based on fundamental frequency estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000261958500005"}
