Caching frequent queries can expedite XML query processing. In this paper, we propose a framework to address an NP-hard optimization problem, caching frequent query patterns, We develop several algorithms to respectively generate query subpatterns, check query containment, and choose query subpatterns for caching. Experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient and scalable.", "paper_title": "Caching frequent XML query patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100008"}
