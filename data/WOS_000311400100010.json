Recently, the crystal structure of human dopamine D3 receptor was reported, which facilitates structure-based drug discovery of D3R significantly. We dock D3R-selective compounds into the crystal structure of D3R and homology structure of D2R. Then we perform 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) of the receptor with selective compounds bound in explicit lipid and water. Our docking and MD results indicate the important residues related to the selectivity of D3R. Specifically, residue Thr(7.39) in D3R may contribute to the high selectivity of R-22 with D3R. Meanwhile, the 4-carbon linker and phenylpiperazine of R-22 improve the binding affinity and the selectivity with D3R. We also dock the agonists, including dopamine, into D3R and perform MD. Our molecular dynamics results of D3R with agonist bound show strong conformational changes from TM5, TM6, and TM7, outward movement of intracellular part of TM6, fluctuation of \"ionic lock\" motif and conformational change of Tyr(7.53), which is consistent with recent crystal structures of active GPCRs and illustrates the dynamical process during activation. Our results reveal the mechanism of selectivity and activation for D3R, which is important for developing high selective antagonists and agonists for D3R.", "paper_title": "Selectivity and activation of dopamine D3R from molecular dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000311400100010"}
