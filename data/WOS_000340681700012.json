In our IBE scheme, all parameters have constant numbers of group elements, and are shorter than those of previous constructions based on decisional linear (DLIN) assumption. Our construction uses both dual system encryption (Waters, CRYPTO 2009) and dual pairing vector spaces (Okamoto and Takashima, Pairing 2008; ASIACRYPT 2009). Specifically, we show how to adapt the recent DLIN-based instantiation of Lewko (EUROCRYPT 2012) to the SXDH assumption. To our knowledge, this is the first work to instantiate either dual system encryption or dual pairing vector spaces under the SXDH assumption. Furthermore, our work could be extended to many other functional encryption. In Particular, we show how to instantiate our framework to inner product encryption and key-policy functional encryption. All parameters of our constructions are shorter than those of DLIN-based constructions.", "paper_title": "Shorter identity-based encryption via asymmetric pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700012"}
