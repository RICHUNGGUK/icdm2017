The communication overhead was minimized by adopting a compact representation of the data exchanged among agents and by reusing previously-computed partial solutions.", "paper_title": "Experimental Analysis of Graph-based Answer Set Computation over Parallel and Distributed Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000268331500008"}
