Specifically, the problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game where all the data are players and the goal is to uniformly and consistently label all of the synthetic data created by any over-sampling technique. The proposed algorithm does not require any prior assumptions and selects representative synthetic instances while generating a very small number of noisy data. We present extensive experimental results over a large collection of datasets using three different classifiers to demonstrate the advantages of our method.", "paper_title": "NEATER: filtering of over-sampled data using non-cooperative game theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000361738400018"}
