However, it involves relatively high decoding complexity. Owing to different convergence behaviors of variable nodes, the nodes detected early can be deleted from the Tanner graph, which reduces the size of the parity-check matrix iteration by iteration and thus the decoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new decoding algorithm for LDPC-coded modulation with reduced complexity. In addition, by deleting the converged bits from the modulation constellation and updating the bit metrics of the demapper with the reduced constellation, more accurate estimation of the bits can be achieved. Simulation results show that, compared with conventional decoding schemes, the proposed method not only greatly reduces the overall decoding complexity for LDPC-coded modulation but also significantly improves decoding performance.", "paper_title": "Forced-convergence decoding for LDPC-coded modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314426900011"}
