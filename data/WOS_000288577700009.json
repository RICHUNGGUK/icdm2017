Because reflectance properties are invariant to changes in illumination, the albedo is promising to range image registration of Lambertian objects lacking in discriminative geometric features under variable illumination. We use adaptive regions in our method to model the local distribution of albedo, which enables us to stably extract the reliable attributes of each point against illumination estimates. We use a level-set method to grow robust and adaptive regions to define these attributes. A similarity metric between two attributes is also defined to match points in the overlapping area. Moreover, remaining mismatches are efficiently removed using the rigidity constraint of surfaces. Our experiments using synthetic and real data demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
