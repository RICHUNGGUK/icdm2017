Traditionally, textual information around the image is used to represent the high-level features of the image. We argue that such \"flat\" representation can not describe images well. In this paper, Hierarchical Representation (HR) and HR-Tree are proposed for image description. Salient phrases in HR-Tree are further to distinguish this image with others sharing the same ancestor concepts. First, we design a method to extract the salient phrases for the images in data records. Then HR-Trees are built using these phrases. Finally, new hierarchical clustering algorithm based on HR-Tree is proposed for users' browsing conveniently. We demonstrate some HR-Trees and clustering results in experimental section.. These results illustrate the advantages of our methods.", "paper_title": "Image description mining and hierarchical clustering on data records using HR-tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000034"}
