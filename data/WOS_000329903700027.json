A rear electric motor has been added to the vehicle driveline and the positive/negative torque generated by this motor affects the driving conditions. The vehicle stability control is addressed using high order sliding modes (HOSMs) control and observation techniques. Two cases are studied: yaw stability and traction control. The proposed controllers preserve the system's safety under undesirable rear motor effects, at the same time, they cope with vehicle uncertainties. The feasibility of this platform was tested in a vehicle simulator.", "paper_title": "High order sliding mode control for hybrid vehicle stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000329903700027"}
