In order to make the beat-to-beat (RR) interval be a function of time and produce an evenly sampled time series, we first adopt a preprocessing method to interpolate and resample the original RR interval. Then, the HHT, which is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach to decompose the HRV signal into several monocomponent signals that become analytic signals by means of Hilbert transform, is proposed to extract the features of preprocessed time series and to characterize the dynamic behaviors of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system of heart. At last, the frequency behaviors of the Hilbert spectrum and Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) are studied to estimate the spectral traits of HRV signals. In this paper, two kinds of experiment data are used to compare our method with the conventional power spectral density (PSD) estimation. The analysis results of the simulated HRV series show that interpolation and resampling are basic requirements for HRV data processing, and HMS is superior to PSD estimation. On the other hand, in order to further prove the superiority of our approach, real HRV signals are collected from seven young health subjects under the condition that autonomic nervous system (ANS) is blocked by certain acute selective blocking drugs: atropine and metoprolol. The high-frequency power/total power ratio and low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio indicate that compared with the Fourier spectrum based on principal dynamic mode, our method is more sensitive and effective to identify the low-frequency and high-frequency bands of HRV.", "paper_title": "Hilbert-Huang Transform for Analysis of Heart Rate Variability in Cardiac Health", "paper_id": "WOS:000294782100010"}
