Terrain is a very important element in these outdoor scenarios. Artists are currently requiring a higher level of customization. In this sense, the objective of the work presented in this paper is to provide the final user with an easy-to-use terrain generation application. More precisely, our aim is to ease the creation of islands. We propose a sketching solution which, combined with a simple terrain algorithm, is capable of suiting the user needs. The application is composed of two windows, which offer 2D and 3D representations of the terrain respectively. These windows are sufficient for providing the user with an interactive feedback about the island that is being designed. We try to show that relatively simple algorithms can be combined and improved to provide successful results.", "paper_title": "Automatic terrain generation with a sketching tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500026"}
