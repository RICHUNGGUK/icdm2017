In order to reduce the RR data rates and further exploit the identical nature of the coefficient distributions between adjacent DCT subbands, the DCT coefficients are reorganized into a three-level coefficient tree. Subsequently, generalized Gaussian density (GGD) is employed to model the coefficient distribution of each reorganized DCT subband. The city-block distance is employed to measure the difference between the two images. Experimental results demonstrate that only a small number of RR features is sufficient for representing the image perceptual quality. The proposed method outperforms the RR WNISM and even the full-reference (FR) quality metric PSNR.", "paper_title": "Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using Reorganized DCT-Based Image Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293710300020"}
