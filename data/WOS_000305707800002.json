The author proposes herein a technique of integrating global and local voting of classifiers. A comparison with other well-known combining methods on standard benchmark data sets was performed, and the accuracy of the proposed method was greater.", "paper_title": "Integrating Global and Local Voting of Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000305707800002"}
