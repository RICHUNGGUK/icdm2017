In doing so, we employ symmetry-adapted perturbation theory based on density functional theory description of monomers, and we perform the many-body variational-perturbational interaction energy decomposition. The principal finding of this study is that the stability of nicotinamide complexes is a complicated interplay of four (large in magnitude) interaction-energy components, i.e. induction, dispersion, electrostatic and exchange repulsion. However, the last two contributions cancel each other out to a large extent. In the case of considered three-body complexes, the nonadditivity effects are found to be not important. Based on the results of topological analysis of charge densities we characterized also the properties of short H ... H contact and identified it as a weak noncovalent closed shell interaction.
