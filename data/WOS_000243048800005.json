However, unlike for other media, the management of a collection of video documents adds the problem of efficiently handling an overwhelming volume of temporal data. Challenges include balancing efficient content modeling and storage against fast access at various levels. In this paper, we detail the framework we have built to accommodate our developments in content-based multimedia retrieval. We show that not only our framework facilitates the development of processing and indexing algorithms but it also opens the way to several other possibilities such as rapid interface prototyping or retrieval algorithm benchmarking. Here, we discuss our developments in relation to wider contexts such as MPEG-7 and the TREC Video Track.", "paper_title": "Handling temporal heterogeneous data for content-based management of large video collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000243048800005"}
