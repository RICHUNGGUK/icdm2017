The study of chromosomes has recently become integrated with molecular biology and genomics. Thus, it is an important part of genetics education. However, it is time consuming to train students and clinical technologists to recognize patterns of G-banded human chromosomes because of the dynamic nature of G-band resolutions in different metaphase spreads. Moreover, there are limited resources to obtain the images of abnormal chromosomes. We present in this paper an advanced version of computer based interactive tutorial program capable of simulating chromosome abnormalities, altering chromosome shapes, and manipulating G-band resolutions for human cytogenetic seduction. By simulating chromosomes using digital image processing and pattern recognition, the versatile software, together with various strategies such as website links and dialogs, will provide students with a virtual learning environment for self-practicing and testing, thus transforming the traditionally dry and ineffective approach into an exciting and efficient learning process.
