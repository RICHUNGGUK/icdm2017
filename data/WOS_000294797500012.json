The feedback loop is subjected to a time-varying bounded delay within the sensors and the structure. By using an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and some free weighting matrices, new sufficient conditions in terms of some linear matrix inequalities are established for the existence of desired controllers such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and kept within a prescribed level of H-infinity performance bound. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed control methodology.", "paper_title": "H-infinity CONTROL DESIGN FOR BUILDING STRUCTURES UNDER SEISMIC MOTION WITH WIRELESS COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500012"}
