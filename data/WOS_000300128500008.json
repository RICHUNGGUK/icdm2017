A generic methodology to investigate application performance and scaling characteristics has been defined, resulting in a detailed understanding of the performance of these applications. This methodology is transferable to other applications and systems: it is of practical value to developers and users who are aiming for optimal utilisation of HPC resources. An understanding of the performance characteristics of a range of large-scale HPC resources has been obtained using low-level synthetic benchmarks. A relatively simple, qualitative mechanism to assess and predict application performance on current and future architectures using synthetic benchmark results together with application performance analysis results is explored.
