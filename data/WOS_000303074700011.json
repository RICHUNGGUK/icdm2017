Inspired by nature, organic computing research wants to learn and adopt from techniques and properties of nature. The artificial hormone system (AHS), motivated by the hormone system of mammals as a role model, was designed to map tasks on processing elements using artificial hormones. In previous publications, the idea of an organic middleware and first theoretical results were presented. To be able to run this middleware in an embedded scenario, a pure ANSI C implementation of the AHS will be presented together with first real-world scenarios and results of test series.", "paper_title": "Implementing and evaluating the AHS organic middleware", "paper_id": "WOS:000303074700011"}
