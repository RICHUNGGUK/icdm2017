Simulation results show that both the correlation of the observation channels and the correlation of the clutter-plus-noise will reduce the detection performance. The algorithm can be utilized to compute and analyze the detection performance of a MIMO radar system for any given transmitter/receiver geometry and varying levels of correlation in the target.", "paper_title": "MIMO RADAR WITH ARBITRARILY DISTRIBUTED ARRAY-TARGET CONFIGURATION IN THE PRESENCE OF POSSIBLE NON-GAUSSIAN CLUTTER-PLUS-NOISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578100014"}
