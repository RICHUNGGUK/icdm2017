In this paper, to lay a solid foundation for future research into the safety verification of semi-algebraic dynamical systems, we first establish a formal framework for evaluating the quality of continuous inductive conditions. In addition, we propose a new complete and computable inductive condition for verifying the safety of semi-algebraic dynamical systems. Compared with the existing complete and computable inductive condition, this new inductive condition can be easily adapted to achieve a set of sufficient inductive conditions with different level of conservativeness and computational complexity, which provides us with a means to trade off between the verification power and complexity. These inductive conditions can be solved by quantifier elimination and SMT solvers.", "paper_title": "Safety Verification of Semi-Algebraic Dynamical Systems via Inductive Invariant", "paper_id": "WOS:000364486500012"}
