Motivated by recent results for both strategies, we investigate possible combinations of in-place and merge-based index maintenance. We present a hybrid approach in which long posting lists are updated in-place, while short lists are updated using a merge strategy. Our experimental results show that this hybrid approach achieves better indexing performance than either method (in-place, merge-based) alone.", "paper_title": "A hybrid approach to index maintenance in dynamic text retrieval systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200021"}
