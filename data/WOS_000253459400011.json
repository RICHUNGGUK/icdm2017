We do not a priori know the eigenfunctions for the linearized problem since the SO(2) symmetry of the problem is broken by perturbation. We show that how the neutral stability curves change and, as a result, how the bifurcation diagrams change by the perturbation of the boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "Bifurcations for turing instability without SO(2) symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000253459400011"}
