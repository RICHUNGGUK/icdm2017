To maximize these benefits, accelerator-based systems that emphasize computation on accelerators (rather than on general purpose cores) should be used. We introduce the \"accelerator store,\" a structure for sharing memory between accelerators in these accelerator-based systems. The accelerator store simplifies accelerator I/O and reduces area by mapping memory to accelerators when needed at runtime. Preliminary results demonstrate a 30% system area reduction with no energy overhead and less than 1% performance overhead in contrast to conventional DMA schemes.", "paper_title": "The Accelerator Store framework for high-performance, low-power accelerator-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288082400004"}
