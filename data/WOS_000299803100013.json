This Interactive Tool for System Identification Education (ITSIE) has been developed using Sysquake, a Matlab-like language with fast execution and excellent facilities for interactive graphics, and is deliverd as a stand-alone executable that is readily accessible to students and engineers. ITSIE provides two distinct functional modes that are very useful from an educational and industrial point of view. The simulation mode enables the user to evaluate the main stages of system identification, from input signal design through model validation, simultaneously and interactively in one screen on a user-specified dynamical system. The real data mode allows the user to load experimental data obtained externally and identify suitable models in an interactive fashion. The interactive tool enables students and engineers in industry to discover a myriad of fundamental system identification concepts with a much lower learning curve than existing methods.
