The system is able to perform human face tracking, voice activity detection, sound source direction estimation, and speech enhancement in real-time. Estimating the sound source directions helps to initialize the human face tracking module when the target changes the direction. The implementation architecture is based on an embedded dual-core processor, Texas Instruments DM6446 platform (Davinci), which contains an ARM core and a DSP core. For speech signal processing, an eight-channel digital microphone array is developed and the associated pre-processing and interfacing features are designed using the Altera Cyclone II FPGA. All the experiments are conducted in a real environment and the experimental results show that this system can execute all the audition and vision functions in real-time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
