The details of flow separation, formation of the detached shear layer, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (inviscid shear layer instability) and vortex shedding, interaction of nonlinear waves, breakdown, and re-attachment are obtained and analyzed. The power spectral density of pressure shows the low frequency of vortex shedding caused by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability still dominates from the leading edge to trailing edge. Based on our understanding on the flow separation mechanism, we try to reveal the mechanism of the flow separation control using blowing jets and then optimize the jets. DNS simulations for flow separation control by blowing jets (pulsed and pitched and skewed jets) are reported and analyzed. The effects of different unsteady blowing jets on the surface at the location just before the separation points are studied. The length of separation bubble is significantly reduced (almost removed) after unsteady blowing technology is applied. The mechanism of early transition caused by the blowing jets was found. A blowing jet with K-H frequency, sharp shape function (very small mass blowing), pitching and skewing obtained the best efficiency based on the increase of the ratio of lift over drag and decrease of blowing mass flow. In this work, a DNS code with high-order accuracy and high-resolution developed by the computational fluid dynamics group at University of Texas at Arlington is applied.
