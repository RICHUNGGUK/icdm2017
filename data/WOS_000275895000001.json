The constructive proof that every rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series has the same sum is relatively straightforward; but the proof that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to whatsoever we please is a good deal more delicate in the constructive framework. The work in the paper answers affirmatively a question posed many years ago by Beeson.", "paper_title": "Rearranging Series Constructively", "paper_id": "WOS:000275895000001"}
