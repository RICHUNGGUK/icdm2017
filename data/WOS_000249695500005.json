For this purpose, a formula of a specific type of ILC which updates the input in an appropriate parameter space is extended to the case of MIMO systems with fixed disturbances. Then a concrete procedure to construct such an ILC is given to apply the ILC to the continuous- time system identification. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate how the parameter estimation can be achieved through the proposed ILC method in the presence of heavy measurement noises.", "paper_title": "An iterative learning control based identification for a class of MIMO continuous-time systems in the presence of fixed input disturbances and measurement noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000249695500005"}
