A new aspect of the accuracy problem, presented in this paper, is the dependence on the type of flux solver: while the accuracy of the HLL scheme massively decreases for Ma -> 0 on a given triangular mesh, the Roe scheme remains accurate, i.e. flows of arbitrarily small Mach numbers can - at least in principle - be simulated on a fixed triangular mesh. We give an asymptotic analysis of this phenomenon and present a number of numerical results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
