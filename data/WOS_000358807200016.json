In this paper, we propose a modified/shared replication cache to keep a redundancy for the latest accessed and modified/shared L2 cache lines. According to the experiments based on Multi2Sim, this cache with proper size can provide considerable data reliability. In addition, the cache can reduce the average latency of memory hierarchy for error correction, with only about 20.2% of L2 cache energy cost and 2% of L2 cache silicon overhead.
