Current research tries to lower any pessimism. However, often it leads to an important increase in the number of decision variables, and problems become unsolvable. In this correspondence, we choose to reduce the number of decision variables while not raising the conservatism in comparison with previous results. This correspondence deals with the discrete case, which is harder to solve. We supply results about the stabilization, the regulator problem, and also H-infinity control.", "paper_title": "Discrete Takagi-Sugeno's fuzzy models: Reduction of the number of LMI in fuzzy control techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191900019"}
