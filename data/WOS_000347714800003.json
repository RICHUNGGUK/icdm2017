We consider the class of recursive omega-languages, i.e. the class of omega-languages accepted by Turing machines with a Buchi acceptance condition, which is also the class Sigma(1)(1) of (effective) analytic subsets of X-omega for some finite alphabet X. We investigate here the notion of ambiguity for recursive omega-languages with regard to acceptance by Buchi Turing machines. We first present in detail essentials on the literature on omega-languages accepted by Turing Machines. Then we give a complete and broad view on the notion of ambiguity and unambiguity of Buchi Turing machines and of the omega-languages they accept. To obtain our new results, we make use of results and methods of effective descriptive set theory.", "paper_title": "AMBIGUITY OF omega-LANGUAGES OF TURING MACHINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800003"}
