In this paper, we show that we can do more than it is possible classically through the use of specific tools and techniques from quantum information processing and quantum cryptography. Specifically, we devise a quantum security scheme that completely eliminates the problem of identity theft in sensor networks, although our scheme may be of interest in more general situations involving secrecy and authentication. The hypercomputational aspect of this result pertains to the unprecedented level of security achieved, a level that is beyond the reach of classical information processing.", "paper_title": "Hypercomputation in a Cryptographic Setting: Solving the Identity Theft Problem Using Quantum Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000287425700004"}
