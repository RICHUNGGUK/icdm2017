The default input device of our system is a pressure-sensitive 2D stylus, the most common sketching tool for digital artists, and we propose two interaction mode: ink-flicking mode and ink-dripping mode, that are designed to be analogous to the artistic techniques of ink splattering in real world. The core of our ink splattering system is a novel three-stage ink splattering framework that simulates the physics-based interaction of ink with different mediums including brush heads, air and paper. We have implemented the physical engine in CUDA and the whole simulation process runs at interactive speed.", "paper_title": "Interactive Physics-based Ink Splattering Art Creation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800016"}
