This proposed hybrid PID-RMRAC control scheme overcomes the inherent drawbacks of both the PID and RMRAC controllers. It is in this manner, that better system stability and control of the rotor vibrational amplitudes are realized. The experiment results indicated that better dynamic response can be realized with the hybrid control scheme as compared to a pure PID scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
