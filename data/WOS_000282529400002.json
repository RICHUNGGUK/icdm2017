We show that current retrieval methods do not scale well towards large databases in the context of interactively supervised search and propose two different approaches for which we objectively evaluate that they significantly outperform existing approaches. The proposed descriptors are constructed such that both the full color image and the sketch undergo exactly the same preprocessing steps. We first search for an image with similar structure, analyzing gradient orientations. Then, best matching images are clustered based on dominant color distributions, to offset the lack of color-based decision during the initial search. Overall, the query results demonstrate that the system offers intuitive access to large image databases using a user-friendly sketch-and-browse interface. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
