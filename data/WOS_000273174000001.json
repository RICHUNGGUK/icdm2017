The elevated glutamate concentration causes an increased activation of NMDA receptors in pyramidal neurons, which in turn leads to neuronal dynamics that is qualitatively identical to epileptiform activity. We identify by chaos analysis a surprising possibility that muscarinergic receptors can help the system out of a chaotic regime.", "paper_title": "MODELING OF GLUTAMATE-INDUCED DYNAMICAL PATTERNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273174000001"}
