Candidate solutions generated with these techniques allow finding optimal embedding parameters of all blocks of a cover image. However, using EC techniques for full optimization of a stream of high-resolution grayscale face images is very costly. In this paper, a blockwise multi-resolution clustering (BMRC) framework is proposed to reduce this cost. During training phase, solutions obtained from multi-objective optimization of reference face images are stored in an associative memory. During generalization operations, embedding parameters of an input image are determined by searching for previously stored solutions of similar sub-problems in memory, thereby eliminating the need for full optimization for the whole face image. Solutions for sub-problems correspond to the most common embedding parameters for a cluster of similar blocks in the texture feature space. BMRC identifies candidate block clusters used for embedding watermark bits using the robustness score metric. It measures the texture complexity of image block clusters and can thereby handle watermarks of different lengths. The proposed framework implements a multi-hypothesis approach by storing the optimization solutions according to different clustering resolutions and selecting the optimal resolution at the end of the watermarking process. Experimental results on the PUT face image database show a significant reduction in complexity up to 95.5 % reduction in fitness evaluations compared with reference methods for a stream of 198 face images.", "paper_title": "Rapid blockwise multi-resolution clustering of facial images for intelligent watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000330648500001"}
