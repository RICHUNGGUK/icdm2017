Briefly, SLRA is defined as follows. Given an initial matrix with a certain structure (for example, Hankel), the aim is to find a matrix of specified lower rank that approximates this initial matrix, whilst maintaining the initial structure. We demonstrate that the optimization problem arising is typically very difficult; in particular, the objective function is multiextremal even in simple cases. We also look at different methods of solving the SLRA problem. We show that some traditional methods do not even converge to a locally optimal matrix.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Structured Low Rank Approximation as an Optimization Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000298978500002"}
