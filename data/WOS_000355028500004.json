Careful evaluation in the earlier design stages must be performed before putting a PSS design solution into practice in order to guarantee the sustainability. Due to the reason that sustainability involves many factors and PSS is a complex system with long lifespan, the sustainability criteria will be of great quantity and various measurements. This paper aims to deal with two issues: (1) how to choose the sustainability criteria (2) and how to deal with uncertain factors when measuring these criteria. The zigzag mapping process is adopted to help decision makers to obtain criteria from the customer domain to function domain. The customer domain is modified to include the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability, To deal with uncertain factors, the Information Axiom is extended in the hybrid uncertain environments characterized by fuzziness and randomness co-existing. The design range is modeled as a fuzzy variable and the system range is modeled as a random variable. Thus the information content calculating involves integrals with fuzzy boundaries. A fuzzy simulation algorithm is constructed to calculate this kind of integrals. Two case studies are illustrated to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method could reflect the judgements of decision makers more precisely, and make use of evaluation information more comprehensively. The results also show that use-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the social aspect of sustainability, while product-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the economic aspect of sustainability.
