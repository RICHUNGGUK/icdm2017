Recently, it has been shown by an article that under some conditions the ratio of the number of arithmetic operations of a third-order method (the Halley class of methods) and Newton's method is constant (at most 5) per iteration. Automatic differentiation (AD) can compute fast and accurate derivatives such as the Jacobian, Hessian matrix and the tensor of the function. The Halley class of methods includes these high-order derivatives. In this paper, we apply AD efficiently to the methods and investigate the computational complexity of them. The results show that under general conditions even including the computation of the function and its derivative terms, the upper bound of the ratio can be reduced to 3.5.", "paper_title": "On the Halley class of methods for unconstrainedoptimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278706700007"}
