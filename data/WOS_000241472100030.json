The analysis of weighted majority voting under the viewpoint of coalition gaming, leads to the existence of analytical solutions to optimal weights for the classifiers based on their prior competencies. The general framework of weighted majority rules (WMR) is tested against common rank-based and simple majority models, as well as two soft-output averaging rules. Experimental results with combined support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on benchmark classification tasks have proven that WMR, employing the theoretically optimal solution for combination weights proposed in this work, outperformed all the other rank-based, simple majority and soft-output averaging methods. It also provides a very generic and theoretically well-defined framework for all hard-output (voting) combination schemes between any type of classifier architecture.", "paper_title": "A game-theoretic approach to weighted majority voting for combining SVM classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100030"}
