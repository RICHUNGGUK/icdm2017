The system. consists of micro lens array and an image sensor. As a micro lens army, we used GRIN lens array. It decreases a cross talk which lens-to-lens occurs on image sensor. Digital processing of the captured multiple images is used to extract the surface profile. Preliminary experiments were executed on evaluation system to verify the principles of the system and to clarify the issues related to its implementation.", "paper_title": "SMALL CAPTURING SYSTEM OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE USING COMPOUND OPTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264294800020"}
