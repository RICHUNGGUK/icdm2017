According to the traditional OT's security requirements, the privacy of the receiver is protected forever, which, however, limits the applications of OT in some areas. In this paper, we propose a new OT with timed-release receiver's privacy in which the sender has N messages, of which the receiver can choose to receive one or more, in such a way that (a) the receiver only learns about the requested messages, and (b) the sender learns the receiver's selections after a designated time. Thus the receiver's privacy is just protected within a period of time. Besides, we also present a concrete scheme combining Tzeng's OT scheme with Casassa Mont et al.'s timed-release encryption scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
