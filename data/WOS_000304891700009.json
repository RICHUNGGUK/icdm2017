For the first two containment relations, we prove dichotomy theorems. For the minor order, we show how to solve MAX-CUT in polynomial time for the class obtained by forbidding a graph with a single crossing (this generalizes a known result for K-5-minor-free graphs) and identify an open problem which is the missing case for a dichotomy theorem.
