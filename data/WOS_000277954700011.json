The objective is to find a schedule that maximizes the minimum agreement index subject to periodic maintenance, non-resumable jobs and fuzzy due-date. A random key genetic algorithm (RKGA) is proposed for the problem, in which a novel random key representation, a new decoding strategy incorporating maintenance operation and discrete crossover (DX) are used. RKGA is applied to some fuzzy scheduling problem with availability constraints and compared with other algorithms. Computational results show that RKGA performs better than other algorithms.
