This is possible by introducing a novel algorithm that controls in a stable and adaptive manner the number of communication channels in each source. Simulation studies performed on a heterogenous delay, long-distance high-speed network, illustrate all aspects of the developed methodology.", "paper_title": "Fairness Guarantees in a Neural Network Adaptive Congestion Control Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000263831800014"}
