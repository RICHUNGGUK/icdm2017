The method is based on the idea that by the absolute difference between a document image and its background it is possible to effectively emphasize the text and attenuate degraded regions. To generate the background of a document our work was inspired on the human visual system and on the perception of objects by distance. Snellen's visual acuity notation was used to define how far an image must be from an observer so that the details of the characters are not perceived anymore, remaining just the background. A scheme that combines k-means clustering algorithm and Otsu's thresholding method is also used to perform binarization. The proposed method has been tested on two different datasets of document images (DIBCO 2011 and a real historical document image dataset) with very satisfactory results.", "paper_title": "A new thresholding algorithm for document images based on the perception of objects by distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000330852600003"}
