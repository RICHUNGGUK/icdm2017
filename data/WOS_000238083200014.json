This work presents an algorithm for topic detection that considers the temporal evolution of news and the structure of web documents. Then, it uses the results of the topic detection algorithm for searching and navigating in an online news source. An experimental evaluation with a collection of online news in Spanish indicates the advantages of incorporating the temporal aspect and structure of documents in the topic detection of news. In addition, topic-based clusters are well suited for guiding the search and navigation of news.", "paper_title": "Clustering-based searching and navigation in an online news source", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200014"}
