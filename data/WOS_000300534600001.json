The ongoing debonding process is simulated. Interracial stress distribution for different load levels is analyzed. A parametric study, including bond strength and the homogeneity index on the pullout behaviors is carried out. The numerical results indicate that the bond stress decreases gradually from loaded end to embedded end along fiber-cement interface. The debonding initially starts from loaded end and propagates to embedded end as load increasing. The embedded length and bond strength affect the load-loaded end displacement curves significantly. The numerical results have a general agreement with the experimental investigation.", "paper_title": "Modeling of fiber pullout behaviors of stiff fiber reinforced cementitious composites", "paper_id": "WOS:000300534600001"}
