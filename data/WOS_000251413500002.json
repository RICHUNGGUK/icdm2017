The probability p is a variable which contains a randomly selected term for each individual driver and a density-dependent term which is the same for all drivers. When the rational probability p is obtained, the larger value of maximum flow which is close to the observed data can be reached compared with that obtained from the NaSch model. The fundamental diagram obtained by simulation shows the ability of this modified CA model to capture the essential features of traffic flow, e.g., the spontaneous formation of traffic jams and appearance of the metastable state. These indicate that the presented model is more reasonable and realistic.", "paper_title": "A new cellular automaton model for traffic flow with different probability for drivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000251413500002"}
