A polynomial expression is derived in GMPs in a natural way, whereas in SVMs a polynomial kernel is employed to derive a similar one. In any particular problem an evolutionary determined sample of monomials is required in GMP expressions while, on the other hand, there is a large number of monomials implicit in the SVM approach. We make some experiments to compare the modeling characterization and accuracy obtained from the application of both methods.", "paper_title": "Analysis of algebraic expressions derived from genetic multivariate polynomials and support vector machines: A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400101"}
