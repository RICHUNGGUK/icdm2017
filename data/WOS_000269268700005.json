It has been introduced in order to increase the intensionality, that is the number of captured algorithms, of a previous method, the quasi-interpretations. Basically, a sup-interpretation provides an upper bound on the size of function outputs. A criterion, which can be applied to terminating as well as nonterminating programs, is developed in order to bound the stack frame size polynomially. Since this work is related to quasi-interpretation, dependency pairs, and size-change principle methods, we compare these notions obtaining several results. The first result is that, given any program, we have heuristics for finding a sup-interpretation when we consider polynomials of bounded degree. Another result consists in the characterizations of the sets of functions computable in polynomial time and in polynomial space. A last result consists in applications of sup-interpretations to the dependency pair and the size-change principle methods.", "paper_title": "Sup-Interpretations, a Semantic Method for Static Analysis of Program Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000269268700005"}
