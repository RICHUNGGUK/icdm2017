This investigation was used to develop and validate an automated method to segment livers in CT images. The proposed framework consists of three steps: 1) preprocessing; 2) initialization; and 3) segmentation. In the first step, a statistical shape model is constructed based on the principal component analysis and the input image is smoothed using curvature anisotropic diffusion filtering. In the second step, the mean shape model is moved using thresholding and Euclidean distance transformation to obtain a coarse position in a test image, and then the initial mesh is locally and iteratively deformed to the coarse boundary, which is constrained to stay close to a subspace of shapes describing the anatomical variability. Finally, in order to accurately detect the liver surface, deformable graph cut was proposed, which effectively integrates the properties and interrelationship of the input images and initialized surface. The proposed method was evaluated on 50 CT scan images, which are publicly available in two databases Sliver07 and 3Dircadb. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was effective and accurate for detection of the liver surface.", "paper_title": "Automatic Liver Segmentation Based on Shape Constraints and Deformable Graph Cut in CT Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000362488900016"}
