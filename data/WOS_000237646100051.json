In addition, methods also exist to manage an IPv6 network, in order to improve the activation and efficiency of IPv6 usage. In this paper, a system is proposed, with a function to measure network performance and obtain automatic connection using tunneling, where even an amateur can connect to the IPv6 system, along with an index. High performance of IPv6 can be manually verified, in order to promote the supply of IPv6, increasing the efficiency of network management.", "paper_title": "Automatic configuration of IPv6 tunneling in a dual stack host", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100051"}
