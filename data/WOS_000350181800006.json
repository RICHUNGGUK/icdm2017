We utilize the notion of resource orchestration as a theoretical lens through which to investigate the nature of the e-commerce adoption process. The findings generate a process model that can be used to explain how resources are orchestrated in the successful adoption of e-commerce by manufacturers: the predominant competitive environment of each phase gives rise to a specific focal capability that is developed through resource-focused actions. This research benefits both academics and practitioners by contributing to cumulative theoretical developments and by offering practical insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
