Design/methodology/approach - One group of experts and one group of novices were recruited. These two groups were asked to provide tags for document bookmarks in a Mozilla Firefox browser. In the experimental analysis we defined two measures similarity and relevance to describe the differences between the two groups. Findings - Tags chosen by experts yielded better similarity and relevance values in all analyses. Tags chosen by the expert group had higher commonality in pairwise similarity analysis; moreover, the relevance analysis showed that tags chosen by experts reflected better understanding of the content. Originality/value - Tagging behavior has become highly popular on the web, and its study has commercial merit. Tags from experts represent the structure behind the knowledge involved; expert representation may be vastly more helpful than novice representation for promoting understanding of content in an era characterized by an explosion of information.", "paper_title": "Analysis of keyword-based tagging behaviors of experts and novices", "paper_id": "WOS:000291177000006"}
