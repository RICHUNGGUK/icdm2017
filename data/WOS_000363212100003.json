In this article we define the syntactic concept lattice and present its basic properties, and its relationship to the universal automaton and the syntactic congruence; we consider several different equivalent definitions, as Galois connections, as maximal factorizations and finally using universal algebra to define it as an object that has a certain universal (terminal) property in the category of complete idempotent semirings that recognize a given language, applying techniques from automata theory to the theory of context-free grammars (CFGs). We conclude that grammars that are minimal, in a certain weak sense, will always have non-terminals that correspond to elements of this lattice, and claim that the syntactic concept lattice provides a natural system of categories for representing the denotations of CFGs.", "paper_title": "The syntactic concept lattice: Another algebraic theory of the context-free languages?", "paper_id": "WOS:000363212100003"}
