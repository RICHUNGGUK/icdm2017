The need to protect privacy in time-series data while effectively supporting complex queries on them poses nontrivial challenges to the database community. We study the anonymization of time series while trying to support complex queries, such as range and pattern matching queries, on the published data. The conventional k-anonymity model cannot effectively address this problem as it may suffer severe pattern loss. We propose a novel anonymization model called (k, P)-anonymity for pattern-rich time series. This model publishes both the attribute values and the patterns of time series in separate data forms. We demonstrate that our model can prevent linkage attacks on the published data while effectively support a wide variety of queries on the anonymized data. We propose two algorithms to enforce (k, P)-anonymity on time-series data. Our anonymity model supports customized data publishing, which allows a certain part of the values but a different part of the pattern of the anonymized time series to be published simultaneously. We present estimation techniques to support query processing on such customized data. The proposed methods are evaluated in a comprehensive experimental study. Our results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "Supporting Pattern-Preserving Anonymization for Time-Series Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000315519500012"}
