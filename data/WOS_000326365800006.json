Recently, new classification methods based on analysis of statistical features of transport layer traffic have been proposed. While these new methods address the limitations of the port based and payload based traffic classification, the current software-based solutions are not fast enough to deal with the traffic of today's high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose an online statistical traffic classifier using the C4.5 machine learning algorithm running on the NetFPGA platform. Our NetFPGA classifier is constructed by adding three main modules to the NetFPGA reference switch design; a Netflow module, a feature extractor module, and a C4.5 search tree classifier. The proposed classifier is able to classify the input traffics at the maximum line speed of the NetFPGA platform, i.e. 8 Gbps without any packet loss. Our method is based on the statistical features of the first few packets of a flow. The flow is classified just a few micro seconds after receiving the desired number of packets.
