This study, therefore, attempted to explore whether learners' reflection levels can be improved if teaching strategies are adapted to fit with learners' thinking styles in an online learning environment. Three teaching strategies, namely constructive, guiding, and inductive, were designed to match with three thinking styles, namely legislative, executive, and judicial respectively. An online reflection learning system was subsequently developed to reflect this scenario. An experiment was then conducted where the learners were classified into fit or non-fit group in order to analyze whether there was a good fit between the teaching strategies designed by the teacher and the thinking styles of learners. A total of 223 graduate and undergraduate students participated in the experiment. The results revealed that the reflection levels of the fit group had outperformed the non-fit group.
