S., & Norton D. P. (1992). The balance scorecard - measures that drive performance. Harvard Business Review, 70(1), 71-79], balanced scorecard (BSC) provides an integrated view of overall organizational performance and strategic objectives. BSC integrates. financial measures with other key performance indicators to create a perspective that incorporates both. financial and non-financial aspects. BSC has proven a powerful tool for strategic planning and communicating strategy that assists in strategy implementation. Successful strategy implementation is based on effective strategic planning. Owing to the strategic planning being a virtual necessity in business, this work proposes an integrated approach for the balanced scorecard tool and knowledge-based system using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and then develops an intellectual BSC knowledge-based system for strategic planning that sets or selects. firm management or operational strategies based on the following perspectives: learning and growth, internal/business process, customer, and. financial performance. This system can help determine specific strategy weights. The intellectual BSC knowledge-based system facilities efficient automated strategic planning. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
