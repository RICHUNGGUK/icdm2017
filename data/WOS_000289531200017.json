Although two classes of antiviral drugs, M2 ion channel protein inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors, are expected to be important in controlling the early stages of a potential pandemic. Different strains of influenza viruses have differing degrees of resistance against the antivirals. In order to analyze the detailed information on the viral resistance, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the neuraminidase (NA) complex with oseltamivir. The carboxylate of Glu276 of H252Y NA faces toward the O-ethyl-propyl group of oesltamivir, Glu276 of wild-type NA adopts a conformation pointing away from the oesltamivir. tau 2 and tau 3 torsional angles fluctuation of the oesltamivir are relatively high for the H252Y mutant NA complex. In addition, there are fewer hydrogen bonds between the oesltamivir and H252Y mutation NA. The results show that H252Y mutation NA has high resistance against the drug.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulation of oseltamivir resistance in neuraminidase of avian influenza H5N1 virus", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531200017"}
