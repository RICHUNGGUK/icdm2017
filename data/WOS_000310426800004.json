The goal of the optimization procedure is to increase the flutter speed onset through the maximization of natural frequencies related to the vibration modes involved in the phenomenon. The aeroelastic stability analysis is performed using ZAERO software system, which includes ZONA 6 unsteady lifting surface method. The finite element method is applied to solve the structural model equilibrium equations, the eigenvalues sensitivities with respect to design variables are calculated analytically, and sequential linear programming is applied. The maximization is accomplished using two methods; the first method uses an aeroelastic analysis to determine which eigenmode causes the flutter onset, and its eigenvalue is then maximized. In the second method, a forward finite difference method is applied and the flutter speed sensitivities with respect to the eigenvalues are calculated. This sensitivity is used to guide the optimization process. Finally, a topology optimization problem is formulated to reduce the plate mass under a minimum flutter velocity constraint, using density distribution as the design variable.", "paper_title": "Aeroelastic tailoring using fiber orientation and topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310426800004"}
