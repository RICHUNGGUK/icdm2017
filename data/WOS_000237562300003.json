To address this problem, striping network traffic in parallel over multiple lower-data-rate but longer-transmission-range wireless channels may be used. In this paper, we propose a new striping method and evaluate its performances over multiple IEEE 802.11(b) channels under various conditions. Our extensive simulation results show that this method is quite effective for such an application.", "paper_title": "On striping traffic over multiple IEEE 802.11(b) wireless channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000237562300003"}
