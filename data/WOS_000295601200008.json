Its performance, however, still suffers from the \"small sample learning\" problem and \"kernel learning\" problem. Aiming to solve these problems, in this paper, we present a, new semi-supervised scheme of KBDA (S-KBDA), in which the projection learning and the \"kernel learning\" are interweaved into a constrained optimization framework. Specifically. S-KBDA learns a subspace that preserves both the biased discriminant structure among the labeled samples, and the geometric structure among all training samples. In kernel optimization, we directly optimize the kernel matrix, rather than a kernel function, which makes the kernel learning more flexible and appropriate for the retrieval task. To solve the constrained optimization problem, a fast algorithm based on gradient ascent is developed. The image retrieval experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the S-KBDA scheme in comparison with the original KBDA, and the other two state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Kernel Optimization Based Semi-Supervised KBDA Scheme for Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601200008"}
