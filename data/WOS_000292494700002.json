That term depends on some expressions of the coefficients defining the quasi-interpolant, and its minimization has been proposed. However, the resulting problem is rather complex and often requires some computational effort. Thus, for quasi-interpolants defined from a piecewise polynomial function, phi, we propose a simpler minimization problem, based on the Bernstein-Bezier representation of some related piecewise polynomial functions, leading to a new class of quasi-interpolants.
