Team size has always been considered to be a significant factor in corporation systems, but recently, more and more enterprises are aware of the fact that knowledge management is a crucial key to gain competitive advantage. This paper integrates knowledge management issues with a cooperation model, focusing on the quantitative relationship among productivity interest, knowledge management, working time allocation and team size. As a result, some useful insights have been concluded from model analysis to improve teamwork performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
