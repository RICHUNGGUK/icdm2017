The authors advocate composing future interconnects of some wires that minimize latency, some that maximize bandwidth, and some that minimize power. A microarchitecture aware of these wire characteristics can steer on-chip data transfers to the most appropriate wires, thus improving performance and saving energy.", "paper_title": "Leveraging wire properties at the microarchitecture level", "paper_id": "WOS:000243005400005"}
