A conjugated tree is a tree that has a perfect matching. Denote by Phi(n) the class of trees with n vertices which have perfect matchings, and by Omega(n,d) the subclass of Phi(n) whose vertex degrees do not exceed d + 1. Let Delta(T) denote maximum degree of T. Zhang and Li determined the minimal energy tree F(n) in Phi(n), and M(n) in Omega(n,2), respectively, where F(n) is a tree obtained by adding a pendent edge to each vertex of the star K(1,(n/2-1)) and M(n) by adding a pendent edge to each vertex of the path P(n/2). This paper is to solve the problem of determining minimal energy conjugated chemical trees, i. e., trees with perfect matchings whose vertex degrees do not exceed 4, or in the class Omega(n,3). In fact, we obtain the minimal energy trees in Omega(n,d) for any d >= 3, a more general result. For maximal energy conjugated trees with given maximum degree Delta, it is easy to determine their structures, and we also present them here.", "paper_title": "Conjugated Chemical Trees with Extremal Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000296211400015"}
