Generalized minimum aberration is an important criterion recently proposed for both regular and non-regular designs. This paper provides a formal optimization treatment on optimal designs with generalized minimum aberration. New lower bounds and optimality results are developed for resolution-III designs. Based on these results, an effective computer search algorithm is provided for sub-design selection, and new optimal designs are reported. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
