If the current workload V (t) of the queue plus the service time of an arriving customer exceeds 1, only 1-V (t) of the service requirement is accepted. We are interested in the distribution of the idle period, which can be interpreted as the deficit at ruin for a risk reserve process R (t) in the compound Poisson risk model. For this risk process a special dividend strategy applies, where the insurance company pays out all the income whenever R (t) reaches level 1. In the queueing context we further introduce a set-up time aa[0,1]. At the end of every idle period, an arriving customer has to wait for a time units until the server is ready to serve it.", "paper_title": "The idle period of the finite G/M/1 queue with an interpretation in risk theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000275446400005"}
