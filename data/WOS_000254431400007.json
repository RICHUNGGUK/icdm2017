An overview of the bulk acoustic wave filters technology enables to outcome the principal features of ladder filters. The lack of out-of-band rejection is currently an important weakness of this topology. The design technique presented enables to improve bulk acoustic wave ladder filters rejection by using their input/output bonding wires. Finally, the technique is used for design and fabrication of a bulk acoustic wave ladder filter for application in W-CDMA reception (2.11-2.17 GHz) front-ends. The filter measurement results show a significant improvement on the filter rejection at the transmission band (from -19 to 34 dB) and on the return loss (from -10 to -16 dB) without considerable modification of filter insertion loss and selectivity.", "paper_title": "Method for improving ladder bulk acoustic wave filters rejection", "paper_id": "WOS:000254431400007"}
