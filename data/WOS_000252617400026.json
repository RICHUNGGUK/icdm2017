Authentic post-issuance program modification is necessary for a multi-application smart card system because applications in the system are realized after the issuance of a smart card. In this paper, we propose a system where only authentic modification is possible. In the proposed system, the smart card issuer stores a unique long bitstring called PID in a smart card. The smart card is then given to the cardholder. A unique substring of the PID (subPID) is shared between the cardholder and a corresponding service vendor. Another subPID is shared between the issuer and the cardholder. During program modification, a protocol using the subPIDs, a one-way hash function and a pseudorandom number generator function verifies the identity of the parties and the authenticity of the program.", "paper_title": "A multi-application smart card system with authentic post-issuance program modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400026"}
