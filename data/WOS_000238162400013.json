We hence propose a generic camera model, which is suitable for fish- eye lens cameras as well as for conventional and wide- angle lens cameras, and a calibration method for estimating the parameters of the model. The achieved level of calibration accuracy is comparable to the previously reported state- of- the- art.", "paper_title": "A generic camera model and calibration method for conventional, wide-angle, and fish-eye lenses", "paper_id": "WOS:000238162400013"}
