The radio-ports of small cells are typically installed to utility posts, customer premises or in residential homes, since they offer a cost-efficient means of increasing the attainable network capacity. Diverse techniques of providing small-cell coverage may be invoked, but unless they use orthogonal resources, they potentially impose additional interference and thus degrade the achievable quality of service. In contrast to previous studies, we analyze the interference distribution (induced by small cells) and the coverage probability from a macrocell user's perspective in the presence of Rician fading. The small cell base station locations are modelled by a homogeneous spatial poisson point process. Our analysis relies on stochastic geometric tools and the results were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "Coverage analysis for macro users in two-tier Rician faded LTE/small-cell networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000014"}
