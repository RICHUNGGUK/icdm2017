In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate protective behaviors in response to tire ways a human may fall to the ground as Well as incorporate tire reactive motions into motion capture animation. It is based on simulated trajectory prediction and biomechanics inspired adjustment. According to the external perturbations, our system predicts a motion trajectory and uses it to select a desired transition-to sequence. At tire same time, physically generated falling motions will fill ill the gap between tire two-motion capture sequences before and after the transition. Utilizing a parallel simulation, our method is able to predict a character's motion trajectory real-time under dynamics, Which ensures that the character moves towards the target sequence and makes the character's behavior, more life-like. Our controller is designed to generate physically plausible motion-following all upcoming motion with adjustment from biomechanics rules, Which is key to avoid air unconscious look for a character during the transition. Based on a relatively small motion database, our system is effective in generating various interactive falling behaviors.
