Distribution rules are related to quantitative association rules but can be seen as a more fundamental concept, useful for learning distributions. We formalize the main concepts and indicate applications to tasks such as frequent pattern discovery, sub group discovery and forecasting. An efficient algorithm for the generation of distribution rules is described. We also provide interest measures, visualization techniques and evaluation.", "paper_title": "Distribution rules with numeric attributes of interest", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900021"}
