The character of SVM in extracting support vector provides a mechanism to extract fuzzy IF-THEN rules from the training data set. We construct the fuzzy inference system using fuzzy basis function. The gradient technique is used to tune the fuzzy rules and the inference system. Theoretical analysis and comparative tests are performed comparing with other fuzzy systems. Modeling is one of the key techniques in the automatic control of the arc welding process, and is still a very difficult problem. Comprehensibility is one of the required characteristics in modeling for the complex GTAW process. We use the proposed SVM-FRAS to obtain the rule-based model of the aluminum alloy pulse GTAW process. Experimental results show the SVM-FRAS model possesses good generalization capability as well as high comprehensibility. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
