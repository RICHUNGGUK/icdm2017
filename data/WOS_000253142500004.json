The approach uses a mechanism similar to the ART 1 network for storing a population of memory antibodies that will be responsible for the acquired knowledge of the algorithm. This characteristic allows the algorithm a self-organization of the antibodies in accordance with the complexity of the database.", "paper_title": "Artificial immune system with ART memory hibridization", "paper_id": "WOS:000253142500004"}
