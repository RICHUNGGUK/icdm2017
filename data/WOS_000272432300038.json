The paper proposes the DE/QDE algorithm for the discovery of classification rules DE/QDE combines the characteristics of the conventional DE algorithm and the QDE algorithm. Based on some strategies of DE and QDE. DE/QDE can directly cope with the continuous, nominal attributes without discretizing the continuous attributes in the preprocessing step. DE/QDE also has specific weight mutation for managing the weight value of the individual encoding. Then DE/QDE is compared with Ant-Miner and CN2 on six problems from the LICI repository datasets. The results indicate that DE/QDE is competitive with Ant-Miner and CN2 in term of the predictive accuracy.
