The fuzzy symbolic modeling approach is based on the eigenstructure analysis of the data similarity matrix to define the number of fuzzy rules in the model. Each fuzzy rule is associated with a symbol and is defined by a Gaussian membership function. The prototypes for the rules are computed by a clustering algorithm, and the model output parameters are computed as the solutions of a bounded quadratic optimization problem. In classification problems, the rules' parameters are interpreted as the rules' confidence. In regression problems, the rules' parameters are used to derive rules' confidences for classes that represent ranges of output variable values. The resulting model is evaluated based on a set of benchmark datasets for classification and regression problems. Nonparametric statistical tests were performed on the benchmark results, showing that the proposed approach produces compact fuzzy models with accuracy comparable to models produced by the standard modeling approaches. The resulting model is also exploited from the interpretability point of view, showing how the rule weights provide additional information to help in data and model understanding, such that it can be used as a decision support tool for the prediction of new data.
