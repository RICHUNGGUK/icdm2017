Then a method based on Symmetrical Uncertainty is proposed to measure the correlation between two flow metrics, and is extended to measure the correlation among multi-variables. Meanwhile, the simulation and polynomial fitting method are used to reveal the threshold value between different correlation degrees for SU method. The statistical analysis results on the common flow metrics using several traces show that Symmetrical Uncertainty can not only represent the correct aspects of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, but also make up for its shortcomings, thus achieve the purpose of measuring flow metric correlation quantitatively and accurately. On the other hand, reveal the actual relationship among fourteen common flow metrics.", "paper_title": "Measure Correlation Analysis of Network Flow Based On Symmetric Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000310978600009"}
