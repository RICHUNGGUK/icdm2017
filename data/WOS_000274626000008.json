This \"PESD-SVM\" method uses PESD signatures that encode molecular shapes and property distributions on protein and ligand surfaces as features to build SVM models that require no Subjective feature selection. A simple protocol was employed for tuning the SVM models during their development, and the results were compared to SFCscore, a regression-based method that was previously shown to perform better than 14 other scoring functions. Although the PESD-SVM method is based on only two surface property maps, the overall results were comparable. For most complexes with a dominant enthalpic contribution to binding (Delta HI-T Delta S > 3), a good correlation between true and predicted affinities was observed. Entropy and solvent were not considered in the present approach, and further improvement in accuracy Would require accounting for these components rigorously.", "paper_title": "Binding Affinity Prediction with Property-Encoded Shape Distribution Signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000274626000008"}
