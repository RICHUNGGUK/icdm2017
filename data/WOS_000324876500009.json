Under nanometer wiring rules, the required separation between two wire ends is dependent on their surrounding wires, and there is a limit on the minimum length of each wire segment. However, traditional shortest path algorithms are not properly designed for these rules. In the paper, we propose a maze routing algorithm, called MANA, capable of finding legal shortest paths under these rules. Experiments with seven industrial cases show that by handling these rules during maze routing, 94% of the violations are prevented on average, and the overall runtime of a commercial router is reduced by 71%. In addition, the total wire length is also reduced by 3% on average.", "paper_title": "MANA: A Shortest Path Maze Algorithm Under Separation and Minimum Length NAnometer Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000324876500009"}
