Virtual reality 360 interactive panorama presentation involves accurately reproduced spherical panorama images which can deliver pre-produced image information of the real-world location that allows user-controlled interactivity in virtual reality digital platforms with up to three hundred and sixty degrees of visibility. Spherical panorama image is also useful in various mixed and augmented reality applications. However, the photographic reproduction of spherical panorama image may tolerate various obstacles and issues that can cause visual abnormality. These can include parallax error, nadir angle difficulty, inconsistent white balance, insufficient dynamic range in multiple angle images, ghosting effect when working with high dynamic range imaging, high amount of multiple angle source images to manage correctly and overall lengthy acquisition time. Biased reproduction of spherical panorama would be inadequate to record and report authentic visual information. This case study investigation provides an overview of the occurrence of potential obstacles and issues with the intention of acquiring high-fidelity spherical panorama photographic reproduction.", "paper_title": "Virtual reality 360 interactive panorama reproduction obstacles and issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000355826700001"}
