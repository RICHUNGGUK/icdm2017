For every K-trivial degreee d, there exists a closed set of degree d and a continuous function of degree d. Every K-trivial closed set contains a K-trivial real. There exists a K-trivial Pi(0)(1) class with no computable elements. A closed set is K-trivial if and only if it is the set of zeroes of some K-trivial continuous function.
