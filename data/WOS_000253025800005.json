Kersten, e-Democracy and participatory decision processes: lessons from e-negotiation experiments, Journal Multi-criteria Decision Analysis 12 (2003) 127-143 [13]] is a new democratic system that focuses on the creation and social diffusion of the knowledge gained from the scientific resolution of highly complex problems associated with public decision making. In this scenario, e-voting is not limited to the choice of a given political party, but to the extraction of the relevant knowledge. Even though e-voting systems have been widely studied, some situations are still not covered by the conventional literature, and this makes it necessary to consider certain variations to the main schema. In this paper, we will present one such lacuna (associated with e-cognocracy), and will examine the changes required in conventional e-voting processes and their implications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
