A challenge in this operation is that it requires intensive manual work to collect data, interpret data, and create 3D models. Each of these components is time consuming. In this research, we propose a framework for fast geo-specific road modeling based on high-resolution aerial photos. This framework has been experimented on a real driving simulator.
