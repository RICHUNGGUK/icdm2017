Changes that occur have to be reflected in the data warehouse thanks to schema updating or versioning. However a data warehouse has also to evolve according to users' analysis needs. This evolution is rather driven by knowledge than by data. To take into account these changes, we propose a new Rule-based Data Warehouse (R-DW) model in which rules integrate users' knowledge to dynamically create dimension hierarchies. The R-DW model is composed of a fixed part which is a fact table related to its first level dimensions, and an evolving part which contains the rules. Our model allows analysis context evolution and increases interactions between users and the decision support system.", "paper_title": "A rule-based data warehouse model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454500029"}
