Metadata representation schemes are extremely important to facilitate (system) interoperability and to define ground truth annotations for surveillance research and benchmarks. Surveillance places specific requirements on these metadata representation schemes. This paper offers a clear and coherent terminology, and uses this to present these requirements and to evaluate them in three ways: their fitness in breadth for surveillance design patterns, their fitness in depth for a specific surveillance scenario, and their realism on the basis of existing schemes. It is also validated that no existing metadata representation scheme fulfils all requirements. Guidelines are offered to those who wish to select or create a metadata scheme for surveillance for security.", "paper_title": "Requirements for multimedia metadata schemes in surveillance applications for security", "paper_id": "WOS:000336807300027"}
