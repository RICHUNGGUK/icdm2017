We have developed an energy model which takes into account the realities of scaling, specifically for asynchronous systems. Studies of an energy efficient asynchronous pipeline show fabricated results of 17 Giga Operations per Joule in 0.6 m at subthreshold when fully pipelined, and simulations at a more modern 65 nm process show a further order of magnitude improvement on that.", "paper_title": "Scaling Energy Per Operation via an Asynchronous Pipeline", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000015"}
