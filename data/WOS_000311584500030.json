However, the concerns about biometrics regarding template security, privacy and revocability impede its further application to network-based scenarios. We propose a novel fingerprint minutiae-based scheme to achieve reliable mutual authentication over insecure channels. In the proposed scheme, a private template is generated which is completely random and independent of the minutiae, thus providing template protection, privacy preservation and revocability. A private matching scheme is embedded in an authentication protocol to ensure that both a server and a user can verify each other by matching the template against the query minutiae without revealing their respective inputs. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme under various attack scenarios. The experimental results on FVC2002-DB2 show that the scheme's verification accuracy is acceptable.", "paper_title": "PRIVACY-PRESERVING AUTHENTICATION USING FINGERPRINT", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500030"}
