Some basic dynamic properties including boundedness, global attractivity, stability, and complete convergence are analyzed rigorously. The main contributions in this paper are as follows: (1) The boundedness of the new model is verified and conditions for global attractivity are derived. (2) Conditions on asymptotically stable of equilibrium points are obtained. (3) Complete convergence for the new network is proved by constructing a novel energy function. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate our theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
