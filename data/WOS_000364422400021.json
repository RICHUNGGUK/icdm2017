This letter focuses on providing a new synchronization and transport system target decoder (T-STD) model of 3D video distribution based on heterogeneous transmission protocol in a hybrid network environment, where a broadcasting network and broadband (IP) network are combined. On the basis of the experimental results, the proposed technology has been proved to be successfully used as a core element for synchronization and T-STD model in a hybrid network-based 3D broadcasting. It has been also found out that it could be used as a base technique for various IP associated hybrid broadcasting services.", "paper_title": "A Synchronization and T-STD Model for 3D Video Distribution and Consumption over Hybrid Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422400021"}
