The geometrical methods leading to discretized equations for numerical computations involve many different concepts. Therefore they give rise to numerical schemes that vary in the accuracy, in the computational cost and in the implementation. In this paper a comparison is made between some alternative Lie-symmetry based methods illustrated on the example of the Burgers equation. The importance of the symmetry preservation is numerically highlighted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
