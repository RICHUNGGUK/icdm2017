We develop a sound and complete tableau algorithm for answering queries w.r.t. an knowledge base with an acyclic TBox. Defining tableau expansion rules in the presence of acyclic definitions by considering only the concept names on the left-hand side of TBox definitions or their negations, allows us to give a PSPACE implementation for . We then consider answering queries w.r.t. an knowledge base (with an acyclic TBox) in which the epistemic operators correspond to those of classical multi-modal logic S4 (m) . The expansion rules in the tableau algorithm I > (S4) are designed to syntactically incorporate the epistemic properties. Blocking is corporated into the tableau expansion rules to ensure termination. We also provide a PSPACE implementation for I > (S4). In light of the fact that the satisfiability problem for with general TBox and no epistemic properties (i.e., ) is NEXPTIME-complete, we conclude that both and offer computationally manageable and practically useful fragments of .", "paper_title": "PSPACE Tableau Algorithms for Acyclic Modalized", "paper_id": "WOS:000310431200002"}
