For our study, we use the NanosCompiler that supports nesting of OpenMP directives and provides clauses to control the grouping of threads, load balancing, and synchronization. We report the benchmark results, compare the timings with those of different hybrid parallelization paradigms (MPI+OpenMP and PLP) and discuss OpenMP implementation issues that affect the performance of multi-level parallel applications.
