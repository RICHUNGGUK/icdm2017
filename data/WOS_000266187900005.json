In this context, the present paper initially surveys the research that has been conducted concerning the exploitation of heart sound signals for automated and semi-automated detection of pathological heart conditions. Then it proposes an automated diagnosis system for the identification of heart valve diseases based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification of heart sounds. This system performs a highly difficult diagnostic task (even for experienced physicians), much more difficult than the basic diagnosis of the existence or not of a heart valve disease (i.e. the classification of a heart sound as 'healthy' or 'having a heart valve disease'): it identifies the particular heart valve disease. The system was applied in a representative global dataset of 198 heart sound signals, which come both from healthy medical cases and from cases suffering from the four most usual heart valve diseases: aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Initially the heart sounds were successfully categorized using a SVM classifier as normal or disease-related and then the corresponding murmurs in the unhealthy cases were classified as systolic or diastolic. For the heart sounds diagnosed as having systolic murmur we used a SVM classifier for performing a more detailed classification of them as having aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Similarly for the heart sounds diagnosed as having diastolic murmur we used a SVM classifier for classifying them as having aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis. Alternative classifiers have been applied to the same data for comparison (i.e. back-propagation neural networks, k-nearest-neighbour and naive Bayes classifiers), however their performance for the same diagnostic problems was lower than the SVM classifiers proposed in this work.
