We provide forward and backward reasoning algorithms which, respectively, support simulation and query answering. These algorithms are then explained through several examples based on Smart Homes applications.", "paper_title": "A LINGUISTIC TRUTH-VALUE TEMPORAL REASONING (LTR) SYSTEM AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE DESIGN OF AN INTELLIGENT ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572700013"}
