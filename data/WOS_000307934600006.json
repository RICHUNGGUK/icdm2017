Materials and methods A PCHMS called Healthy. me was developed and evaluated in a 2010 CONSORT-compliant two-group (6-month waitlist vs PCHMS) parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) (allocation ratio 1: 1). The PCHMS integrated an untethered personal health record with consumer care pathways, social forums, and messaging links with a health service provider. Results 742 university students and staff met inclusion criteria and were randomized to a 6-month waitlist (n = 372) or the PCHMS (n = 370). Amongst the 470 participants eligible for primary analysis, PCHMS users were 6.7% (95% CI: 1.46 to 12.30) more likely than the waitlist to receive an influenza vaccine (waitlist: 4.9% (12/246, 95% CI 2.8 to 8.3) vs PCHMS: 11.6% (26/224, 95% CI 8.0 to 16.5); chi(2) = 7.1, p = 0.008). PCHMS participants were also 11.6% (95% CI 3.6 to 19.5) more likely to visit the health service provider (waitlist: 17.9% (44/246, 95% CI 13.6 to 23.2) vs PCHMS: 29.5% (66/224, 95% CI: 23.9 to 35.7); chi(2) = 8.8, p = 0.003). A dose-response effect was detected, where greater use of the PCHMS was associated with higher rates of vaccination (p = 0.001) and health service provider visits (p = 0.003). Discussion PCHMS can significantly increase consumer participation in preventive health activities, such as influenza vaccination. Conclusions Integrating a PCHMS into routine health service delivery systems appears to be an effective mechanism for enhancing consumer engagement in preventive health measures.
