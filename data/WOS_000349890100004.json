Broadband channel is often characterized by the sparse multipath channel model, and significant taps are widely separated in time, and thereby, a large delay spread exists. Accurate channel state information is required for coherent detection. Traditionally, accurate channel estimation can be achieved by sampling the received signal with large delay spread by analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at Nyquist rate and then estimate all of channel taps. However, as the transmission bandwidth increases, the demands of the Nyquist sampling rate already exceed the capabilities of current ADC. In addition, the high-speed ADC is very expensive for ordinary wireless communication. In this paper, we present a novel receiver, which utilizes a sub-Nyquist ADC that samples at much lower rate than the Nyquist one. On the basis of the sampling scheme, we propose a compressive channel estimation method using Dantzig selector algorithm. By comparing with the traditional least square channel estimation, our proposed method not only achieves robust channel estimation but also reduces the cost because low-speed ADC is much cheaper than high-speed one. Computer simulations confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.
