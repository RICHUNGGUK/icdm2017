Our method first reconstructs an initial 3D model by selecting uniformly distributed key images using a view sphere. Then once a new image is added, we search its correlated reconstructed patches and incrementally update the result model by optimizing the geometric and photometric energy terms. The experimental results illustrate our method is effective for incremental 3D reconstruction and can be further applied for large-scale datasets or to real-time reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Incremental 3D reconstruction using Bayesian learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000326387300008"}
