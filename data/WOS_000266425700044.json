The proposed algorithm provides right of way (Row) and crash avoidance information by means of an intelligent WSN system. The system is composed of magnetic sensors, embedded in the center of a lane, with relay nodes and a base station placed on the side of the road. The experimental results show that the vehicle detection accuracy is over 99% and the sensor node battery life expectancy is over 3 years for traffic of 5,800 vehicles per day. For the traffic application we consider, a strong effect is observed as the projected conflict rate was reduced by 72% compared to an FWSC intersection operated with only driver perception.", "paper_title": "A Feasibility Study on Crash Avoidance at Four-Way Stop-Sign-Controlled Intersections Using Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700044"}
