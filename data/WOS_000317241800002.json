The method is an extension of the multiple viewpoint method for music prediction and generation. A multiple viewpoint system significantly outperforms all component viewpoints on the tasks of folk tune genre and region classification. The method is successfully applied to predict the genres of unlabelled Basque folk tunes.", "paper_title": "Multiple Viewpoint Systems for Music Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000317241800002"}
