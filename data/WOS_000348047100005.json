One of the key phenomena is the fast, near-exponential increase of data. Consequently, most of the traditional data classification methods fail to meet the dynamic and real-time demands of today's data processing and analyzing needs-especially for continuous data streams. This paper proposes an improved incremental learning algorithm for a large-scale data stream, which is based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) and is named DS-IILS. The DS-IILS takes the load condition of the entire system and the node performance into consideration to improve efficiency. The threshold of the distance to the optimal separating hyperplane is given in the DS-IILS algorithm. The samples of the history sample set and the incremental sample set that are within the scope of the threshold are all reserved. These reserved samples are treated as the training sample set. To design a more accurate classifier, the effects of the data volumes of the history sample set and the incremental sample set are handled by weighted processing. Finally, the algorithm is implemented in a cloud computing system and is applied to study user behaviors. The results of the experiment are provided and compared with other incremental learning algorithms. The results show that the DS-IILS can improve training efficiency and guarantee relatively high classification accuracy at the same time, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "SVM-Based Incremental Learning Algorithm for Large-Scale Data Stream in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047100005"}
