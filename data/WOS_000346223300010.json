Using the inclusion comparison possibility in the interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy context, an inclusion-based index of interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is proposed that considers positive and negative ideals. An inclusion-based consistency index and an inclusion-based inconsistency index to measure the concordance and discordance, respectively, between paired comparison judgments are suggested. An inclusion-based LINMAP model is constructed using a linear programming technique to determine the optimal criterion weights and obtain the corresponding comprehensive inclusion-based index for each alternative. Then, the priority order of the alternatives can be acquired according to the comprehensive inclusion-based indices. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated using a practical problem that relates to the selection of bridge construction methods. A comparative analysis of other relevant decision-making methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed methodology.", "paper_title": "The Inclusion-Based LINMAP Method for Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Within an Interval-Valued Atanassov's Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000346223300010"}
