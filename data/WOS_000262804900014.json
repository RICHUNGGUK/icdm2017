This leads to a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic system with coupled time-dependent boundary conditions. We propose a method-of-lines discretisation by using an upwinding scheme. We derive stability estimates for the linearisation with frozen coefficients. The resulting differential-algebraic equation has a perturbation index of 2 and a weak instability with respect to the space step size. The latter property is validated experimentally even for the nonlinear system. In contrast, the perturbation index did not exceed one in the numerical experiments. (C) 2008 IMACS.
