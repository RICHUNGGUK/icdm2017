The governing equation is a single-miniband Boltzmann-Poisson transport equation with a BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) collision term. Appropriate boundary conditions for the distribution function describe electron injection in the contact regions. These conditions seamlessly become Ohm's law at the injecting contact and the zero charge boundary condition at the receiving contact when integrated over the wave vector. The time-dependent model is numerically solved for the distribution function by using the deterministic Weighted Particle Method. Numerical simulations are used to ascertain the convergence of the method. The numerical results confirm the validity of the Chapman-Enskog perturbation method used previously to derive generalized drift-diffusion equations for high electric fields because they agree very well with numerical solutions thereof.
