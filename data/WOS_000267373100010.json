KAT is an equational system that has been successfully applied in program verification and, in particular, it subsumes the propositional Hoare logic (PHL). We also present an PHL encoding in KAT, by deriving its deduction rules as theorems of KAT. Some examples of simple program's formal correctness are given. This work is part of a study of the feasibility of using KAT in the automatic production of certificates in the context of (source-level) Proof-Carrying-Code (PCC).", "paper_title": "KAT and PHL in Coq", "paper_id": "WOS:000267373100010"}
