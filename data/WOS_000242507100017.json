A single-tapped complex FIR filter is used for filtering a chip code to suppress NBI. In this system, the spectrum of transmitted signal has a null at an arbitrary frequency. By choosing filter coefficients, we place this null at NBI center frequency to mitigate the effect of NBI. The performance of this scheme is theoretically analyzed and validated by simulation. We also compare the effectiveness against BPSK interference between the chip code filtering and received signal filtering. The results indicate the chip code filtering is effective against single-tone and BPSK interference, and gains better performance than the received signal filtering at certain level of SNR.", "paper_title": "Analysis on interference rejection of DS/SS systems using a complex FIR filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100017"}
