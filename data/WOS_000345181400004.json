However, mobility data is a high-dimensional dataset in which multi-context prediction is difficult in a single model. Mobility data can usually be expressed as a home event, a work event, a shopping event and a traveling event. Previous works have only been able to learn and predict one type of mobility event and then integrate them. As the tensor model has a strong ability to describe high-dimensional information, we propose an algorithm to predict human mobility in tensors of location context data. Using the tensor decomposition method, we extract human mobility patterns with multiple expressions and then synthesize the future mobility event based on mobility patterns. The experiment is based on real-world location data and the results show that the tensor decomposition method has the highest accuracy in terms of prediction error among the three methods. The results also prove the feasibility of our multicontext prediction model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
