Different ANFIS models are compared for representing the aging process in the best possible way. An artificial aging experiment is performed and vibration data taken from the initial (healthy) and final (faulty) cases are used to identify the aging process. Four different ANFIS models are presented. Moving average (MA) filters are applied to the input and output pairs for different lagging factors to change the smoothness degree of the data and thus the performance of system identification. The success of the models is evaluated on three conditions; the performance of the ANFIS and the linear correlation between expected output (faulty case data) and aging model output, in time and frequency domains.The study also evaluates the influence of preprocessing using MA filtering on the ANFIS performance for vibration data which have stochastic characteristics.", "paper_title": "Anfis model for vibration signals based on aging process in electric motors", "paper_id": "WOS:000351408300027"}
