The mixed time-delays are composed of discrete and distributed delays, both of which are mode-dependent. In addition, the distributed time-delays are characterized by the upper and lower bounds, both of which are mode-dependent. By constructing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, a unified framework is established to derive sufficient conditions for the concerned systems to be globally exponentially stable in mean square. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the main results obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
