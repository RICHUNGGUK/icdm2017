Our analysis clearly shows the differences between the system throughputs of both multiple access methods. The obtained results show that the hybrid slotted CSMA/CA-TDMA can achieve a considerably higher system throughput compared to the slotted CSMA/CA; the difference between the two access methods is especially pronounced as the increase in the number of devices contending for the network increase. The system throughput comparisons have established why the hybrid slotted CSMA/CA-TDMA is preferred over the slotted CSMA/CA for high-speed wireless communications of the 802.15.3c WPAN.", "paper_title": "Throughput Comparison of Hybrid Slotted CSMA/CA-TDMA and Slotted CSMA/CA in IEEE 802.15.3c WPAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100017"}
