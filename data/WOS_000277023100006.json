Correlation among different camera views calls for distributed source coding for efficient multiview image compression. The fact that cameras are placed within a short range of each other results in a high level of interference, multipath fading, and noise effects during communications. We develop a novel two-camera system, that employs multiterminal source coding and complete complementary data spreading, so that while the former technique exploits the statistical correlation between camera views, and performs joint compression to reduce transmission rates, the spreading technique will protect transmitted data by mitigating the effects of wireless fading channels. Our results indicate that the proposed system is competitive when compared to two independently JPEG encoded streams at low to medium transmission rates.", "paper_title": "Multiterminal source coding for multiview images under wireless fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000277023100006"}
