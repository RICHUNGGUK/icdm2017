Both cases of systems with and without time delays in Markov switching topologies are considered. With the introduced control protocols, necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square consensus of second-order multi-agent systems are derived. Under the given control protocols in Markov switching topologies, the second-order multi-agent systems can reach mean square consensus if and only if each union of the graphs corresponding to all the nodes in closed sets has a spanning tree. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square consensus under Markov switching topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000311084900014"}
