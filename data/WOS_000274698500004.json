This paper studies asymmetric power assignments for which the induced communication graph is k-strongly connected, while minimizing the total energy assigned and maximizing the network lifetime. We show that our power assignment algorithm from [9] achieves a bicriteria approximation ratio of (O(k), O(k log (k)root n phi(n))) with high probability, where phi(n) is any function with lim(n ->infinity)phi(n) = infinity, for the minimal total cost/maximal network lifetime problem in the plane, respectively, in the case of arbitrary battery charges. The same algorithm provides an (O(k), O(1))-approximation in the case of uniform batteries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a bicriteria approximation ratio for the total power assignment cost and the network lifetime under the k-fault resilience criterion. In addition, we study the special cases where the nodes are located on a torus or along a line. In the linear case with uniform batteries, we show that our algorithm from [33] obtains an (O(1), 1)-approximation. For the toral case, we suggest an assignment which is simultaneously the optimum in terms of each of the criteria.", "paper_title": "Energy and Lifetime Efficient Connectivity in Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274698500004"}
