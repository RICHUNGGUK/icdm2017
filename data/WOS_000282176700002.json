The certificate can then be verified in deterministic (log a)(1+o(1)) time. The certificate constitutes for each possible prime exponent p a prime number q(p), such that a mod q(p) is a p(th) non-residue. We use an effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem to estimate the density of such prime numbers q(p).", "paper_title": "Efficiently Certifying Non-Integer Powers", "paper_id": "WOS:000282176700002"}
