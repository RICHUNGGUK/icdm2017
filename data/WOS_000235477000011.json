It is assumed that an execution of any task can be preempted and the number of processors allocated to the same task can change during its execution. We present a rectangle packing algorithm, which converts an optimal solution for the relaxed problem, in which the number of processors allocated to a task is not required to be integer, into an optimal solution for the original problem in O(n) time.", "paper_title": "Preemptable malleable task scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000235477000011"}
