In order to fulfill the real-time designing and manufacturing infoiniation interaction among the collaborative partners in an industrial cluster area, we designed an industrial-cluster-oriented CMSS and provide services for these small and medium manufacturing enterprises by means of mobile cloud system and relative technologies. The framework of CMSS is defined, and a series of corresponding enabling technologies, including virtualization of manufacturing resources, using ways of virtualized manufacturing resources, lifecycle management of manufacturing service, and compounded access control model of CMSS, are developed. At end, a lightweight application of CMSS, which can provide optimization, simulation and analysis services, is built. Our work can help to satisfy the common designing demands of industrial-cluster area partly. Also, we have performed an effective attempt of engineering applications of mobile cloud system.", "paper_title": "Cloud Manufacturing Service System for Industrial-Cluster-Oriented Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000336885500006"}
