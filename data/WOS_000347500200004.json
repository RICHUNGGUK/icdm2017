A comprehensive knowledge base is automatically constructed with the aid of Wikipedia, which has been modelled as an associative network of concepts. Semantic marker gets a short answer, extracts the most important concepts, and initiates a spreading activation algorithm to measure the degree of relatedness between the student's answer and the corresponding ideal answer. The proposed approach significantly and consistently outperforms previous unsupervised methods for short answer grading.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Short Answer Grading Using Spreading Activation over an Associative Network of Concepts", "paper_id": "WOS:000347500200004"}
