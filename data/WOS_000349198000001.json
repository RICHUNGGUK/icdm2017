Verbeek, 1983 [8]), and that this size is necessary in the worst case (R. Alur and P. Madhusudan, 2009 [4]). This paper demonstrates that the same worst-case 2(Theta(n2)) size blow-up occurs when converting a nondeterministic IDPDA to an unambiguous one, and an unambiguous IDPDA to a deterministic one. In addition, the methods developed in this paper are used to demonstrate that the descriptional complexity of complementation for nondeterministic IDPDAs is 2(Theta(n2)), and that the descriptional complexity of homomorphisms for deterministic IDPDAs is 2(Theta(n2)).
