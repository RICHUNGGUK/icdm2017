A new continuous-time MILP formulation with general precedence variables is proposed to simultaneously handle decisions related to timing, product sequencing, heat exchanger matches (selected from a two-stage superstructure) and their heat loads. It features a complex set of timing constraints to synchronize heating and cooling tasks, derived from Generalized Disjunctive Programming. Through the solution of an industrial case study from a vegetable oil refinery, we show that major savings in utilities can be achieved while generating the set of Pareto optimal solutions through the 6-constraint method.
