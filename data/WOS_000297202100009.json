Awareness of the significance of information security is evidenced by a rapid increase in information security investments. Despite the fact that information security has taken on a new level of importance, academic research on this subject is still in its infancy. A review of literature indicated that past studies largely took a resource based view, suggesting that organizations invest and develop a variety of IS resources so as to ease potential threats caused by information security breaches. However, the resource-based perspective as used in previous studies was somewhat limited. Based on and extending from previous work, this study employed the resource-based view as a theoretical lens to examine the role that IS resources play in determining the level of information security. A field study was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results of the model testing show that IT human, relational, and infrastructure resources have significant impacts on information security.", "paper_title": "Information systems resources and information security", "paper_id": "WOS:000297202100009"}
