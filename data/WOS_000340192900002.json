The motion of the helicopter is required to synchronise with that of an oscillating platform, e. g. the deck of a vessel subject to wave-induced motions. A robust linear time-invariant output feedback controller consisting of a nominal controller and a robust compensator is designed. The robust compensator is introduced to restrain the influences of parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities and external disturbances. It is shown that robust stability and robust tracking property can be achieved simultaneously. Experimental results on the laboratory helicopter for automatic landing demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed control approach.", "paper_title": "Robust output tracking control of a laboratory helicopter for automatic landing", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900002"}
