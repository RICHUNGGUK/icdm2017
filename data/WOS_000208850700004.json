This construction is based on coding theory, more precisely we use concatenation to construct Boolean functions from codes over F-q containing a first-order generalized Reed-Muller code. As it turns out this construction has a very compact description in terms of Boolean functions, which is of independent interest. The construction allows one to design functions with better nonlinearities than known before.", "paper_title": "A new construction of highly nonlinear S-boxes", "paper_id": "WOS:000208850700004"}
