In this article, focusing on the median of three problem, we prove more important properties about adequate subgraphs with rank 3 and discuss the algorithms inventorying simple adequate subgraphs. After finding simple adequate subgraphs of small sizes, we incorporate them into ASMedian, an algorithm to solve the median of three problem. Results on simulated data show dramatic speedup so that many instances can be solved very quickly, even ones containing hundreds or thousands of genes.", "paper_title": "A Fast and Exact Algorithm for the Median of Three Problem: A Graph Decomposition Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000270687800006"}
