Based on the classical minimum hop algorithm, we develop a Maximizing Energy Utilization Routing Protocol (MEURP), which exploits local flooding mechanism to contact with multiple neighboring nodes. In contrast with the traditional flat-based algorithm, our MEURP solution enjoys a back-off waiting scheme to alleviate the flooding overhead in the course of gradient setup phase. For ease of implementation, we also introduce an IEEE 802.11 liked mechanism to cope with the channel contention, as well as the packet transmission errors. Together with employing a concise cost table associated with each intermediate node, MEURP makes use of a multiple routing selection mechanism to forward packets. In face of the frequent alteration of network topology, a compact gradient reconfiguration mechanism is aim brought in. Simulation experiments demonstrate that MEURP significantly outperform traditional flat-based and energy aware algorithms in terms of network lifetime and data packet throughput, respectively.
