Two main contributions are presented. First, we develop an optimal resource-management policy that allows a joint scheduling of the source rate, transmit energy and playout rate. Salient features of the proposed scheduling policy are that: (i) it is self-adaptive; and, (ii) it is able to provide hard (i.e., deterministic) QoS guarantees, in terms of hard limited playout delay, playout rate-jitter and pre-roll delay. Second, by referring to power and bandwidth limited access scenarios, we develop a traffic analysis of the underlying IP-over-wireless pipes that allows us to analyze the effects of both fading-induced errors and congestion-induced packet's losses on the end-to-end performance of the proposed scheduler.
