In the present paper, we describe the design concept of iPat/OMP, the parallelization sequence achieved by the tool and its current implementation status. In addition, we present an evaluation of the performance of the implemented functionalities. The experimental results show that iPat/OMP can detect parallelism and create an appropriate OpenMP directive for several for-loops.", "paper_title": "Development and implementation of an interactive parallelization assistance tool for OpenMP: iPat/OMP", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800003"}
