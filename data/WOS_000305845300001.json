The continuous 3D surfaces obtained due to reconstruction algorithms for a 3D face is considered to obtain a numerical estimate. The surface based measures namely the volume of difference, average edge distance and intercept edge distance metrics are proposed. These measures are computed by considering continuous 3D surfaces to ascertain the quality of the reconstruction techniques. Experimental validation of the proposed approach is performed using the data acquired by 2D cameras and 3D scanning technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
