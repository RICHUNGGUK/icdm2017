We are interested in a shape decomposition problem where the simple primitives sought are generalized cylinders, which are ubiquitous in both organic forms and man-made artifacts. We introduce a quantitative measure of cylindricity for a shape part and develop a cylindricity-driven optimization algorithm, with a global objective function, for generalized cylinder decomposition. As a measure of geometric simplicity and following the minimum description length principle, cylindricity is defined as the cost of representing a cylinder through skeletal and cross-section profile curves. Our decomposition algorithm progressively builds local to non-local cylinders, which form over-complete covers of the input shape. The over-completeness of the cylinder covers ensures a conservative buildup of the cylindrical parts, leaving the final decision on decomposition to global optimization. We solve the global optimization by finding an exact cover, which optimizes the global objective function. We demonstrate results of our optimal decomposition algorithm on numerous examples and compare with other alternatives.", "paper_title": "Generalized Cylinder Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200008"}
