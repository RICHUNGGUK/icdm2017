Recent techniques are not robust to occlusion as they mainly rely on the information provided by the keyframes, which are 2D drawings lacking 3D information. Our approach creates a hybrid face model to learn the prior knowledge about the approximate 3D geometry and multi-view appearances of an individual character's face from master frames to overcome the lack of information. Based on the hybrid model, we combine our example-based stroke annotating method with our example-based viewpoint recognition method to automatically specify accurate stroke correspondences, even when there is occlusion. Our approach facilitates auto-inbetweening much.", "paper_title": "Correspondence specification learned from master frames for automatic inbetweening", "paper_id": "WOS:000357130400020"}
