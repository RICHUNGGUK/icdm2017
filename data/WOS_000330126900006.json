FlexRay is a new standard for data/signal communication among electronic devices installed in a vehicle. The FRT includes two major parts in the physical layer design: the data transmission part, i.e., Bus Driver (BD), which is used to generate and recognize the electrical characteristics on the bus; the control part, including Bus Driver Controller and Bus Guardian (BG), which is in charge of data path, security, safety, and supervising Communication Controller (CC) in FlexRay communication systems. The proposed FRT with BG design in this work is implemented using a typical 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The total core area is 0.88 x 0.84 mm(2) and the power consumption is 53.04 mW at a 80 MHz system clock by physical on-silicon measurement.", "paper_title": "A FlexRay Transceiver Design with Bus Guardian for In-car Networking Systems Compliant with FlexRay Standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000330126900006"}
