Firstly, the image is divided into blocks, and the motion state of each image block is detected according to real-time motion detection method. So limited gray scale method to improve DFC can only be used in moving image blocks. Then, ordered dither and random dither combined with minor pixel separation (MPS) are used to improve gray scale loss caused by inverse gamma conversion and limited gray scale method, respectively. The experimental results show that motion detection can be implemented easily and the detection accuracy is more than 99.3%. The gray scales in moving and static image regions are all expressed smoothly while DFC is markedly improved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
