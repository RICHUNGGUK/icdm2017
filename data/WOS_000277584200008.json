This is an abstraction of certain geometric problems in shape and image matching and is also a natural variation and extension of the fundamental problems of graph isomorphism and bandwidth. Our focus is on algorithms that find an optimal (or near-optimal) bijection when the distortion is fairly small. We present a polynomial time algorithm that finds an optimal bijection between two line metrics, provided the distortion is less than 5 + 2 root 6 approximate to 9.9. We also give a parameterized polynomial time algorithm that finds an optimal bijection between an arbitrary unweighted graph metric and a bounded-degree tree metric.", "paper_title": "LOW DISTORTION MAPS BETWEEN POINT SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584200008"}
