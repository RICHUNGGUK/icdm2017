Recently, while many researchers have adopted generative probabilistic models for topic detection and tracking, few have compared generative probabilistic models with traditional cocitation and co-word methods in terms of their overall performance. In this article, we compare the performance of hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), a promising generative probabilistic model, with that of the 2 traditional topic detecting and tracking methodscocitation analysis and co-word analysis. We visualize and explore the relationships between topics identified by the 3 methods in hierarchical edge bundling graphs and time flow graphs. Our result shows that HDP is more sensitive and reliable than the other 2 methods in both detecting and tracking emerging topics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the important topics and topic evolution trends in the literature of terrorism research with the HDP method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Topic Detection and Tracking: A Comparison of HDP, C-Word, and Cocitation Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000342346500009"}
