Each pickup customer provides one unit volume of the product while each delivery customer requires one unit volume of the product. For the path case, we propose an 0(n(2)/min (k,n)) algorithm for any arbitrary k, and two O(n) algorithms for k=1 and k=infinity. For the tree case, O(n(2)) and O(n) algorithms are proposed for k=1 and k=infinity, respectively. Moreover, when k is arbitrary, the problem becomes NP-hard in the strong sense.
