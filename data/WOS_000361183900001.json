These chord spaces are formalized as simplicial complexes. A musical composition is represented in such a space by a trajectory. Spatial transformations are applied on these trajectories and induce a transformation of the original composition. These concepts are implemented in two applications, the software HexaChord and the Max object bach. tonnetz, dedicated to music analysis and composition, respectively.", "paper_title": "Representation of Musical Structures and Processes in Simplicial Chord Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000361183900001"}
