Our main result establishes the fact that the second-order modes are invariant under any of these typical frequency transformations. This means that any transformed system that is generated from a prototype system has the same second-order modes as those of the prototype system. We achieve the derivation of this result by describing the state-space equations and the controllability/observability Gramians of transformed systems.", "paper_title": "Invariance of second-order modes of linear continuous-time systems under typical frequency transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400027"}
