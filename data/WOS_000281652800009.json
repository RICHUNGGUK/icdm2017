First, a new concept of H output feedback stabilisation for general linear discrete-time systems with impulses is introduced. Then sufficient linear matrix inequality conditions for the stabilisation and H performance of general discrete systems with impulses are proposed. In addition, the result is applied to resolve typical output feedback control problems for systems with impulses, such as the decentralised H output feedback control and the simultaneous H output feedback control. Finally, a numerical simulation is also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "H output feedback stabilisation of linear discrete-time systems with impulses", "paper_id": "WOS:000281652800009"}
