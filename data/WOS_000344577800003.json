It describes the method of dividing the series of compressive strength results into batches of statistically stable strength parameters at specific time intervals, based on the standardized concept of \"concrete family\". The article presents the examples of calculations made for two series of concrete strength results, from which sets of decreased strength parameters were separated. When assessing the quality of concrete elements and concrete road surfaces, the principal issue is the control of the compressive strength parameters of concrete. Large quantities of concrete mix manufactured in a continuous way should be subject to continuous control. Standardized approach to assessing the concrete strength proves to be insufficient because it does not allow for the detection of subsets of the decreased strength results, which in turn makes it impossible to make adjustments to the concrete manufacturing process and to identify particular product or area on site with decreased concrete strength. In this article two independent methods of grouping the test results of concrete with statistically stable strength parameters were proposed, involving verification of statistical hypothesis based on statistical tests: Student's t-test and Mann - Whitney - U test.", "paper_title": "Statistical division of compressive strength results on the aspect of concrete family concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577800003"}
