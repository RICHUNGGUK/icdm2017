Ten healthy elderly persons were involved in a laboratory study and tested in a protocol comprising various types of activities of daily living and slip-induced backward falls. Inertial measurement units attached to the trunk and thigh segments were used to measure trunk angular kinematics and thigh accelerations. The effect of individual calibration was evaluated with previously developed fall detection algorithm. The results indicated that with individual calibration, the fall detection performance achieved approximately the same level of sensitivity (100% vs. 100%) and specificity (95.25% vs. 95.65%); however, response time was significantly lower than without (249ms vs. 255ms). It was concluded that the automatic individual calibration using the IAM framework improves the performance of fall detection, which has a greater implication in preventing/minimising injuries associated with fall accidents.", "paper_title": "Automatic individual calibration in fall detection an integrative ambulatory measurement framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000319107700005"}
