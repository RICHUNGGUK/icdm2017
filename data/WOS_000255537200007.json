As prevailing in other research, this network is presumed static in QTC(N). Actually, in many cases, networks are dynamic entities. For example in a road network, the opening of a bridge can temporarily close the connection between two junctions; traffic jams and traffic lights increase the time needed to travel from A to B. Therefore, it is interesting to examine what happens with qualitative relations between two continuously moving point objects if there are changes in the network. In this paper, we introduce QTC(DN'), being the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus on Changing Networks able to handle topological network changes. Potential applications of the calculus in transportation are highlighted, clearly illustrating the usefulness of the calculus. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
