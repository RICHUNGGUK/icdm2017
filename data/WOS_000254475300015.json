As an example, we work out the case where each expert is represented by a path in a directed graph and the loss of each expert is the sum of the weights over the edges in the path. These results are then used to construct universal limited-delay schemes for lossy coding of individual sequences. In particular, we consider the problem of tracking the best scalar quantizer that is adaptively matched to the source sequence with piecewlse different behavior. A randomized algorithm is presented which can perform, on any source sequence, asymptotically as well as the best scalar quantization algorithm that is matched to the sequence and is allowed to change the employed quantizer for a given number of times. The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the sequence length, but at the price of some deterioration in performance, the complexity can be made linear. Analogous results are obtained for sequential multiresolution and multiple description scalar quantization of individual sequences.", "paper_title": "Tracking the best quantizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300015"}
