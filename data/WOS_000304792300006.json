Our study used concepts from resource dependence and contingency theories to examine the mediating effects of knowledge and technology integration mechanisms (KIMs and TIMs) on interfirm codevelopment competency and e-service innovation, as well as investigating the moderating effect of them on partner match. A field survey was conducted in IT departments of financial and information service firms; we found that companies in these industries emphasized interfirm codevelopment competency in developing e-service innovation but used different types of mechanisms to enhance e-service innovation, which can be viewed as a practice of embodying partner match in interfirm codevelopment competency. We concluded that IT managers should mobilize interfirm codevelopment competency in conjunction with KIM and TIM to achieve e-service innovation. Furthermore, selecting compatibility of partners is crucial in enhancing e-service innovation. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings and conclude with comments on limitations in our study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
