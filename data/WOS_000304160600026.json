Its manufacture involves multi-axis free form machining, a time consuming and error-prone process. Tool path planning is considered a critical issue in the process but still lacking of systematic solutions. This paper proposes a tool path planning framework for 5-axis machining of centrifugal impeller with split blades. It provides several CAM functions that assist the users to generate collision-free cutter motions with smooth tool orientations. First, the machining process is divided into four operations and the planning tasks of each operation are standardized. Second, the hub surfaces are properly decomposed, re-grouped, and re-parameterized to facilitate calculation of quality tool path with reduced cutter retraction and plunging. Finally, geometric algorithms are developed to automatically detect tool collisions and then correct the erroneous tool orientations. An optimization scheme is applied to minimize the total amount of tool posture changes after the correction. An impeller is machined with the NC codes generated from the framework. The result shows the effectiveness of this work in automating the tool path planning in 5-axis machining of highly intricate impeller.", "paper_title": "An integrated framework of tool path planning in 5-axis machining of centrifugal impeller with split blades", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600026"}
