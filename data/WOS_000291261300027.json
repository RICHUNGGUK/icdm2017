The services are based on two proteochemometric models which accepts a protease or reverse transcriptase sequence in amino acid form, and outputs the predicted drug susceptibility values. The predictions are based on a comprehensive analysis where all the relevant inhibitors are included, resulting in models with excellent predictive capabilities. Availability and Implementation: The services are implemented as interoperable Web services (REST and XMPP), with supporting web pages to allow for individual analyses. A set of plugins were also developed which make the services available from the Bioclipse workbench for life science. Services are available at http://www.hivdrc.org/services.", "paper_title": "Services for prediction of drug susceptibility for HIV proteases and reverse transcriptases at the HIV drug research centre", "paper_id": "WOS:000291261300027"}
