The methodology involves an extraction of texture features using the wavelet packet frame decomposition. This is followed by a Gaussian-mixture-based classifier which assigns each pixel to the class. Each subnet of the classifier is modeled by a Gaussian mixture model and each texture image is assigned to the class to which pixels of the image most belong. This scheme shows high recognition accuracy in the classification of Brodatz texture images. It can also be expanded to an unsupervised texture segmentation using a Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Gaussian mixtures. The proposed method was successfully applied to Brodatz mosaic image segmentation and fabric defect detection. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
