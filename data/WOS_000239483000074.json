The local spatial continuity constraint reduces the noise effect and the classification ambiguity. More importantly, the strength of spatial constraint for each given image pixel is auto-selected by the scaled variance of its neighbor pixels, which results in the adaptiveness of the presented algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of the presented method for image segmentation are supported by experimental results on synthetic and MR images.", "paper_title": "Image segmentation by deterministic annealing algorithm with adaptive spatial constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000074"}
