The model allows non-ideal links to be involved in scheduling, under the premise of not affecting the quality of existing transmission links. In addition, we design two greedy algorithms to schedule more links with SINR values located in the transition region. The results show that a gray physical interference model is more accurate than a threshold physical interference one, the concurrent transmission capability of a network based on the gray physical interference model is significantly increased, and network throughput is increased by 20%.", "paper_title": "Gray physical interference model based link scheduling algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300010"}
