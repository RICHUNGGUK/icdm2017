We first adaptively decompose the input image into overlapped patches according to the shadow distribution. Then, by building the correspondence between the shadow patch and the lit patch based on texture similarity, we construct an optimized illumination recovering operator, which effectively removes the shadows and recovers the texture detail under the shadow patches. Based on coherent optimization processing among the neighboring patches, we finally produce high-quality shadow-free results with consistent illumination. Our shadow removal system is simple and effective, and can process shadow images with rich texture types and nonuniform shadows. The illumination of shadow-free results is consistent with that of surrounding environment. We further present several shadow editing applications to illustrate the versatility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Shadow Remover: Image Shadow Removal Based on Illumination Recovering Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000360814100012"}
