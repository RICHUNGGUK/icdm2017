In this paper, we address the case of multicomponent problems. We first provide closed form expressions for several important multicomponent proximity operators and then derive extensions of existing proximal algorithms to the multicomponent setting. These results are applied to stereoscopic image recovery, multispectral image denoising, and image decomposition into texture and geometry components.", "paper_title": "Proximal Algorithms for Multicomponent Image Recovery Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293328100002"}
