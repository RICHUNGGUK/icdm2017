In this paper, we propose a novel KPCA-based feature extraction method that assumes that an eigenvector can be expressed approximately as a linear combination of a subset of the training sample set (\"nodes\"). The new method selects maximally dissimilar samples as nodes. This allows the eigenvector to contain the maximum amount of information of the training sample set. By using the distance metric of training samples in the feature space to evaluate their dissimilarity, we devised a very simple and quite efficient algorithm to identify the nodes and to produce the sparse KPCA. The experimental result shows that the proposed method also obtains a high classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "EVALUATE DISSIMILARITY OF SAMPLES IN FEATURE SPACE FOR IMPROVING KPCA", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857200005"}
