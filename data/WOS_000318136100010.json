In our model, the supplier and the retailer employ order-up-to policy to replenish their inventory. In order to evaluate the value of information sharing in a two echelon seasonal supply chain, three levels of information sharing proposed by Yu, Yan, and Cheng (2002) are used. The results for optimal inventory policies under these three levels of information sharing are derived. We show that the seasonal effect has an important impact on optimal inventory policies of the supplier under the three levels of information sharing. Our findings also demonstrate that the replenishment of lead time must be less than the seasonal period in order to benefit from information sharing. Thus, this result provides managers with managerial insights to improve supply chain performance through information sharing integration partnerships. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
