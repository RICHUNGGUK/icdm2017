For a single data unit, we prove that the problem is NP-hard and provide efficient branch and bound algorithms that are much faster than the previously best solution based on dynamic programming. For a group of interdependent data units, we show how to compute optimal solutions with branch and bound algorithms. The branch and bound algorithms for a group of data units are much slower than the current state of the art, a heuristic technique known as sensitivity adaptation. However, in many real-world situations, they provide a significantly better rate-distortion performance.", "paper_title": "Branch and bound algorithms for rate-distortion optimized media streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000234850000016"}
