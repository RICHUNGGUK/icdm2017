In order to obtain a more accurate model of the femoral head prosthesis for the target sufferer, an improved individualized modeling system was presented in this paper. It was different from our previous system based on the sphere fitting method. This new system could reconstruct a more accurate ellipsoid model of the femoral head for the target sufferer. It could recover the necrotic femoral heads into the satisfactory models. These models could well match with the acetabulums. This improved system afforded a theoretical model for the accurate surgical position fixing in the orthopaedic clinic. And this system also provided an innovative practical means for the individualized modeling and manufacture of the artificial femoral head prosthesis.", "paper_title": "An improved system for 3D individualized modeling of the artificial femoral head", "paper_id": "WOS:000326929200003"}
