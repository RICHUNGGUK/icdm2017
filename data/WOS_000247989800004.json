We investigate how a robot achieves adaptive walking during such turning by focusing on rhythm control and propose a locomotion control system that generates robot motions by rhythmic signals from internal oscillators and modulates signal generation based on touch sensor signals. First, we verify that the robot attains limit cycles of straight and curved walking by numerical simulations and hardware experiments. Second, we examine the transition between these walking patterns based on the basin of attraction of the limit cycles in numerical simulations. Finally, we verify whether the robot actually accomplishes transition and turning by hardware experiments. This paper clarifies that the robot establishes such turning motions by adequate modulation of walking rhythm and phase through interactions between the dynamics of its mechanical system, oscillators, and environment.", "paper_title": "Adaptive behavior in turning of an oscillator-driven biped robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000247989800004"}
