Owing to the limited representation space, conflicts may occur between both the same and different features under different contexts. A successful displacement should settle multiple conflicts, suppress the generation of secondary conflicts after moving some objects, and preserve the distribution patterns. The effect of displacement can be understood as a force that pushes related objects away with properties of propagation and distance decay. This study borrows the idea of vector fields from physics discipline and establishes a vector field model to handle the displacement of multiple conflicts in building generalization. A scalar field is first constructed based on a Delaunay triangulation skeleton to partition the buildings being examined (e.g., a street block). Then, we build a vector field to conduct displacement measurements through the detection of conflicts from multiple sources. The direction and magnitude of the displacement force are computed based on an iso-line model of vector field. The experiment shows that this global method can settle multiple conflicts and preserve the spatial relations and important building patterns.", "paper_title": "A vector field model to handle the displacement of multiple conflicts in building generalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000359789900002"}
