Linear regression models for this type of data are necessarily more complex than a simple generalization of the classical model: the parameters cannot be negative; still the linear relation between the variables must be allowed to be either direct or inverse. In this work, we propose a new linear regression model for histogram-valued variables that solves this problem, named Distribution and Symmetric Distribution Regression Model. To determine the parameters of this model, it is necessary to solve a quadratic optimization problem, subject to non-negativity constraints on the unknowns; the error measure between the predicted and observed distributions uses the Mallows distance. As in classical analysis, the model is associated with a goodness-of-fit measure whose values range between 0 and 1. Using the proposed model, applications with real and simulated data are presented.", "paper_title": "Linear Regression Model with Histogram-Valued Variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000354012600002"}
