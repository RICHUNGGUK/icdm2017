The Uncertainties include both mismatched parametric uncertainties in the state model and the matched external disturbance. After deriving sufficient conditions for the existence of linear sliding surfaces based on linear matrix inequality (LMI), robust reaching motion control is presented. A simulation study shows the effectiveness of the control scheme.", "paper_title": "ROBUST SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN LINEAR DISCRETE SYSTEMS INDEPENDENT OF TIME-DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100029"}
