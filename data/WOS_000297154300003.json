Here, a gradient search is employed to lay the negative masks over the design region. A continuous material assignment model is presented and studied. This investigation is motivated by the following goals: (a) reduction in the number of evaluations thereby making the search computationally efficient compared to the previous implementations, (b) obtaining as close to well-connected binary topologies as possible, and (c) influence of various parameters on the quality of solutions and existence of gray cells.", "paper_title": "Topology design with negative masks using gradient search", "paper_id": "WOS:000297154300003"}
