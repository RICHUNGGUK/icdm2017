Its aim is to combine some paradigms from the supervised classification - sometimes with a previous non-supervised data division phase - in order to improve the individual accuracy of the component classifiers. Formation of classifier hierarchies is an alternative among the several methods of classifier combination. In this paper we present a novel method to find good hierarchies of classifiers for given databases. In this new proposal, a search is performed by means of genetic algorithms, returning the best individual according to the classification accuracy over the dataset, estimated through 10-fold cross-validation. Experiments have been carried out over 14 databases from the UCI repository, showing an improvement in the performance compared to the single classifiers. Moreover, similar or better results than other approaches, such as decision tree bagging and boosting, have been obtained. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
