For any fixed 0 < p < 1, we prove that finding the global minimal value of the problem is strongly NP-Hard, but computing a local minimizer of the problem can be done in polynomial time. We also develop an interior-point potential reduction algorithm with a provable complexity bound and demonstrate preliminary computational results of effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A note on the complexity of L-p minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000295785000006"}
