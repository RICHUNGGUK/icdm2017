On the basis of the byte-oriented model and the differential analysis principle, we propose a differential fault attack on the Camellia algorithm. Mathematical analysis and simulating experiments show that our attack can recover its 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit secret key by introducing 30 faulty ciphertexts. Thus our result in this study describes that Camellia is vulnerable to differential fault analysis. This work provides a new reference to the fault analysis of other block ciphers.
