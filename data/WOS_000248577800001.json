Our results can be viewed in a variety of ways: as a generalization of the notion of private information retrieval (to more general queries and to a streaming environment); as positive results on privacy-preserving datamining; and as a delegation of hidden program computation to other machines.", "paper_title": "Private searching on streaming data", "paper_id": "WOS:000248577800001"}
