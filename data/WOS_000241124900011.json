For this purpose, a density estimation-based robust algorithm (DER) was developed. The DER algorithm was comparatively evaluated with four other parameter estimation methods (mean value, median filtering, least square estimation, Welsch robust m-estimator). Two important questions were raised and investigated: 1) Which of the five methods can robustly estimate the mean bioaffinity signal? and 2) How many microparticles need to be measured in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the mean signal value? To answer the questions, bootstrap and coefficient of variation (CV) analyses were performed. In the CV analysis, the DER algorithm gave the best results: The CV ranged from 0.8% to 4.9% when the number of microparticles used for the mean signal estimation varied from 800 to 30. In the bootstrap analysis of the standard error, the DER algorithm had the smallest variance. As a conclusion, it can be underlined that: 1) of all methods tested, the DER algorithm gave the most consistent and reproducible results according to the bootstrap and CV analysis; 2) using the DER algorithm accurate estimates could be calculated based on 80-100 particles, corresponding to, a typical assay measurement time of 1 min; and 3) the investigated bioaffinity signals contained a large number of outliers (observations that severely deviate from the majority of data) and therefore robust techniques were necessary for the mean signal estimation tasks.", "paper_title": "Robust estimation of bioaffinity assay fluorescence signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124900011"}
