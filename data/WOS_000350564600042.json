They communicate with one another along three dimensions of cross layers, cross (circuit-switched and packet-switched) domains, and cross (36 and 4G systems. In this work, we propose signaling diagnosis tools and uncover six instances of problematic interactions. Such control-plane issues span both design defects in the 3GPP standards and operational slips by carriers. They are more damaging than data-plane failures. In the worst-case scenario, users may be out of service in 46, or get stuck in 36. We deduce root causes, propose solutions, and summarize learned lessons.", "paper_title": "Control-Plane Protocol Interactions in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600042"}
