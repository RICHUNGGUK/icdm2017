Previous approaches for coding such 3-D images propose to employ multicomponent transforms to exploit correlation among CT slices, but these approaches do not always improve coding performance with respect to a simpler slice-by-slice coding approach. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis which accurately predicts when the use of a multicomponent transform is profitable. This analysis models the correlation coefficient r based on image acquisition parameters readily available at acquisition time. Extensive experimental results from multiple image sensors suggest that multicomponent transforms are appropriate for images with correlation coefficient r in excess of 0.87.", "paper_title": "Correlation Modeling for Compression of Computed Tomography Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000324581200006"}
