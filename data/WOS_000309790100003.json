Those sensor nodes' computation and memory requirements are growing, but their energy resources do not increase; thus, more energy-efficient memories and processors are required. New circuit-design techniques that drastically reduce the static ram (SRAM) memories' energy consumption while still achieving tens of megahertz of operation are discussed.", "paper_title": "ULTRA LOW-ENERGY SRAM DESIGN FOR SMART UBIQUITOUS SENSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309790100003"}
