In order to achieve the chosen optimization goal, stiff inclusions in a soft matrix are varied in shape and location controlled by the variation of implicit level-set functions. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) allows the use of a fixed structured mesh. For the non-linear constitutive behaviour an isotropic damage model is chosen for interface and matrix softening failure; the inclusions are assumed to be elastic. For the calculation of the required sensitivities the influence of the material interfaces, the related enrichment funcions of the X-FEM as well as the kinematic and constitutive relations have to be taken into account.", "paper_title": "Optimization of multiphase structures considering damage", "paper_id": "WOS:000355760000008"}
