WebOWL consists of a community of intelligent agents, acting as crawlers, that are able to discover and learn the locations of Semantic Web neighborhoods on the Web, a semantic database to store data from different ontologies, a query mechanism that supports semantic queries in OWL, and a ranking algorithm that determines the order of the returned results based on the semantic relationships of classes and individuals. The system has been implemented using Jade, Jena and the db4o object database engine and has successfully stored over one million OWL classes, individuals and properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
