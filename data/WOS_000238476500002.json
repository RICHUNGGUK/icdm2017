An interdisciplinary approach seems to be necessary because the development of guidelines for sound knowledge modeling-in particular in medicine-requires expertise from areas such as linguistics, informatics, medicine, cognitive science and philosophy. In the present paper, we discuss relevant aspects of such an approach and outline some results of the work of the research group Onto-Med. In particular, we expound a methodology, which supports the semantic foundation of medical information systems by using top-level ontologies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
