If the process is not controlled at any stage, the final product can be damaged or lost. Thus, in such environments, considering the quality of the product at each state. is essential. Also, to control the process, communication among different parts of production line is essential. The wasted time in production line has a direct effect on process correction time and cement production performance. Here, a model of a new intelligent multi-agent quality control system (IMAQCS) for controlling the quality of cement production processes is suggested. This model, using of rule-based artificial intelligence technique, concentrates on relationship between departments in cement production line to monitor multi-attribute quality factors. With the presence of agents for controlling the quality of cement processes, real-time analyzing and decision making in a fault condition will be provided. In order to validate the proposed model, IMAQCS is deployed in real plants of a cement industries complex in Iran. The ability of the system in the process production environment is assessed. The effectiveness and efficiency of the system are demonstrated by reducing the process correction time and increasing the cement production performance. Finally, this system can effectively impact on factory resources and cost saving. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
