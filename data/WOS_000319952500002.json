This controlled behavior permits it to outperform standard Competitive Learning algorithms that only tend to concentrate neurons according to the input data density, when other kind of data information processing is desired. Some examples applying different target functions show the MSCL possibilities in several applications as data-series interpolation, surface modelling from 3D point clouds and color quantization (CQ).
