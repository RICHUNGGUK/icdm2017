Virtualization is a cost-effective way to remove such barriers and provide a test environment similar to the production site, reducing the burden on IT administrators. An Eclipse-based virtualization tool framework can offer developers a personal runtime environment for launching and testing their applications. The authors have followed a model-driven architecture approach that integrates best-of-breed virtualization technologies, such as Xen and VDE.", "paper_title": "System Virtualization Tools for Software Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000269716300008"}
