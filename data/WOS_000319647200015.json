Highly disturbed recirculation region is observed at the constriction exit where pressure fluctuations and consequential vessel wall vibrations display broadband spectral content over a range of several hundred Hz. Maximum dynamic pressure and vibration amplitudes are observed around the reattachment point and they gradually decrease along downstream of flow. Results obtained by numerical simulations are compared with relevant studies in the literature and are in good agreement in terms of general spectral behavior. However, the amplitudes were significantly lower as compared to experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
