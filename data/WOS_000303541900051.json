That is, the mechanism of regular hexagonal TATB molecules stacking to a quasi-regular or regular hexagonal TATB crystal was discussed using a combined method of a density functional theory BLYP and Dreiding forcefield, and a series of static scanning calculations. As a result, we found that there are two styles of forming the most energetically favored TATB dimers: a hydrogen bonding along the molecular plane and an offset pi-stacking vertical to the plane, just leading to the outspread and the thickening of the regular hexagon during the crystal growth, respectively. At the same time, it was found that the rotation of one TATB layer in any parallel stacked double-layer should overcome a very high energy barrier. It suggests that the TATB molecules or layers are arranged on the crystal face always along the special orientation of a regular hexagon and other orientations are strongly thermodynamically forbidden, resulting in a hexagonal crystal bulk.", "paper_title": "Why is the crystal shape of TATB is so similar to its molecular shape?
