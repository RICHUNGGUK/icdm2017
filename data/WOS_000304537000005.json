Controlling for sequence length variation is critical to properly score sequence features and identify true biological signals rather than length-dependent artifacts. Results: Several cis-regulatory module discovery algorithms exhibit a substantial dependence between DNA sequence score and sequence length. Our newly developed LOESS method is flexible in capturing diverse score-length relationships and is more effective in correcting DNA sequence scores for length-dependent artifacts, compared with four other approaches. Application of this method to genes co-expressed during Drosophila melanogaster embryonic mesoderm development or neural development scored by the Lever motif analysis algorithm resulted in successful recovery of their biologically validated cis-regulatory codes. The LOESS length-correction method is broadly applicable, and may be useful not only for more accurate inference of cis-regulatory codes, but also for detection of other types of patterns in biological sequences.", "paper_title": "LOESS correction for length variation in gene set-based genomic sequence analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000304537000005"}
