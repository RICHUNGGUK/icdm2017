Yet most structure prediction algorithms handle only linear RNAs. The most straightforward approach is to compute circular structures from 'internal' and 'external' substructures separated by a base pair. This is incompatible, however, with the memory-saving approach of the Vienna RNA Package which builds a linear RNA structure from shorter (internal) structures only. Result: Here we describe how circular secondary structures can be obtained without additional memory requirements as a kind of 'post-processing' of the linear structures.", "paper_title": "Memory efficient folding algorithms for circular RNA secondary structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300004"}
