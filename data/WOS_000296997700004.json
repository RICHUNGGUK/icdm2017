An EWCDS is an effective method for clustering. In this paper, we extend the dominative capabilities of nodes such that each forward node dominates not only itself and its regular neighbors fully, but also its quasi-neighbors partly. Based on this extension, three novel algorithms to find EWCDSs in ad hoc networks are proposed. The correctness and performance of our algorithms are confirmed through theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
