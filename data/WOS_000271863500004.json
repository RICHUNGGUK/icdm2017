One of the key elements in determining the traffic flow information is traffic density estimation. The goal of traffic density estimation is to determine the density of vehicles on a given road from loop detectors, traffic radars, or surveillance cameras. However, due to the inflexibility of deploying loop detectors and traffic radars, there is a growing trend of using video-content-understanding technique to determine the traffic flow from a surveillance camera. But difficulties arise when attempting to do this in real-time under changing illumination and weather conditions as well as heavy traffic congestions. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of real-time traffic density estimation by using a stochastic model called Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to probabilistically determine the traffic density state. Choosing a good set of model parameters for HMMs has a significant impact on the accuracy of traffic density estimation. Thus, we propose a novel feature extraction scheme to represent traffic density, and a novel approach to initialize and construct the HMMs by using an unsupervised clustering technique called AutoClass. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed real-time algorithm achieves an average traffic density estimation accuracy of 96.6% over various different illumination and weather conditions.", "paper_title": "A MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR REAL-TIME TRAFFIC DENSITY DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000271863500004"}
