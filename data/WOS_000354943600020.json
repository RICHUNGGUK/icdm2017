This paper presents efficient encoding schemes to m-ary balanced codes with parallel (hence, fast) decoding. In fact, the decoding time complexity is O(1) digit operations. These schemes are a generalization to the m-ary alphabet of Knuth's complementation method with parallel decoding. Let ((n)(w))(m) indicate the number of m-ary words of length n and weight w is an element of 10, 1,... (m - 1)n). For any m is an element of IN m >= 2, a simple implementation of the method is given which uses r Eili check digits to balance k <= {(1(L)(m-l)(r)(r/2)]) - (m mod 2 + [(m - 1)k mod 2))/(m - 1) information digits with an encoding time complexity of O(mklog(m)k) digit operations. A refined implementation of the parallel decoding method is also given with r check digits and k <= (m(r) -1)1 (m - 1) information digits, where the encoding time complexity is O (k root log(m) k). Thus, the proposed codes are less redundant than the m-ary balanced codes with parallel decoding found in the literature and yet maintain the same complexity.", "paper_title": "m-ary Balanced Codes With Parallel Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600020"}
