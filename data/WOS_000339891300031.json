In this paper, the classification tools are integrated for supporting more effective 3D model search in the high-dimensional feature space. Our proposed algorithm used multiple SVM classifiers to predict 3D models for a given query and D-S Evidence theory is used to fuse all the prediction results. Experimental results show that our proposed 3D model retrieval algorithm can improve the accuracy significantly compared with the traditional kNN method.", "paper_title": "Evidence-based SVM fusion for 3D model retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300031"}
