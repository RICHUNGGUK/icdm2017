The parametric WOWA operator with piecewise linear function can be used to represent various preferences of the decision makers in the forms of risk pessimistic, risk neutral and risk optimistic, respectively. The expected utility theory becomes a special case of it with risk neutral attitude. Meanwhile, some properties of the parametric WOWA operator with piecewise linear function are provided and the advantages of it in solving dynamic decision making problems are summarized. Different attitudes of the decision makers can be implemented by changing the values of parameter in parametric WOWA operators under different application contexts. Finally, an example is introduced to illustrate our theoretical results with decision tree for introducing and pricing new product.", "paper_title": "Parametric WOWA operator and its application in dynamic decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700042"}
