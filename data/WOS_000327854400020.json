However, application market with the size of about a hundred of million makes end-to-end security facing grand challenges, especially the repeated construction of authentication facilities for different applications. According to features of MTC, an end-to-end security scheme is proposed, which is based on the Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA), and is thus suitable for MTC communication in application layer. User authentication and session key agreement are achieved by the assistance of operator network in this scheme. Hence, the MTC server can only focus on service delivery. Performance of the proposal is also analyzed, and from this procedure, we obtain the function of lifetime of master session key against expected number of bootstrapping request. Finally, it is shown how the operator could set an optimized lifetime of master session key.", "paper_title": "End-to-end security scheme for Machine Type Communication based on Generic Authentication Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400020"}
