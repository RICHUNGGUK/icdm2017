The Ontologizer implements the standard approach to statistical analysis based on the one-sided Fishers exact test, the novel parentchild method, as well as topology-based algorithms. A number of multiple-testing correction procedures are provided. The Ontologizer allows users to visualize data as a graph including all significantly overrepresented GO terms and to explore the data by linking GO terms to all genes/proteins annotated to the term and by linking individual terms to child terms.", "paper_title": "Ontologizer 2.0 - a multifunctional tool for GO term enrichment analysis and data exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000257576000017"}
