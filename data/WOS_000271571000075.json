FJSP is NP-hard and mainly presents two difficulties. The first one is to assign each operation to a machine out of a set of capable machines, and the second one deals with sequencing the assigned operations on the machines. This paper proposes a parallel variable neighborhood search (PVNS) algorithm that solves the FJSP to minimize makespan time. Parallelization in this algorithm is based on the application of multiple independent searches increasing the exploration in the search space. The proposed PVNS uses various neighborhood structures which carry the responsibility of making changes in assignment and sequencing of operations for generating neighboring solutions. The results obtained from the computational study have shown that the proposed algorithm is a viable and effective approach for the FJSP.
