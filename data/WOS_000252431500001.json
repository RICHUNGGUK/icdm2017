For computational efficiency both algorithms are implemented in C and interfaced to R. Examples are given which illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms. We provide a second package FGN which illustrates the use of the ltsa package with fractional Gaussian noise (FGN). It is hoped that the ltsa will provide a base for further time series software.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for linear time series analysis: With R package", "paper_id": "WOS:000252431500001"}
