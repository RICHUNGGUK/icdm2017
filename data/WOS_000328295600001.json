By appropriately mixing data packets at intermediate nodes, network coding allows a single multicast flow to achieve higher throughput to a set of receivers. Broadcast applications can also exploit link-layer rate diversity, whereby individual nodes can transmit at faster rates at the expense of corresponding smaller coverage area. We first demonstrate how combining rate-diversity with network coding can provide a larger capacity for data dissemination of a single multicast flow, and how consideration of rate diversity is critical for maximizing system throughput. Next we address the following question: given a specific topology of wireless nodes, what is the maximum rate that can be supported by the resultant network exploiting both network coding and multi-rate? We present a linear programming model to compute the maximal throughput that a multicast application can achieve with network coding in a rate-diverse wireless network. We also present analytical results where we observe noticeably better throughput than traditional routing. This suggests there is opportunity for achieving higher throughput by combining network coding and multi-rate diversity.
