Multicast routing with QoS multi-constraints problem is a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem, its goal is to find the minimum cost multicast tree which satisfies multi-constraints such as delay, jitter and bandwidth. Such constrained multicast tree problem is known to be an NP-Hard problem, and there are many heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. However, the execution process of those algorithms is slow and complex, and the security of routing path is not guaranteed. To overcome these shortcomings, we make trust as another QoS constraint, and propose a multicast trusted routing algorithm with QoS multi-constraints basing on a novel ant colony optimization method. In this new algorithm, ants move constantly on the network to find an optimal constrained multicast security tree including source node and destination nodes. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm can quickly find a feasible solution to solve the constrained multicast trusted routing issue. Compared with the conventional ant colony algorithm, the convergence speed and packet delivery ratio of the new algorithm are improved.", "paper_title": "A Novel Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for QoS-Based Multicast Trusted Routing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000369378600009"}
