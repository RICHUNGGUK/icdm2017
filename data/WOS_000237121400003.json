The function EARn is the following Boolean function defined for n x n Boolean matrices: EARn (M) = 1 iff the matrix M contains two equal adjacent rows. We prove that each FBDD computing EAR(n) has size at least 2(0.63log22n-O(log n log log n)) and we present a construction of such diagrams of size approximately 2(1.89 log22 n+O(log n)).", "paper_title": "Free binary decision diagrams for the computation of EAR(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000237121400003"}
