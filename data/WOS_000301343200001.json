In this paper, a new forwarding address suitable for next generation networks named the vector address (VA) is proposed which is different from the forwarding address coding methods of current networks. The characteristics of the VA are analyzed. Complex network theory and a theoretical analysis method are introduced to study the average address length of the VA when used to construct a global network. Simulation experiments in a practical network topology model are carried out to validate the results. The results show that not only can the VA construct a simpler, more secure, and more scalable network, but it also can accommodate many more users than an Internet Protocol (IP) network with the same address length.", "paper_title": "A new forwarding address for next generation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301343200001"}
