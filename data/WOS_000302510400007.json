Replacing the algebraic product by an arbitrary aggregation function B naturally leads to the properties of alpha-B-migrativity and B-migrativity. This generalization establishes a link between migrativity and a particular case of Aczel's general associativity equation, already considered by Cutello and Montero as a recursive formula for aggregation. Following a basic investigation, emphasis is put on aggregation functions that can be represented in terms of an additive generator, more specifically, strict t-norms, strict t-conorms and representable uninorms.
