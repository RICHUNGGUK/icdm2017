Distributed computing needs the systems to be partitioned optimally into clusters. The network partitioning is an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the number of nodes in a cluster and the tie lines between the clusters. Harmony Search(HS) Algorithm is one of the recently developed meta heuristic algorithms that can be applied to optimization problems. In this work, the HS algorithm is applied to the network partitioning problem and power flow based equivalencing is done to represent the external system. Simulation is done on IEEE Standard Test Systems. The algorithm is found to be very effective in partitioning the system hierarchically and the equivalencing method gives accurate results in comparison to the centralized control.
