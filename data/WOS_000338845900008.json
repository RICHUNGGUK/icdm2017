Both subcarrier pairing (SP) and power allocation are performed subject to a primary user interference constraint to minimize the mean squared error of frequency-domain equalization at the secondary destination receiver. Under uniform power allocation at the secondary source and optimal power allocation at the secondary relay, the ordered SP is proven to be asymptotically optimal in maximizing the matched filter bound on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. SOA implements the ordered SP before power allocation optimization by decoupling the ordered SP from the power allocation. Simulation results show that SOA can optimize resource allocation efficiently by significantly reducing complexity.", "paper_title": "Sequential Optimization for Subcarrier Pairing and Power Allocation in CP-SC Cognitive Relay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000338845900008"}
