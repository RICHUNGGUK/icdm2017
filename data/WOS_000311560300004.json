The first part is devoted to Birkhoff's and Reiterman's theorems on equational descriptions of varieties. Eilenberg's variety theorem and its successive generalizations form the second part. The more recent results on equational descriptions of lattices of languages are presented in the third part of the paper.", "paper_title": "EQUATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000311560300004"}
