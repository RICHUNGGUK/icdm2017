To push the frontier, two major technologies need to be addressed. The first one is efficient feature-extraction algorithms/hardware that can match a line rate in the order of Gb/second; the second one is fast and effective anomaly detection schemes. In this paper, we focus on design of efficient data structure and algorithms for feature extraction. Specifically, we propose a novel data structure that extracts the so-called two-directional (2D) matching features, which are shown to be effective indicators of network anomalies. Our key idea is to use a Bloom filter array (BFA) to trade-off a small amount of accuracy in feature extraction, for much less space and time complexity, so that our data structure can catch up with a line rate in the order of Gb/second. Different from the existing work, our data structure has the following properties: (1) dynamic Bloom filter, (2) combination of a sliding window with Bloom filter, and (3) using an insertion-removal pair to enhance Bloom filter with a removal operation. Our analysis and simulation demonstrate that the proposed data structure has a better space/time trade-off than conventional algorithms. For example, for a fixed time complexity, the conventional algorithm (i.e., hash table [1-8]) requires a memory of 1.01 Gbits while our data structure requires a memory of only 62.9 Mbits, at the cost of losing 1% accuracy in feature extraction.
