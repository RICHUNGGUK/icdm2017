Its application over digits is common in bank checks, mail and historical document processing, among others. This paper presents an algorithm for segmentation of connected handwritten digits based on the selection of feature points, through a skeletonization process, and the clustering of the touching region via Self-Organizing Maps. The segmentation points are then found, leading to the final segmentation. The method can deal with several types of connection between the digits, having also the ability to map multiple touching. The proposed algorithm achieved encouraging results, both relating to other state-of-the-art algorithms and to possible improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
