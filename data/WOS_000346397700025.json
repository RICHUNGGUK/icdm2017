In addition, some limitations of conventional methodologies for deducing the hydraulic conductivity from oedometer or Rowe cell tests are investigated. An alternative approach for estimating the hydraulic conductivity in soils improved by vertical drains is discussed. This methodology will allow for simpler finite element modeling of consolidation due to vertical drains. The effectiveness of this technique has been demonstrated using a field study.
