Therefore, the identifier-locator split mapping network which separates the two functions has become one of the federating themes for future Internet architecture. However, DDoS attacks are still in existence in this network. In this paper, we use the attack traffic to discuss and compare the effects of DDoS attacks on the current Internet and the identifier-locator split mapping network. The numerical and simulation analyses show that the identifier-locator split mapping network alleviates DDoS attacks more effectively compared with the current Internet.", "paper_title": "Impact of Identifier-Locator Split Mechanism on DDoS Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200003"}
