A novel hybrid method for the globally optimal path planning of UCAV is proposed in this paper, which is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). The comparative experimental results with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm show that our proposed approach can not only reduce the uncertainty of the evolutionary computation caused by the probability model, but also avoid falling into local point with much quicker speed.
