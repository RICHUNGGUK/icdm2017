As a result, the federal communications commission (FCC) has been investigating new ways to manage the radio frequency resources. Cognitive radio (CR) technology is an innovative radio design philosophy which aims to increase spectrum utilization by exploiting unused and under-utilized spectrum in dynamically changing environments. The basic idea is to let unlicensed users use licensed frequencies, provided they can guarantee minimum interference perceived by the primary licensed users. However, allowing opportunistic use of the wireless spectrum creates new problems such as peaceful coexistence with other wireless technologies as well as understanding the influence of interference that each of these networks can create. In this article, we discuss the key CR operations and principles, and then discuss some of the main challenges and research opportunities that exist in CR-based emerging wireless networks.
