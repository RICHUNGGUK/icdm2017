While the features of robot behavior are extracted by symbolic dynamic filtering of the observed time series, the behavior patterns are classified based on language measure theory. The behavior identification procedure has been experimentally validated on a networked robotic test bed by comparison with commonly used tools, namely, principal component analysis for feature extraction and Bayesian risk analysis for pattern classification.", "paper_title": "Symbolic Dynamic Filtering and Language Measure for Behavior Identification of Mobile Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000304163200006"}
