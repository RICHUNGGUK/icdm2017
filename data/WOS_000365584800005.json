The model is intended in particular for compressor control system development. First, we develop a bond graph model of a single compression system. Bond graph modeling offers a different perspective to previous work by modeling the compression system based on energy flow instead of fluid dynamics. Analyzing the bond graph model explains the energy flow during compressor surge. Two principal solutions for compressor surge problem are identified: upstream energy injection and downstream energy dissipation. Both principal solutions are verified in bond graph modelings of single compression system equipped with a surge avoidance system (SAS) and single compression system equipped with an active control system. Moreover, the bond graph model of single compressor equipped with SAS is able to show the effect of recycling flow to the compressor upstream states which improves the current available model. The bond graph model of a single compression system is then used as the base model and combined to build compressor network models. Two compressor networks are modeled: serial compressors and parallel compressors. Simulation results show the surge conditions in both compressor networks.", "paper_title": "Bond graph modeling of centrifugal compression systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365584800005"}
