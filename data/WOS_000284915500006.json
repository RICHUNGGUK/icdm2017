By this method, multiple classification is transformed to a superposed cloud model with training samples as the cloud expectation, while the test samples are regarded as the 'cloud droplets', and their classifications of membership degree in a cloud model can be calculated. Considering the effect of the number of training samples on the membership degree, the cloud model is weighted by the ratio of the total number of training samples to the number of training samples in a single class so that the data distribution of the samples can be balanced. The formula of multiple classification based on the cloud model has the structure identical to that of Support Vector Machines, and the hyper entropy in cloud models exerts similar punishment on the noise samples just like the loose coefficients in Support Vector Machines; therefore, the reasonability of the method is theoretically proved.. Compared with Support Vector Machine, the method discussed in this paper does not require any large-scale quadratic programming, thus the algorithm of the method is simpler. Last but not the least, five types of data distribution samples are selected for the comparative experiment, and comparison is made with four other classification methods; the result shows that the accuracy and stability of the algorithm is high, and its implementations on the high dimensional multiple classifications are especially satisfactory.", "paper_title": "A MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION METHOD BASED ON THE CLOUD MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000284915500006"}
