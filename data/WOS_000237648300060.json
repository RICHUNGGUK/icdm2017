Space allocation is pre-assigning spaces for arriving ships so that loading operations can be performed efficiently. The constraints, which are used to maximize the efficiency of yard trucks and transfer cranes, were collected from a real container terminal and formulated in the form of constraint. Numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Satisfying constraints for locating export containers in port container terminals", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300060"}
