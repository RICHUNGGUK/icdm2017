Based on this foundation we develop a time-and space-discrete geodesic calculus. In particular we show how to shoot geodesics with prescribed initial data, and we give a construction for parallel transport in shell space. This enables, for example, natural extrapolation of paths in shell space and transfer of large nonlinear deformations from one shell to another with applications in animation, geometric, and physical modeling. Finally, we examine some aspects of curvature on shell space.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Geometry of the Space of Shells", "paper_id": "WOS:000341128900025"}
