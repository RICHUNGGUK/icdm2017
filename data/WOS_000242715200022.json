Built on the original PBAT-implementation of the Lange-Van Steen algorithm to bypass the multiple testing problem in family-based association studies, P(2)BAT integrates all PBAT-analysis tools for binary and complex traits into R and makes them accessible through a user-friendly GUI. The genome-wide analysis tools are fully automated and can be ran massively parallel directly through the GUI. P(2)BAT is fully documented and contains graphical output tools for time-to-onset analysis. P(2)BAT also features the ability to test for gene and environment/drug interaction. Availability: The P(2)BAT package is available as the R package 'pbatR' which can be downloaded from http://cran.r-project.org/. The PBAT-software is available at http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/similar to clange/.
