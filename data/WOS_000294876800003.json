This study presents a new model that uses Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks for predicting tree diameters values. The model requires three diameter measures at the base of the tree, and recursively predicts other diameter measures. The predicted diameters allow for calculating tree volume using the Smalian method. The performance of the proposed model was satisfactory when compared with data obtained from tree scaling and volume equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
