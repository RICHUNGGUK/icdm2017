In this paper, the equality of LSVM and LSMM is proved concisely, and then a new double-unmixing scheme is proposed by combining the two models. In the first time, LSVM based full unmixing is performed for selecting related class subset. In the second time, appropriate model is selected according to the cardinality of current subset for partial unmixing. Another, least square LSVM has been improved for effective unmixing. Experiments prove the high efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Combination of linear support vector machines and linear spectral mixed model for spectral unmixing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300089"}
