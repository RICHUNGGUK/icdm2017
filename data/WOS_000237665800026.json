Most speech recognition systems resolve the task of recognition on a single stage without having an intermediate phonetic sequence result. The proposed solution is hybrid in the sense that it uses HMMs and Viterbi Decoding for recognizing a phonetic sequence (actually, triphones) and then DTW or One-Stage to generate the corresponding graphemes. Experimental results showed an average accuracy rate of 100% on the recognition of closed sentences, and average word recognition rate of 84% for the continuous speech recognition task.", "paper_title": "Phonetic sequence to graphemes conversion based on DTW and one-stage algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800026"}
