The purpose of this study is to analyze the limitations of current KM systems and to propose an approach for applying the Semantic Web to KM. We analyzed the factors that affect KM system user dissatisfaction through a survey. We found that inconvenience, search and integration were statistically significant limitation factors for system quality. On the other hand, incongruence and untrustworthiness of knowledge were significant limitation factors for knowledge quality. Finally, we suggest methods for applying the Semantic Web to KM as an alternative overcoming the technical limitations of current KM systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
