The studied compounds include urea derivatives of adamantane and the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. The urea derivatives of adamantanes had previously been identified as inhibitors of NS5MTaseDV. The docking simulations using GOLD, Glide, and Dock give consistent binding modes and binding affinities of adamantanes in the AdoMet-binding site of NS5MTaseDV and, in particular, yield similar positions for the previously found inhibitors. Combined, they perfectly correspond to the bioassay measurements of nucleoside-2O-methyltransferase activity of NS5TaseDV, which confirmed inhibitory properties of the active urea adamantane but did not show inhibitory activity for amantadine and rimantadine. We also employed microscopic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a linear interaction energy (LIE) method to verify the docking results. The MD/LIE binding free energies of selected proteininhibitor complexes agree overall with the binding affinities from docking and demonstrate that amantadine and rimantadine only weakly bind at the explored site. The MD simulations also demonstrated the flexible character of a protein loop that is located between the 2 and 3 strands and is part of the AdoMet-binding pocket of NS5MTaseDV.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Adamantane Derivatives as Inhibitors of Dengue Virus mRNA Cap Methyltransferase by Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000315147900004"}
