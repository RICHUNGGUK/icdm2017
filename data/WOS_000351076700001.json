Such a situation is known as spatially correlated contention. The random access method to resolve such contention suffers from high collision rate, whereas the traditional distributed TDMA scheduling techniques primarily try to improve the network capacity by reducing the schedule length. Usually, the situation of spatially correlated contention persists only for a short duration, and therefore generating an optimal or suboptimal schedule is not very useful. Additionally, if an algorithm takes very long time to schedule, it will not only introduce additional delay in the data transfer but also consume more energy. In this paper, we present a distributed TDMA slot scheduling (DTSS) algorithm, which considerably reduces the time required to perform scheduling, while restricting the schedule length to the maximum degree of interference graph. The DTSS algorithm supports unicast, multicast, and broadcast scheduling, simultaneously without any modification in the protocol. We have analyzed the protocol for average case performance and also simulated it using Castalia simulator to evaluate its runtime performance. Both analytical and simulation results show that our protocol is able to considerably reduce the time required for scheduling.", "paper_title": "A Distributed TDMA Slot Scheduling Algorithm for Spatially Correlated Contention in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000351076700001"}
