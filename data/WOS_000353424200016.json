In this paper, we give an upper bound for the Balaban index of r-regular graphs on n vertices. Then we concentrate on cubic graphs. We give a better upper bound for fullerene graphs and we show that the Balaban index tends to zero as the number of vertices increases. This means that Balaban index does not distinguish well the fullerene graphs when they are sufficiently large. We conclude the paper with a conjecture on the lower bound of Balaban index for cubic graphs.", "paper_title": "Balaban Index of Cubic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200016"}
