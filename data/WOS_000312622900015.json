[M. Aouchiche, P. Hansen and M. Zheng, Variable neighborhood search for extremal graphs 19: further conjectures and results about the Randic index, Match Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 58(2007), 83-102]. We prove that the conjecture holds for all trees and all connected graphs with edge connectivity kappa'(G) >= 2, and if kappa'(G) = 1, the conjecture holds for sufficiently large n. The conjecture also holds for all connected graphs with diameter D <= 2(n-3+2 root 2)/pi(2) or minimum degree delta >= n/2. We also prove R . a >= 8 root n-1/nD(2) and R . a >= n delta(2 delta-n+2)/2(n-1), and then R . a is minimum for the path if D <= (n - 1)(1/4) or delta >= n/2.", "paper_title": "On a Relation Between Randic Index and Algebraic Connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000312622900015"}
