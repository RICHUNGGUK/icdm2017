By the domain mapping technique, the original function of the volume heat source is accordingly transformed to a new function defined in the mapped domain. As a result of applying MRM, the volume integral arising from the transformed heat source is transformed into a series of boundary integrals. At the end of this paper, three numerical examples are presented to show the veracity and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Also, the convergence of the transformed boundary integrals is also investigated for different types of volume heat source functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
