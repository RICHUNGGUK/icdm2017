Thus, the data propagation process follows the principles and techniques of opportunistic networks. However, as the mobile devices embedded in the bicycle are managed by rational individuals, the selfish behaviours that attempt to conserve their resources can significantly degrade the network performance. In this paper, a secure social-aware credit-based stimulating mechanism for BikeNet, called SOS, is proposed to encourage the cooperation among nodes while resisting the malicious attacks. The social context information is utilised to formulate the routing and data forwarding strategy. Moreover, to guarantee the security of nodes and enhance the confidentiality and integrity of messages, we propose identity-based cryptosystems based on social attributes for BikeNet. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that SOS can effectively stimulate the cooperation of nodes while keeping the confidentiality and integrity of messages.", "paper_title": "SOS: a secure social-aware credit-based stimulating mechanism for BikeNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000345435100005"}
