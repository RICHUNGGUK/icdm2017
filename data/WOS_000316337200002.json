Previous community detection methods are often based solely on the observed connectivity relation and the above situation is not explicitly considered. Even when the connectivity relation is partially observable, if some profile data about the vertices in the network is available, it can be exploited as auxiliary or additional information. We propose to utilize a graph structure (called a profile graph) which is constructed via the profile data, and propose a simple model to utilize both the observed connectivity relation and the profile graph. Furthermore, instead of a hierarchical approach, based on the modularity matrix of the network structure, we propose an embedding approach which utilizes the regularization via the profile graph. Various experiments are conducted over two social network datasets and comparison with several state-of-the-art methods is reported. The results are encouraging and indicate that it is promising to pursue this line of research.", "paper_title": "Toward finding hidden communities based on user profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000316337200002"}
