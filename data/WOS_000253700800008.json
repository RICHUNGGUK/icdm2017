Though the majority of patients have benign causes, uncertainty during the physician's initial assessment may result in unnecessary tests and prolonged observation before a definitive disposition decision can be made. A rule-based mobile clinical decision support system, Mobile Emergency Triage-Abdorninal Pain (MET-AP), has been developed to recommend an appropriate triage plan (discharge, consult surgery or observe/investigate) early in the ED visit, with the goal of promoting ED efficiencies and improved patient outcomes. Objective: To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of MET-AP to recommend the correct triage plan when used during the initial assessment by staff emergency physicians (EPs) and residents in a tertiary care pediatric ED. Design: Prospective cohort study. Staff EPs and/or residents examined children, aged 1-16 years, with acute, non-traumatic AP of less than 10 days duration. Details of their initial assessment, along with their blinded prediction of the correct triage plan, were recorded electronically inter-observer assessments were collected, where possible. Telephone and chart follow-up at 10-14 days was conducted to determine the patient's outcome/diagnosis, and thus the gold standard triage plan appropriate for the patient's visit. Measurements: Accuracy of MET-AP to recommend the correct triage plan (i.e., to match the gold standard plan); accuracy of physicians to predict the correct triage plan; inter-observer agreement between staff EPs and residents for each clinical attribute recorded within MET-AP. Results: Over 8 months, 574 patients with AP completed follow-up (10% appendicitis, 13% other pathology, 77% benign/resolving conditions). For patient assessments by the staff EP (n = 457), the MET-AP recommendation was correct for 72% of patients (9S% CI's: 67.9-76.1), while the physician's prediction was correct in 70% of cases (65.9-74.2) (p = 0.518). However, staff EP triage plans were more conservative than those generated by MET-AP, and a small number of patients whose triage plan should have been \"consult surgery\" would have been \"discharged\" by MET-AP. For resident assessments (n = 339), MET-AP and physician accuracies were slightly lower, but not statistically different from staff results or from each other. Inter-observer agreement on most attributes was moderate to near perfect. MET-AP shows promise in recommending the correct triage plan with similar overall accuracy to experienced pediatric EPs, but requires further research to improve accuracy and safety. MET-AP can be used on all pediatric ED patients with AP and is capable of producing a triage plan recommendation without requiring a complete set of patient information.
