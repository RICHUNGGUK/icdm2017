Gower's idea of pseudo-sample projection is exploited to develop novel tools, the pseudo-sample based contribution plots, for diagnostic purposes. The results show that when the datasets under study are affected by severe non-linearities, the proposed approach performs better than classical ones.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-sample based contribution plots: innovative tools for fault diagnosis in kernel-based batch process monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000368044900006"}
