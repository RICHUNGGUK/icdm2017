We describe the content-addressable network D2B, based on an overlay network preserving de Bruijn connections dynamically, and on a distributed hash table (DHT) supporting efficient publish and search procedures. The overlay network has constant expected degree, and any publish or search operation in the DHT takes a logarithmic expected number of steps. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
