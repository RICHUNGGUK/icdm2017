In this realm, it seems really powerful to have both an a priori user profiling and an a posteriori knowledge, extracted from historical and current user behavior, thus recommender systems can be easily adapted to these environments. In this paper, we present a hybrid strategy that proposes customized recommendations using semantic contents and potentially low-level features of multimedia objects, past behavior of users in terms of usage patterns and user interests expressed by ontologies. We have implemented a prototype that supports our proposed recommendation strategy and a real use of our system based on a 3D interface is shown. Finally, some preliminary experimental results are presented and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
