Meanwhile, there already exist many kinds of image processing algorithms and their variations, while new algorithms are still emerging. Consequently, an ongoing problem is how to improve the efficiency of massive image processing and support the integration of existing implementations of image processing algorithms into the systems. This paper proposes a distributed image processing system named SEIP, which is built on Hadoop, and employs extensible innode architecture to support various kinds of image processing algorithms on distributed platforms with GPU accelerators. The system also uses a pipeline-based framework to accelerate massive image file processing. A demonstration application for image feature extraction is designed. The system is evaluated in a small-scale Hadoop cluster with GPU accelerators, and the experimental results show the usability and efficiency of SEIP.", "paper_title": "SEIP: System for Efficient Image Processing on Distributed Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000365873400006"}
