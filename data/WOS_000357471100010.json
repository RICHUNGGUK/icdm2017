This paper presents a development framework for building and deploying mobile healthcare monitoring apps. The framework combines an application development methodology (that ensures adoption and effectiveness of apps when deployed) with an application architecture and component library (to simplify and reduce the development effort needed to implement, deploy and maintain such apps). The development framework is evaluated using a case study of a mobile healthcare monitoring app developed and deployed in collaboration with a team of healthcare researchers and doctors to support the training of residents in family medicine.", "paper_title": "A development framework for mobile healthcare monitoring apps", "paper_id": "WOS:000357471100010"}
