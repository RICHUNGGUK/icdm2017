RNN can be trained directly with only the input-output data without having to know the internal details of the circuit. The trained models can reflect the behavior of nonlinear circuits. In our proposed technique, we extract slow-changing signals from the inputs and outputs of the PA and use these signals as extra inputs of RNN model to effectively represent long-term memory effects. The methodology using the proposed RNN for modeling short-term and long-term memory effects is discussed. Examples of behavioral modeling of PAs with short- and long-term memory using both the existing dynamic neural networks and the proposed RNNs techniques are shown. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
