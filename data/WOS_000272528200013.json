The challenge lies in resolving the communication cost minimization problem, while simultaneously satisfying the timing constraints of job executions. In this paper, we explore bus-layer minimization problems by first identifying factors that contribute to the NP-hardness of these problems. Existing proposed algorithms and NP-hard problems are then identified and elucidated. A simulated annealing algorithm is proposed and compared with heuristics-based algorithms to provide further insights for system designers. Lastly, a series of extensive simulations is carried out and a case study is presented to show comparisons among different approaches and workloads. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
