This system after receiving both functional variables of the gas transmission network and faults signals makes right decisions to eliminate and repair the conditions of the transmission network according to its database established through experience gathered from experts. These decisions are expressed in the form of some scenarios with different desirability degrees. Desirability degrees measure the outcomes of the decisions taken for the aforementioned conditions; this in turn will assist the managers in choosing the best ones. The user interface properly developed is graphical and provides the manager a good facility to easily use the system without any hesitation at the occurrence time of crisis. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
