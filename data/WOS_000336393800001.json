The solution is performed by methods developed for one-parameter algebraic program models. This summarizes previous studies of this model. An important functional feature of the model is revealed: the existence of several canonical forms for the representation of schemas in their equivalence class.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a two-parameter algebraic model of programs by methods developed for one-parameter models", "paper_id": "WOS:000336393800001"}
