One of the main issues to maintain the quality of services (QoS) in mobile video playback is to ensure sufficient number of video frames available at the client side while a video is being played. However, due to the limited bandwidth of a mobile network and variable workload streaming video, this is not easy to achieve in practice. In addition, the communication link between mobile clients and a video server is subject to frequent errors and temporary disconnection. In this paper, we propose to use the notion of buffered bandwidth in addition to the network bandwidth to support real-time playback of videos at mobile clients. Based on this, we designed a bandwidth allocation scheme called Cooperative Pre-Fetching (CP) in which the amount of bandwidth to be allocated to serve a video request depends on the current buffer level of the video at the client relative to the target buffer level of the client. In determining the target buffer level, we consider the errors in communication to the client as well as the other clients who are concurrently served by the system. The buffered video frames at the clients are then used to minimize the impact of error in communications on the overall QoS of video playbacks in the whole system.", "paper_title": "Real time video frames allocation in mobile networks using cooperative pre-fetching", "paper_id": "WOS:000244314900005"}
