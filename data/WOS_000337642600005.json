We derive corresponding multivariate decomposition methods and show that they lead to polynomial tractability under suitable assumptions concerning gamma weights as well as the probability density functions omega and psi. For instance, suppose that the cost of evaluating functions with d variables is at most exponential in d and the weights y decay to zero sufficiently quickly. Then the cost of approximating such functions with the error at most epsilon is proportional to epsilon(-1)/(r+minc1/s-1/p,0)) ignoring logarithmic terms. This is a nearly-optimal result, since (once again ignoring logarithmic terms) it equals the complexity of the same approximation problem in the univariate case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
