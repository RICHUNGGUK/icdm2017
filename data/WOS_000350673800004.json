Motivated by various applications, two types of DPCE (of Type-I and II) are defined, depending upon whether the user delegates the plaintext checking right at his will to a delegated checker (Type-I) or the user is required to provide this plaintext checking right to a designated checker (Type-II). We propose several generic random-oracle and standard model constructions for DPCE of both the types based on arbitrary probabilistic or deterministic encryption schemes.", "paper_title": "PLAINTEXT CHECKABLE ENCRYPTION WITH DESIGNATED CHECKER", "paper_id": "WOS:000350673800004"}
