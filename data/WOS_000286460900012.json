Design: Descriptive study. Settings: Sleep laboratory for patient's recording and home for healthy volunteers. Participants: Twelve patients referred for suspicion or treatment of sleep disordered breathing and 5 healthy subjects. Measurements: Complete polysomnography was recorded during one night in patients and during two nights in healthy volunteers. Heasys (R) sheet was placed under the fitted bed sheet to allow concomitant recording. During the second night, healthy subjects were asked to get out of bed at least 2 times for a minimal duration of 3 min. Results: Heasys (R) allowed the detection of all bed-exit events in patients and volunteers (sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 85%). When bed-exit events were defined by the lack of the presence signal combined with absence of motion and a dip in temperature, sensitivity and specificity of Heasys (R) were 92 and 100%, respectively. In patients and volunteers, Heasys (R) detected body position changes recorded by polysomnography respectively, in 84 and 98% of the cases. Additional recorded motions were mainly related to leg movements or arousals. Conclusion: In this small feasibility study, Heasys (R) seemed to be an effective innovative device allowing bed-exit events detection in adult patients and healthy volunteers.
