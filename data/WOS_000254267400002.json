Web developers adopt tactics for integrating external services into their applications, aiming to enrich both utility and efficiency with low cost. A variety of services derived from the area of Open Hypermedia Systems (OHS) can augment web functionality with valuable hypermedia features. Towards that, this paper proposes a framework for enabling the provision of hypermedia services to web developers in a service-oriented manner. It investigates and analyzes the requirements of developers for easily inserting hypermedia functionality into Web applications, thus facilitating rapid prototyping of web applications. A Service Discovery Mechanism for finding and using hypermedia services is defined, and solutions for increasing the usage of hypermedia systems by web developers are proposed.", "paper_title": "Selecting services for web applications: The open hypermedia case", "paper_id": "WOS:000254267400002"}
