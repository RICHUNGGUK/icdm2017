It incorporates the most important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth, mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity, temperature and salinity fields archived from ROMS or MARS oceanic models. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and statistical software. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
