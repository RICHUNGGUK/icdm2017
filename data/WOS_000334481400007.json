The switched Boolean network is introduced and expressed into an algebraic form. Then, the switching-incidence matrix is constructed and the physical meaning is given. Based on this, a necessary and sufficient condition for the global stability at some limit cycle of the switched Boolean network is given. An illustrative example shows the efficiency of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
