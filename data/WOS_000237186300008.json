A feed-forward, backpropagation ANN was tested with three methods for estimating the missing values. Similar results were achieved with a constraint satisfaction ANN, which can accommodate missing values without a separate estimation step. This empirical study highlights the need for additional research on developing robust clinical decision support systems for realistic environments in which key information may be unknown or inaccessible.
