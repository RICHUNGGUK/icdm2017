Although certificate-based and ID-based authentication schemes have been proposed to provide authentication for Joux's protocol, no provably secure password-based one round tripartite key agreement protocol has been proposed yet. We propose a secure one round password-based tripartite key agreement protocol that builds on Joux's protocol and adapts PAKEC scheme for password-based authentication, and present a proof of its security.", "paper_title": "Provably secure tripartite password protected key exchange protocol based on elliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900014"}
