We simulate this geometrically complicated phenomenon by modeling the effects of heat transfer, shrinkage and partial ablation on a thin shell. A strain-limitation technique is applied to a two-layer structure of springs arranged as a body-centered square. Although this structure is over-constrained, convergence can be achieved using a new successive fast projection method. We also remesh the shells dynamically to deal with the topological changes that occur as regions burn away.", "paper_title": "Shrinkage, wrinkling and ablation of burning cloth and paper", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600002"}
