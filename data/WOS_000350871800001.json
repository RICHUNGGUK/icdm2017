One example is represented by the fast-moving fronts originating from dam breaches that proceed downstream through artificial channels. In this work, a fully 3D lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is tested. The numerical model is a front-tracking variant of the LBM, being the free surface tracked through the liquid volume fraction. Model performances are evaluated simulating the effect of dam-break flows on synthetic settings schematically represented by an artificial domain and comparing results with analytical data and experimental laboratory measurements. Obtained results are promising for the use of LBM for practical engineering applications.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of water free-surface flows through a front-tracking lattice Boltzmann approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350871800001"}
