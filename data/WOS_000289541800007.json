In this critical review paper we focus on the feed-forward RNN model and its ability to solve classification problems. In particular, we paid special attention to the RNN literature related with learning algorithms that discover the RNN interconnection weights, suggested other potential algorithms that can be used to find the RNN interconnection weights, and compared the RNN model with other neural-network based and non-neural network based classifier models. In review, the extensive literature review and experimentation with the RNN feed-forward model provided us with the necessary guidance to introduce six critical review comments that identify some gaps in the RNN's related literature and suggest directions for future research.
