Our objective is to find a power control law that optimizes the link layer performance, specifically, minimizes the packet drop probability, subject to a long-term average power constraint. We assume the buffer at the transmitter is finite; hence packet drop happens when the buffer is full. The fading channel under our study has a continuous state, e.g., Rayleigh fading. Since the channel state space is continuous, dynamic programming is not applicable for power control. In this paper, we propose a sub-optimal power control law based on a parametric approach. The proposed power control scheme tries to minimize the packet drop probability by considering the queue length, i.e., reducing the probability of those queue-length states that will cause full buffer. Simulation results show that our proposed power control scheme reduces the packet drop probability by one or two orders of magnitude, compared to the time domain water filling (TDWF) and the truncated channel inversion (TCI) power control.
