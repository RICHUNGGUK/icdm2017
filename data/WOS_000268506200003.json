The trajectory of each particle is determined by a simple rule incorporating the current particle velocity and exploration histories of the particle and its neighbors. Since its introduction by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, PSO has attracted many researchers due to its search efficiency even for a high dimensional objective function with multiple local optima. The dynamics of PSO search has been investigated and numerous variants for improvements have been proposed. This paper reviews the progress of PSO research so far, and the recent achievements for application to large-scale optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Particle Swarm Optimization - A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200003"}
