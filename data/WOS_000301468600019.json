In this model, if the Private Key Generator (PKG) maliciously re-distributes users' decryption keys, it runs the risk of being caught and prosecuted. Libert and Vergnaud proposed an accountable authority identity-based broadcast encryption, which allows white-box tracing or weak black-box tracing. Their scheme was proved only secure in selective-ID model. We present a weak black-box accountable authority identity-based broadcast encryption scheme, which is proven as fully CCA2 secure against adaptive adversary with tight reduction. Our scheme achieves O(m) public keys size, O(m) private keys size, and O(1) ciphertext length, where m is the maximum number of receivers allowed in each broadcast. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
