A summation invariant, which captures local characteristics of a facial surface, is extracted from multiple subregions of a 3-D range image as the discriminative features. Similarity scores between two range images are calculated from the selected subregions. A novel fusion method that is based on a linear discriminant analysis is developed to maximize the verification rate by a weighted combination of these similarity scores. Experiments on the Face Recognition Grand Challenge V2.0 dataset show that this new algorithm improves the recognition performance significantly in the presence of facial expressions.", "paper_title": "Optimal linear combination of facial regions for improving identification performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000249594500006"}
