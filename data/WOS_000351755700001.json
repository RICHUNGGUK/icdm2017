Our goal is to model the hairs in a given cartoon image with consistent layering and occlusion, so that we can produce various visual effects from just a single image. We propose a novel 2.5D modeling approach to deal with this problem. Given an input image, we first segment the hairs of the cartoon character into regions of hair strands. Then, we apply our novel layering metric, which is derived from the Gestalt psychology, to automatically optimize the depth ordering among the hair strands. After that, we employ our hair completion method to fill the occluded part of each hair strand, and create a 2.5D model of the cartoon hair. By using this model, we can produce various visual effects, e.g., we develop a simplified fluid simulation model to produce wind blowing animations with the 2.5D hairs. To further demonstrate the applicability and versatility of our method, we compare our results with real cartoon hair animations, and also apply our model to produce a wide variety of hair manipulation effects, including hair editing and hair braiding.", "paper_title": "2.5D Cartoon Hair Modeling and Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351755700001"}
