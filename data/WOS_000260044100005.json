Edge-curl can increase its height while sintering the dielectric. Therefore, it is important to know the effect of the dielectric on the electrode. This study examined the shape change of the electrode as a function of the sintering temperature by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal properties of the electrode and the dielectric were measured by TG-DTA and dilatometer. Based on these results, a faster reaction of the dielectric around the electrode and the difference in shrinkage between the dielectric and the electrode were found to be causes of the occurrence and deepening of edge-curl.
