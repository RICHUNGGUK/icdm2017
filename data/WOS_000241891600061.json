We introduce the concept of classification learning and propose a new representation of observed behavior. Compared with previous robot behavior learning methods, this method has the property of learning a new behavior while at the same time preserving prior learned behaviors. Moreover, visual information and audio information are integrated to form a unified percept of the observed behavior, which facilitates robot behavior learning. We implement this learning method on a humanoid robot head for behavior learning and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.", "paper_title": "Humanoid robot behavior learning based on ART neural network and cross-modality learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600061"}
