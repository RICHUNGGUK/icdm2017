In this article, we propose a high-performance and well-manageable DML, named HPWM, which is characterized by three main novel features: (1) using .NET Remoting to provide better network performance and having scalable and extendable architecture; (2) using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) to provide an efficient and lightweight Graphic User Interface (GUI) without browser plug-ins; and (3) offering adequate management functionalities to well manage users and instruments and establishing their relationships. The software structure used for developing HPWM is also described. Finally, HPWM has been tested in the academic and industrial education and has shown its correctness and effectiveness.
