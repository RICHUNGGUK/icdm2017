A life-support load restoration framework is proposed for an efficient restoration, which consists of a hybrid triggering mechanism and a Multi-Agent Consensus System (MACS). The hybrid triggering mechanism is proposed to identify life-support loads rapidly, as a disaster-caused blackout occurs. Meanwhile, communication network bandwidth is saved greatly. The novel MACS is developed as a restoration operator. Multi-agent consensus algorithm, as an Action Consensus Protocol of Agents (ACPA), is firstly applied in power systems restoration. Based on the proposed ACPA, the emergency restoration can be quantized precisely. Simulation results on IEEE-30 bus system are provided to validate the performance of the proposed approach.
