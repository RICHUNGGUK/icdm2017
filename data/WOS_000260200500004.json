We propose a heuristic technique to classify TCP anomalies, i.e., segments that have a sequence number different from the expected one, Such as out-of-sequence and duplicate segments. Since TCP is a closed-loop protocol that infers network conditions from packet losses and reacts accordingly, the possibility of carefully distinguishing the causes of anomalies in TCP traffic is very appealing and may be instrumental to understand TCP behavior in real environments. We apply the proposed heuristic to traffic traces collected at both network edges and backbone links. By comparing results obtained from traces collected over several years, we observe some phenomena such as the impact of the introduction of TCP SACK which reduces the unnecessary retransmissions, the large percentage of network reordering, etc. By further studying the statistical properties of TCP anomalies, we find that, while their aggregate exhibits long-range dependence, anomalies suffered by individual long-lived flows are on the contrary uncorrelated. Interestingly, no dependence on the actual link load is observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Passive analysis of TCP anomalies", "paper_id": "WOS:000260200500004"}
