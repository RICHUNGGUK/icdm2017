Based on this model, the government's optimal carbon-emission tax scheme and the company's optimal transportation mode and production decisions are explored. We find that: 1) whether or not the transport carbon-emission tax can increase social welfare depends on the relationships among the social cost of carbon (SCC), the transportation mode shifting threshold (TMST), and the biggest carbon-emission tax that a company can afford (BCRA); 2) a greater SCC implies a higher probability of improving social welfare via imposing transportation carbon-emission tax; and 3) a smaller TMST or BCRA yields a higher probability of improving social welfare when a carbon-emission tax is imposed. Further study shows that imposing a carbon-emission tax on the product with a higher production cost, a bigger product volume, or a bigger product density can increase the probability of improving social welfare.", "paper_title": "Effects of Carbon Emission Taxes on Transportation Mode Selections and Social Welfare", "paper_id": "WOS:000363231900003"}
