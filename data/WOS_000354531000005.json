At the same time, however, expanding search towards document structure and external, formal knowledge sources (e.g. LOD resources) remains challenging, especially with respect to efficiency, usability, and scalability. This paper introduces Mimir-an open-source framework for integrated semantic search over text, document structure, linguistic annotations, and formal semantic knowledge. Mimir supports complex structural queries, as well as basic keyword search. Exploratory search and sense-making are supported through information visualisation interfaces, such as co-occurrence matrices and term clouds. There is also an interactive retrieval interface, where users can save, refine, and analyse the results of a semantic search over time. The more well-studied precisionoriented information seeking searches are also well supported. The generic and extensible nature of the Mimir platform is demonstrated through three different, real-world applications, one of which required indexing and search over tens of millions of documents and fifty to hundred times as many semantic annotations. Scaling up to over 150 million documents was also accomplished, via index federation and cloud-based deployment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
