However, services residing in OSGi platforms are devised specifically for the platforms' local bundles. Although several works have enhanced OSGi with various communication mechanisms that enable remote service invocations, two crucial issues pertaining to mobile computing remain to be addressed: One is limited resources of mobile devices, and the other is unstable links experienced with mobile devices. To address these two issues, we propose an itinerary-based mobile agent approach with four major features: To implement mobile agents as OSGi bundles to deliver distributed OSGi services with lower resource consumption; to extend WSDL and WS-BPEL to help developers design mobile agent itineraries; to provide an opportunistic service matchmaking mechanism allowing mobile agents to adapt to context changes at runtime; and to devise asynchronous communication mechanism to enable reliable mobile agent transmissions among mobile devices with dynamic IP addresses and intermittent connection to the Internet. Through experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that both network traffic and turnaround time of our approach are better than those of client-server ones.", "paper_title": "Itinerary-Based Mobile Agent as a Basis for Distributed OSGi Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000323718600007"}
