Although several geocasting protocols have already been proposed for multi-hop wireless networks, most of these algorithms consider a \"single\" target region only. Here, when more than one target regions need to receive the same geocast messages, multiple transmissions need to be initiated separately by the message source. This causes significant performance degradation due to redundant packet transmissions, and it becomes more severe as the number of target regions increase. To solve this problem, we propose a basic scheme and its variations which utilize the geometric concept of \"Fermat point\" to determine the optimal junction point among multiple geocast regions from the source node. Our simulation study using ns-2 shows that the proposed schemes can effectively reduce the overhead of message delivery while maintaining a high delivery ratio in mobile multi-hop wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Efficient geocasting with multi-target regions in mobile multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278968500003"}
