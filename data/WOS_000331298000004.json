The purpose of this study was to separate bony structures such as ribs and clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs. To achieve this, we developed anatomically specific multiple massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) combined with total variation (TV) minimization smoothing and a histogram-matching-based consistency improvement method. The anatomically specific multiple MTANNs were designed to separate bones from soft tissue in different anatomic segments of the lungs. Each of the MTANNs was trained with the corresponding anatomic segment in the teaching bone images. The output segmental images from the multiple MTANNs were merged to produce an entire bone image. TV minimization smoothing was applied to the bone image for reduction of noise while preserving edges. This bone image was then subtracted from the original CXR to produce a soft-tissue image where bones were separated out. This new method was compared with conventional MTANNs with a database of 110 CXRs with nodules. Our new anatomically specific MTANNs separated rib edges, ribs close to the lung wall, and the clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs to a substantially higher level than did the conventional MTANNs, while the conspicuity of lung nodules and vessels was maintained. Thus, our technique for bone-soft-tissue separation by means of our new MTANNs would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as CADe schemes in detection of lung nodules on CXRs.", "paper_title": "Separation of Bones From Chest Radiographs by Means of Anatomically Specific Multiple Massive-Training ANNs Combined With Total Variation Minimization Smoothing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331298000004"}
