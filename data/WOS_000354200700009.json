VANET has been incrementally experimented for rescue scenario. Therefore, one of the popular ad hoc protocols, ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), is applied to adjust VANET environment. In AODV, its critical routing fields (CRF) are security leakages allowing malicious nodes to launch routing attacks by illegally modifying field content. To prevent CRF from being modified by forwarders, we propose Mobile Two-hop Integrity Validation for Emergency vehicle routing (MoTIVE) to enhance routing security of AODV. To design a secure VANET without introducing extra traffic, MoTIVE uses two-hop integrity stamping (THIS) and validation rules, accompanying routing information exchanges without modifying protocol design. With THIS, MoTIVE verifies the integrity of forwarded AODV routing messages within each two-hop area; consequently, it guarantees the routing correctness of whole network with induction concept. The main contribution of MoTIVE is that security-reinforced information is piggybacked in normal routing messages within two-hop locally instead of being flooded to the entire network globally. Compared with the original AODV, experiment results show that MoTIVE is scalable and causes no performance degradation while supplementary security protection is applied.
