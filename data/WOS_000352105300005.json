The purpose of this paper is to aim at defining the solution to the integration. Design/methodology/approach - Channel coordination is grounded on a new governance of integration strategy which bridges the channels. This study proposes a novel research model with three stages: first, click-and-brick strategies; second, channel coordination for three purchase stages; and third, synergy realizations. A survey was conducted for collecting empirical data. PLS was used for path analysis. In total, three separate statistical analyses were performed for three defined integration strategies. Findings - Click-and-brick strategies have different degrees of impact on channel coordination in different purchase stages and in turn, different degrees of impact on synergy benefits. Specifically, the in-house division strategy is more important in determining channel coordination in the three purchase stages. Practical implications - Customers initially perceive online services with a nature of low trust and view them as highly risky. This integration is useful for a firm to successfully start a new online business. Further, it provides insight into allocating a firm's resources to critical multi-channel activities to realize synergy benefits. Originality/value - Multi-channel marketing is dynamic and complex in nature. Existing theories provide limited insight into effectively defining them. This study attempted to define a strategy-based implementation model. This model demonstrated the capability to effectively reduce the complexity of defining channel integration.", "paper_title": "A strategy-based model for implementing channel integration in e-commerce An empirical examination", "paper_id": "WOS:000352105300005"}
