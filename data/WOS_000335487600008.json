This article draws attention to the issue, illustrating the difficulties it can cause for road vehicle aerodynamics simulations. Firstly a benchmark problem is used to assess a range of turbulence models and grid types. Large noise amplitudes up to 22% are evident for solutions computed on unstructured tetrahedral grids whereas computations on hexahedral and polyhedral grid structures exhibit substantially less noise. The Spalart Allmaras turbulence model is shown to be far less susceptible to noise levels than two other commonly-used models for this application. Secondly, multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimization is applied to a fairing for a practical road vehicle which is parameterised in terms of three design variables. Moving Least Squares (MLS) metamodels are constructed from 50 high-fidelity CFD solutions for two objective functions. Subsequent optimization is successful for the first objective, however numerical noise levels in excess of 7% give rise to difficulties for the second one. A revision to the problem leads to success and the construction of a small Pareto front. Further analysis underlines the inherent capability of MLS metamodels in dealing with noisy CFD responses.
