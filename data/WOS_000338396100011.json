Two data sets consisting of X-ray patterns of the Au-Sn thin film system and laser-induced coloured oxide films on a titanium substrate (Ti-O) are analysed as examples. The proposed approach is based on the assumption that data has a bilinear mathematical structure and, therefore, it can be subjected to principal component analysis and a biplot can be created. The key information was gained when the PCA model that we have developed was employed to reference a database of X-ray patterns. The obtained biplot, in a simple way, allowed for a visual appraisal of the chemical compounds that constituted the analysed samples. Chemical information about the composition of the two sets of targets. Au-Sn and Ti-O, was found to be consistent with that reported in the literature and determined using other methods. Moreover, in the case of Ti-O, which is known as a very complex system, multivariate data analysis enabled the determination of new supplementary information concerning the role of the individual chemical compounds in terms of laser-induced colouring of the titanium surface.
