By spine decomposition and a linear-time algorithm for the maximum density segment problem, we developed an O(n logn) time algorithm, which improves the previously best result of O(n log(2)n) by using centroid decomposition. We also show the time complexity is optimal in the algebraic computation tree model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
