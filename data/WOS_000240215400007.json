Low-level vision processing tasks need good lighting in the work environment for them to function robustly. Hence, good and uniform illumination from external light source is essential for machine vision applications to function. In this paper, we suggest a design procedure to obtain uniform illumination on the scene being imaged using several light sources. We pose the problem of determining the optimal position of the light sources as a minimisation problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed procedure to illuminate the scene uniformly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
