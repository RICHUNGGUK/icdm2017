However, there is a so-called \"sharp boundary\" problem in association rules mining with quantitative attribute domains. This paper aims at proposing an associative classification approach, namely Classification with Fuzzy Association Rules (CFAR), where fuzzy logic is used in partitioning the domains. In doing so, the notions of support and confidence are extended, along with the notion of compact set in dealing with rule redundancy and conflict. Furthermore, the corresponding mining algorithm is introduced and tested on benchmarking datasets. The experimental results revealed that CFAR generated better understandability in terms of fewer rules and smother boundaries than the traditional CBA approach while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.", "paper_title": "BUILDING AN ASSOCIATIVE CLASSIFIER BASED ON FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264144000007"}
