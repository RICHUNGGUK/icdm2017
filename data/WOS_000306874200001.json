Now given the time-shifted nature of future requests, rerouting strategies have also been considered to improve resource allocation and carried loads. However, most existing rerouting schemes have focused on minimizing connection disruptions and have not considered further link load information. Along these lines, this paper develops novel rerouting strategies to improve connection scheduling in advance reservation networks. Specifically, a dynamic optimization formulation is presented to handle \"on-line\" arrivals along with a new heuristic load-balancing strategy. The performance of these proposed solutions is then evaluated for a wide range of network topologies and also compared against some existing rerouting schemes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
