Therefore, an empirical study is performed to examine the correlation between the user/developer activities and the state of development of an OSS project. It is shown that certain user/developer activities have a particular efficacy in facilitating OSS project development. The results presented in this study provide an effective approach useful in observing and evaluating the development of OSS projects.
