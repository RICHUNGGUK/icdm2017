The presented method is based on decomposing the fractional order interval plant into several vertex plants using the lower and upper bounds of the fractional orders and relevant coefficients and then constructing the characteristic quasi-polynomial of each vertex plant, in which the value set of vertex characteristic quasi-polynomial in the complex plane is a polygon. The D-decomposition method is used to characterise the stability boundaries of each vertex characteristic quasi-polynomial in the space of controller parameters, which can obtain the stability region by varying orders in the range (0,2). These regions of each vertex plant are computed by using three stability boundaries: real root boundary (RRB), complex root boundary (CRB) and infinite root boundary (IRB). The method gives the explicit formulae corresponding to these boundaries in terms of fractional order PI controller parameters. Thus, the robust stability region for fractional order interval plant can be obtained by intersecting stability region of each vertex plant. The robustness of stability region is tested by the value set approach and zero exclusion principle. Our presented technique does not require sweeping over the parameters and also does not need linear programming to solve a set of inequalities. It also offers several advantages over existing results obtained in this direction. The method in this article is useful for analysing and designing the fractional order PI controller for the fractional order interval plant. An example is given to illustrate this method.", "paper_title": "Robust stability region of fractional order PI lambda controller for fractional order interval plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000320097900016"}
