The design methodology of SPC aided communications transceivers is described, including the Multiple Level Modulation (MLM) concept, the corresponding iterative Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) aided receiver and the quasi-random coding principle. Building on these fundamental discussions, various future wireless applications of the SPC technique were provided, which encompass cooperative communications-assisted relay systems and cross-layer SPC aided multiplexed Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) techniques. Our discussions demonstrate that the SPC technique is a promising enabler for diverse future wireless communications scenarios, ranging from cellular networks to cooperative networks.", "paper_title": "A Unified Treatment of Superposition Coding Aided Communications: Theory and Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000295209300011"}
