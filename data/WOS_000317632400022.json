This is the rendezvous process. Channel hopping (CH) schemes have been proposed to establish pairwise rendezvous. In this paper, we present a distributed CH scheme based on the quorum system to make SUs rendezvous on their common available channels within a bounded time. Our scheme can guarantee rendezvous even when SUs sense different sets of available channels. Simulation results show that the proposed CH scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of average time-to-rendezvous and success rate.", "paper_title": "Quorum-based channel hopping scheme for cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400022"}
