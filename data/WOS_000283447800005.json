A generic asset-based DWTA model is established, especially for the warfare scenario of force coordination, to formulate this problem. Four categories of constraints, involving capability constraints, strategy constraints, resource constraints (i.e., ammunition constraints), and engagement feasibility constraints, are taken into account in the DWTA model. The concept of virtual permutation (VP) is proposed to facilitate the generation of feasible decisions. A construction procedure (CP) converts VPs into feasible DWTA decisions. With constraint satisfaction guaranteed by the synergy of VPs and the CP, an elaborate local search (LS) operator, namely move-to-head operator, is constructed to avoid repeatedly generating the same decisions. The operator is integrated into two tabu search (TS) algorithms to solve DWTA problems. Comparative experiments involving a random sampling method, an LS method, a hybrid genetic algorithm, a hybrid ant-colony optimization algorithm, and our TS algorithms show that the proposed TS heuristics for DWTA outperform their competitors in most test cases and they are competent for high-quality real-time DWTA decision makings.", "paper_title": "Efficient Decision Makings for Dynamic Weapon-Target Assignment by Virtual Permutation and Tabu Search Heuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000283447800005"}
