This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model using 74 soil series provided by the Department of Agriculture, Malaysia. The ANN model produces acceptable results: the K values for 74 soil series of Peninsular Malaysia give much better information to engineers in determining the soil loss and sediment yield for a given development area.", "paper_title": "Prediction of soil erodibility factor for Peninsular Malaysia soil series using ANN", "paper_id": "WOS:000330318500014"}
