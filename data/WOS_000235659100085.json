In MGRID, various manufacturing resources compose the foundation of applications above it. To virtualize the resources, we present an encapsulation model based on Web Service Resource Framework (WSRF) specification. To solve the problem of dynamic organization of manufacturing job, we design a job management system, which accomplishes dynamic composition of manufacturing services. At last, a prototype is given to demonstrate our method.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a service-oriented manufacturing Grid system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100085"}
