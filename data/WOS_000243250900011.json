Under the assumption of availability of the correspondence of three vanishing points, in general position, we propose two techniques. The first is a transfer-based scheme which synthesizes new views with only a translation of the virtual camera and computes z-buffer values for handling occlusions in synthesized views. The second is a reconstruction-based scheme which synthesizes arbitrary new views in which the camera can undergo rotation as well as translation. We present experimental results to establish the validity of both formulations.
