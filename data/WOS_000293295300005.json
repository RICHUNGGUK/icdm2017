In this paper, we first present a new model, the OC-DEC-MDP (Opportunity Cost Decentralized Markov Decision Process), that allows us to represent large multi-agent decision problems with temporal and precedence constraints. Then, we propose polynomial algorithms to efficiently solve problems formalized by OC-DEC-MDPs. The problems we deal with consist of a set of agents that have to execute a set of tasks in a cooperative way. The agents cannot communicate during task execution and they must respect resource and temporal constraints. Our approach is based on Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) and uses the concept of opportunity cost borrowed from economics to obtain approximate control policies. Experimental results show that our approach produces good quality solutions for complex problems which are out of reach of existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Solving efficiently Decentralized MDPs with temporal and resource constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000293295300005"}
