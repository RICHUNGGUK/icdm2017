The introduction of evolutionary computation has further boosted the research towards exploring ways to incorporate human supervision and guidance in the automatic evolution of melodies and sounds. This kind of human-machine interaction belongs to a larger methodological context called interactive evolution (IE). For the automatic creation of art and especially for music synthesis, user fatigue requires that the evolutionary process produces interesting content that evolves fast. This paper addresses this issue by presenting an IE system that evolves melodies using genetic programming (GP). A modification of the GP operators is proposed that allows the user to have control on the randomness of the evolutionary process. The results obtained by subjective tests indicate that the utilization of the proposed genetic operators drives the evolution to more user-preferable sounds.", "paper_title": "Controlling interactive evolution of 8-bit melodies with genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000310743100002"}
