Different from the traditional one in RI space, it derives three quadratic curves in R-2 space for approximating (t,f(t)) instead, which leads to a higher approximation order. Two bounding polynomials are then computed in O(n(2)) for bounding the roots of f(t) within the interval. The new clipping method achieves a convergence rate of 4 for a single root, compared with that of 3 from traditional method using quadratic polynomial approximation in R-1 space. When f(t) is convex within the interval, the two bounding polynomials are able to be directly constructed without error estimation, which leads to computational complexity O(n). Numerical examples show the approximation effect and efficiency of the new method. The method is particularly useful for the fly computation in many geometry processing and graphics rendering applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
