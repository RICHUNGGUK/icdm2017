Our method consists of two parts: pre-failure model derivation and post-failure model-based anomaly detection. The first part collects function-call traces from all processes and derives an execution model that reflects the function-calling behaviors of the target system. When a failure occurs, we identify the most deviant behaviors in the failed run by comparing the failure traces with the derived model. We claim that the analyst can substantially reduce the burden of fault localization by prioritizing such behaviors. Our preliminary experiment with a distributed job manager supports this claim: Our method narrows down localization of a 70-second faulty run on a 78-node distributed platform into just sub-second behaviors involving only two nodes.", "paper_title": "Model-based Fault Localization: Finding Behavioral Outliers in Large-scale Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000280961200003"}
