In this paper, we show that the upper triangular matrix encountered during the sphere decoding of a linear dispersion STBC can be rank-deficient even when the rate of the code is less than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. We then show that all known families of high-rate (rate greater than 1) multigroup decodable codes have rank-deficient matrix even when the rate is less than the number of transmit and receive antennas, and this rank-deficiency problem arises only in asymmetric MIMO systems when the number of receive antennas is strictly less than the number of transmit antennas. Unlike the codes with full-rank matrix, the complexity of the sphere decoding-based ML decoder for STBCs with rank-deficient matrix is polynomial in the constellation size, and hence is high. We derive the ML sphere decoding complexity of most of the known high-rate multigroup decodable codes, and show that for each code, the complexity is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas.", "paper_title": "On the Sphere Decoding Complexity of High-Rate Multigroup Decodable STBCs in Asymmetric MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800049"}
