Design/methodology/approach - A unique H-shape quasi-Z-source network is connected between the three-phase voltage source and traditional indirect matrix converter to achieve the voltage boost and buck in a single-stage power conversion. The complete space vector modulation (SVM) method is proposed to control the proposed QZSIMC. The output voltage amplitude of quasi-Z-source network can be boosted by the shoot-through of the front-end rectifier, so the whole system's voltage gain is extended. Meanwhile, the QZSIMC modeling and quasi-Z-source impedance parameter design are developed by using the state space averaging method. The design-oriented analysis based on small signal model is used to investigate the quasi-Z-source impedance parameter's impact on the QZSIMC's dynamic performance. A simulated application example employs a 4-kW induction motor drive to verify the proposed QZSIMC, the developed modulation method and parameter design method. Findings - The proposed QZSIMC can achieve high voltage gain larger than one and also can fulfill buck function, which widens the induction motor drive's operation range. The simulation results verify the proposed QZSIMC and SVM and also validate the quality performance of the proposed induction motor drive and all theoretical analysis and parameter design method. Originality/value - The proposed QZSIMC effectively overcomes the limitation of traditional indirect matrix converter, through extending the voltage gain larger than one. The systematic principle, analysis, parameter design, and simulation verification provide the proposed QZSIMC with a feasible approach in practical induction motor drive applications.", "paper_title": "Modeling, analysis, and motor drive application of quasi-Z-source indirect matrix converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500028"}
