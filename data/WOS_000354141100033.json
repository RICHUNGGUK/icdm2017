This is for instance the case for all scanning imaging methods. Data acquisition therefore requires high acquisition rates, together with an accurate synchronization between the probe control and the measurement. The GPScAN.VI program is a general purpose LabVIEW program for the control of National Instruments high-speed data acquisition boards, allowing to design scanning imaging systems. Analog output voltages are used to drive a two-dimensional scanning device, while acquisition of analog voltages and TTL pulse counting are run in parallel. Acquisition of megapixel images with pixel dwell times down to the microsecond can be reached with negligible I/O transfer time. The design can be generalized to any situation requiring high speed synchronous generation and acquisition.

Computer: Any machine running Lab VIEW 2010 or higher. Operating system: Windows XP or higher, OS X. RAM: 5 Mbytes Classification: 20. Nature of problem: A large number of measurement techniques involve the scanning of a probe, while a physical quantity is measured. This is, for instance, the case for all scanning imaging methods. Data acquisition therefore requires high acquisition rates, together with an accurate synchronization between the probe control and the measurement. Solution method: The GPScan.VI program allows the setting up of National Instruments multifunction acquisition boards, so that analog output voltage series (used to drive the scanner / probe) are generated, while analog input and counter acquisitions are run synchronously. Restrictions: Requires National Instruments high-speed multifunction boards, such as X Series or S Series, with at least two analog outputs, and a compatible NI-DAQmx driver installed. The program has been tested on X series boards, with Lab VIEW 2011, under Windows 7. Running time: Real time data acquisition. Scan rates, up to several millions of samples per second, depend on the specification of the board and may be limited by the response of the physical system used to perform the scanning.
