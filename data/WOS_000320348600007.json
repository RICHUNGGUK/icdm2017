Now taking into account typical properties of pervasive computing devices, which are weak computing power and stringent energy or power consumption limitations, lightweight solutions are a must. This especially holds true for all-in-silicon objects like radio frequency identification tags, or RFIDs. Many solutions in this area are called lightweight, but being lightweight requires conformance to quantitative requirements using certain metrics. A solution that adheres to such requirements is a new privacy enabling protocol for RFIDs that outperforms other architecturally similar protocols, and this presents the first contribution of this paper. Further, privacy is not only a matter of technical solutions, but increasingly so a matter of organizational processes. This fact calls for further addressing of supporting its formal treatment in business contexts. This paper provides a basis for formal addressing of privacy from business processes perspective, and this is its second main contribution. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
