It retransmits the packet using scheduled transmit antennas according to the state of the communication link, instead of retransmitting the packet via the same antennas. As a result, a combination of conventional HARQ systems, viz. chase combining (CC) and incremental redundancy (IR) are used to achieve better performance and lower redundancy. The proposed MIMO-OFDM HARQ system with antenna scheduling is shown to be superior to conventional MIMO HARQ systems, due to its spatial diversity gain.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for Iterative Detection and Decoding MIMO-OFDM HARQ with Antenna Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000270807100003"}
