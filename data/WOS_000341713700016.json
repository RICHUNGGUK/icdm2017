Olsen's wave energy converter (WEC) system Lifesaver with special focus on the stand-alone electrical system that is implemented for operation without grid-connection. Design/methodology/approach - The paper focus on the detailed design of the DC-Link system that drives the industrial 400VAC inverters and generators for the production system. The DC-Link is stabilized by an ultra capacitor bank and has no external source or grid-connection. Findings - The system has been tested through extensive sea trials since April 2012 and has proved its function. Some results from real sea testing are presented. Practical implications - This paper proves the viability of the specified design and may serve as a basis for the design if similar systems in the future. Originality/value - This paper presents a WEC system that has proven successful operation through practical tests, and is therefore regarded as a high-value paper as there is limited experience on this subject.", "paper_title": "Self-sustained all-electric wave energy converter system", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700016"}
