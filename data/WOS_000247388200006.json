The VC dimension is the size of the largest shattered subset. Under the binomial model of k-uniform random hypergraphs, the threshold function for the VC dimension to be larger than a given integer is obtained. The same is done for the testing dimension, which is the largest integer d such that all sets of cardinality d are shattered.
