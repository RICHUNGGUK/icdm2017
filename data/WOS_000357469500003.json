The controller design is formulated in terms of a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved by using a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, offering high likelihood of finding an optimal or near-optimal global solution. The process of tuning the controller minimizes differences between system outputs and optimal specifications given in terms of rising time, overshoot and steady-state error, and the controller succeed in fitting the performance requirements even considering parametric uncertainties and the nonlinearities of the aircraft. The stability of the controller is proved for the nominal case and its robustness is carefully verified by means of Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
