Despite radio technology diversity, a great deal of existing research focuses on a single and isolated wireless technology at a time, where homogeneous elements are identified by IP addresses. This work presents a heterogeneous technology routing (HTR) Framework, targeted towards scenarios where the heterogeneity of devices and networking technologies is present. Our contribution is many fold. It consists of a framework, which encompasses a process for bootstrapping networks, a routing protocol capable of dealing with multiple network interfaces, and a tuning with multipath extensions. We evaluate the performance of the bootstrap, routing and multipath mechanisms by way of simulation and an actual testbed implementation. The multipath evaluation simulates HTR networks with WiMAX, 3GPP LTE and Wi-Fi support. Results show that our proposal can effectively improve the data delivery ratio for ad-hoc networks and that it reduces the end-to-end delay without major impact on network energy consumption. As part of HTR tuning, we investigate next the impacts of tuning the HELLO refresh interval timer on route convergence and its subsequent energy consumption reduction during this phase. We also compare our tuned HTR with the widely used optimized link state routing protocol. Results show that varying the HELLO refresh interval can improve the convergence time and reduce the energy consumption without major impact on network behavior. Our proposal also includes a new distributed address allocation algorithm, namely, the dynamic node configuration protocol (DNCP). This paper conducts a comparative analysis between the Prime, Prophet and the DNCP schemes using static and dynamic topologies in terms of network setup time, energy consumption and control message overhead. Results show that the DNCP had a lower battery power consumption and less control message overhead while it slightly suffers with regard to setup.", "paper_title": "On the performance of heterogeneous MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300011"}
