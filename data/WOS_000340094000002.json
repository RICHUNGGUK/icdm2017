Recent advances have suggested that structured or group sparsity often leads to more powerful signal reconstruction techniques in various compressed sensing (CS) studies. In this paper, we propose a nonlocal low-rank regularization (NLR) approach toward exploiting structured sparsity and explore its application into CS of both photographic and MRI images. We also propose the use of a nonconvex log det(X) as a smooth surrogate function for the rank instead of the convex nuclear norm and justify the benefit of such a strategy using extensive experiments. To further improve the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we have developed a fast implementation using the alternative direction multiplier method technique. Experimental results have shown that the proposed NLR-CS algorithm can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art CS techniques for image recovery.", "paper_title": "Compressive Sensing via Nonlocal Low-Rank Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000340094000002"}
