The suggested service model uses context information to smartly control whether to execute a service of a flow or not. So, a service flow following the suggested service model can be automatically controlled according to context information from sensors around the agricultural environments. The proposed model supports a flow pattern to reutilise previous flows through an external reference in making a new smart service application. With the flow pattern, users can flexibly compose a smart service flow according to their intention, and can easily merge several small flows into a bigger or new workflow.", "paper_title": "Towards a smart service based on a context-aware workflow model in u-agriculture", "paper_id": "WOS:000292422800001"}
