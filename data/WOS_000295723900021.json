Since the reaction is equilibrium-limited, the use of reactive distillation is an attractive option. A new double-column system is suggested for ethyl-acetate production by applying reactive pressure swing batch distillation. The system was investigated by a feasibility study based on the analysis of reactive and non-reactive residue curve maps. Two different process options were found to be feasible. In the first option, the reactive column operates at the lower pressure (1.01 bar), and the non-reactive column that removes ethyl-acetate from the system operates at the higher pressure (10 bar). The second option allows the reactive column to operate at the higher pressure (10 bar), and the non-reactive column removes water at the lower pressure (1.01 bar). The first process option was studied by rigorous simulation based on less simplifying assumptions using a professional dynamic simulator. The influence of the most important operation parameters was also studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
