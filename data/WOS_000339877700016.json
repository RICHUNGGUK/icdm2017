How to manage P2P traffic efficiently, both to improve the efficiency of network and to protect the interests of P2P users, is widely concerned by industry and academia. Although some traffic planning scheme to the P2P apps such as P4P can alleviate the pressure on bandwidth resources to some extent, it requires deep cooperation between ISPs and P2P service providers. Therefore it has some limitations to independent DPI strategies. In addition, there is no flow planning strategies which can rapidly response to ISPs' QOS requirements such as sudden changes of bandwidth reservation and so on. This paper analyses current mainstream P2P optimization strategies, and then put forward a network resources dynamic allocation (NRDA) technology based on the deployment of P2P traffic stand on the ISPs' position. This technology enables ISPs to have the ability to manage the P2P traffic on the specified links independently and efficiently, especially for the rapid response of unexpected resource requirements. NRDA implements an overall planning of network resources and makes the network flexible, provides the resource planning ability to the ISPs.", "paper_title": "A research on dynamic allocation of network resources based on P2P traffic planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700016"}
