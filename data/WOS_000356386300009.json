Although many different types of contextual cues have been successfully explored, most of them only consider the pair-wise relationship between objects or parts. Several models utilize the high-order relationship for encoding contextual information. However, they mainly use a single contextual cue. In this paper, we present a novel high-order contextual descriptor (HOOD) to measure the strength of interactions among objects within an image. Heterogeneous contextual cues like semantic, spatial, and scale contexts are jointly integrated into HOOD to define the high-order interactions. The strength of these interactions are inferred by applying Bayes' rule on the pure dependence of the involved objects. As a result, an object-level graph is constructed to represent the contextually consistent interactions. Moreover, we propose a HOOD based object localization framework to verify the effectiveness of HOOD. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets including SUN09 and PASCAL2007 show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art context based object localization methods. Finally, we apply HOOD on two multimedia applications: structured image retrieval and out-of-context object detection, which demonstrates the potential usages of HOOD.", "paper_title": "An Object-Level High-Order Contextual Descriptor Based on Semantic, Spatial, and Scale Cues", "paper_id": "WOS:000356386300009"}
