A new iterative cross-entropy scheme, based on the idea of the EM method, is proposed to overcome the challenge of deciding the optimal weights for each mode in the mixture. Detailed studies of this new algorithm and its applications to the estimation of rainbow option prices are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Entropy Scheme for Mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000350075000006"}
