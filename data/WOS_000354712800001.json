Among three subtypes (alpha, gamma and delta), we here consider the least investigated delta subtype to explore the molecular fingerprints of selective PPAR delta agonists. Validated QSAR models (regression based 2D-QSAR, HQSAR and KPLS) and molecular docking with dynamics analyses support the inference of classification-based Bayesian and recursive models. Chemometric studies indicate that the presence of ether linkages and heterocyclic rings has optimum influence in imparting selective bioactivity. Pharmacophore models and docking with molecular dynamics analyses postulate the occurrence of aromatic rings, HB acceptor and a hydrophobic region as crucial molecular fragments for development of PPAR delta modulators. Multi-chemometric studies suggest the essential structural requirements of a molecule for imparting potent and selective PPAR delta modulation.", "paper_title": "Exploring molecular fingerprints of selective PPAR delta agonists through comparative and validated chemometric techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000354712800001"}
