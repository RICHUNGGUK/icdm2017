Various relaying protocols and broadcasting strategies are studied. The main focus of this work is on simple relay transmission scheduling schemes. For decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, the simple relay cannot buffer multiple packets, nor can it reschedule re-transmissions. This gives rise to consideration of other relaying techniques, such as amplify-and-forward (AF), where a maximal broadcasting achievable rate is analytically derived. A quantize-and-forward (QF) relay, coupled with a single-level code at the source, uses codebooks; matched to the received signal power and performs optimal quantization. This is simplified by a hybrid amplify-QF (AQF) relay, which performs scaling, and single codebook quantization on the input. It is shown that the latter is optimal by means of throughput on the relay-destination link, while maintaining a lower coding complexity than the QF setting. A further extension of the AQF allows the relay to perform successive refinement, coupled with a matched multilevel code. Numerical results show that for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the broadcast approach over AF relay may achieve higher throughput gains than other relaying protocols that are numerically tractable.", "paper_title": "Single-user broadcasting protocols over a two-hop relay fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700006"}
