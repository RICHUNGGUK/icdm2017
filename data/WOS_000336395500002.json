In this paper, we present a review of MDC techniques based on their application domain and we explain their functionality, with the objective of giving enough insight to designers to decide which MDC scheme is best suited for their specific application based on requirements such as standard compatibility, redundancy tunability, complexity, and extendibility to n-description coding. The focus is mainly on video sources but image-based algorithms applicable to video are considered as well. We also cover the well-known and important problem of drift and solutions to avoid it.", "paper_title": "A review of multiple description coding techniques for error-resilient video delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000336395500002"}
