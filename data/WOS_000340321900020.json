Presence of fluorine atom gives rise to the alterations in the electronic profile and the pK(a) of molecules which results in mechanistic deviations. The fluorine-substituted mechanism-based substrate analogs are widely used in the inactivation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. The presence of fluorine atom also alters the sequence of reactions taking place in PLP-dependent enzymes where the HF elimination reaction appears in between the transimination and inactivation reactions. Despite the amount of the works on beta-fluoroamines, the effect of stereoelectronic differences on the transimination and HF elimination reactions taking place in PLP-dependent enzymes has not been investigated yet. A density functional theory study is conducted to elucidate mechanistic details of the reactions occurring in PLP-dependent enzymes. In order to understand the mechanistic insights of different isomers and the effect of the fluorine atom, 4-amino-3-fluorobutanoic acid (3-F-GABA) enantiomers are chosen to be investigated besides 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA), which is the natural substrate for gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT). The investigated beta-fluoroamines are the experimentally proposed potential inhibitors of PLP-dependent enzyme GABA-AT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
