Many of its properties have already been discovered: for instance, the minimal entanglement, as well as the minimal cardinality of the output sets, have been characterized. This paper contains two main results. First, we prove that no bipartite pseudo-telepathy game exists, in which one of the partners receives only two questions; as a corollary, we show that the minimal \"input cardinality\", that is, the minimal number of questions required in a bipartite pseudo-telepathy game, is 3 x 3. Second, we study the Bell-type inequality derived from the pseudo-telepathy game known as the Magic Square game: we demonstrate that it is a tight inequality for 3 inputs and 4 outputs on each side and discuss its weak resistance to noise.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-telepathy: input cardinality and bell-type inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175600005"}
