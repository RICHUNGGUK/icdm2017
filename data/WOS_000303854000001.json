The scheduling problem in heterogeneous environments is NP-hard, so a significant effort has been made to develop efficient methods for solving the problem. However, few works have faced realistic grid-sized problem instances. This work presents a parallel CHC (pCHC) evolutionary algorithm codified over MALLBA, a general-purpose library for combinatorial optimization, for solving the scheduling problem in HC and grid environments. Efficient numerical results are reported in the experimental analysis performed on both a standard benchmark and a set of large-sized problem instances specially designed in this work. The comparative study shows that pCHC is able to achieve high problem solving efficacy, significantly improving over traditional deterministic scheduling methods, while also showing a good scalability behavior when solving large problem instances.", "paper_title": "SCHEDULING IN HETEROGENEOUS COMPUTING AND GRID ENVIRONMENTS USING A PARALLEL CHC EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000303854000001"}
