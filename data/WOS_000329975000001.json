In this paper, we propose the notion of (orientated) lower concept formula (for short, lcf) of relational information systems and study the order-theoretic properties of the derived lcf systems. Particularly, we show that every orientated lcf system is an algebraic lattice and conversely every algebraic lattice is order-isomorphic to the orientated lcf system of an appropriate relational information system. Moreover, we obtain the one-to-one correspondence between approximable mappings and Scott continuous functions. In addition, we investigate the connection between the orientated lcf systems on the relational information systems and the topped -structures on the lower concept lattices. Our results demonstrate the power of Rough Set Theory in studying domain structures.", "paper_title": "On the order-theoretic properties of lower concept formula systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329975000001"}
