The environments are called ubiquitous computing environments. To realize the environments, it is important to reduce the cost to develop ubiquitous computing applications by encapsulating complex issues in middleware infrastructures that are shared by various applications. However, we have not enough experiences with how to build middleware infrastructures for ubiquitous computing, and it is important to share knowledge among research communities. In this paper, we present three middleware infrastructures for ubiquitous computing, that have been developed in our research group. These middleware infrastructures hide various complexities such as context-awareness and distribution to make it easy to develop ubiquitous computing applications. We describe design issues and overviews of the middleware infrastructures, and show some lessons learned during the development of the middleware infrastructures.", "paper_title": "Software infrastructures for building ubiquitous computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000250066400007"}
