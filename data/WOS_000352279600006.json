The main applications of these types of associative memory can be found in fuzzy rule-based systems. In contrast, T-fuzzy associative memories (T-FAMs) represent parametrized fuzzy neural networks with a hidden layer and these FAM models extend (dual) S-FAMs and SM-FAMs based on fuzzy subsethood and similarity measures. In this paper, we provide theoretical results concerning the storage capacity and error correction capability of T-FAMs. In addition, we introduce a training algorithm for T-FAMs and we compare the error rates produced by T-FAMs and some well-known classifiers in some benchmark classification problems that are available on the internet. Finally, we apply T-FAMs to a problem of vision-based self-localization in mobile robotics.", "paper_title": "Theta-Fuzzy Associative Memories (Theta-FAMs)", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600006"}
