Several MD computational techniques are integrated with the conventional MD scheme to enable the adjustment of the dot density in specific regions of the light guide in order to create a dot distribution with a high dot density variation and a high spatial uniformity. These techniques include the cell division technique, the variable r-cut technique, the boundary smoothing technique and the reflective boundary condition. The reflective boundary condition enables a precise control of the dot density within each cell, and is instrumental in achieving a dot distribution with both a high dot density variation and a high spatial uniformity. The performance of the proposed dot generation scheme is verified by considering the practical example of the dot pattern design of a light guide with a single LED light source located in the lower-right corner. The numerical results confirm the ability of the proposed method to achieve an even luminance condition by establishing a dot pattern whose density increases concentrically with an increasing distance from the light source.
