More precisely, sampled-data information is exchanged according to a unified sampling sequence instead of continuous-time communication, which is more reliable and practical in the applications. Additionally, the proposed strategy can be capable of both uniform and non-uniform sampling periods. Furthermore, from the energy point of view, potential benefit can be provided to reduce the communication energy consumption. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the synchronization can be achieved in the scenarios with fixed and switching topologies. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
