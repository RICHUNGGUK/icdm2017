We prove the following generalization of the Erdos-Szekeres theorem. For any k, any sufficiently large set P of points in general position contains k points, p(1),p(2),...,p(k), that form either a k-cap or a k-cup, and there is no point of P vertically above the polygonal line p(1)p(2)center dot center dot center dot p(k). We give double-exponential lower and upper bounds on the minimal size of P.
