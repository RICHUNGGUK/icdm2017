The way these data are manipulated by the sensor nodes is a fundamental issue. Information fusion arises as a response to process data gathered by sensor nodes and benefits from their processing capability. By exploiting the synergy among the available data, information fusion techniques can reduce the amount of data traffic, filter noisy measurements, and make predictions and inferences about a monitored entity. In this work, we survey the current state-of-the-art of information fusion by presenting the known methods, algorithms, architectures, and models of information fusion, and discuss their applicability in the context of wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Information fusion for wireless sensor networks: Methods, models, and classifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249658500003"}
