The ANFIS is divided into a nonlinear antecedent part and a linear consequent part; and the consequent part is replaced with the FLNN to enhance the nonlinear approximation ability of the method. An adaptive filtering algorithm adjusts the parameters of the fuzzy inference and neural network. Verification of the method showed that it was effective in removing EOG and EMG artifacts from an EEG. A comparison showed that this method provided better performance than an ANFIS, an RBF-ANFIS, or an adaptive FL-BPNN. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
