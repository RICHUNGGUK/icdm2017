The Delta Sigma-CSP uses 1-bit processing which is a new concept in digital control to remove multi-bit multiplications. A simple conditional-negate-and-add (CNA) unit is proposed for most operations of control laws. For this reason, the targeted processor is small and very fast, making it ideal for embedded real-time control applications. The Delta Sigma-CSP has been implemented as a VLSI hard macro in a high-performance 0.13/mu m silicon process. Results show that it compares very favorably to other digital processors in terms of area and clock frequency.", "paper_title": "A novel processor architecture for real-time control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500021"}
