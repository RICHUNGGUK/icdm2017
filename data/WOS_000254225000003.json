Among them, locality preserving projection (LPP) is one of the most promising feature extraction techniques. However, when LPP is applied to the classification tasks, it shows some limitations, such as the ignorance of the label information. In this paper, we propose a novel local structure based feature extraction method, called class-wise locality preserving projection (CLPP). CLPP utilizes class information to guide the procedure of feature extraction. In CLPP, the local structure of the original data is constructed according to a certain kind of similarity between data points, which takes special consideration of both the local information and the class information. The kernelized (nonlinear) Counterpart of this linear feature extractor is also established in the paper. Moreover, a kernel version of CLPP namely Kernel CLPP (KCLPP) is developed through applying the kernel trick to CLPP to increase its performance on nonlinear feature extraction. Experiments on ORL face database and YALE face database are performed to test and evaluate the proposed algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
