Computer-assisted procedures have been proposed to measure the calibre of retinal blood vessels from high-resolution photopraphs. Most of them are in fact semi-automatic. Our objective in this paper is twofold, to develop a totally automated system to classify retinal vessels into arteries and veins and to compare the measurements of the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR) computed from the system with those computed from observers. Our classification method consists of four steps. First, we obtain the vascular tree structure using a segmentation algorithm. Then, we extract the profiles. After that, we select the best feature vectors to distinguish between veins and arteries. Finally, we use a clustering algorithm to classify each detected vessel as an artery or a vein. Our results show that compared with an observer-based method, our method achieves high sensitivity and specificity in the automated detection of retinal arteries and veins. In addition the system is robust enough independently of the radii finally chosen, which makes it more trustworthy in its clinical application. We conclude that the system represents an automatic method of detecting arteries and veins to measure the calibre of retinal microcirculation across digital pictures of the eye fundus.
