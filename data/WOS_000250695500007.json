This paper outlines an automatic computer vision-based approach for the detection and differential spraying of weeds in corn crops. The method is designed for post-emergence herbicide applications where weeds and corn plants display similar spectral signatures and the weeds appear irregularly distributed within the crop's field. The proposed strategy involves two processes: image segmentation and decision making. Image segmentation combines basic suitable image processing techniques in order to extract cells from the image as the low level units. Each cell is described by two area-based measuring relationships between crop and weeds. The decision making determines the cells to be sprayed based on the computation of a posterior probability under a Bayesian framework. The a priori probability in this framework is computed taking into account the dynamic of the physical system (tractor) where the method is embedded. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the combination of the image segmentation and decision making processes and (2) the decision making itself which exploits a previous knowledge which is mapped as the a priori probability. The performance of the method is illustrated by comparative analysis against some existing strategies. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
