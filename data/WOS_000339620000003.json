Design/methodology/approach - For this, the paper proposes an optimization framework based on software component, web service, and plugin to exploit these models in different environments. Findings - The paper illustrates the discussion with optimizations in Matlab (TM) and R (www.r-project.org) of a transformer described and exploitable from the internet. Originality/value - The originality is to make easy implementation of simulation model and optimization algorithm coupling using software component, web service, and plugin.", "paper_title": "Framework for the optimization of online computable models", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000003"}
