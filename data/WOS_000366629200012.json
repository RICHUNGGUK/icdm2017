All three complexes, especially Li(N3H3), were found to have large first hyperpolarizabilities (beta(0)). Meanwhile, Li(N3H3) and Li(N3H3) Li' exhibited electride and alkalide characteristics, respectively. The dependance of electric properties of alkalide Li(N3H3) Li' on the alkali atoms involved and the complexant layer number were revealed by investigating the related M(N3H3)Li' and Li(N3H3)M' (M = Na and K), and Li(N3H3)(n)Li' (n=2, 3) systems. Note that the beta(0) value of alkalide M(N3H3) M' increased not only with the increasing atomic number of the M'(-) anion but also with that of the M+ cation, which differs from previously reported cases. In addition, the electric properties of the Li(N3H3) Li' alkalide were enhanced by increasing the complexant layers. However, it was found that both the complexant-complexant and the complexant-Li' interactions reduced with the addition of N3H3 layers, so no stable structures were found for larger Li(N3H3)(n)Li' complexes.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study on alkali-metal doped N3H3 complexes: an in-depth understanding of the origin of electride and alkalide and their large nonlinear optical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000366629200012"}
