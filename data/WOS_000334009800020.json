Two-dimensional picture array languages is one such area in which different kinds of P systems have been constructed for picture array generation. Incorporating the feature of permitting symbols in the rules, a new variety of array P system is constructed here for generating picture languages consisting of picture arrays. The advantage of this approach is that there is a reduction in the number of membranes used in the construction, in comparison to the existing array P system models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
