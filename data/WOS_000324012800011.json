This paper introduces an efficient privacy-preserving protocol with confidentiality for Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) based on group sign-cryption. The proposed protocol featured with the following characteristics: Firstly, it offers conditional anonymous authentication: a message issuer can authenticate itself anonymously on behalf of a group of potential signers while only a trusted authority can reveal the true identity of a message sender. Secondly, it provides confidential: the secrecy of the communication content can be protected. Thirdly, it is efficient: it achieves low storage requirements, fast message verification and cost-effective identity tracking in case of a dispute. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
