In this letter, a sufficient and necessary condition for a set of FHSs with optimal AHC is given. Based on interleaved technique, a new construction for optimal ARC FHS sets is also proposed, which generalizes the construction of Chung and Yang. Several optimal AHC FHS sets with more flexible parameters not covered in the literature are obtained by the new construction, which are summarized in Table 1.", "paper_title": "On the Average Hamming Correlation of Frequency Hopping Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738600033"}
