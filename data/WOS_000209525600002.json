We modify the method of estimation in Fligner and Verducci's (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 83(403)(1988), 892-901) multistage model for rankings, from maximum likelihood of conditional agreement over a sample of rankings to a locally smoothed estimator of agreement. Through simulations we show that this modification performs very well under several conditions. We apply our technique as a stopping rule to supplement the tau-path algorithm, developed by Yu et al. (Statistical Methodology 8(2011), 97-111), in an analysis of associations between gene expression and compound potency in cancer data, and discuss some ramifications as planned extensions.
