In this paper, an existing interactive model is introduced and then improved in order to better characterize the way a virus spreads in email networks with different topologies. The model is used to demonstrate the effects of a number of key factors, notably nodes' degree and betweenness. Experiments are then performed to examine how the structure of a network and human dynamics affects virus propagation. The experimental results have revealed that a virus spreads in two distinct phases and shown that the most efficient immunization strategy is the node-betweenness strategy. Moreover, those results have also explained why old virus can survive in networks nowadays from the aspects of human dynamics.", "paper_title": "Network immunization and virus propagation in email networks: experimental evaluation and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000289562400005"}
