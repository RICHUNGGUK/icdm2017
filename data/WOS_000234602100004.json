For two arbitrary points of G, we can compare the length of the shortest path in G connecting them against their Euclidean distance. The supremum of all these ratios is called the geometric dilation of G. Given a finite point set, we would like to know the smallest possible dilation of any graph that contains the given points. In this paper we prove that a dilation of 1.678 is always sufficient, and that pi/2 = 1.570... is sometimes necessary in order to accommodate a finite set of points.", "paper_title": "The geometric dilation of finite point sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000234602100004"}
