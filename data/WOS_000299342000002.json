Many analytic techniques for networks require finding low-cost paths, but exact methods for search become prohibitive for large networks, and data sets are steadily increasing in size. Short paths can be found efficiently by utilizing an index of network structure, which estimates network distances and enables rapid discovery of short paths. Through experiments on synthetic networks, we demonstrate that one such novel network structure index based on the shortest-path tree outperforms other previously proposed indices. We also show that it generalizes across arbitrarily weighted networks of various structures and densities, provides accurate estimates of distance, and has efficient time and space complexity. We present results on real data sets for several applications, including navigation, diameter estimation, centrality computation, and clustering-all made efficient by virtue of the network structure index.", "paper_title": "Indexing Network Structure with Shortest-Path Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000299342000002"}
