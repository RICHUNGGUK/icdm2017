OSGi is constructed to provide a service platform with high application interoperability while OpenCV is used to provide many application programming interfaces (APIs) about image processing. In this paper, we design a recognition assisted surveillance system based on OSGi and OpenCV platforms. The system features dynamic monitoring by a camera carried by a robot and a Java 2 Micro-Edition (J2ME) viewer on a mobile phone. With the assistance of image recognition techniques, the captured frames are adaptively reproduced for handheld phones in a limited bandwidth environment. The proposed adaptive pause time control mechanism can efficiently improve the synchronization relationship between captured and viewed frames across heterogeneous networks. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can save power for the moveable camera and have a shorter time delay between the captured and viewed frames. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
