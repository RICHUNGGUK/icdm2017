The main two reasons behind this decoupling are the absence of certain specific applied subjects and a lack of knowledge regarding updated technological innovations that are already introduced in the business world. The PAVEs programme (Profesores Asociados Vinculados a Empresa, Adjunct Enterprise Professors) of the University of Valladolid offers an improvement in the preparation of engineers, representing an effective solution to the exposed problems. It complements engineering curricula including industry-driven knowledge imparted by industry professionals. Many years of research and implementation experiences of the PAVEs program approve a methodology that works and enhances the performance of engineering students. The obtained results show that both students and companies participating are highly satisfied with the experience.", "paper_title": "Improving teaching in engineering education: adjunct enterprise professors programme", "paper_id": "WOS:000319363100008"}
