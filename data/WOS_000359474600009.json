However, understanding content browsing behavior in uncontrolled environments is still challenging because human gaze can be very complex; it is affected not only by viewers' states but also by the spatio-semantic structures of visual content. This study proposes a novel gaze analysis framework which introduces the content creators' point of view to understand the meaning of browsing behavior. Visual content such as web pages, digital articles and catalogs are comprised of structures intentionally designed by content creators, which we refer to as designed structure. This paper focuses on two design factors of designed structure: spatial structure of content elements (content layout), and their relationships such as \"being in the same group\". The framework was evaluated with an experiment involving 12 participants, wherein the participant's state was estimated from their gaze behavior. The results from the experiment show that the use of design structure improved estimation accuracies of user states compared to other baseline methods.", "paper_title": "Using Designed Structure of Visual Content to Understand Content-Browsing Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600009"}
