In order to accomplish a common goal, the agents have to complement the partial \"view\" they have of the environment. The results obtained prove that the agents are capable of cooperating and coordinating their actions in order to carry out a navigation task. A preliminary analysis of the mechanisms underlying the group behaviour is provided.", "paper_title": "Evolved homogeneous neuro-controllers for robots with different sensory capabilities: Coordinated motion and cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300056"}
