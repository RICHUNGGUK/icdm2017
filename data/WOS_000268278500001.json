Clinical data, including chemistry analysis data and electrocardiogram (ECG) data for heartbeat behavior, are commonly used to classify the cardiovascular diseases in supporting medical diagnosis. This study proposes a new approach for enhancing rough set classifier which applied to diagnose cardiovascular disease. Two datasets were used in this empirical case study to illustrate the proposed approach. Due to its improved accuracy and fewer rules, the proposed approach is superior to listing methods.", "paper_title": "DIAGNOSING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE USING AN ENHANCED ROUGH SETS APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000268278500001"}
