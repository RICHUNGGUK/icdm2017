Although least-squares cross-validation is considered to be the best criterion for bandwidth selection of the kernel estimator of the conditional density, the number of computations required for this procedure grows exponentially as the number of observations increases. A fast algorithm is proposed to reduce this computational cost, and its accuracy and efficiency are verified via numerical experiments. A practical application is also presented to demonstrate the algorithm's potential usefulness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
