In this paper, we resolve the trade-off problem between control performance and power consumption in a real-time embedded control system with a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) uniprocessor implementing multiple control tasks. We formulate an optimization problem whose cost function depends on both the control performance and the power consumption. We introduce an adapter into the real-time embedded control system that adaptively assigns deadlines of jobs and clock frequencies according to the plant's stability and schedulability by solving the optimization problem. In numerical simulations, we show that the proposed adapter can reduce the power consumption while maintaining the control performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Assignment of Deadline and Clock Frequency in Real-Time Embedded Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100034"}
