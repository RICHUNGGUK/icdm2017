Therefore, accurate detection of intrusion is very essential to secure information in computer and network systems of any organization such as private, public, and government. Several intrusion detection approaches are available but the main problem is their performance, which can be enhanced by increasing the detection rates and reducing false positives. This issue of the existing techniques is the focus of research in this paper. The poor performance of such techniques is due to raw dataset which confuse the classifier and results inaccurate detection due to redundant features. The recent approaches used principal component analysis (PCA) for feature subset selection which is based on highest eigenvalues, but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier due to ignoring many sensitive features. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues such as PCA, this research applied a genetic algorithm to search the genetic principal components that offers a subset of features with optimal sensitivity and the highest discriminatory power. The support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification purpose. This research work used the knowledge discovery and data mining cup dataset for experimentation. The performance of this approach was analyzed and compared with existing approaches. The results show that proposed method enhances SVM performance in intrusion detection that outperforms the existing approaches and has the capability to minimize the number of features and maximize the detection rates.", "paper_title": "Enhancing SVM performance in intrusion detection using optimal feature subset selection based on genetic principal components", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900018"}
