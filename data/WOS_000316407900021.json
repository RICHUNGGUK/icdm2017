In particular, we study the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution, P(Z(n) <= z), where {Z(n)} is the Bhattacharyya process associated with W, and its dependence on the rate of transmission. On the basis of this result, we characterize the asymptotic behavior, as well as its dependence on the rate, of the block error probability of polar codes using the successive cancellation decoder. This refines the original asymptotic bounds by Arikan and Telatar. Our results apply to general polar codes based on l x l kernel matrices. We also provide asymptotic lower bounds on the block error probability of polar codes using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder. The MAP lower bound and the successive cancellation upper bound coincide when l = 2, but there is a gap for l > 2.", "paper_title": "Rate-Dependent Analysis of the Asymptotic Behavior of Channel Polarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900021"}
