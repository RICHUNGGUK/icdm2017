A new interconnection network called exchanged crossed cube (ECQ) is proposed and analyzed in this paper. We prove that ECQ has the better properties than other variations of the basic hypercube in terms of the smaller diameter, fewer links, and lower cost factor, which indicates the reduced communication overhead, lower hardware cost, and more balanced consideration among performance and cost. Furthermore, it maintains several attractive advantages including recursive structure, high partitionability, and strong connectivity. Furthermore, the optimal routing and broadcasting algorithms are proposed for this new network topology.", "paper_title": "Exchanged Crossed Cube: A Novel Interconnection Network for Parallel Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000325170700010"}
