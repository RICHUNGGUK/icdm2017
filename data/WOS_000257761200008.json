The proposed dBB84 protocol is then extended to be a deterministic secure quantum communication (DSQC) protocol wherein the sender can securely transmit secret messages to the receiver via quantum channels and the receiver can read out the secret messages only after receiving an additional classical bit for each qubit from the sender. In contrast to the existing single-photon-based secure communication protocols, which require the sender to either prepare two-qubit photon states or to establish two-way quantum channels with the receiver, the newly proposed protocol requires the sender to prepare single-qubit photon states for message transmissions and only set up one-way quantum channels to the receiver. Therefore, the proposed protocol is very suitable and feasible in practical applications.", "paper_title": "Secure direct communication using deterministic BB84 protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761200008"}
