The security and resilience of such cyberdefense systems are paramount, since an attacker will try to evade them or render them unusable before attacking the end systems. In this paper, we introduce a system model for IDN nodes in terms of their logical components, functions, and communication channels. This allows us to model different IDN node roles (e.g., detectors, filters, aggregators, correlators, etc.) and architectures (e.g., hierarchical, centralized, fully distributed, etc.). We then introduce a threat model that considers adversarial actions executed against particular IDN nodes, and also the propagation of such actions throughout connected nodes. Based on such models, we finally introduce a countermeasure allocation model based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain optimal allocation strategies that minimize both risk and cost. Our experimental results obtained through simulation with different IDN architectures illustrate the benefit of our framework to design and reconfigure cyberdefense systems optimally.
