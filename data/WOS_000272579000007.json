Model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Exact integrals of risk functions and tissue kinetics transition times were derived. Agreement with previously published results was excellent including: (a) maximum likelihood values within one log-likelihood unit of previous results and improvements by re-optimization: (b) mean predicted DCS incidents within 1.4% of. observed DCS; and (c) time of DCS occurrence prediction. Alternative optimization and homogeneous parallel processing techniques yielded faster model optimization times. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
