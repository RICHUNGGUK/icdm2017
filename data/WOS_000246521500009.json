In the deterministic approach, an interdisciplinary ship design method integrates principal dimension decisions and hull form variations in the preliminary ship design stage. Integrated ship design, as presented in this paper, has the distinctive feature that these parameters are evaluated simultaneously. Conversely, in sequential design, which is based on the traditional preliminary ship design process, hull form designs and principal dimension decisions are determined separately and sequentially. The current study adopts the first method to enhance the design quality in the early design stage. Furthermore, a probabilistic approach is applied to ship design to resolve uncertainties in design information more efficiently than a deterministic approach would.", "paper_title": "A study on the preliminary ship design method using deterministic approach and probabilistic approach including hull form", "paper_id": "WOS:000246521500009"}
