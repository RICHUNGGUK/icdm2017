At the transport layer of I-PEPs, the Space Communications Protocols Standards-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP) provides a reliable connection to upper layers, although resulting in very poor performance in tests. In fact, standard congestion-control mechanisms underperform mainly due to long latency and Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) access schemes, especially in the case of short transfers, as for Web traffic, when optimum window may not be reached. In this paper, a burst-based TCP, named TCP Noordwijk (TCPN), is introduced to improve on these aspects. To evaluate performance, the protocol has been implemented on the Network Simulator NS-2. Definitively, details on the protocol design, implementation, and a vast gamut of results coming from simulations are reported.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Performance Evaluation of a Burst-Based TCP for Satellite DVB RCS Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000278813900018"}
