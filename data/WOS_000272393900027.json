With MMICs reliability improved, GaAs MMICs failure rates will reach levels which are impractical to measure with conventional methods in the near future. This letter proposes a methodology to predict the GaAs MMICs reliability by combining empirical and statistical methods based on zero-failure GaAs MMICs life testing data. Besides, we investigate the effect of accelerated factors on MMICs degradation and make a comparison between the Weibull and lognormal distributions. The method has been used in the reliability evaluation of GaAs MMICs successfully.", "paper_title": "Empirical-Statistics Analysis for Zero-Failure GaAs MMICs Life Testing Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000272393900027"}
