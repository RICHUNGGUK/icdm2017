Two well-known controllers are designed, namely a conventional damping controller (CDC) and fuzzy logic damping controller (FLDC). These 2 damping controllers are added to a main control loop of a SSSC operating as a SSR damping controller. It should be noted that, to optimize the parameters of the CDC, a versatile optimization technique is implemented, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO). A comprehensive comparison between the 2 control methods is carried out for different operational conditions. To observe the superior performance of the proposed FLDC, many operating points and different fault types are considered. The IEEE second benchmark model aggregated with the SSSC is utilized and simulations are presented.", "paper_title": "SSR mitigation with SSSC thanks to fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000326514200014"}
