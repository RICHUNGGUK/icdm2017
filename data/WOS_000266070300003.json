This software uses the SIMULINK library of MATLAB which has shown to be a good choice to implement and solve the implicated equations. The model allows us to achieve the vehicle's performances with enough accuracy and to modify the parameters than influence on these performances quickly and easily in order to understand the physic phenomena involved.
