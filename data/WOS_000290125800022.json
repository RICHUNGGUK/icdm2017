Moreover, conventional image stitching algorithms cannot be directly applied to a real-time video stitching due to its complexity and waving artifacts. In this paper, we propose a real-time content-aware stitching algorithm which not only finds a seam by using path searching based on the greedy method, but also adaptively updates the seam by detecting objects moving toward the seam. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully produce stitched video sequences without the waving and ghost artifacts commonly found in conventional stitching algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Novel Content-Aware Stitching Algorithm for Real-Time Video Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125800022"}
