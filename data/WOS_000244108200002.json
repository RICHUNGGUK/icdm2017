To obtain the steady periodic state one usually solves the dynamical system obtained after the spatial coordinates have been discretized. Here, we calculate the steady periodic state using an implicit method based on the discretization of the time coordinate over a period and the asymptotic regime is enforced by the periodicity condition in the computed temperature field. The obtained system of equations is solved using a Newton-type iterative algorithm with invariant Jacobian. At each iteration step, the sparse linearized system is solved using a multi-grid algebraic technique of rapid convergence. From a computational point of view and for the problem considered here, this method is an order of magnitude faster than the one based on a spatial discretization.
