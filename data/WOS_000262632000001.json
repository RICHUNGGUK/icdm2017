Many results have been reported using a variety of approaches and techniques. However, much of the focus has been laid on the use of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory to derive sufficient stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The purpose of this article is to survey the recent results developed to analyse the asymptotic stability of time-delay systems. Both delay-independent and delay-dependent results are reported in the article. Special emphases are given to the issues of conservatism of the results and computational complexity. Connections of certain delay-dependent stability results are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A survey of linear matrix inequality techniques in stability analysis of delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632000001"}
