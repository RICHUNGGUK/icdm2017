A related problem is to find one of the curves given a measure of similarity and another curve. Given a set of points S, a polygonal curve P. and an epsilon > 0, the discrete set-chain matching problem is to find another polygonal curve Q such that the nodes of Q are points in S and d(F)(P, Q) <= epsilon. Here, d(F) is the discrete Frechet distance between the two polygonal curves. For the first time we study the set-chain matching problem based on the discrete Frechet distance rather than the continuous Frechet distance. We further extend the problem based on unique or non-unique nodes and on limiting the number of points used. We prove that three of the variations of the set-chain matching problem are NP-complete. For the version of the problem that is polynomial, we give an O(vertical bar P vertical bar vertical bar S vertical bar) time greedy solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
