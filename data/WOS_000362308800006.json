Consequently, there is a great need to reconcile the mixed findings obtained so far. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, we hypothesize that the effect of community participation may be contingent on participators' goal-pursuit focus (prevention or promotion). Our analysis of customer blog data in a company-sponsored community together with transactional data of the same company demonstrated that deep community participation among promotion-focused customers significantly increases purchase frequency; however, deep participation has a very different effect among prevention-focused customers.
