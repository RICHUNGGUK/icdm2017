Therefore, it is critical to have a good understanding of the TCP dynamics over WLANs. In this paper, we conduct rigorous and comprehensive modeling and analysis of the TCP performance over the emerging 802.11e WLANs, or more specifically, the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) WLANs. We investigate the effects of minimum contention window sizes and transmission opportunity (TXOP) limits (of both the AP and stations) on the aggregate TCP throughput via analytical and simulation studies. We show that the best aggregate TCP throughput performance can be achieved via AP's contention-free access for downlink packet transmissions and the TXOP mechanism. We also study the effects of some simplifying assumptions used in our analytical model, and simulation results show that our model is reasonably accurate, particularly, when the wireline delay is small and/or the packet loss rate is low.", "paper_title": "Analytical Study of TCP Performance over IEEE 802.11e WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000268070200008"}
