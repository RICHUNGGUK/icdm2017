In this paper, we pro. pose an idea, one whereby these problems are avoided: Instead of physical system or sensor parameters, a vector corresponding to the failure probabilities of the system's sensors (which of course are bounded within the unit hypercube) is tracked. With the help of a system diagnosis model the corresponding fault signatures can be identified as terminal states for these probability vectors. To perform tracking, Kalman filters and interacting multiple-model estimators are implemented for each sensor. The work that has been completed thus far shows promising results in both large-scale and small-scale systems, with the impending failures being detected quickly and the prediction of the time until this failure occurs being determined accurately.", "paper_title": "Predicting time to failure using the IMM and excitable tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000249024900004"}
