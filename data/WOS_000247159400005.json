Similarity searching over complex data is much more expensive than searching over simple data. Moreover, comparison operations over complex data usually consider features extracted from each element, instead of the elements themselves. Thus, even if an algorithm retrieves an exact answer, it is 'exact' regarding the extracted features, not regarding the original elements themselves. Therefore, trading exact answering with query time response can be worthwhile. In this work we developed two search strategies based on genetic algorithms to allow retrieving approximate data indexed by Metric Access Methods (MAM) within a limited, user-defined, amount of time. These strategies allow implementing algorithms to answer both range and k-nearest neighbor queries, and allow also to estimate the precision obtained for the approximate answer. Experimental evaluation shows that very good results (corresponding to what the user would expect) can be obtained in a fraction of the time required to obtain the exact answer.
