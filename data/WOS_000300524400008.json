Analysis of 347 usable responses shows that players' network centrality has a negative impact on their ties to players who belong to other guilds (i.e., non-guild interaction), but a positive effect on players' access to resources. However, players' network centrality fails to increase their perceived game enjoyment directly. Players' resource accessibility and perceived game enjoyment play mediating roles in the relationship between network centrality and attitude toward playing an MMOG, which in turn influences game continuance intention. The results also show that although players' non-guild interaction is negatively related to their resource accessibility from the networks, it is positively associated with perceived game enjoyment. The article concludes with implications and limitations of the study. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
