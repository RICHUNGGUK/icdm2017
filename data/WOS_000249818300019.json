This new tool has been devised specifically to address the problem of the simultaneous analysis of a large number of viral strains. The multiple alignment is embedded in a graph that can be explored at different levels of resolution. Availability: The Alvira software is available at: http://bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr/Alvira Contact: fenault@toulouse.inra.fr Supplementary information: A tutorial is available at Alvira's homepage.", "paper_title": "Alvira: comparative genomics of viral strains", "paper_id": "WOS:000249818300019"}
