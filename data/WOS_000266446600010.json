We propose the notion of iota-twin-roots (x, y) of an iota-symmetric word w. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the iota-twin-roots of ail iota-symmetric word, and show that the left factor alpha and right factor beta of any factorization of w as w = alpha beta = iota(beta alpha), can be expressed in terms of the iota-twin-roots of w. In addition, we show that for any involution iota, the catenation of the iota-twin-roots of w equals the primitive root of w. We also provide several characterizations of the iota-twin-rots of a word, for iota being a morphic or antimorphic involution. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
