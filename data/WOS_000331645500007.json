In this paper we study 2-layer drawings where any two crossing edges meet at right angle. We characterize the graphs that admit this type of drawing, provide linear-time testing and embedding algorithms, and present a polynomial-time crossing minimization technique. Also, for a given graph G and a constant k, we prove that it is -complete to decide whether G contains a subgraph of at least k edges having a 2-layer drawing with right angle crossings.", "paper_title": "2-Layer Right Angle Crossing Drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000331645500007"}
