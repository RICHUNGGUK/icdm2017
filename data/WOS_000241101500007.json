However, research into structured document retrieval has so far not systematically examined how structure can be used to facilitate the search process of users. We investigate how users of an XML retrieval system can be supported in their search process, if at all, through summarisation. To answer this question, an interactive information retrieval system was developed and a study using human searchers was conducted. The results show that searchers actively utilise the provided summaries, and that summary usage varied at different levels of the XML document structure. The results have implications for the design of interactive XML retrieval systems.", "paper_title": "The use of summaries in XML retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500007"}
