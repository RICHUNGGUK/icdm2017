This paper presents a reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for approximating the transient response of linear elastic structures over a range of design and random parameters. The full-order response is projected onto a lower-dimensional basis spanned by modes computed from a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of full-order model simulation results at multiple calibration points. The basis is further enriched by gradients of the POD modes with respect to the design/random parameters. A truncation strategy is proposed to compensate for the increase in basis vectors due to the proposed enrichment strategies. The accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed framework are studied with a two-dimensional model problem. The numerical results suggest that the proposed ROM approach is well suited for large parameter changes and that the number of basis vectors needs to be increased only linearly with the number of design and random parameters to maintain a particular ROM performance. The application of the proposed ROM approach to robust shape optimization demonstrates significant savings in computational cost over using full-order models.", "paper_title": "A multi-point reduced-order modeling approach of transient structural dynamics with application to robust design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000266255500005"}
