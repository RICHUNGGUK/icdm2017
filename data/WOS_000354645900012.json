Design/methodology/approach - In the field-circuit approach the distribution and changes of magnetic flux density in the motor are computed using a time-stepping finite element method. The additional losses in each element are evaluated at different frequencies. Findings - An approximate analytical formulation is derived for rapid losses computation confirmed by the results of field-circuit method. For high-voltage motors due to the size ratios of the core and relatively deep stator and rotor slots major role in causing loss of higher harmonics play a fundamental slot harmonics. Higher harmonics order bigger than 100 cause only small part of total higher harmonics core losses. Closed rotor slots construction influenced significantly on no-load losses mainly due to reduction of losses at slot upper part. For nominal load condition that influence is not so strong according to the saturation of slot tips by rotor leakage flux. Nevertheless, core losses at load are several times higher as at no-load. Research limitations/implications - In future research authors will take into account motors feed from PWM inverter, working in the frequency range up to 400 Hz. Practical implications - The results of investigation will be used in more detailed design of IMs especially for motors with closed rotor slots. Originality/value - The methods presented in the paper was not used before. Also results of additional losses in the motor core calculation, especially according motors with closed slots at no load and load conditions are new.", "paper_title": "Influence of the closing rotor slots on the additional losses in the induction motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000354645900012"}
