The results suggest that the relative stabilities of the cryptates in solution are due to a combination of steric effects (compression of large ions within the cryptand cavity), electronic effects (delocalization of the ionic charge onto the cryptand atoms) and solvent effects (dominantly the ionic dessolvation penalty). Thus, the relative stabilities in solution cannot be rationalized solely on the basis of a simple match or mismatch between the ionic radius and the cryptand cavity size as has been suggested previously. For example, although the [K. 222](+) cryptate is found to be the most stable in solution, in agreement with experimental data, it is the [Na. 222](+) cryptate that is the most stable in the gas phase. The present results provide further support to the notion that the solvent in which supramolecules are dissolved plays a key role in modulating molecular recognition processes.", "paper_title": "On the relative stabilities of the alkali cations 222 cryptates in the gas phase and in water-methanol solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000248302100009"}
