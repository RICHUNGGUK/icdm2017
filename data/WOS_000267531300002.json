This paper addresses the lack of research on this problem and introduces the CASU framework (from Creation, Activation, subscription, Unsubscription). The contribution of this framework is a systematic description of design alternatives for the specification of instantiation semantics of process modeling languages. We classify six prominent languages by the help of this framework. We validate the relevance of the CASU framework through empirical investigations involving a large set of process models from practice. Our work provides the basis for the design of new correctness criteria as well as for the formalization of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) and extension of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). It complements research such as the workflow patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Process instantiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000267531300002"}
