Therefore, a two-step control concept is presented. First, time-optimal trajectories are planned with respect to the kinematic and dynamic restrictions of the toggle mechanism. Formulating the time-optimal problem as a linear program allows the consideration of nonconstant velocity and acceleration limits as well as jerk constraints for the actuating piston. Second, a nonlinear control scheme based on feedback linearization is introduced to guarantee the time-optimal movement of the toggle mechanism. The proposed nonlinear controller possesses a cascade structure and considers the different modes of the clamping unit's hydraulic system as well as the clamping force build-up of the clamping unit. The simulation and measurement results presented in the paper show significant improvements compared to an existing open-loop control concept. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
