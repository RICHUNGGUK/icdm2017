Moreover, the adaptive beamforming technologies can remove unwanted noise and interference from the received signal. In this paper, we propose the adaptive direct sequence (DS) CDMA antenna receivers and compare their performances in three existing multirate methodologiesvariable processing gain (VPG), variable chip rate, and multicode systems for multiuser communications in multipath fading channels. Simulation results show that the processing powers of both narrowband and wideband adaptive antennas are not enough. We propose a powerful processing technique named Wiener Code Filter (WCF) to retrieve the shortcomings. Mean square error (MSE) analyses are also given in this paper. Some simulation examples are given to compare the performances of the proposed multirate structures.
