Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the dissimilarities stem from interhelical rather than intrahelical motions. The difference in the hydrophobic thicknesses of these simulated lipid bilayers is potentially a significant reason for the observed difference in results. The distinct lipid headgroups might also lead to different molecular interactions and hence different protein loop motions. Overall, the A2a AR shows higher mobility and flexibility in POPC as compared to POPE.", "paper_title": "Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Adenosine A2a Receptor in POPC and POPE Lipid Bilayers: Effects of Membrane on Protein Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000331992000023"}
