As well as causing local image data loss, a tear results in a noticeable relative shift in the frame between the regions at either side of the tear boundary. This paper describes a method for delineating the tear boundary and for correcting the displacement. This is achieved using a graph-cut segmentation framework that can be either automatic or interactive when automatic segmentation is not possible. Using temporal intensity differences to form the boundary conditions for the segmentation facilitates the robust division of the frame. The resulting segmentation map is used to calculate and correct the relative displacement using a global-motion estimation approach based on motion histograms. A high-quality restoration is obtained when a suitable missing-data treatment algorithm is used to recover any missing pixel intensities.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the Digital Restoration of Torn Films", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700013"}
