However, exhaustive searching operations are needed in order to find optimal phase factors. Signal distortions also occur because the clipping is a nonlinear operation. In this letter, we propose a new partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme using a phase factor selection algorithm with preset thresholds. The proposed scheme achieves considerable savings for determining the optimum phase factors without the signal distortions.", "paper_title": "Partial Transmit Sequence Scheme with Phase Factor Selection Algorithm in OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400014"}
