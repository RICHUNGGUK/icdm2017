The utilization of the L2-norm, however, makes it sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose an L1-norm-based BPCA (BPCA-L1) as a robust alternative to BPCA. We show the equivalence between the L1-norm-based two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA-L1) and the L1-norm-based principal component analysis (PCA-L1), both of which can be formulated as special cases of BPCA-L1. Experiments of image reconstruction and classification on benchmark image sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
