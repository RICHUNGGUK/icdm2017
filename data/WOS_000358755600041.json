In this method, an intelligent hierarchical structure for classifiers is used, which requires fewer calculation efforts in comparison with direct methods. Therefore, it is suitable for real time applications. Also, the correlations among different scenarios of the power system are considered. Therefore, the results are more realistic. The proposed method is implemented on IEEE 39-Bus New England and IEEE 300-Bus networks and the results show the superiority of the proposed method over other ones, to assess the system static security.", "paper_title": "Intelligent hierarchical structure of classifiers to assess static security of power system", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600041"}
