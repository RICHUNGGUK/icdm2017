In this report we review the research themes covered in these papers and identify the topics that are active at the moment. The main mechanism for this analysis is a clustering of the research papers based on both cocitation links and text similarity. It is interesting to note that the core set of papers has attracted citations from almost three thousand papers outside the conference collection so it is clear that the CBR conferences are a subpart of a much larger whole. It is remarkable that the research themes revealed by this analysis do not map directly to the subtopics of CBR that might appear in a textbook. Instead they reflect the applications-oriented focus of CBR research, and cover the promising application areas and research challenges that are faced.", "paper_title": "An Analysis of Current Trends in CBR Research Using Multiview Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000279271500004"}
