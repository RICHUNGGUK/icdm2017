These so-called skew-N domains cover about a third of the human genome and are bordered by two skew upward jumps that were hypothesized to compose a subset of \"master\" replication origins active in the germline. Skew-N domains were shown to exhibit a particular gene organization. Genes with CpG-rich promoters likely expressed in the germline are over represented near the master replication origins, with large genes being co-oriented with replication fork progression, which suggests some coordination of replication and transcription. In this study, we describe another skew structure that covers 13% of the human genome and that is bordered by putative master replication origins similar to the ones flanking skew-N domains. These skew-split-N domains have a shape reminiscent of a N, but split in half, leaving in the center a region of null skew whose length increases with domain size. These central regions (median size similar to 860 kb) have a homogeneous composition, i.e. both a null and constant skew and a constant and low GC content. They correspond to heterochromatin gene deserts found in low-GC isochores with an average gene density of 0.81 promoters/Mb as compared to 7.73 promoters/Mb genome wide. The analysis of epigenetic marks and replication timing data confirms that, in these late replicating heterochomatic regions, the initiation of replication is likely to be random. This contrasts with the transcriptionally active euchromatin state found around the bordering well positioned master replication origins. Altogether skew-N domains and skew-split-N domains cover about 50% of the human genome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
