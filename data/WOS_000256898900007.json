Research in this domain is aimed at eliminating some disadvantages of the technique: the lack of focalization of the stimulated human body region and the reduced efficiency of the energetic transfer from the stimulating coil to the tissue. Designing better stimulation coils is so far a trial-and-error process, relying on very compute-intensive simulations. In software, such a simulation has a very high running time (several hours for complicated geometries of the coils). This paper proposes and demonstrates an FPGA-based hardware implementation of this simulation, which reduces the computation time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Thanks to this powerful tool, some significant improvements in the design of the coils have already been obtained.", "paper_title": "Accelerating the computation of the physical parameters involved in transcranial magnetic stimulation using FPGA devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000256898900007"}
