In this paper, we analyze the endogamy of a large set of computer science conferences and journals. We observe a strong correlation between the quality of those conferences and the endogamy of their authors: conferences where researchers collaborate with new peers have significantly more quality than conferences where researchers work in groups that are stable along time.", "paper_title": "Research Endogamy as an Indicator of Conference Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000321322500002"}
