Despite the importance of document filtering for domain ontology management, however, few studies have sought to develop a method for automatically filtering out domain-relevant documents from the web. To address this situation, here we propose a document filtering scheme that identifies documents relevant to a domain ontology based on concept preferences. Testing of the proposed filtering scheme with a business domain ontology on 1,409 YahooPicks web pages yielded promising filtering results that outperformed the baseline system.", "paper_title": "Document filtering for domain ontology based on concept preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800038"}
