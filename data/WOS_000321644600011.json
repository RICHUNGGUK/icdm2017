The problems involved may however be ill-conditioned, and defined in terms of uncertain data, and even supplementary interval arithmetic may not ensure robustness. Trapping mechanisms are therefore proposed to resolve this difficulty.", "paper_title": "Managing uncertainty and discontinuous condition numbers in geometric computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321644600011"}
