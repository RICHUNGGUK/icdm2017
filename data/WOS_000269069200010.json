However, line officers rarely have time to take such courses on campus. The conventional solution to this problem used to take the inefficient correspondence courses. Whereas Internet technologies progress, online course is the current trend for military training. However, the question is what distance learning methodology best suits such a proprietary learning purpose. This study presents a sequential process of developing distance learning courses in advanced military education. Further, the Petri-Net analytical approach is adopted to discover the essential interaction requirements of advanced military education delivered via Internet. This study developed a systematic method for designing e-learning systems according to specific requirements of target courses. The proposed approach starts by comparing on-campus programs with the existing e-learning systems to identify the steps required to transform the program into an e-learning system. After first outlining the pedagogy of the on-campus program, its proposed teaching flow through the Internet is then sketched. Finally, the Petri-Net model was used for in-depth analysis of the stages affecting the learning curve of the line office taking e-learning courses. The example of a \"Joint Operations\" AME course elaborated the presented approach. An e-learning system prototype was also designed accordingly. Lastly, an experiment was conducted to verify the efficiency of the presented approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
