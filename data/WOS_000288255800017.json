Misbehavior is the result of an intrusion, or a software or hardware failure. Our misbehavior detection approach is inspired by the role of co-stimulation and priming in the biological immune system (BIS). We translate priming into a computational paradigm that can increase robustness as well as stimulate energy efficiency of misbehavior detection. We provide a detailed energy consumption analysis with respect to the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 protocols. We analyze the efficiency of misbehavior detection with co-stimulation and priming. This analysis is complemented with experimental results. We show that co-stimulation and priming introduce new options such as the ability to choose a trade-off between detection performance and energy efficiency. We provide a summary of the challenges related to the design of co-stimulation and priming based architectures. We argue that co-stimulation and priming are rather general paradigms with possible applications in other areas than misbehavior detection.", "paper_title": "Priming: making the reaction to intrusion or fault predictable", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800017"}
