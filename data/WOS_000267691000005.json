In this study, we consider the two constituent sub-problems of Grid scheduling, namely: (i) the scheduling of computation tasks to processing resources and (ii) the routing and scheduling of the data movement in a Grid network. Regarding computation tasks, we examine two typical online task scheduling algorithms that employ advance reservations and perform full network simulation experiments to measure their performance when implemented in a centralized or distributed manner. Similarly, for communication tasks, we compare two routing and data scheduling algorithms that are implemented in a centralized or a distributed manner. We examine the effect network propagation delay has on the performance of these algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that a distributed architecture with an exhaustive resource utilization update strategy yields better average end-to-end delay performance than a centralized architecture.
