Validation means ensuring whether a given application fulfils the user requirements. We suggest validation of database applications by using the functional testing technique, which is a fundamental black-box testing technique for checking the software without being concerned about its implementation and structure. Our main contribution to this work is in providing a MDA approach for deriving testing software from the OCL specification of the integrity constraints. This testing software is used to validate the database applications, which are used to enforce these constraints. The generated testing software includes three components: validation queries, test cases and initial data inserted before the testing process. Our approach is implemented as an add-in tool in Rational Rose called OCL2TestSW.", "paper_title": "AN OCL-BASED APPROACH TO DERIVE CONSTRAINT TEST CASES FOR DATABASE APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295530400001"}
