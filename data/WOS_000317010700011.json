In this error model, the error magnitude does not exceed a certain limited value and it is known beforehand. For asymmetric, unidirectional, and symmetric channels, both all and t error detecting codes are studied. In all these cases, close-to-optimal codes are proposed.", "paper_title": "Limited Magnitude Error Detecting Codes over Z(q)", "paper_id": "WOS:000317010700011"}
