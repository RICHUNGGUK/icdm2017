The spatial knowledge of human participants was assessed after they had learned the relative positions of London Underground stations on a map via passive, marginally active, or active exploration. Following learning, the participants were required to answer questions in relation to the spatial representation and distribution of the stations on the map. Performances were compared between conditions involving (1) without auditory cues versus continuous auditory cues; (2) without auditory cues versus noncontinuous auditory cues; and (3) continuous auditory cues versus noncontinuous auditory cues. Results showed that the participants perfomed better following active and marginally-active explorations, as compared to purely passive learning. These results also suggest that under specific conditions (i.e., continuous sound with extremely fast tempo) there is no benefit to spatial abilities from active exploration over passive observation; while continuous sound with moderate to fast tempo is effective for simple actions (i.e., key press).", "paper_title": "Enhancing Visuospatial Map Learning through Action on Cellphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000304614400005"}
