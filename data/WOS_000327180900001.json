A number of factors including population growth, the ageing population and a lack of new infrastructure are expected to further exacerbate waiting times in the near future. In this work, we show how healthcare services can be modelled as queueing nodes, together with healthcare service workflows, such that these workflows can be optimised during execution in order to reduce patient waiting times. Services such as X-ray, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging often form queues, thus, by taking into account the waiting times of each service, the workflow can be re-orchestrated and optimised. Experimental results indicate average waiting time reductions are achievable by optimising workflows using dynamic re-orchestration. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
