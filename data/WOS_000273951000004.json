To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first papers in the literature investigating the integration of actual H.264 video traces and gaming traffic with other types of traffic over wireless networks. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves high throughput results while preserving the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of each traffic type, and outperforms two efficient schemes previously proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "A new bandwidth allocation mechanism for next generation wireless cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273951000004"}
