Cooperative manipulation is achieved by tracking relative trajectories that are designed for both the nonholonomic nature of the platforms and path constraints limiting the deformation of the flexible structure. The relative trajectories are designed by transforming an optimal-trajectory problem to a nonlinear programming problem. A tracking control law is also designed for the nonholonomic nature of the platforms with consideration for the challenges in cooperative manipulation. Results are presented for a simulation example, and a hardware demonstration for a simple case is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.", "paper_title": "Trajectory Planning for the Cooperative Manipulation of a Flexible Structure by Two Differentially-Driven Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000276504100003"}
