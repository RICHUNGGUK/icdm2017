Whereas clinical investigations often relate increased variability to decreased stability, there are only few studies examining stability aspects directly. On the other hand, various papers from the field of robotics are dedicated to the question: how can the stability of legged locomotor systems be quantified? Particularly, when it comes to realizing fast motions in robots, the question of maintaining dynamic stability is of utmost importance. The current paper presents a theoretical comparison of several measures for dynamic stability - namely Floquet multipliers and Local Divergence Exponents (LDE). The sensitivity of these parameters to changes in speed of human treadmill locomotion is investigated. Experimental results show that two different types of stability with respect to speed dependence seem to exist. Short term LDE and Floquet multipliers consider the stability over a period of one stride, which seems to be optimal at intermediate walking speeds. Long term LDE quantify stability of movement trajectories over multiple strides. This type of stability decreases with speed and may be one reason for changing gaits from walking to running at a certain speed value.", "paper_title": "Comparison of two measures of dynamic stability during treadmill walking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700016"}
