That scheme is designed to achieve high-order algebraic convergence and high-accuracy when applied to operators given on smoothly parameterized surfaces. This paper generalizes the approach to a wider class of integral operators including many defined via the Cauchy principal value. Operators of this type frequently occur in the course of solving scattering problems involving boundary conditions on tangential derivatives. The resulting scheme achieves high-order algebraic convergence and approximately 12 digits of accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
