We show that a classical limit theorem for convergence of sums of triangular arrays to infinitely divisible distributions can be used to determine the distribution of this number. The asymptotic distribution of the (normalized) number of records or cuts is found to be weakly 1-stable.", "paper_title": "Random Records and Cuttings in Binary Search Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000277473600004"}
