In this paper, we capitalize on the mathematical knowledge of Gaussian convolution and propose a strategy to minimally reblur test images. From the reblur algorithm, synthetic reblur images are created. We propose a new blind blur metric which makes use of the reblur images to produce blur scores. Compared to other no-reference blur assessments, the proposed method has the advantages of fast computation and training-free operation. Experiment results also show that the proposed method can produce blur scores which are highly correlated with human perception of blurriness.", "paper_title": "An Efficient and Training-Free Blind Image Blur Assessment in the Spatial Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400019"}
