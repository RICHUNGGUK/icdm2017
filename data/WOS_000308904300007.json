The present work addresses this issue with a specific focus on the network design. First, the paper presents a brief review of computer-based design methods and shows that a significant number of efforts have been pursued. Secondly, it proposes the approach of geometric analysis of the distribution networks as complementary points of the former optimization methods. Finally, an original illustrative application is proposed. The geometric and multi-scale optimization known as the constructal design is used to analytically optimize T-shaped network architectures subject to an operational water quality constraint. This illustrative application leads to the determination of an optimal geometry of the network that minimizes head losses (factor of pumping energy). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
