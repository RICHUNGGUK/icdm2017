This is partly because each framework may work well for different types of investigations, but it hasn't been shown if any are sufficient for all types of investigations. To address this problem, this work uses a model based on the history of a computer to define categories and classes of analysis techniques. The model is more lower-level than existing frameworks and the categories and classes of analysis techniques that are defined support the existing higher-level frameworks. Therefore, they can be used to more clearly compare the frameworks. Proofs can be given to show the completeness of the analysis techniques and therefore the completeness of the frameworks can also be addressed. (c) 2006 DFRWS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
