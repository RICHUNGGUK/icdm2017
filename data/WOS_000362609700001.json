The solutions obtained from the slope stability analyses are bracketed to within +/- 10% or better. For comparison purposes, results from two-dimensional (2D) analyses based on the numerical limit analysis methods and the conventional limit equilibrium method (LEM) are also discussed. This study shows that 3D boundary of a slope can have significant effects on the slope stability. In addition, the results are presented in the form of stability charts which can be convenient tools for practicing engineers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
