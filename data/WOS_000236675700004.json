At larger scales, beyond a few tens of meters, the ocean circulation can be seen to separate into quasi-horizontal and vertical directions, with the magnitude of mixing differing by many orders of magnitude between the two. It is within this context, and with additional constraints of flux-conservation when used for coupled climate simulation, that transport schemes are placed within ocean general circulation models. Forward-in-time upwind-weighted methods have made gradual, steady inroads into the field. We review this evolution from centred-in-time centred-in-space schemes, first discussing temporally hybrid models (centred discretization of the momentum equations with forward-in-time treatment of the scalar transport equations), then fully forward-in-time models, touching on a number of test problems and analyses that have provided guidance to these model development efforts and discussing selected results.
