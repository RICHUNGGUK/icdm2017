We refer to such a pseudorandom generator as an asymptotically optimal PRG. We present a simple construction of an asymptotically optimal PRG from any one-way function f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(n) which satisfies the following requirements: 1. f can be computed by linear-size circuits; 2. f is 2(beta n)-hard to invert, for some constant beta > 0; 3. f either has high entropy, in the sense that the min-entropy of f (x) on a random input x is at least gamma n where beta/3 + gamma > 1, or alternatively it is regular in the sense that the preimage size of every output of f is fixed. Known constructions of PRGs from one-way functions can do without the entropy or regularity requirements, but they achieve slightly sub-exponential security (Vadhan and Zheng (2012) [27]). Our construction relies on a technical result about hardcore functions that may be of independent interest. We obtain a family of hardcore functions H ={h : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(alpha n)} that can be computed by linear-size circuits for any 2(beta n)-hard one-way function f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1}(n) where beta > 3 alpha. Our construction of asymptotically optimal PRGs uses such hardcore functions, which are obtained via linear-size computable affine hash functions (Ishai et al. (2008) [24]). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
