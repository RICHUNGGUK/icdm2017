Some sufficient conditions are established for the existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of the equilibrium point by using Lyapunov functionals, the analysis method and impulsive control. Here we point out that our result, which is different from previous known results, shows that the unstable Cohen-Grossberg-type BAM neural networks with time-varying delays can be exponentially stabilized via impulsive control. Moveover, the estimate of the exponential convergence rate is also obtained, which depends on the system parameters. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and result. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
