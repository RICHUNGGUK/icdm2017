Pure software solutions on general-purpose processors tend to be slow because they do not take advantage of the inherent parallelism, whereas hardware realizations usually rely on optimizations that reduce the range of applicable network topologies, or they attempt to increase processing efficiency by means of low-precision data representation. This paper presents, first of all, a study that shows the need of heterogeneous platform (CPU-GPU-FPGA) to accelerate the optimization of ANNs using genetic algorithms and, secondly, an implementation of a platform based on embedded systems with hardware accelerators implemented in Field Pro-grammable Gate Array (FPGA). The implementation of the individuals on a remote low-cost Altera FPGA allowed us to obtain a 3x-4x acceleration compared with a 2.83 GHz Intel Xeon Quad-Core and 6x-7x compared with a 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron Quad-Core 2354.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary optimization of neural networks with heterogeneous computation: study and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358668000009"}
