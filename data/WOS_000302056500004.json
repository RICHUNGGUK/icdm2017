By considering the parent distribution as exponential, we derive Bayesian prediction intervals as well as Bayesian point predictors for k-record values from a future sequence based on an observed progressively Type-II right censored sample. The corresponding results for ordinary Type-II censored sample and the usual order statistics are then deduced as special cases. A real data set concerning the breakdown times of an insulating fluid in an accelerated life-test is used for illustrating all the results developed here.", "paper_title": "Bayesian prediction of k-record values based on progressively censored data from exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056500004"}
