Four models are studied: the problem under sum-type weighted Hamming distance; the problem under bottleneck-type weighted Hamming distance and two mixed types of problems. We present their respective combinatorial algorithms that all run in strongly polynomial times.", "paper_title": "Inverse maximum flow problems under the weighted Hamming distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241166500007"}
