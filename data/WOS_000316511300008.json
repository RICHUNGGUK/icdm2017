For that purpose, a robust and systematic method is first proposed to derive the elastic model of their structure and an efficient FE simulation of the process is then used to predict accurately the forming forces. Their values are then defined as the inputs of the proposed elastic model to calculate the robot TCP pose errors induced by the elastic deformations. This avoids thus a first step of measurement of the forces required to form a test part with a stiff machine. An intensive experimental investigation is performed by forming a classical frustum cone and a non-symmetrical twisted pyramid. It validates the robustness of both the FE analysis and the proposed elastic modeling allowing the final geometry of the formed parts to converge towards their nominal specifications in a context of prototyping applications.
