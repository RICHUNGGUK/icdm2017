High speed with low-latency architecture has been designed and implemented in Virtex-4 FPGA for Golay encoder without incorporating linear feedback shift register. This brief also presents an optimized and low-complexity decoding architecture for extended binary Golay code (24, 12, 8) based on an incomplete maximum likelihood decoding scheme. The proposed architecture for decoder occupies less area and has lower latency than some of the recent work published in this area. The encoder module runs at 238.575 MHz, while the proposed architecture for decoder has an operating clock frequency of 195.028 MHz. The proposed hardware modules may be a good candidate for forward error correction in communication link, which demands a high-speed system.", "paper_title": "Efficient Hardware Implementation of Encoder and Decoder for Golay Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100040"}
