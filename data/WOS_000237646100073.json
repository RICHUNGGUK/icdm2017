Therefore, fault-tolerance mechanisms are needed for the wireless sensor networks have to maintain stability and normal operation of the networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive mobile checkpointing mechanism for wireless sensor networks that gives fault-tolerance for the networks. It is a yet another checkpointing mechanism based on the diskless checkpointing which does not use stable storage but uses the redundant memory space of neighboring nodes. Our experimental results show that the lifetime and stability of sensor networks was dramatically increased compared with the case when the proposed mechanism was used or not.", "paper_title": "Adaptive mobile checkpointing facility for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100073"}
