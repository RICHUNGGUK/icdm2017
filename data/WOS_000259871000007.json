Supply chain performance in the face of various market and technical uncertainties is usually measured by service level. that is, the expected fraction of demand that the supply chain can satisfy within a predefined allowable delivery time window. Safety stock is introduced into supply chains as an important hedge against uncertainty in order to Provide customers with the promised service level. Although a higher safety stock level guarantees a higher service level, it does increase the Supply chain operating cost and thus these levels must be suitably optimized. The complexities in safety stock management for multi-stage, supply chain with multiple products and production capacity constraints arise from: (1) the nonlinear performance functions that relate the service level, expected inventory with safety stock control variables at each site; (2) the interdependence of the performances of different sites: and (3) finally the margin by which production capacity exceeds the uncertain demand. Given the complexities, the integrated management of safety stocks across the supply chain imposes significant computational challenges. In this research, we propose art approach in which the evaluation of the performance functions and the decision on safety stock related variables are decomposed into two separate Computational frameworks. For evaluating the performance functions, off-line computation using a discrete event simulation model is proposed. A linear programming based safety stock management model is developed, in which the safety stock control variables (the target inventory levels used in production planning and scheduling models, base-stock levels for the base-stock policy at the warehouses) and service levels at both plant stage and warehouse stages are used as important decision variables. in the linear programming model, the nonlinear performance functions, interdependence of the performances, and the safety production capacity limits in safety stock management are properly represented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety stock management model, a case study of a realistically scaled polymer supply chain problem is presented. In the case problem, the supply chain is composed of two geographically separated production sites and 3-8 warehouses supplying 10 final products to 30 sales regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
