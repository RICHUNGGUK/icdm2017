Design/methodology/approach - Construction, principle of working, and mathematical model of a four-band stepper linear reluctance motor are shortly discussed. In order to elaborate an effective tool for motor performance analysis, a circuital approach was applied. To increase model accuracy, major parameters of the model (main self- and leakage inductances) were calculated on the basis of a 3D electromagnetic field distribution using Finite Element Method (FEM). The nonlinearity of the core was taken into account. Elaborated mathematical model was implemented in MatLab-Simulink environment. Selected results of investigations are presented. Findings - The elaborated mathematical model and the review of control methods are very useful for analysis of dynamic operation of stepper linear reluctance motors. Originality/value - The paper provides a review of control methods of stepper linear reluctance motors.", "paper_title": "Model of dynamic operation of stepper linear reluctance motor based on field approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900009"}
