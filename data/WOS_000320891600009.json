Assume channel state information of all MSs is known by base station. We propose uplink RA algorithms, performing subcarrier assignment and power allocation, for optimizing bpj of MS in a single-cell OFDMA-based cellular network for both single- and multi- user scenarios. In the single-user case, we propose RA algorithms, which utilize the closed-form solution derived by applying Lambert-W function and an iterative approach based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions respectively to achieve optimal bpj of MS. In the multi-user case, centralized iterative multi-user RA algorithms for maximizing sum of MS' bpj, performing joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation iteratively, are proposed by utilizing the proposed single-user RA schemes. In particular, tradeoffs between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency are fully investigated, and the influence of MS' power and minimum rate constraints on bpj performance is also studied. The effectiveness of proposed algorithms is presented by numerical experiments. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithms can enhance bpj significantly with limited loss of total throughput compared to the sum-rate maximization algorithm (in Moretti et al., IEEE Trans Veh Technol 60(4):1788-1798, 2011).", "paper_title": "Single- and multi- user uplink energy-efficient resource allocation algorithms with users' power and minimum rate constraint in OFDMA cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600009"}
