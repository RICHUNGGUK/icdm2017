In this paper, a novel feature extraction method, two-dimensional nearest neighbor discriminant analysis (2DNNDA), is proposed front the view of the nearest neighbor classification, which makes use of the matrix representation of images. We apply 2DNNDA to face recognition and the results demonstrate that 2DNNDA outperforms the conventional methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
