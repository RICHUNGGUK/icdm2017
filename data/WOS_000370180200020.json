In this paper, an improved sparse signal recovery algorithm based on smoothed l(0) (SL0) norm method is proposed to achieve high resolution ISAR imaging with limited pulse numbers. Firstly, one new smoothed function is proposed to approximate the l(0) norm to measure the sparsity. Then a single loop step is used instead of two loop layers in SL0 method which increases the searching density of variable parameter to ensure the recovery accuracy without increasing computation amount, the cost function is undated in every loop for the next loop until the termination is satisfied. Finally, the new set of solution is projected into the feasible set. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the several popular methods both in terms of the reconstruction performance and computation time. Real data ISAR imaging obtained by the proposed algorithm is competitive to several other methods.", "paper_title": "High Resolution ISAR Imaging Based on Improved Smoothed L0 Norm Recovery Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200020"}
