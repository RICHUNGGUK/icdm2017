The degree of initialization can be quantified by k, the number of clean qubits in the initial state of the register. In this article, we show that unless m is an element of O (k+log n), oblivious (gate-by-gate) simulation of an ideal m-qubit quantum circuit by an n-qubit circuit with k clean qubits is impossible. Effectively, this indicates that there is no avoiding physical initialization of a quantity of qubits proportional to that required by the best ideal quantum circuit.", "paper_title": "Computing with highly mixed states", "paper_id": "WOS:000239799600008"}
