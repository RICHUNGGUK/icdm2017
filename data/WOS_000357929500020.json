Dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) and DRAM low-power states (Demotion) are two main-stream techniques for DRAM power management. DFS reduces the operation frequency of memory channels and DRAM devices when the memory bandwidth is under-utilized, whereas demotion transits individual memory ranks to low-power states during long idle periods. Despite that there have been fruitful research work for DFS and demotion separately, little attention has been paid to the synergy between these two techniques. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive study on the synergy between DFS and demotion. In particular, we leverage queuing theory to develop analytical models for the energy consumption and performance of DRAM systems with DFS and demotion. These models provide valuable insights into the synergy between DFS and demotion. We further attempt to minimize the energy consumption by considering both DFS and demotion while keeping a pre-defined performance penalty budget. To reduce the optimization complexity, we develop simple yet effective heuristics to search near-optimum DFS-demotion configurations. We experimentally compare our design with other state-of-the-art DRAM energy saving policies using detailed simulations of a large set of workloads. Experimental results show the accuracy of our analytical models and the effectiveness of our optimizations.", "paper_title": "Synergy of Dynamic Frequency Scaling and Demotion on DRAM Power Management: Models and Optimizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000357929500020"}
