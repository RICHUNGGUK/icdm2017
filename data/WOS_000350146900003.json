This method needs only local data exchange among neighboring sensor nodes and thus provides enhanced reliability, scalability, and ease of deployment. To make the multimodel particle filtering work in a distributed manner, a Gaussian approximation of the particle cloud obtained at each sensor node and a consensus propagation-based distributed data aggregation scheme are used to dynamically reweight the particles' weights. The proposed method can recover from failure situations and is robust to noise, since it keeps the same population of particles and uses the aggregated global Gaussian to infer constraints. The constraints are enforced by adjusting particles' weights and assigning a higher mass to those closer to the global estimate represented by the nodes in the entire sensor network after each communication step. Each sensor node experiences gradual change; i.e., if a noise occurs in the system, the node, its neighbors, and consequently the overall network are less affected than with other approaches, and thus recover faster. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulations for a target tracking system which can process both soft and hard data in sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Distributed Soft-Data-Constrained Multi-Model Particle Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000350146900003"}
