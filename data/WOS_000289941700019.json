We address the problem of real-time recognition of the user's live dance performance in order to determine the interactive motion to be rendered by a virtual dance partner. The real-time recognition algorithm is based on a human body partition indexing scheme with flexible matching to determine the end of a move as well as to detect unwanted motion. We show that the system can recognize the live dance motions of users with good accuracy and render the interactive dance move of the virtual partner.
