The k-feedback arc set problems in tournaments and bipartite tournaments (k-FAST and k-FASBT) have applications in ranking aggregation and have been extensively studied from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. By introducing a new concept called \"bimodule\", we provide a problem kernel with O(k (2)) vertices for k-FASBT, which improves the previous result by a factor of k.", "paper_title": "A Quadratic Vertex Kernel for Feedback Arc Set in Bipartite Tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400006"}
