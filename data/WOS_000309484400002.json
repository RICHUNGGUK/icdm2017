We revisit and extend this result by enlarging the set of available computational gates: in addition to unitaries and measurements, we allow dissipative evolution governed by a Markovian master equation with linear Lindblad operators. We show that this more general form of fermionic computation is also simulable efficiently by classical means. Given a system of N fermionic modes, our algorithm simulates any such gate in time O(N-3) while a single-mode measurement is simulated in time O(N-2). The steady state of the Lindblad equation can be computed in time O(N-3).", "paper_title": "CLASSICAL SIMULATION OF DISSIPATIVE FERMIONIC LINEAR OPTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309484400002"}
