Features are extracted from the 1D signals r and theta, and hence the processing memory and time are reduced. The approximate shift-invariant property of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform and the Fourier transform guarantee that this method is invariant to translation, rotation and scaling. The method is used to recognize aircrafts from different rotation angles and scaling factors. Experimental results show that it achieves better recognition rates than that which uses only the Fourier features and Granlund's method. Its success is due to the desirable shift invariant property of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform, the translation invariant property of the Fourier spectrum, and our new complete representation of the outer contour of the pattern.", "paper_title": "Contour-based feature extraction using dual-tree complex wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000251720000008"}
