Our hybrid GA scheme uses the concept of Lamarckian genetics to perform a local search about an individual, followed by replacing it with a better solution found in its neighborhood. Two local search schemes have been investigated and their performance relative to the standard GA have been compared. Preliminary results obtained on a set of three protein-ligand complexes are encouraging.", "paper_title": "Hybrid-genetic algorithms for flexible ligand docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000252859000004"}
