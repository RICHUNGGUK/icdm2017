Initially, harmonic and others electrical characteristics were identified by carrying out an experiment on four types of LED lamps available on the local market. On the basis of the identified characteristics, a new LED lamp model was developed in MATLAB Simulink. This model is called the time-dependent current source model and gives more accurate results than the fixed current source model. Then this model was applied to a distribution network together other linear and nonlinear loads, namely incandescent lighting, computer loads, and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). The simulated results show that the harmonic voltage distortion can exceed the 8% IEC standard limit when 80% incandescent lamps in a distribution power network are replaced with LED lamps. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the active power loss can drastically increase across distribution transformers due to the presence large numbers of LED lamps.", "paper_title": "Impact of large-scale installation of LED lamps in a distribution system", "paper_id": "WOS:000365508200020"}
