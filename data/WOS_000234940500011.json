In addition, it introduces the different characteristics that censored data have, together with the different scenarios that would lead to the application of the appropriate statistical approaches. The analysis of these scenarios will be mainly centered on the knowledge of the distribution for the survival time and the functional relationship between the survival time and the different covariates available in heterogeneous populations. The proposals are applied to a real data set where the survival time of AIDS-diagnosed patients in the Basque Country (Spain) is studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
