To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited. In addition, the physical constraints such as joint limits and joint velocity limits are incorporated into the problem formulation of such a redundancy-resolution scheme. The scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic-programming (QP) problem. As a QP real-time solver, the LVI-based primal-dual neural network is designed based on the QP-LVI conversion and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. With simple piecewise-linear dynamics and global exponential convergence to optimal solutions, it can handle general QP and linear programming (LP) problems in the same inverse-free manner. The repetitive motion planning scheme and the LVI-based primal-dual neural network are simulated successfully based on PA10 robot arm, with effectiveness demonstrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
