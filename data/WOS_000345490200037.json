A basic roadblock for robust potential computations in such scenarios is the poor scaling of modified-Bessel functions used for computation of the semi-analytical solution, for extreme arguments and/or orders. To accommodate this, we construct a set of rescaled versions of modified-Bessel functions, which avoids underflows and overflows in finite precision arithmetic, and minimizes round-off errors. In addition, several extrapolation methods are applied and compared to expedite the numerical evaluation of the (otherwise slowly convergent) associated Sommerfeld-type integrals. The proposed algorithm is verified in a number of scenarios relevant to geophysical exploration, but the general formulation presented is also applicable to other problems governed by Poisson equation such as Newtonian gravity, heat flow, and potential flow in fluid mechanics, involving cylindrically stratified environments.
