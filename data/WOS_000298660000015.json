By introducing the population growth equation with variable carrying capacity into the classical Solow model and combining the population growth equation, we obtain a two-dimensional dynamical system. It is proved that the dynamical system has a unique equilibrium and the solution of the dynamical system is asymptotically stable. By qualitative analysis, we obtain that the population growth rate increases from zero to a positive level firstly and then decreases to zero and per capita capital increases strictly along a normal economic growth path. Therefore, the model implies that the demographic transition appears under the interaction between economic growth and human population carrying capacity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
