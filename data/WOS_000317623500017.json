The dynamic zero is adapted to load current to get an adequate phase margin with a load current variation from 0 to 3 A. The proposed NMOS LDO has been implemented in a standard 0.35 mu m CMOS process, and the die size is as small as 650 x 890 mu m(2). In the experimented transient response, the load regulation of 3.3 mV/A is observed. In addition, the power-supply rejection ratio at 1 MHz can be up to -30 dB.", "paper_title": "A dynamic zero frequency compensation for 3 A NMOS ultra-low dropout regulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000317623500017"}
