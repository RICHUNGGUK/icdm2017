After a brief introduction of the Situated Cellular Agents model, the guidelines to the crowd modeling approach is introduced as a way to support the communication among the different actors that are part of the simulation project team. The approach is then applied to describe a complex scenario providing a blend of competitive and cooperative behavior for pedestrian agents: an underground station. A module supporting the effective 3D visualization of simulated crowd dynamics is finally introduced, as an instrument for the communication of simulation results to decision makers and nonexperts in crowd phenomena.", "paper_title": "Situated cellular agents approach to crowd modeling and simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249495500006"}
