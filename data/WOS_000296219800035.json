However, research on scheduling problems with deteriorating jobs has rarely considered explicit setup times. With the current emphasis on customer service and meeting the promised delivery dates, we consider a single-machine scheduling problem to minimize the number of late jobs with deteriorating jobs and setup times in this paper. We derive some dominance properties, a lower bound, and an initial upper bound by using a heuristic algorithm to speed up the search process of the branch-and-bound algorithm. Computational experiments show that the algorithm can solve instances up to 1000 jobs in a reasonable amount of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
