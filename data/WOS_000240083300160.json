There is no static infrastructure such as base station in cell mobile communication. Due to the dynamic nature of the network topology and restricted resources, quality of service (QoS) and multicast routing in MANET is a challenging task. Finding and maintaining QoS multicast routing in the data is still more challenging. In this paper, we present an entropy-based genetic algorithm (GA) to support QoS multicast routing in mobile ad hoc networks (EQMGA). The key idea of EQMC-A algorithm is to construct the new metric-entropy and select the long-life path with the help of entropy metric to reduce the number of route reconstruction so as to provide QoS guarantee in the ad hoc network. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach and parameters provide an accurate and efficient method to estimate and evaluate the route stability in dynamic mobile networks.", "paper_title": "QoS multicast routing algorithm in MANET: An entropy-based GA", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300160"}
