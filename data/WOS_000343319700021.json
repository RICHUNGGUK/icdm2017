The pixel wise intensity, gradient, and C1 SMF features are extracted via the local homogeneity model and Gabor filter, which would be used as inputs of MFMK-SVM model. It may provide multiple features of the samples for easier implementation and efficient computation of MFMK-SVM model. A new clustering method, which is called feature validity-interval type-2 fuzzy C-means (FV-IT2FCM) clustering algorithm, is proposed by integrating a type-2 fuzzy criterion in the clustering optimization process to improve the robustness and reliability of clustering results by the iterative optimization. Furthermore, the clustering validity is employed to select the training samples for the learning of the MFMK-SVM model. The MFMK-SVM scene segmentation method is able to fully take advantage of the multiple features of scene image and the ability of multiple kernels. Experiments on the BSDS dataset and real natural scene images demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Multiple-Feature and Multiple-Kernel Scene Segmentation Algorithm for Humanoid Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000343319700021"}
