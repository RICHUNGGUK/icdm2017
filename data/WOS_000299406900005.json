The interaction mechanisms between the streamwise vortex and the secondary vortex and the impact of the streamwise vortex position on the performance of the turbine cascade are discussed in detail. The results indicate that streamwise vortex can effectively reduce the stagnation pressure loss and the flow deviation. The control effect is significantly dependent on the relative location of the streamwise vortex with respect to the cascade. It can suppress the development of the pressure side leg of the horseshoe vortex better if the streamwise vortex is close to the suction side of blade leading edge. The experimental and computational results in this configuration show a decrease in stagnation pressure loss at the cascade exit by 6.5 +/- 1.0% and 5.4%, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
