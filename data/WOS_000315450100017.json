The common peroneal nerve was stimulated, and a mechanomyogram (MMG) of the anterior tibialis muscle was detected with a laser displacement meter or an acceleration sensor. The transfer function between stimulation and the MMG was identified by the singular value decomposition method. The MMG detected with a laser displacement meter, DMMG, was approximated with a second-order model, but that detected with an acceleration sensor, AMMG, was approximated with a sixth-order model. The natural frequency of the DMMG coincided with that in the literature and was close to the lowest natural frequency of the AMMG. The highest natural frequency of the AMMG was within the range of the resonance frequencies of human soft tissue. The laser displacement meter is suitable for the precise identification of the MMG, which has a natural frequency of around 3 Hz. The acceleration transducer is suitable for the identification of the MMG with natural frequencies of tens of hertz.", "paper_title": "Comparison of displacement and acceleration transducers for the characterization of mechanics of muscle and subcutaneous tissues by system identification of a mechanomyogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000315450100017"}
