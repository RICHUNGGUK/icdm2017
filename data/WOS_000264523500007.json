One-hop DHTs give lower lookup latencies and lower lookup failure rates. However, it is hard to maintain large, wide-area one-hop topologies. We contribute aecast, a new topology dissemination algorithm for one-hop DHTs. It avoids expensive repair mechanisms and critical points of failure in existing one-hop DHTs. When a node discovers by anti-entropy that it has missed a topology update, it initiates \"controlled flooding,\" sending the update to nodes in the multicast tree that also missed the update. We compare aecast with a widely cited epidemic multicasting algorithm, pbcast, by analysis and simulation. Aecast gives at least fivefold fewer out-of-date nodes on average within one round of a topology update. We support it with a fault-tolerant topology agreement protocol, so that only legitimate topology changes propagate throughout the overlay. Consequently, we argue that one-hop DHTs deserve greater attention for Internet applications in which reasonably reliable nodes carry high lookup loads.", "paper_title": "Topology Dissemination for Reliable One-Hop Distributed Hash Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000264523500007"}
