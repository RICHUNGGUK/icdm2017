Chemical vendors provide millions of compounds; however, these compounds are highly redundant. Clustering analysis, a technique that groups similar compounds into families, can be used to analyze such redundancy. Many available clustering methods focus on accurate classification of compounds; they are slow and are not suitable for very large compound libraries. Here is described a fast clustering method based on an incremental clustering algorithm and the 2D fingerprints of compounds. This method can cluster a very large data set with millions of compounds in hours on a single computer. A program implemented with this method, called cd-hit-fp, is available from http://chemspace. org.", "paper_title": "A fast clustering algorithm for analyzing highly similar compounds of very large libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000240701700007"}
