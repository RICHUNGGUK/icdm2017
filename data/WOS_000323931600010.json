However, limited CPU power makes large-scale in silico screening such as virtual screening with QM calculations a challenge. Recently, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) has offered an alternative, because of its significantly accelerated computational time over CPU. Here, we review a GPGPU-based supercomputer, TSUBAME2.0, and its promise for next generation in silico drug discovery, in high-density (HD) silico drug discovery.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Quantum Chemistry Calculations with Graphical Processing Units - Toward in High-Density (HD) Silico Drug Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000323931600010"}
