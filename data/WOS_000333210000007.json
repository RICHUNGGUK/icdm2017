We describe the method and discuss the many challenges encountered. We have loaded the data into an online database to make it accessible for anyone to explore and we present our own first explorations of it. The focus of the paper is thus twofold, covering pedagogical and methodological aspects of the lists' construction, and linguistic aspects of the by-product of the project, the KELLY database.", "paper_title": "Corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners for nine languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000333210000007"}
