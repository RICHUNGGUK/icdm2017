However, the Internet heterogeneous environment, where each provider has its own policies, infrastructure and business goals, hinders the deployment of more advanced communication services. This paper presents a Quality of Service (QoS) for Inter-Domain Services (QIDS) model that allows inter-domain QoS-aware services to be defined, configured, and adapted in a dynamic and on-demand fashion, among service providers. This is accomplished by: 1) the use of a common communication channel (business layer) where service providers publish and search for services, and interact with each other to contract and manage these services; 2) the templates to specify the business and technical characteristics of the services; 3) the automatic composition of services using service elements (smaller services) according to performance and service-specific QoS parameters; and 4) the creation and enforcement of configuration rules for the underlying infrastructure. A prototype was implemented to validate QIDS and performance tests were conducted on an inter-domain Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)/Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) scenario.", "paper_title": "Provisioning of Inter-Domain QoS-Aware Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000351292400017"}
