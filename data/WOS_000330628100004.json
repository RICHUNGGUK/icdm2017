Many studies have proven that most individuals spend their lives in indoor environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new index structure for moving objects in cellular space. The index is based on the connectivity (adjacency) between the indoor environment cells and can effectively respond to the spatial indoor queries and enable efficient updates of the location of a moving object in indoor space. An empirical performance study suggests that the proposed indoor-tree in terms of measurements and performance is effective, efficient and robust.", "paper_title": "A connectivity index for moving objects in an indoor cellular space", "paper_id": "WOS:000330628100004"}
