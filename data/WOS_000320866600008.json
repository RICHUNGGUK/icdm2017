A common message is sent to three receivers. Another message is sent to the first and second receivers and needs to be kept secret from the third receiver (second eavesdropper). The third message is sent to the first receiver and needs to be kept secret from the second and third receivers (first and second eavesdroppers). First, we consider perfect secrecy conditions at the eavesdroppers, where we find an achievable perfect secrecy region. In the achievability scheme, we use superposition coding which divides the available randomness into different levels. These levels are used to mislead the eavesdroppers. The proposed coding scheme determines the perfect secrecy capacity region of the one-receiver two-eavesdropper BC with three degraded message sets, when the receivers exhibit a degradedness order. Next, we find an achievable rate-equivocation region using the rate splitting technique and indirect decoding. We show that for the two-receiver one-eavesdropper BC with three degraded message sets where we relax the secrecy condition at the second receiver, our coding scheme is optimal when the second receiver is a degraded version of the first receiver and it is less noisy than the third receiver.", "paper_title": "One-Receiver Two-Eavesdropper Broadcast Channel With Degraded Message Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000320866600008"}
