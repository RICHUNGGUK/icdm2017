Different configurations of ANN were used with different decision combination methods, including a neural combiner, to propose the model. The model was developed using the plant data collected over a period of fivemonths to predict steam temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate, using feed water pressure, feed water temperature, conveyor speed, and incinerator exit temperature as the input parameters. The predictive capability of the model is evaluated in terms of both correlation coefficient (R) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results observed from this work demonstrate that neural combiner and ANN-based MDES can efficiently predict the data on steam properties consistently, and that the model can serve as an efficient tool for monitoring boiler behavior under real-time conditions. Superiority of the proposed model over others under various scenarios is also demonstrated.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLE DECISION EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF A BOILER SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000363691000001"}
