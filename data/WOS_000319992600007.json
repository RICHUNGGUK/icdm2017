An approximation method is presented based on the Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) using B-splines. Four algorithms are proposed according to different cases of the boundary conditions. The solution surfaces can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations of simple and sparse structure. Examples are provided to illustrate that the proposed method is effective and flexible.", "paper_title": "An approximation method based on MRA for the quasi-Plateau problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000319992600007"}
