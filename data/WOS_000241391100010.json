In particular, we propose a generalized algorithme a trous, which is an extension of the algorithme a trous introduced for 1-D wavelet transforms. Using the proposed algorithm, as well as incorporating modified versions of directional filter banks, we construct the TI contourlet transform (TICT). To reduce the high redundancy and complexity of the TICT, we also introduce semi-translation-invariant contourlet transform (STICT). Then, we employ an adapted bivariate shrinkage scheme to the STICT to achieve an efficient image denoising approach. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits and potential of the proposed denoising approach. Complexity analysis and efficient realization of the proposed TI schemes are also presented.", "paper_title": "Translation-invariant contourlet transform and its application to image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100010"}
