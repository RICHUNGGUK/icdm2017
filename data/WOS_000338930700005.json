In this paper, we propose a generally applicable and designer-friendly specification strategy based on a generalized variant of Eilenberg's X-machine model of computation. Our approach, which extends existing approaches to SXM test-based verification, is arguably capable of modelling very general unconventional computations, and would allow implementations to be verified fully against their specifications.", "paper_title": "Specification, testing and verification of unconventional computations using generalized X-machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000338930700005"}
