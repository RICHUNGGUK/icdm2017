We consider the excitation of CELC by the electric and magnetic fields of microstrip lines and its resonance characteristics by the diagrams of effective permittivity (epsilon eff) and permeability (eff). A circuit model is obtained by the consideration of its coupling with the loaded microstrip line. We then realize a novel left-handed (LH) cell by the combination of the CELC resonator and a short circuited stub. It is designed by the least mean square method. We finally use the cascade connection of such LH cells for the design of a miniaturized narrow-band band-pass filter with high out of band rejection. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
