The weight of a subgraph of G is the sum of the weights of its vertices (edges). The MIN H-SUBGRAPH problem is to find a minimum weight subgraph isomorphic to H, if one exists. Our main results are new algorithms for the MIN H-SUBGRAPH problem. The only operations we allow on real numbers are additions and comparisons. Our algorithms are based, in part, on fast matrix multiplication. For vertex-weighted graphs with n vertices we obtain the following results. We present an O(n(t(omega,h))) time algorithm for MIN H-SUBGRAPH in case H is a fixed graph with h vertices and omega < 2.376 is the exponent of matrix multiplication. The value of t(omega, h) is determined by solving a small integer program. In particular, the smallest triangle can be found in O(n(2+1/(4-omega)) <= o(n(2.616)) time, the smallest K-4 in O(n(omega+1)) time, the smallest K-7 in O(n(4+3/(4-omega))) time. As h grows, t(omega,h) converges to 3h/(6 - omega) < 0.828h. Interestingly, only for h = 4, 5, 8 the running time of our algorithm essentially matches that of the (unweighted) H-subgraph detection problem. Already for triangles, our results improve upon the main result of [VW06]. Using rectangular matrix multiplication, the value of t(omega, h) can be improved; for example, the runtime for triangles becomes O(n(2.575)). We also present an algorithm whose running time is a function of m, the number of edges. In particular, the smallest triangle can be found in O(Tu((18-4 omega))/((13-3))) <= o(m(1.45)) time. For edge-weighted graphs we present an O(m(2-1/k) log n) time algorithm that finds the smallest cycle of length 2k or 2k - 1. This running time is identical, up to a logarithmic factor, to the running time of the algorithm of Alon et al. for the unweighted case. Using the color coding method and a recent algorithm of Chan for distance products, we obtain an O(n(3)/log n) time randomized algorithm for finding the smallest cycle of any fixed length.", "paper_title": "Finding the smallest H-subgraph in real weighted graphs and related problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500024"}
