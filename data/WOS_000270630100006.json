We propose a new heuristic and compare the results with existing popular heuristics for the problem. We also propose a method based on genetic algorithms to solve the problem. We present the worst case performance analysis of the proposed heuristic. We also consider the problem of minimizing the completion time variance of n jobs on in identical parallel machines in both restricted and unrestricted versions. A heuristic method and a method based on genetic algorithms are presented for both the cases and results of computational testing are provided. It is concluded that the proposed methods provide better results compared to existing methods for the single machine case as well as for the multi-machine case. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
