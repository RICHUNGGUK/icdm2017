What is the meaning of a time scatter in a measurement? What is the meaning of the correlated energy gap? Why should they combine to give a value greater or equal to a theoretical lower bound? In this paper, we discuss uncertainty in measurement from the computational point of view and introduce the archetype of a generic stochastic oracle to a Turing machine.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty in Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000365777000008"}
