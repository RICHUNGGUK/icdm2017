However, ultra high speed of optical networks makes it very hard to satisfy this rule-of-thumb, especially with limited choices of buffering in the optical domain, because optical RAM is under research and it is not expected to have a large capacity, soon. In this article, we evaluate the performance of our explicit congestion control protocol-based architecture designed for very small Optical RAM-buffered optical packet switched wavelength division multiplexing networks with pacing at edge nodes in order to decrease the required buffer size at core nodes. By using a mesh topology and applying TCP traffic, we evaluate the optical buffer size requirements of this architecture and compare with a common proposal in the literature.", "paper_title": "XCP-based transmission control mechanism for optical packet switched networks with very small optical RAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000269209500011"}
