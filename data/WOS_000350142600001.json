Therefore, finding an effective approach to discover data resources in order to promote better interactions between application communities or virtual organizations becomes a critical challenge. Traditional grid resource discovery models are mostly based on central and hierarchical architecture that can lead to bottlenecking with the expansion of the grid scale. Although the PeertoPeer (P2P) technique is integrated into the grid in order to improve the performance in recent years, each P2P structure still has drawbacks that require several compensatory strategies. In this paper, based on the unstructured supernodebased architecture from the P2P system, we design a structured logic resource tree in each domain in order to effectively alleviate the load on the supernode, and we propose a query recording learning algorithm based on this hybrid architecture to reduce traffic in the network and greatly shorten the response time. The model and algorithm are validated by simulations and compared with the traditional superpeer model and the floodingbased approach.
