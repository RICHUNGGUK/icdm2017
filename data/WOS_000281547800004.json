To protect clouds, providers must first secure virtualized data-center resources, uphold user privacy, and preserve data integrity. The authors suggest using a trust-overlay network over multiple data centers to implement a reputation system for establishing trust between service providers and data owners. Data coloring and software watermarking techniques protect shared data objects and massively distributed software modules. These techniques safeguard multi-way authentications, enable single sign-on in the cloud, and tighten access control for sensitive data in both public and private clouds.", "paper_title": "Trusted Cloud Computing with Secure Resources and Data Coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000281547800004"}
