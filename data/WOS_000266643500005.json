We empirically assessed and integrated four models to help in predicting smart phone adoption. The varying factors were combined and a survey was conducted in five sales branches of a delivery service company. Results of the analysis of the collected data show that the relationships amongst constructs were similar. Self-efficacy was a strong predictor of behavioral intention through attitude; after innovation, diffusion theory was added. Attitude towards smart phone adoption was found to be affected mainly by testability and organizational and environmental factors. We decided that an iterative approach to implementing smart phone adoption was effective. Managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
