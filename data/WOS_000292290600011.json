The 2009 HA model was obtained by virtually mutating the 1918 HA crystal structure based on A/Mexico City/MCIG01/2009(H1N1) segment 4 sequence. We found that human receptor molecule has no binding preference between the 2009 HA and the 1918 HA. In addition, among the four sugar moieties in the human receptor molecule, sialic acid contributes the most to the electrostatic and non-polar interaction energy during binding. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds between sialic acid and the surrounding residues in 1918 HA are preserved in 2009 HA. We also found that the mutated residues contribute to a more favorable binding of hemagglutinin to the human receptor molecule.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics studies of human receptor molecule in hemagglutinin of 1918 and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600011"}
