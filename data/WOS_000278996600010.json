By using the multiple clock phases of the DLL, the lock controller is able to indicate whether the delay time of the VCDL is within the correct locking range or not. A differentially controlled edge combiner is also proposed for the frequency multiplication. The antiharmonic DLL-based frequency multiplier, implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, occupies an active area of 0.043 mm(2), and dissipates 36.7 mW at 1.7 GHz. The measured root mean square jitter and peak-to-peak jitter for the multiplied output clock at 1.7 GHz are 2.64 and 16.8 ps, respectively.", "paper_title": "An Antiharmonic, Programmable, DLL-Based Frequency Multiplier for Dynamic Frequency Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000278996600010"}
