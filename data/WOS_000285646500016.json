This paper examines the relation between the integration scale matrix of next iteration and the current second moment matrix and finds that the convergence stability of the method can be improved by adjusting the relation between the two matrices instead of keeping them always proportional as proposed by previous methods. By estimating and updating the shape of the integration kernel and differentiation kernel in each iteration based on the anisotropy of the current second moment matrix, we propose a coarse-to-fine affine shape adaptation scheme which is able to adjust the pace of convergence and enable the process to converge smoothly. The feature matching experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains an improvement in convergence ratio and repeatability compared with the current schemes with relatively fixed integration kernel.", "paper_title": "A New Shape Adaptation Scheme to Affine Invariant Detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000285646500016"}
