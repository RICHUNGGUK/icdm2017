Although rural telecenters are becoming more common, developing content that's presented in local languages, relevant to users, and delivered in an immediately usable form is a challenge here and in rural areas across the globe. To address this, an agricultural portal for rural farmers in India uses innovative database systems and information retrieval techniques. In so doing, it both improves service and addresses connection costs and constraints.", "paper_title": "The aAQUA approach - Innovative Web 2.0 tools for developing countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000253543000010"}
