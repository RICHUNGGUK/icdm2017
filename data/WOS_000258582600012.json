In this article, we investigate the relations between users' motivation for using (i.e., trying out and continuing to use) a search engine and the engine's functional features. Based on Herzberg's two-factor theory (F. Herzberg, 2003; F. Herzberg, M. Bernard, & B. Snyderman,1959), the features can be categorized as hygiene factors and motivation factors. Hygiene factors support the query process and provide a basic \"task context\" for information seeking that allows users to access relevant information. Motivation factors, on the other hand, help users navigate (i.e., browse) and comprehend the retrieved information, related to the \"task-content\" aspect of information seeking. Given the consistent findings that hygiene factors induce work motivation for a shorter period of time, it is hypothesized that hygiene factors are more effective in attracting users; while motivation factors are more effective in retaining than in attracting users. A survey, with 758 valid participants, was conducted to test the hypotheses. The empirical results provide substantial support for the proposed hypotheses and suggest that the two-factor theory can account for the motivation for using a search engine.", "paper_title": "Motivation for using search engines: A two-factor model", "paper_id": "WOS:000258582600012"}
