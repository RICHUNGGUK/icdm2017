This paper expands the vision to new QoE acceptability for the future 5G networks and analyzes the impact of the main challenges of 5G on QoE. An efficient QoE estimation method tailored for 5G systems is also proposed based on the neural network (NN) approach. Due to their ability to fully learn the causal relationship between network parameters of quality of services (QoS) and the resulting QoE, NN can be suitable to gain QoE self-optimization for 5G. Again, new increasingly smart user devices will be delegated to handle the most burdensome tasks of ensuring user satisfaction.", "paper_title": "THE QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE PERSPECTIVE TOWARD 5G TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200004"}
