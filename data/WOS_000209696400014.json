We assume random arrival time for a new user within a frame, and consider discrete spreading factors as a practical case. We show that the optimum outer-loop SNR-target does not depend on the received number of paths (L-p), and neither is dependent on the Uniformly-distributed arrival time of new users. Furthermore, an increase in L-p reduces the sum-throughput and the achievable gain in sum-throughput through our optimization approach.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Design and Optimization of CDMA Networks in Frequency-Selective Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400014"}
