It is now accepted that the charged amino group is bound by a cation-pi interaction to a conserved tryptophan residue, and that the aromatic moiety is projected into a hydrophobic pocket deeply located inside the binding cleft. A hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, maybe a water molecule solvating this receptor subsite, contributes to further stabilize the nicotinic ligands. The position of this water molecule has been established by several X-ray structures of the acetylcholine-binding protein. In this study, we computationally analyzed the role of this water molecule as a putative hydrogen bond donor/acceptor moiety in the agonist binding site of the three most relevant heteromeric (alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 4) and homomeric (alpha 7) neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Our theoretical investigation made use of epibatidine 1 and deschloroepibatidine 2 as molecular probes, and was then extended to their analogues 3 and 4, which were subsequently synthesized and tested at the three target receptor subtypes. Although the pharmacological data for the new ligands 3 and 4 indicated a reduction of the affinity at the studied nAChRs with respect to reference agonists, a variation of the selectivity profile was clearly evidenced.", "paper_title": "Investigating the hydrogen-bond acceptor site of the nicotinic pharmacophore model: a computational and experimental study using epibatidine-related molecular probes", "paper_id": "WOS:000328207000005"}
