The model can be used to simulate the life cycle of a large batch of products and track products in operation and service phases with consideration of design and manufacturing phases. This provides some useful benefits - in particular, being able to generate composite results when the product life is subject to unpredictable events, which makes the system's behaviour non-linear. A case study is conducted through a domestic appliance in the field trial from a manufacturing company, and the results indicate that the model can enable developers or manufacturers to understand the behaviour and characteristics of products or systems in the future use and to predict the cost of any changes in the pattern of their life.", "paper_title": "A model-driven decision support system for product risk analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000283737900007"}
