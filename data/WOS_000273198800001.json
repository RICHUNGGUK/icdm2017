Our scheme adopts the approach that the private key associated with an identity rather than the master key of PKG is shared. Comparing to the-state-of-art work by Back and Zheng, our scheme has the following advantages. (1) The round-complexity of the threshold signing protocol is Optimal. Namely, during the signing procedure, each party broadcasts only one message. (2) The communication channel is optimal. Namely, during the threshold signing procedure, the broadcast channel among signers is enough. No private channel between any two signing parties is needed. (3) Our scheme is Much more efficient than the Back and Zheng scheme in term of computation, since we try our best to avoid using bilinear pairings. Indeed, the private key of an identity is indirectly distributed by sharing a number x(ID) is an element of Z(q)*, which is much more efficient than directly sharing the element in the bilinear group. And the major computationally expensive operation called distributed key generation protocol based on the bilinear map is avoided. (4) At last, the proactive security can be easily added to our scheme.", "paper_title": "One-Round ID-Based Threshold Signature Scheme from Bilinear Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000273198800001"}
