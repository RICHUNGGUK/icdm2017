While simulation of full-scale catalytic reactors would require domain decomposition based parallelism and use of multiple central processing units, significant performance enhancement can be achieved by fully utilizing the compute resources available within each node in emerging architectures. Here, a serial reacting flow solver was used as a starting point. Performance was enhanced using multi-threading for acceleration of surface chemistry, material properties calculations, and species equation solvers, and using graphical processing units for acceleration of the linear solvers and pre-conditioners. Of the two test cases presented here, the largest test case entails steady-state calculations for catalytic methane-air combustion with 22 reaction steps and 19 species within a 13-channel catalytic monolith reactor discretized using 313,872 control volumes. For this particular test case, a speed-up factor of about 4.5 over serial calculations is noted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
