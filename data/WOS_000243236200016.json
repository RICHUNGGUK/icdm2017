The parameters' tuning is accomplished by an unsupervised method based on quantitative measures. This procedure has been validated via user panel tests. Furthermore, the spray approach has faster performances than the path-wise one. Tests and results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Random spray Retinex: A new Retinex implementation to investigate the local properties of the model", "paper_id": "WOS:000243236200016"}
