The model is based on the winding function approach, which makes no assumption for sinusoidal symmetrical distribution of the machine windings. A new method of calculation of synchronous machine inductances is presented, in which the space harmonics produced by the windings are readily taken into account. Simulation results for internal faults on the stator windings of a generator at no load and at load are compared with experimental results to verify the accuracy of the proposed model.
