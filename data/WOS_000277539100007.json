Design/methodology/approach - The spin fields of systemic yoyos are used to explain the interactions between electric and magnetic fields and between elementary particles. Findings - The concepts of potential pits (traps) and ramparts for electrons and those of nuclear, atomic, and molecular bonds are introduced. These concepts are employed successfully to describe the topological structure of atoms. Originality/value - Other than providing a brand new model for the internal structure of atoms, this paper establishes a deeper understanding of the general systemic yoyo mode.", "paper_title": "The physical structure of atoms: a new model", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100007"}
