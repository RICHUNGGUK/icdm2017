The responses to diverging ramp stimuli have not been previously studied, but convergence and divergence responses to other stimuli often show different behaviors. Converging and diverging 6 degrees/s ramps were presented to four subjects over a stimulus range of 2 degrees-20 degrees. Step-like behavior was seen in both convergence and divergence responses, but the dynamics was different. For divergent ramps, the peak velocity of each step-like movement decreased as the stimulus moved away from the subject, but no such trend was observed for convergence. The step-like behavior seen in divergence supports the hypothesis that the transient component is active in disparity divergence similar to the transient component proposed for convergent movements. However, the transient component in divergence may be dependent on stimulus position which is not the case for convergence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
