However, classical description logics are limited when dealing with imprecise concepts and roles, thus providing the motivation for this work. In this paper, we present a type-2 fuzzy attributive concept language with complements (ALC) and provide its knowledge representation and reasoning algorithms. We also propose type-2 fuzzy web ontology language (OWL) to build a fuzzy ontology based on type-2 fuzzy ALC and analyze the soundness, completeness, and complexity of the reasoning algorithms. Compared to type-1 fuzzy ALC, type-2 fuzzy ALC can describe imprecise knowledge more meticulously by using the membership degree interval. We implement a semantic search engine based on type-2 fuzzy ALC and carry out experiments on real data to test its performance. The results show that the type-2 fuzzy ALC can improve the precision and increase the number of relevant hits for imprecise information searches.", "paper_title": "Type-2 fuzzy description logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000292506500008"}
