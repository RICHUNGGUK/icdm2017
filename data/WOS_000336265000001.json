Furthermore, decisions on balancing these aspects that also change with time have to deal with a high degree of uncertainty. No general methodology for modular branding has currently been published. A methodology with that aim is proposed and prototyped in a real but anonymized industrial case. The presented task is to select standard original equipment manufacturer engines for six brands of self-propelled walk-behind lawn mowers. Selection is based on a set of calculated utility scores and known costs. The utility of an engine with a certain performance level and set of features is specific to each brand. This article presents a first step in developing a general methodology for modular branding and the organizational learnings of using the proposed methodology in an industrial setting.", "paper_title": "On a methodology for component selection in modular branding: An industrial pilot study", "paper_id": "WOS:000336265000001"}
