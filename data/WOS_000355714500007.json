Combining the techniques above, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Algorithm based on Cluster and Hop-tree (BEACH) for single mobile sink in event-driven wireless sensor networks. It calculates a quasi-optimal position for the mobile sink at proper time according to event information, moves the mobile sink to the position efficiently without data loss, builds a network hop-tree and clusters nodes in a distributed manner with tolerable overhead, aggregates data within clusters, transmits data reliably, and maintains a unimpeded route structure effectively. It achieves the energy efficiency for both sink movement and data collection and prolongs network lifetime. Experiments show that BEACH can improve the performance of event-driven wireless sensor networks greatly.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Algorithm based on Cluster and Hop-tree for Single Mobile Sink in Event-driven Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355714500007"}
