It was designed and developed in the European project LAMBDA (Linear Access to Mathematics for Braille Device and Audio-synthesis). This system is made up of two main functional components: the LAMBDA code and the mathematical editor. The research project is funded by the European Union in the framework of the IST Programme. It started in 2002 and will end in 2006.", "paper_title": "LAMBDA: A European system to access mathematics with Braille and audio synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000176"}
