A risk evaluation framework using the Imprecise Data Envelopment Analysis (IDEA) method is proposed to be applied to operations of Korean Army helicopters. The risks pertaining to pilots, missions and helicopters are evaluated based on bounded data, and pilots are appropriately allocated to missions and helicopters using goal programming with bounded risk scores. Using bounded data, two risk allocation models are developed to be used with the expected value and lower/upper limit values, resulting in improved reliability of the solutions. Numerical experiments show reasonable solutions and valuable information for risk management. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
