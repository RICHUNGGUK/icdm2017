New SM-based modeling techniques are proposed that are easy to implement entirely in the Agilent ADS framework. A simplified SM-based model description is discussed. Using a two-section transformer example, we show how the modeling accuracy is affected by the model flexibility. Tables, diagrams, and flowcharts are developed to help in understanding the concepts. This makes the SM modeling concept available to engineers through widely used commercial software. Our approach permits the creation of library models that can be used for model enhancement of microwave elements. Frequency-interpolation techniques are discussed and implemented. A set of four different SM-based models is presented along with corresponding implementations in the ADS schematic for a microstrip right-angle bend and a microstrip shaped T-junction. We use a three-section transformer to illustrate the implementation procedure in full details. We apply the technique to a more complicated HITS filter modeling problem. Fine-model data is obtained from Sonnet's em. We discuss the relation between the model complexity and accuracy as well as further improvement of the model.
