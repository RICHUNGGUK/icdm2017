A client-peer node retrieves the sub-streams from multiple parent-peer nodes, combining them into the original video stream. Each client-peer node has two buffers, a synchronization buffer and a cache buffer, and arriving data blocks are synchronized at the synchronization buffer and then forwarded to the cache buffer. In this buffering system, data-block synchronization is important to guarantee high video quality. In this paper, we consider the effect of churn on the performance of data-block synchronization scheme with which data blocks are simultaneously forwarded just after all the data blocks composing a macro data block arrive at the synchronization buffer. It is assumed that data blocks belonging to a sub-stream arrive at the client-peer node according to an interrupted Poisson process. The synchronization buffer is modeled as a multiple-buffer queueing system with homogeneous interrupted Poisson processes, and the mean forwarding interval is derived. Numerical examples show that the average forwarding interval increases as parent-peer nodes leave more frequently.", "paper_title": "Effect of node churn on frame interval for peer-to-peer video streaming with data-block synchronization mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000301869900004"}
