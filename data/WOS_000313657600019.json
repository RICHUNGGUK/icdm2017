Following this purpose, in this paper, two methods are proposed to synchronize general forms of chaotic systems with application in secure communication. The first method uses radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) as a controller. All the parameters of the RBFNN are derived and optimized via particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). In order to increase the robustness of the controller, in the second method, an integral term is added to the RBF neural network gives an integral RBFNN (IRBFNN). The coefficients of the integral term and the parameters of IRBFNN are also derived and optimized via PSO and GA. The proposed methods are applied to the famous Lorenz chaotic system for secure communication. The performance and control effort of the proposed methods are compared with the recently proposed PID controller optimized via GA. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison to the recent one in improving synchronization while using smaller control effort.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of general chaotic systems using neural controllers with application to secure communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600019"}
