MFI-Tree employs tree structure which is beneficial for the browsing application, and retrieves the last level cluster nodes in retrieval application to improve the performance. Aggressive Decided Distance for kNN (ADD-kNN) search algorithm is designed because it can effectively reduce the distance to prune the search space. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFI-Tree and ADD-kNN algorithm have the advantages over sequential scan in performance.", "paper_title": "MFI-Tree: An Effective Multi-feature Index Structure for Weighted Query Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000013"}
