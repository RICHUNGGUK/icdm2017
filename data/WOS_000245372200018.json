To ensure that the reliability and operating frequency are well maintained, the reserve scheduling guidelines always specify that the reserve quantity and response rate should meet some precise levels. This paper presents an algorithm to estimate the frequency response characteristic, beta, of an isolated system online. The real-time estimated beta could be gainfully used for the instant when the update of reserve scheduling is needed. A contingency reserve scheduling according to a series of frequency restoration processes is also proposed to ensure the effectiveness of the reserve response. Test results showing that the scheduling method in simulated conditions, and on actual operating data, was confirmed to be feasible to ensure the power system's reliability.", "paper_title": "A real-time contingency reserve scheduling for an isolated power system", "paper_id": "WOS:000245372200018"}
