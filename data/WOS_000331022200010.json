An expression for the run length distribution of the DS (X) over bar chart is derived, by conditioning and taking parameter estimation into account. Since the shape and the skewness of the run length distribution change with the magnitude of the mean shift, the number of Phase-I samples and sample sizes, it is shown that the traditional chart's performance measure, i.e. the average run length, is confusing and not a good representation of a typical chart's performance. To this end, because the run length distribution is highly right-skewed, especially when the shift is small, it is argued that the median run length (MRL) provides a more intuitive and credible interpretation. From this point of view, a new optimal design procedure for the DS (X) over bar chart with known and estimated parameters is developed to compute the chart's optimal parameters for minimizing the out-of-control MRL, given that the values of the in-control MRL and average sample size are fixed. The optimal chart which provides the quickest out-of-control detection speed for a specified shift of interest is designed according to the number of Phase-I samples commonly used in practice. Tables are provided for the optimal chart parameters along with some empirical guidelines for practitioners to construct the optimal DS (X) over bar charts with estimated parameters. The optimal charts with estimated parameters are illustrated with a real application from a manufacturing company. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
