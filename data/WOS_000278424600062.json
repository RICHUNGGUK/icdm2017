The technology has thus become an essential research issue. In particular, location-based services (LBSs) on mobile devices can convey location related information to individual users, thus helping users to obtain helpful and adaptive information. Accordingly, this study presents an intelligent location-based service system to provide local news with summaries to personal handheld PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) device based on the user's location. First, this study proposes a novel multi-document news summarization scheme based on fuzzy synthetic evaluation. This scheme identifies a key paragraph in a news story as a summary based on three evaluation scores, in order to dispatch news information to mobile devices with small screens. Furthermore, to sense a user's location precisely, the study also develops a practicable location-awareness scheme based on GPS (Global Positioning System) signals to identify the position of a user in the Taiwan area. Finally, an intelligent location-based mobile news service system with automatic news summarization for location-based news services was implemented by combining the proposed multi-document news summarization and user location schemes. The proportion of satisfactory news summaries is up to 86%, and the accuracy of the user location-awareness scheme is up to 90%, according to experimental results in multi-document summarization and user location identification. These experimental results show that the proposed system can be successfully applied in real-world applications for personalized location-based news services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
