This paper describes the design and use of Sloop, the first image retrieval system for individual animal identification incorporating crowd-sourced relevance feedback. Sloop's iterative retrieval strategy using hierarchical and aggregated matching and relevance feedback consistently improves deformation and correspondence-based approaches for individual identification across several species. Its crowdsourcing strategy is successful in utilizing relevance feedback on a large scale. Sloop is in operational use. The user experience and results are presented here to facilitate the creation of a community-based individual identification system for conservation planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
