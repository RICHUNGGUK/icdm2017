MemoNote uses annotation patterns to deduce annotation semantics from the form chosen by the teacher. We specify the annotation context, its capture from elements of the teaching situation and we model it with ontologies. Annotation context model is then directly integrated into the previous pattern formalism in MemoNote, in order to obtain context-aware pattern. Therefore, MemoNote can deduce annotation semantics from the annotation form depending on the current context.", "paper_title": "Taking teaching context into account for semantic annotation patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400050"}
