A complementary study was carried out and was verified by comparisons with the available experimental data that were obtained at corresponding conditions with the aim of achieving an improved understanding of fluid dynamics of the studied processes. The computations were conducted by OpenFOAM C++, and the physical realism of the incoming turbulent boundary layer was secured by employing random field generation algorithm. The cavity was computed with a sinusoidal transpiration boundary condition on its floor. The results from URANS computation and LES were compared and described qualitatively and quantitatively. There is a particular interest for acquiring the turbulent structures from the present numerical data. The numerical methods can capture vortical structures including a hairpin (primary) vortex and secondary structures. However, the present computations confirmed that URANS and LES are capable of predicting current flow field with a more detailed structure presented by LES data as expected.
