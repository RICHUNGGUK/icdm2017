Thus, mechanisms to efficiently allocate the available spectrum are of interest. In this paper, we model the radio spectrum allocation problem as a sealed-bid reserve auction, and propose SMALL, which is a Strategy-proof Mechanism for radio spectrum ALLocation. Furthermore, we extend SMALL to adapt to multiradio spectrum buyers, which can bid for more than one radio. We evaluate SMALL with simulations. Simulation results show that SMALL has good performance in median to large scale spectrum auctions.", "paper_title": "A Strategy-Proof Radio Spectrum Auction Mechanism in Noncooperative Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319407200006"}
