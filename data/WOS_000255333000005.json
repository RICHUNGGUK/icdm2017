We propose one way of the safety evaluation witch consist on the extraction of feared scenarios in the Petri net model of the system. We use ESA_PetriNet tool (Extraction Scenarios & Analyzer by Petri Net model) that was developed in the aim of extraction of feared scenarios in computer-controlled systems. These scenarios characterize the sequences of actions leading to dangerous situations. The taking into account of the failures, the temporal constraints and partially the continuous dynamic (by temporal abstraction) of the system makes it possible to respect the order of appearance of the events in the generated scenarios.", "paper_title": "Extraction of critical scenarios in a railway level crossing control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333000005"}
