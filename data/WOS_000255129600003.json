Some of these letters share common primary shapes, differing only in the number of dots and whether the dots are above or below the primary shape. In this paper, a new concept of using dots in a cursively handwritten Farsi/Arabic word is introduced for lexicon reduction and a fast method for extracting dots is presented. The technique involves extraction and representation of number and position of dots from off-line handwritten words to eliminate unlikely candidates. Experimental results on a set of 12,000 handwritten word images yield a lexicon reduction of 93% with accuracy of 85%. The proposed lexicon reduction algorithm achieves the speedup factor of 2 as well as 13% improvement in recognition rate.
