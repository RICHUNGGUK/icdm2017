The advantages offered by using MA-based Network Management (MANM) include reduction in network traffic, intelligence, automation, fault-tolerance, and robustness. From our previous research, we have developed a security-focused MA framework (MASAM) for achieving active network management. This paper aims to examine the implication of network traffic load when implementing network security management by using MANM through four simulated security attack event cases. Evaluation results indicate that the MANM approach can enhance performance and security when dealing with various security attacks.", "paper_title": "A comparison of Mobile Agent and SNMP message passing for network security management using event cases", "paper_id": "WOS:000242563100014"}
