To determine the state of a simulated system, existing treatments involve the computation of cumulative phase factors which involve quadratic dependencies. We present a simple formalism in which Pauli operators are represented using displacement operators in discrete phase space, expressing the evolution of the state via linear transformations modulo D <= 2d. We thus obtain a simple proof that simulating stabilizer circuits on n qudits, involving any constant number of measurement rounds, is complete for the complexity class coMod(d)L and may be simulated by O(log(n)(2))-depth circuits for any constant d >= 2.", "paper_title": "A LINEARIZED STABILIZER FORMALISM FOR SYSTEMS OF FINITE DIMENSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304700006"}
