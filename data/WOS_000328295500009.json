The DBRs were connected with each other through slits that act as chemical bonds, resulting in a strong exchange current interaction between these DBRs. The polymer structure has side atoms connected to the backbone. A TM wave can be coupled into these side atoms, and a coherent plasmon wave can be excited along the polymer chain. This introduces a resonance peak in the optical transmission spectrum. The dispersion property of such a coherent mode agrees well with the theoretical calculation results.", "paper_title": "Excitation of coherent plasmon modes in a polymer structure with side resonators", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500009"}
