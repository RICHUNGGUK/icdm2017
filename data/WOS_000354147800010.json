It relies on a generic framework for the comparison of diffusion probabilities on the sphere, sampled from the underlying models. We demonstrate that this method, combined to dimensionality reduction through a principal component analysis, allows for more robust detection of lesions on simulated data when compared to classical tensor-based analysis. We then demonstrate the efficiency of this pipeline on the longitudinal comparison of multiple sclerosis patients at an early stage of the disease: right after their first clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and three months later. We demonstrate the predictive value of ODF-based scores for the early detection of lesions that will appear or heal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
