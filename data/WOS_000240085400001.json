We attach some constraints to ant colony model and present a parallel constrained ant colony model to solve the image registration problem. The problem is represented by a directed graph so that the objective of the original problem becomes to find the shortest closed circuit on the graph under the problem-specific constraints. A number of artificial ants are distributed on the graph and communicate with one another through the pheromone trails which are a form of the long-term memory guiding the future exploration of the graph. The algorithm supports the parallel computation and facilitates quick convergence to the optimal solution. The performance of the proposed method as compared to those of the genetic-based approaches is very promising.", "paper_title": "A constrained ant colony algorithm for image registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400001"}
