We investigate the property of commuting for aggregation operators in connection with their relationship to bisymmetry. In case of bisymmetric aggregation operators we show a sufficient condition ensuring that two operators commute, while for bisymmetric aggregation operators with neutral element we even provide a full characterization of commuting n-ary operators by means of unary distributive functions. The case of associative operations, especially uninorms, is considered in detail.", "paper_title": "Aggregation operators and commuting", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000002"}
