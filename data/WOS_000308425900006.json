Moreover, most previous experiments in this field can report only partial contact information since not everyone participating in the experiment carries a sensor device. Previously collected contact traces have significantly contributed to the development of more realistic human mobility models. This in turn has influenced proposed routing algorithms for Delay Tolerant Networks where human contacts play a vital role in message delivery. By exploiting time-spatial properties of contact graphs as well as the popularity and social information of mobile nodes, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the missing parts of contact graphs where only a subset of nodes are able to sense contacts.
