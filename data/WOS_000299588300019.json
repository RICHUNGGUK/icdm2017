The eta(T) pairing on supersingular curves over GF(3(n)) is particularly popular since it is efficiently implementable. Taking into account the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone attack, the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in GF(3(6n)) becomes a concern for the security of cryptosystems using eta(T) pairings in this case. In 2006, Joux and Lercier proposed a new variant of the function field sieve in the medium prime case, named JL06-FFS. We have, however, not yet found any practical implementations on JL06-FFS over GF(3(6n)). Therefore, we first fulfill such an implementation and we successfully set a new record for solving the DLP in GF(3(6n)), the DLP in GF(3(6.71)) of 676-bit size. In addition, we also compare JL06-FFS and an earlier version, named JL02-FFS, with practical experiments. Our results confirm that the former is several times faster than the latter under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "Solving a 676-Bit Discrete Logarithm Problem in GF(3(6n))", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300019"}
