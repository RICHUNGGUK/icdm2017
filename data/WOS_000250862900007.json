However, the number of pairwise comparisons necessary in real problems often becomes overwhelming. In such cases, generally the experts are not able to answer all questions and consequently sparse judgement matrix is generated which caused \"equal ranks\" and \"rank reversal\" based on AHP method. In this paper, a new ranking system (FARSJUM) is developed for such sparse judgment matrix. The system is constructed on fuzzy rules and fuzzy reasoning methods. The numerical example of world cup soccer tournament is brought to clarify the performance of the developed system comparing with AHP method in ranking the sparse judgment matrices.", "paper_title": "Farsjum, a fuzzy system for ranking sparse judgment matirces: A case study in soccer tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862900007"}
