Their performances, however, are mixed as for certain concepts, the single-instance representations of images are more suitable, while for others, the multiple-instance representations are better. Thus this paper explores a unified learning framework that combines the multiple-instance and single-instance representations for image annotation. More specifically, we propose an integrated graph-based semi-supervised learning framework to utilize these two types of representations simultaneously. We further explore three strategies to convert from multiple-instance representation into a single-instance one. Experiments conducted on the COREL image dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed integrated framework and the conversion strategies.", "paper_title": "Image Annotation by Graph-Based Inference With Integrated Multiple/Single Instance Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000275922000004"}
