The model is represented as a 13-tuple consisting of the components of the FPN, two functions that give semantic meanings to the scheme and a set of contradictions. For the scheme, called the knowledge representation scheme based on the fuzzy Petri nets theory (KRFPN) the fuzzy inheritance and fuzzy recognition-inference procedures based on the dynamical properties of the FPN, are described in detail. The upper-time complexity of both the proposed inference algorithms is O(nm), where n is the number of places (concepts) and m is the number of transitions (relations) in the scheme. Illustrative examples of the fuzzy inheritance and the fuzzy recognition algorithms for the knowledge base, designed by the KRFPN, are given.", "paper_title": "INFERENCE PROCEDURES FOR FUZZY KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000262294800002"}
