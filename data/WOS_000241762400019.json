For the end-to-end QoS guaranteed service, we model the control plane and user plane considering the WLAN and 3GPP interworking network. And we propose the QoS parameter/class mapping and DPS packet scheduler. By the simulation results, DPS can provide the low end-to-end delay of voice traffic, even though a traffic load increases by 96%. Especially, the end-to-end delay of voice is much smaller when the QoS parameter/class mapping and DPS are applied to the interworking network.(1)", "paper_title": "End-to-end QoS guaranteed service in WLAN and 3GPP interworking network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400019"}
