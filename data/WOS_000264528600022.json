In this paper, we propose a learning method for combining the predictions of a set of classifiers. The method described in this paper uses a genetic-based version of the correspondence analysis for combining classifiers. The correspondence analysis is based on the orthonormal representation of the labels assigned to the patterns by a pool of classifiers. In this paper instead of the orthonormal representation we use a pool of representations obtained by a genetic algorithm. Each single representation is used to train a different classifiers. these classifiers are combined by vote rule. The performance improvement with respect to other learning-based fusion methods is validated through experiments with several benchmark datasets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
