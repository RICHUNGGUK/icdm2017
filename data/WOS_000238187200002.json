Based on a previous tool called PARTNET, by Conte and Pedone [2], the agents of the system have goals to achieve and actions that lead to these goals, which must be performed by other agents. When choosing preferred partners, the agents may have different strategies (utilitarians, subtantialists and misers). In PART-NET, partnerships were restricted to two agents, and the authors have shown that some social hypotheses were validated, i.e., that in heterogeneous societies, utilitarians should have the best net benefit, followed by substantialists, then my misers. By using the PartNet++ simulator in several new experiments, it is shown in this work that results that are valid for partnerships between two agents can be generalized for multiple agents.", "paper_title": "PartNET++: Simulating multiple agent partnerships using dependence graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238187200002"}
