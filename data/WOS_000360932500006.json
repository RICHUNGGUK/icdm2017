The method is based on comparing automatically found boundaries with ground truth. Hence, the method is more accurate and able to grasp the evaluation problem in a way more similar to the evaluation conducted by a human being. Traditional methods often fail on grading segmentation algorithms, particularly those of relatively similar qualities. We define a fuzzy membership function that measures the degree to which the segments obtained by an automatic procedure are similar to the results of a correct segmentation. To identify a pair of equivalent segments, we set a fuzzy alignment function that points the pairs of segments obtained by an automatic segmentation with the corresponding segments from a correct segmentation. Speech segmentation is an example where the presented approach was applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
