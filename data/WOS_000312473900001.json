In addition, the computational cost-sensitive group-feature selection criterion combined with the sequential forward selection is applied in order to obtain a useful and computationally inexpensive quasi-optimal feature set for the purpose of accelerating the classification time. The classification time was reduced by up to 57% and the overall accuracy was significantly improved in comparison with the one-against-all and one-against-one support vector machine methods with sequential forward selection (paired t-test, p<0.001). The reduction of classification time as well as the improvement of overall accuracy demonstrates promise for the proposed classification method to be adopted in various real-time and on-line image-based clinical applications.
