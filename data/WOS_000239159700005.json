The circuit technology investigated to improve the resistance against fault attacks is asynchronous logic. Specific properties of asynchronous circuits make them inherently resistant against a large class of faults. An analysis of their behavior in the presence of faults shows that they are an interesting alternative to design robust systems. A behavior diagnosis enables us to propose hardening techniques that improve fault tolerance and resistance. They are applied at design time and aim at exploiting quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) circuit properties to significantly harden the architecture with a very low area overhead and a reasonable performance penalty. To validate these techniques, a hardened DES crypto-processor is presented. The countermeasures are evaluated using laser beam fault injection.", "paper_title": "Designing resistant circuits against malicious faults injection using asynchronous logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000239159700005"}
