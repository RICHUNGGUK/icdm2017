However, CR requires a flexible and adaptive physical layer in order to perform the required tasks efficiently. In this article, CR systems and their requirement of a physical layer are discussed, and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique is investigated as a candidate transmission technology for CR. The challenges that arise from employing OFDM in CR systems are identified. The cognitive properties of some OFDM-based wireless standards also are discussed to indicate the trend toward a more cognitive radio.", "paper_title": "OFDM FOR COGNITIVE RADIO: MERITS AND CHALLENGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000265487000002"}
