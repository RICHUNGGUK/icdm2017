In this paper, we study the integration of VGI in Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) systems, which allow the integration and analysis of large volumes of good quality data. Using a real-world scenario, we highlight some similarities and differences among these two types of systems. We define a conceptual quality-oriented framework for warehousing and OLAPing VGI data. In particular, to address precision and credibility problems related to VGI data, we propose two new ETL operators: aggregation based on the VGI credibility and a filter based on the historical precision. We also define a new spatio-multidimensional model that provides decision makers with a global description of the quality of the aggregated data. To validate our proposal, we extend the classical relational SOLAP architecture using a standard VGI system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
