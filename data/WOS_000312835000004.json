This framework predicts and allocates the appropriate data bandwidth for motion estimation under a limited bandwidth supply to fit a dynamically changing bandwidth supply. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve 66% and 41% memory bandwidth savings while maintaining an equivalent rate-distortion performance and meeting real-time targets, when compared with conventional approaches for low-motion and high-motion D1 (704 x 576)-size video, respectively. The final implementation costs 122 K gate counts with TSMC 0.13-mu m CMOS technology and consumes 74 mW of power for D1 resolution at 30 frames/s which is 40% of that achieved in previous designs.", "paper_title": "Algorithm and Architecture Design of Bandwidth-Oriented Motion Estimation for Real-Time Mobile Video Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000004"}
