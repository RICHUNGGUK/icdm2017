The authors examined the influence of these radiative devices on energy absorption and also their effects as reflective metal surfaces when incoming radiofrequency energy was present. Design/methodology/approach - The research was carried out using electromagnetic modeling based on the finite difference time domain method and the calculations were performed to determine the electric field and specific absorption rate. The implanted antenna operated in the Medical Implant Communication Service band. The incoming external electric fields considered included different frequency bands covering most current telecommunications standards. Findings - Levels of absorbed energy with and without the implanted device. Practical implications - The paper offers an analysis of results and comparison with current dosimetric standards and guidelines for limiting electromagnetic exposure. Originality/value - The paper studies the interactions of implanted antennas with biological tissues, taking into account two behaviors radiative and passive.", "paper_title": "Subcutaneous implanted antennas: interaction with biological tissues", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700011"}
