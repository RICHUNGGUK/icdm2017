We introduce three indexes: distance, changing range, and changing level that have great influence on the searching efficacy of neighborhood search techniques. These insights can help develop more efficient heuristic algorithms. As a result, we have developed an iterated neighborhood search (INS) algorithm that is very simple but that demonstrates good performance when tested against 176 benchmark instances under different scales (small, medium, and large), with 25 instances having been updated with new best known solutions in the computing experiments.
