However, data center operations require a set of sophisticated skills (e. g., command-line-interface), resulting in a high operational cost. In this demo, to reduce the data center operational cost, we design and build a novel cloud data center management system, based on the concept of 3D gamification. In particular, we apply data visualization techniques to overlay operational status upon a data center 3D model, allowing the operators to monitor the real-time situation and control the data center from a friendly user interface. This demo highlights: (1) a data center 3D view from a First Person Shooter (FPS) camera, (2) a run-time presentation of visualized infrastructures information. Moreover, to improve the user experience, we employ cutting-edge HCI technologies from multi-touch, for remote access to Cloud3DView.", "paper_title": "Cloud3DView: An Interactive Tool for Cloud Data Center Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900066"}
