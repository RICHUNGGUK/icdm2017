We implement a Robust Routing algorithm (RRT) with an aim of satisfying networking goals such as load balancing, routing robustness to the range of traffic demand matrices or to the traffic changes caused by uncertain traffic demands. We conduct simulation experiments on range of topologies that includes, real network and randomly generated synthetic network topologies. Simulation results show marked improvement in the maximum link utilization compare to Open Shortest Path First. K-shortest path implementation of RRT can be extended for Multi Protocol Level Switching.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Routing with Robustness to the Variation in Traffic Demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000300354400005"}
