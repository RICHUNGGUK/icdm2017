SEBM supports three different modalities that are visual, auditory and textual modalities for video database systems and it can dissolve these three modalities within a single structure. This dissolving procedure is a mimic of human interpretation regarding video data. The SEBM video data model is used to answer content-based, spatio-temporal and fuzzy queries about video data. A SEBM prototype system is developed to evaluate the practical usage of the SEBM video data model when storing and querying the video data.", "paper_title": "Structural and event based multimodal video data modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200028"}
