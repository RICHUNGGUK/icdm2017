Much attention has been devoted to understanding fault rupture propagation in uncemented soil. However, the effects of a pre-existing fracture in cemented soil on surface fault ruptures are not fully understood. This paper describes a numerical parametric study to investigate the mechanism of normal fault rupture propagation through cemented clay. Special attention was paid to the effect of the location (or tip depth) of a pre-existing fracture on the mechanism. The numerical model and model parameters adopted were verified through two centrifuge model tests. The results show that a zone of influence consisting of a tensile failure zone and a differential settlement zone was induced by normal faulting in cemented clay both with and without a pre-existing fracture. The width of this zone of influence increased with the tip depth of the pre-existing fracture. The effects of the tip depth of a pre-existing fracture on the width of the zone of influence were more significant when the tip was located at a shallow depth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
