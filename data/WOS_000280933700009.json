Its parameters are estimated by fitting the model to real data from Spanish Ministry of Health. Predictions about the future behavior of the alcohol consumption in Spain are presented using this model. Results are applied to estimate the economic costs (sanitary and non-sanitary) assumed by Spanish society that are derived from this consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
