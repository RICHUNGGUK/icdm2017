Based on the disruption management, to deal with the disruption in the logistics system, disruption events in logistics scheduling are classified by the effect factors: route disruption events, vehicle disruption events, goods disruption events, and mixed disruption events. The whole processes of disruption events treatment need three steps, which is capturing, identifying and resolving. A vehicle monitoring and dispatching system is proposed to monitor and schedule the vehicles in logistics, and a decision support system to manage the disruption events. After analyzing the system function to handle the disruption, the frame of decision support system for disruption management in logistics is designed. Especially, the disruption event processing models are described in detail.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM OF DISRUPTION MANAGEMENT IN LOGISTICS SCHEDULING", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400010"}
