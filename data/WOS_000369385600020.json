In this paper, a new method based on beam search algorithm for Chinese WSD is proposed. By mining potential knowledge between phrase and semantic category in a sentence, this approach can construct its semantic network. It searches an optimal semantic category sequence from a Chinese sentence's semantic network with beam search algorithm, so that correct meanings of ambiguous words can be found from the optimal sequence. Experiments show that a better WSD performance is gotten.", "paper_title": "Chinese Word Sense Disambiguation Based on Beam Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600020"}
