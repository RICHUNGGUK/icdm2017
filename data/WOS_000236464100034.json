We show that it is decidable for a given visibly pushdown automaton whether it is equivalent to a visibly counter automaton, i.e. an automaton that uses its stack only as counter. In particular, this allows to decide whether a given visibly pushdown language is a regular restriction of the set of well-matched words, meaning that the language can be accepted by a finite automaton if only well-matched words are considered as input.", "paper_title": "Regularity problems for visibly pushdown languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000236464100034"}
