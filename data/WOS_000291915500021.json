The proposed SAFNC system is composed of a computation controller and a robust controller. The computation controller containing a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) identifier is the principle controller. The SOFNN identifier is used to online estimate the compound uncertainties with the structure and parameter learning phases of fuzzy neural network (FNN), simultaneously. The structure-learning phase consists of the growing of membership functions, the splitting of fuzzy rules and the pruning of fuzzy rules, and thus the SOFNN identifier can avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error tuning procedure for determining the network structure of fuzzy neural network. The robust controller is used to attenuate the effects of the approximation error so that the synchronization of chaotic systems is achieved. All the parameter learning algorithms are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure network convergence as well as stable synchronization performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results are illustrated in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
