Most research activities in the past aimed towards applications as broadcast news, meetings, conversational telephony, and automatic multimodal data annotation, where SD may be performed off-line. However, a recent research focus is human-computer interaction (HCI) systems where SD must be performed on-line, and in real-time, as in modern gaming devices and interaction with large displays. Often, such applications further suffer from noise, reverberations, and overlapping speech, making them increasingly challenging. In such situations, multimodal/multisensory approaches can provide more accurate results than unimodal ones, given a data stream may compensate for occasional instabilities of other modalities. Accordingly, this paper presents an on-line multimodal SD algorithm designed to work in a realistic environment with multiple, overlapping speakers. Our work employs a microphone array, a color camera, and a depth sensor as input streams, from which speech-related features are extracted to be later merged through a support vector machine approach consisting of VAD and SSL modules. Speaker identification is incorporated through a hybrid technique of face positioning history and face recognition. Our final SD approach experimentally achieves an average diarization error rate of 11.48% in scenarios with up to three simultaneous speakers, and is able to run 3.2 x real-time.", "paper_title": "Multimodal Multi-Channel On-Line Speaker Diarization Using Sensor Fusion Through SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685400002"}
