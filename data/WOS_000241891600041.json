The parameters that we consider are: the rate of increase of the sizes of the receptive fields, the overlap among the receptive fields, the size of the central receptive field, and the number of directions along which the centers of the receptive fields are placed. We show that the learning algorithm is very robust to changes in parameter values and that the recognition rates are higher when using a retina-like distribution of receptive fields compared to uniform distributions.", "paper_title": "Biologically inspired Bayes learning and its dependence on the distribution of the receptive fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600041"}
