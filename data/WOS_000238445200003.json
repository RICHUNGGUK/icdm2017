We build on previous works of Sahai and De Santis et al. and construct a scheme that we believe is the easiest to understand to date. In particular, it is only slightly more involved than the Naor--Yung encryption scheme that is secure against passive chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA1). We stress that the focus of this paper is on simplicity only.", "paper_title": "A simpler construction of CCA2-secure public-key encryption under general assumptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238445200003"}
