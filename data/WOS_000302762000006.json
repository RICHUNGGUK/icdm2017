However, most of those remote user authentication schemes on ECC suffer from different attacks and can not provide provable security. Therefore. we propose an ID-based remote mutual authentication with key agreement scheme on ECC in this paper. The proposed scheme not only provides mutual authentication but also supports a session key agreement between the user and the server. The scheme also provides the known session key security, the perfect forward secrecy, the no key-compromise impersonation, the no unknown key-share and the no key control. Compared with the related works, the proposed scheme is more efficient and practical for mobile devices. We also give a security proof under the random oracle.
