In this context, the main resources of interest are execution time, space and communication/synchronisation costs. There has recently been significant progress in resource analysis technology, notably in type-based analyses and abstract interpretation. At the same time, parallel and distributed computing are becoming increasingly important. This paper synthesises progress in both areas to survey the state-of-the-art in resource analysis for parallel and distributed computing. We articulate a general model of resource analysis and describe parallel/distributed resource analysis together with the relationship to sequential analysis. We use three parallel or distributed resource analyses as examples and provide a critical evaluation of the analyses. We investigate why the chosen analysis is effective for each application and identify general principles governing why the resource analysis is effective.
