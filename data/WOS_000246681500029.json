Inference for the fixed effects under the assumption of independent normally distributed errors with constant variance is shown to be robust when the errors are either non-gaussian or heteroscedastic, except when the error variance depends on a covariate included in the model with interaction with time. Inference is impaired when the errors are correlated. In the latter case, the model including a random slope in addition to the random intercept is more robust than the random intercept model. The use of Cholesky residuals and conditional residuals to evaluate the fit of a linear mixed model is also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
