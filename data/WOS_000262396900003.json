An example of such a pattern is \"a high temperature reading in the vicinity of at least four high-pressure readings\". We devise protocols for 'in-network' evaluation of this class of queries, aiming at the minimization of power consumption. In addition, we develop cost models that suggest the appropriateness of each protocol, based on various factors, including selectivity of query elements, energy requirements for sensing, and network topology. Finally, we experimentally compare the effectiveness of the proposed solutions on an experimental platform that emulates real sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Retrieval of Spatial Join Pattern Instances from Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262396900003"}
