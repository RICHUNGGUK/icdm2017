Hybrid channels have been prone to suffering from transmission error in the forms of packet erasures due to congestion at wired networks, as well as bit errors caused by the wireless interference or fading on wireless links. We present a recursion approach to transmission distortion estimation over hybrid channels in successive frames with the prediction mode. This approach is feasible for video transmission applications as it is capable of online estimation of transmission distortion on received decoded video. Our extensive simulation results on six well-known video sequences demonstrate that our proposed approach is accurate and robust. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
