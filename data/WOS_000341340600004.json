Identified practices are summarised according to the incident management phases of ISO/IEC 27035. The study shows that current practice and experience seem to be in line with the standard. We identify some inspirational examples that will be useful for organisations looking to improve their practices, and highlight which recommended practices generally are challenging to follow. We provide suggestions for addressing the challenges, and present identified research needs within information security incident management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
