So the cutoff frequencies of filters made by CDMSs can be controlled. The proposed CDMSs have wider stopband characteristic and sharper transition from passband to stopband than defected microstrip structure (DMS). To show the behavior variations of the effective inductance, the DMS and CDMSs have been analyzed, compared, and their design parameters are formulated. These parameters are necessary for a fast filter design procedure. Also. the models of DMS and CDMSs using the very simple lumped element forms are presented according to the physical parameters. The results of the proposed models have been compared with those obtained by full wave analysis. To verify the proposed DMS model, the comparison in response not only hits been considered in amplitude but also in phase of all S-parameters of proposed model and full wave analysis. It is obvious that the stopband is enhanced by periodically cascading the DMS. Surviving of EMC aspects between DMS, DIGS, and CDMS is considered and compared. Finally. the theoretical results are validated by comparison with simulations of the structures and experimental results. The simulations from modeling results are found to be in good agreement with the full wave analysis and measurement results in the range of 0.5-35 GHz. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.
