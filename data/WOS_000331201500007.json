On the other hand, faster time-to-market motivates the investigation of programmable implementations. This paper presents a novel design of a programmable turbo decoder as an application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) using transport triggered architecture (TTA). The processor architecture is designed in such a manner that it can be programmed with high level language to support different suboptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms in a single TTA processor. The design enables the designer to change the algorithms according to the frame error rate performance requirement. A quadratic polynomial permutation interleaver is used for contention-free memory access and to make the processor 3GPP LTE compliant. Several optimization techniques to enable real time processing on programmable platforms are introduced. The essential parts of the turbo decoding algorithm are designed with vector function units. Unlike most other turbo decoder ASIPs, high level language is used to program the processor to meet the time-to-market requirements. With a single iteration, 68.35 Mbps decoding speed is achieved for the max-log-MAP algorithm at a clock frequency of 210 MHz on 90 nm technology.", "paper_title": "Design of a transport triggered vector processor for turbo decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500007"}
