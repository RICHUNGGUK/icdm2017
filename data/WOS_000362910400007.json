Big data applications are expected to provide a lot of benefits and convenience to our lives. Cloud computing is a popular infrastructure that has the resources for big data processing. As the number of mobile devices is fast increasing, mobile cloud computing is becoming an important part of many big data applications. In this article, we propose a novel MapReduce-based framework to process geo-dispersed big data in mobile cloud architecture. The proposed framework supports simple as well as complex operations on geo-dispersed big data, and uses various data aggregation schemes to satisfy different application requirements.", "paper_title": "Processing Geo-Dispersed Big Data in an Advanced MapReduce Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000362910400007"}
