As shown by Gallai, Roy and Vitaver, this edge orienting problem is equivalent to finding the chromatic number of a graph. We study various properties of edge orienting methods in the context of local search for graph coloring. We then exploit these properties to derive four tabu search algorithms, each based on a different neighborhood. We compare these algorithms numerically to determine which are the most promising and to give potential research directions.", "paper_title": "On edge orienting methods for graph coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000243140800005"}
