A new spiking function has been proposed in the non-linear integrate and fire model and its inter spike interval is derived and used in the Wavelet Radial Basis Neural Network for the classification of gene expression data. The proposed model is termed as Spiking Wavelet Radial Basis Neural Network (SWRNN). The classification accuracy has been evaluated on various benchmark gene expression datasets. A comparative performance evaluation of the proposed model has been made with the Wavelet Radial Basis Neural Network (WRNN) and the standard available results in terms of classification accuracy. The comparison of the proposed SWRNN and WRNN has also been done in terms of execution time. It has been observed that the increase in classification accuracy for the proposed SWRNN is highly statistically significant for most of the gene expression datasets when compared with WRNN and the standard results. Thus incorporating a spiking function in an artificial neural network can make it more powerful for classification.
