To exploit LSC images for quantitative physiological measurements, we developed an approach that implements controlled spatial averaging to reduce the detrimental impact of the noise and improve measurement sensitivity. By this approach, spatial resolution and measurement sensitivity can be traded-off in a flexible way depending on the quantitative prospect of the study. As an application, detectability of the cardiac activity from LSC images of forearm using power spectrum analysis is studied through the construction of spatial activity maps offering a window on the blood flow perfusion and its regional distribution. Comparisons with results obtained with signals of laser Doppler flowmetry probes are performed.", "paper_title": "Assessing spatial resolution versus sensitivity from laser speckle contrast imaging: application to frequency analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000309356000002"}
