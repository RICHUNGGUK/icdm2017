When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. In this paper we present an extensive axiomatic study of ranking systems. In particular, we consider two fundamental axioms: Transitivity, and Ranked Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. Surprisingly, we find that our impossibility result holds under various restrictions on the class of ranking problems considered. However, when transitivity is weakened, an interesting possibility result is obtained. In addition, we show a complete axiomatization of approval voting using ranked IIA.", "paper_title": "Axiomatic foundations for ranking systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254618500002"}
