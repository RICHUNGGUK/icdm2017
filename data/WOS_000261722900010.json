The proposed procedure combines geologic knowledge, coded well data logs stored in a hydrogeologic georeferenced database, geographic information system (GIS) and 3D calculation software to reconstruct the detailed distribution of the subsoil's hydrogeologic parameters. The calculations may apply to any subsoil part, bounded by one or more surfaces. This methodological approach may be applied to diverse investigation depths, vertical intervals detailed to varying extents, on a local or regional scale. Employing great quantities of well data logs, recorded in different ways and distributed across large areas, has enabled significant spatial sedimentologic reconstruction. Two groups of parameters were considered: textural (percentages of gravel, sand and clay) and hydrogeologic (hydraulic conductivity and porosity). In terms of sedimentology, the method reconstructs spatial heterogeneity both along cross-sections and for an entire user-defined volume to analyze the sediments' energy functions and their distribution; deposition rates are proportional to process intensity and distribution with time. In terms of hydrogeology, detailed 3D hydrogeologic structural data provide detailed input for hydrogeologic models in groundwater resource management and planning, such as for transport models.
