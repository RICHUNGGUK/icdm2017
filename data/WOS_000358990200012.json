However, VoIP service is vulnerable to several potential security threats. Moreover, existing IP-based security solutions are unable to inspect call setup information. In this paper, we propose a VoIP-aware attack-detection scheme. The proposed scheme is able to detect VoIP network attacks including VoIP DoS and SPAM. It can detect VoIP DoS attacks with low false negatives using a statistics-based detection algorithm and can recognize SPAM with low false positives using a caller behavior-based detection algorithm. We have included experimental results to confirm the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "VoIP-aware network attack detection based on statistics and behavior of SIP traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000358990200012"}
