In this paper we consider two variants of this optimization problem: (1) the rectangles are allowed to be reoriented freely while restricting them to be parallel to each other, and (2) one rectangle is restricted to be axis-parallel but the other rectangle is allowed to be reoriented freely. For both of the problems, we present O(n(2) log n)-time algorithms using O(n) space.", "paper_title": "COVERING A POINT SET BY TWO DISJOINT RECTANGLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292166600004"}
