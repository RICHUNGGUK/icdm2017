Therefore so-called non-precise numbers are necessary to describe measurement results. Non-precise numbers are special fuzzy subsets of the set of real numbers. For vector quantities so-called fuzzy vectors are the best up to date model for measurement results of continuous vector quantities. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
