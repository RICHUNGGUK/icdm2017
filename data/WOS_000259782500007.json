An algebraic framework for schema matching is developed in this paper. First, based on universal algebra, we propose a meta-meta structure for schema, which is named multi-labeled schema. This definition has a distinctive feature: it is able to formally describe any particular style of schemas, and transforms a schema and other available information into a finite structure over specific signature. Later, we introduce a formal definition of schema matching that is called multivalent matching. Then, we formulize SMP as a schema homomorphism problem, and prove that SMP is equivalent to finding a semantic homomorphism from one schema to another. These results lead to the main contribution of this paper: an algebraic framework for SMP. This framework builds the algorithm model for SMP. Thirdly, we show a classification of schema matching based on the algebraic framework. Finally, we discuss the relations between matching cardinality and subclasses of schema homomorphism.", "paper_title": "An algebraic framework for schema matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000259782500007"}
