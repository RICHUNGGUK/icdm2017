To help a user to find proper information, web news search functions are devised and developed. Although those search engines provide some solutions, users still suffer from reading huge amounts of hyperlinks. Also, users of new media now have great expectations of what they can see on the Web. To provide better user satisfaction, we proposed a story model (story structures) that can be dynamically instantiated for different user requests from various multi-modal elements. The proposed story model defines four domain-independent story types. We compared traditional web news search functions and our story model by using usability test. The result shows that our multimedia presentation methodology is significantly better than the current search functions.", "paper_title": "A new methodology for information presentations on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000088"}
