Maximal designed distances of primitive Hermitian dual containing q(2)-ary BCH codes (narrow-sense or non-narrow-sense) are determined by a careful analysis of properties of cyclotomic cosets. Non-narrow-sense BCH codes which achieve these maximal designed distances are presented, and a sequence of nested non-narrow-sense BCH codes that contain these BCH codes with maximal designed distances are constructed and their parameters are computed. Consequently, new nonbinary quantum BCH codes are derived from these non-narrow-sense BCH codes. The nonbinary quantum BCH codes presented here have better parameters than those quantum BCH codes available in the literature.", "paper_title": "HERMITIAN DUAL CONTAINING BCH CODES AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW QUANTUM CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304700003"}
