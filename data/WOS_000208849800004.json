Here we add new arguments to our original approach and also extend some of our recent constructions and results to more general orbits of polynomial iterations which may involve distinct polynomials as well. Using this construction we design a new class of hash functions from iterations of polynomials and use our estimates to motivate their \"mixing\" properties.", "paper_title": "Pseudorandom numbers and hash functions from iterations of multivariate polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849800004"}
