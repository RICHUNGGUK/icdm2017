It provides all the functionality to create continued fractions, in particular k-periodic or limit k-periodic fractions, to compute approximants, make use of continued fraction tails, perform equivalence transformations and contractions, and much more. The package, developed in Maple, includes a library of more than 200 representations of special functions, of which only 10% can be found in the 1964 NBS Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs and Mathematical Tables by M. Abramowitz and I. Stegun.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 895: A Continued Fractions Package for Special Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000268474100003"}
