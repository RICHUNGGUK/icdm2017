In this paper we consider preferences over discrete domains, and show that for a certain class of simple and intuitive qualitative preference statements, one can always generate compact value functions consistent with these statements. These value functions maintain the independence structure implicit in the original statements. For discrete domains, these representation theorems are much more general than previous results. However, we also show that it is not always possible to maintain this compact structure if we add explicit ordering constraints among the available outcomes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
