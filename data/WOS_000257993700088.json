Thus, recent efforts have applied application layer multicast to implement Such applications by organizing the multicast group in an overlay (virtual), peer-to-peer network. Such a communication scheme can be regarded as a broadcasting problem with degree and delay constraints in the overlay network. The degree and delay-constrained broadcasting problem with minimum-cost appears to be NP-complete. This study proposes an ant colony-based algorithm to solve the difficult broadcasting problem and compares it with some related methods. The results of a series of simulations show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
