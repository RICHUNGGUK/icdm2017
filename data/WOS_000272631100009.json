In this study we tested whether manuscripts that were accepted by Angewandte Chemie International Edition (one of the prime chemistry journals worldwide) received the first citation after publication faster than manuscripts that were rejected by the journal but published elsewhere. The results of a Cox regression model show that accepted manuscripts have a 49% higher hazard rate of citation than rejected manuscripts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
