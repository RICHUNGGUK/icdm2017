Here the stations and section tracks of the railway network are respectively regarded as the nodes and edges of the network model. Using the model proposed in this paper, we measure the distribution of trains and the mean waiting time of trains etc. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can be successfully used for the simulation of railway network. Some phenomena observed in real railway networks can be reproduced, such as the characteristic behavior of train movement. A comparison with real data for the Netherlands (i.e., the Dutch railway network) is included. It supports the practical values of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A weighted network model for railway traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000241565400009"}
