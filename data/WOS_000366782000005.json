Such systems require means for surveillance that involves a type of sensor system that may identify entities that behave in an unusual way. However, this is not sufficient as means for determination of entities that seemingly are behaving in a normal way but whose activities somehow relate to the first category, must be determined. Means for the support of the operators must also be available by the surveillance system. In this work, an approach to a surveillance system with a Slow Intelligence systems controller for incident handling using a situation-based recommendations Handbook, is proposed and discussed.
