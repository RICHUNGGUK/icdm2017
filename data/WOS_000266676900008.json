The jets are generated by periodically oscillating inlet velocities in stationary vocal tracts. The jets are computed by solving the 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations by a high order finite difference method, which has been constructed to be strictly stable for linear hyperbolic and parabolic problems. Vortex dynamics is investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of confined pulsating jets in human phonation", "paper_id": "WOS:000266676900008"}
