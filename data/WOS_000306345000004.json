So far, many researches have been done to index such values to support fast retrieval. Still, many existing indexing schemes are suffering from performance degradation due to the curse of dimensionality problem. As an alternative, heuristic algorithms have been proposed to calculate the answer with 'high probability' at the cost of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new hash tree-based indexing structure called tertiary hash tree for indexing high-dimensional feature data. Tertiary hash tree provides several advantages compared to the traditional extendible hash structure in terms of resource usage and search performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed index structure achieves outstanding performance.", "paper_title": "Tertiary hash tree-based index structure for high dimensional multimedia data", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000004"}
