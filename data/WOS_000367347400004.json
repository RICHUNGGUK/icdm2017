After developing the principal physical aspects (in the longitudinal dimension), we describe an abstract model in the form of a collection of hybrid automata, together with design requirements to be met by an ideal controller. We discuss simplifications and assumptions that make this model amenable to verification and validation tools such as SpaceEx. To enable experimentation with different prototypical controllers and user behaviours in concrete scenarios, we also develop a simple simulation framework using digital time.", "paper_title": "On the Control of Self-Balancing Unicycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000367347400004"}
