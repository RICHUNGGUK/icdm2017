The hybrid algorithm was able to determine the structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network simultaneously. In this algorithm, adaptive crossover and mutation probability were used to accelerate the genetic speed and avoid the occurrence of prematurity. The modal frequencies of a glass/epoxy laminates beam with varying assumed delamination sizes and locations were computed using finite element method and fed into the wavelet neural network to predict the delamination location and its extent. The simulation demonstrates that the wavelet neural network based on hybrid hierarchy genetic algorithm is robust, promising and converges very fast. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
