First, the relationship of projection coefficients between high-resolution and low-resolution images using PCA is investigated. Then based on this analysis, a high resolution global face image is constructed from a low resolution one. Next a high-resolution residue is derived based on the similarity between the projections on high and low resolution residue training sets. Finally by combining the global face and residue in high resolution, a high resolution face image is generated. Also the recursive and two-stage methods are proposed, which improve the results of face image enhancement. Extensive experiments validate the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "An innovative face image enhancement based on principle component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203800001"}
