In this paper, an R package, edcc (economic design of control charts), which provides a numerical method to find the optimum chart parameters is presented using the unified approach of the economic design. Also, some examples are given to illustrate how to use this package. The types of the control chart available in the edcc package are (X) over bar, CUSUM (cumulative sum), and EWMA (exponentially-weighted moving average) control charts.", "paper_title": "edcc: An R Package for the Economic Design of the Control Chart", "paper_id": "WOS:000315019600001"}
