Herein, we further consider a more general case, two-party bi-input PFE, where P-2 also participates in the PFE by contributing a private input y. The research in this general case is of great value not only in theory but also in practice. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose the first constant-round two-party bi-input PFE protocol, which is with linear complexity and without relying on universal circuit or fully homomorphic encryption.
