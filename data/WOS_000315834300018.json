To facilitate system design engineers to express their various behavioral requirements, a uniform behavior modeling approach is proposed based on SysML. A set of new constructs are proposed which compose the uniform behavior modeling profile. Based on the profile, the hybrid behavior of the mechatronic system can be uniformly represented in a multi-view and hierarchical way. Moreover, the language- and tool-dependent simulation related information is also described based on SysML as the complement part of the uniform behavior model, which can be transformed to different simulation platforms based on the triple graph grammar (TGG). In this way, the system-level design of the mechatronic system is simulated and verified automatically in the early design stage. Finally, the method is implemented and an example is given to illustrate the whole process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
