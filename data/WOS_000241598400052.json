The process to establish the predicates is based on the topological and geometrical analysis of spatial data. These predicates are handled by a set of rules, which are used to find the relations between geospatial objects. Moreover, the rules aid the searching of several features that compose the partition of topographic maps. For instance, in the case that any road intersects with other, we appreciate that a connection relation exists between different destinies, which can be accessed by these roads. Furthermore, the rules help us to know each possible access for this case. Therefore, this description assists in the tasks of geospatial data interpretation (map description) in order to provide quality information for spatial decision support systems.", "paper_title": "Spatial data description by means of knowledge-based system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400052"}
