Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using reference signal is a useful tool for extracting a desired independent component (IC). Reference signal is served as a priori information to conduct the one-unit ICA to converge to the local extreme point related to a desired IC. There are two methods can perform ICA using reference signal, namely ICA with reference (ICA-R) and fast ICA with reference signal (FICAR). This paper intends to fill in a gap in the previous studies to give comparisons of those methods systematically. Moreover, we also provide useful improvements to the two methods. Firstly, we propose a improved algorithm to fix the flaw in the previous FICAR. Secondly, for ICA-R, we propose a criterion to select appropriate distance measurement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
