Each agent has a singled out place interpreted as a communication port with ingoing edges labelled with send (p(1), ... , p(n)) and receive (q(1), ... , q(m)) commands, where p(i), q(j) are names of ports of its interlocutors. Every such edge exits a transition emiting a request for send or receive message. A transmission channel between the agent and its intelocutors is established when its port holds a send or receive command, while ports of its interlocutors hold respective (matching) communication commands. This gives rise to communication between the agent and its interlocutors, after which the channel is disrupted: hence floating channels. Some behavioural properties of such network system are examined, their decision complexity, deadlock and fairness in their number.", "paper_title": "Floating Channels Between Communicating Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000343008800003"}
