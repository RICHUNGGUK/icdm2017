As one of the key members of IoT, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has seen steep advancement in communication technologies. Now, vehicles can easily exchange safety, efficiency, infotainment, and comfort-related information with other vehicles and infrastructures using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We leverage on the cloud-based VANETs theme to propose cyber-physical architecture for the Social IoV (SIoV). SIoV is a vehicular instance of the Social IoT (SIoT), where vehicles are the key social entities in the machine-to-machine vehicular social networks. We have identified the social structures of SIoV components, their relationships, and the interaction types. We have mapped VANETs components into IoT-A architecture reference model to offer better integration of SIoV with other IoT domains. We also present a communication message structure based on automotive ontologies, the SAE J2735 message set, and the advanced traveler information system events schema that corresponds to the social graph. Finally, we provide the implementation details and the experimental analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system as well as include different application scenarios for various user groups.", "paper_title": "Toward Social Internet of Vehicles: Concept, Architecture, and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200025"}
