In these type of systems, the overall system performance may be affected due to congestion, and therefore parallel programming stacks must be assisted by quality-of-service (QoS) support to meet application requirements and to deal with application dynamism. In this paper, we present a hardware-software QoS-driven reconfigurable parallel computing framework, i.e., the NoC services, the runtime QoS middleware API and our ocMPI library and its tracing support which has been tailored for a distributed-shared memory ARM clustered NoC-based MPSoC platform. The experimental results show the efficiency of our software stack under a broad range of parallel kernels and benchmarks, in terms of low-latency interprocess communication, good application scalability, and most important, they demonstrate the ability to enable runtime reconfiguration to manage workloads in message-passing parallel applications.", "paper_title": "QoS-Driven Reconfigurable Parallel Computing for NoC-Based Clustered MPSoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900042"}
