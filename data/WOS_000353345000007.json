The homogeneous, two-layer and three-layer concentric half-split CDRAs have been discussed separately. The effect of antenna parameters such as layer arrangement, geometrical parameters, and probe length are investigated. To validate the results, two-layer and three-layer concentric half-split CDRA have been fabricated using commercially available microwave laminates. In each case, the input reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, and antenna gain are simulated and measured. Good agreements between simulated and measured results have been obtained.
