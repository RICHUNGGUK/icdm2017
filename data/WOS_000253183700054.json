Modeling the fluid dispensing process is important because it enables us to understand the process behavior, as well as determine the optimum operating conditions of the process for a high yield, low cost and robust operation. Previous studies of fluid dispensing mainly focus on the development of analytical models. However, an analytical model for fluid dispensing, which can provide accurate results, is very difficult to develop because of the complex behavior of fluid dispensing and high degree of uncertainty associated with the process in a real world environment. In this project, Takagi-Sugeno neural fuzzy systems, is introduced to model the fluid dispensing process for microchip encapsulation. Two process models were generated for the two quality characteristics; encapsulation weight and encapsulation thickness, respectively. Validation tests were performed. The test results were compared with approaches based on statistical regression, neural network and fuzzy regression. From a comparison of the results, it can be concluded that among these the TS neural fuzzy system is the best approach for modeling fluid dispensing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
