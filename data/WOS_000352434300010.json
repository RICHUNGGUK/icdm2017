In particular, suppose we are given samples of the form where is an unknown but non-singular matrix, is a random variable whose coordinates are independent and have a fourth order moment strictly less than that of a standard Gaussian random variable and is an -dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance : We give an algorithm that provably recovers and up to an additive and whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in and . To accomplish this, we introduce a novel \"quasi-whitening\" step that may be useful in other applications where there is additive Gaussian noise whose covariance is unknown. We also give a general framework for finding all local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately finding just one) and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we find the columns of one by one via local search.", "paper_title": "Provable ICA with Unknown Gaussian Noise, and Implications for Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000352434300010"}
