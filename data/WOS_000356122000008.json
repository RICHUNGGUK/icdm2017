The proposed algorithm incorporates the bats' habitat selection and their self-adaptive compensation for Doppler effect in echoes into the basic BA. The bats' habitat selection is modeled as the selection between their quantum behaviors and mechanical behaviors. Having considered the bats' self-adaptive compensation for Doppler effect in echoes and the individual's difference in the compensation rate, the echolocation characteristics of bats can be further simulated in NBA. A self-adaptive local search strategy is also embedded into NBA. Simulations and comparisons based on twenty benchmark problems and four real-world engineering designs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and stability of NBA compared with the basic BA and some well-known algorithms, and suggest that to improve algorithm based on biological basis should be very efficient. Further research topics are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
