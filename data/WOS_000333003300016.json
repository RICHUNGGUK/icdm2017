Approximations of various orders based on the Post-Widder formula are constructed, and the accuracy of the corresponding Dirichlet series approximating the compliance function is assessed. It is shown that the accuracy can often be substantially increased by appropriate modifications of the discrete retardation times used by the Dirichlet series. Practical hints regarding the choice of the discrete retardation times and the order of integration used in the evaluation of the compliance coefficients are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
