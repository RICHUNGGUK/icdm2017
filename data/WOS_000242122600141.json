Private photo is one of the most important types of personal contents. In many of conventional approaches for private photo searching, a user is required to assign annotations manually to the private photos of the user by oneself. However, assigning annotations is tedious for a user. This paper introduces an automatic indexing approach for private photo searching based on c-mail message archive. Many of e-mail messages of a user may describe some experiences of the user. In this approach, the temporal expressions are extracted from an e-mail message, and they are used for estimate the relativity between a term in the e-mail message and a temporal interval in the personal time space of a user. The weight of a term to a private photo is calculated on the basis of the relativity and the granularity of the temporal interval.", "paper_title": "An antomatic indexing approach for private photo searching based on e-mail archive", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600141"}
