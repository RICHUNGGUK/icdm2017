The pitch contour of the whole Mandarin syllable is used as a unit type for pitch conversion. The syllable pitch contours are first extracted from the source and target utterances. Time normalization and moving average filtering are then performed on them. These preprocessed pitch contours are classified to generate the source and target tone codebooks, and by associating them, a Mandarin tone mapping codebook is finally obtained in terms of speech alignment. Experiment results show that the proposed method for voice conversion can deliver a satisfactory performance in Mandarin speech.", "paper_title": "Mandarin voice conversion using tone codebook mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100101"}
