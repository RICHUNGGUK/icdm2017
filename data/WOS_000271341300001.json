The honeycomb core is modelled as a single solid layer of equivalent material properties. Analytical and numerical (finite element) homogenization approaches are used to compute the effective properties of the honeycomb core. A general kinematic model (unified formulation) has been adopted and used for the modelling of honeycomb sandwich panel submitted to the bending test. A comparative study of major classes of representative theories has been considered. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of displacement, stress have been presented and discussed.
