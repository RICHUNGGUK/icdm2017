In particular, the case of yogurt production, a representative food process, in a real-life dairy facility is studied in detail. The problem in question is mainly focused on the packing stage, whereas timing and capacity constraints are imposed with respect to the batch stage to ensure the generation of feasible production plans. A novel mixed discrete/continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming model, based on the definition of families of products, is proposed. Timing and sequencing decisions are taken for product families rather than for products; thus, reducing significantly the model size. Additionally, material balances are realized for every particular product, permitting the detailed optimization of inventory and operating costs. Packing units operate in parallel and share resources. Qualitative as well as quantitative objectives are considered. Several industrial case studies, including also some unexpected events scenarios, have been solved to optimality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
