To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic performance index. In addition, the repetitive-motion-planning scheme could incorporate the joint physical limits such as joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic program (QP). As QP real-time solvers, the aforementioned three kinds of neural networks all have piecewise-linear dynamics and could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of strictly-convex quadratic-programs. Furthermore, the neural-network based RMP scheme is simulated based on a four-link planar robot manipulator. Computer-simulation results substantiate the theoretical analysis and also show the effective remedy of the joint angle drift problem of robot manipulators. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
