They are formed by mirrors which concentrate direct incident sunlight in a pipe where an oil is able to accumulate thermic energy flows. From the control point of view, the objective consists of making the outlet oil temperature to track a reference signal by manipulating the oil flow, in the possible presence of fast disturbances caused by passing clouds. Significant levels of uncertainty motivate the use of adaptive methods. A confrontation between data-driven and model-driven adaptive control algorithms for distributed collector solar fields is made using experimental results and algorithm structure. A trade-off is shown to exist; i.e. by incorporating more information about plant dynamics, the control algorithms yield an increased performance, but they become plant dependent.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control of distributed collector solar fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238000005"}
