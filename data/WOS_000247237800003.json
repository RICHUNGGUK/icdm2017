Also using the mathematical concept of best approximation in Hilbert spaces, a predistorter structure is suggested to compensate both AM/AM and AM/PM conversion characteristics of a solid state power amplifier. To verify the effects of this linearization we generally consider it in a QAM signal transmission in an additive white Gaussian noise channel and the results are compared with the ideal linear case. It is shown that the presented method is able to compensate the nonlinearity up to a good extent. The performance of proposed method has been analyzed in frequency domain through spectrum simulations. To prove the validity of presented method we have made similar considerations on continuous spectrum.", "paper_title": "A modified model and linearization method for solid state power amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000247237800003"}
