Existing methodologies for ontology development are complex and they require technical knowledge that business users and developers don't poses. By introducing ontology completeness indicator developer is guided throughout the development process and constantly aided by recommendations to progress to next step and improve the quality of ontology. In evaluating the ontology, several aspects are considered; from description, partition, consistency, redundancy and to anomaly. The applicability of the approach was demonstrated on Financial Instruments and Trading Strategies (FITS) ontology with comparison to other approaches.", "paper_title": "Facilitating Ontology Development with Continuous Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000285982300005"}
