In this paper a CLSC network is investigated that involves four echelons in a forward direction including suppliers, manufacturer, distribution center and demand market, and three echelons in a backward direction including disposal, rework and collection centers. This paper presents a bi-objective model in order to design a network of bi-directional facilities in logistics network under uncertainties. Its objectives are to minimize the total costs as well as the total defective rate, disposal rate and pollution production rate. To solve the model, a hybrid solution approach is applied that combines fuzzy possibilistic programming and fuzzy multi-objective programming. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the validity of the model and applicability of the proposed solution approach, numerical experiments and the related sensitivity analysis are provided. Finally, the conclusion is provided.", "paper_title": "A hybrid fuzzy approach for the closed-loop supply chain network design under uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600036"}
