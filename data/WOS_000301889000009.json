In this paper, we provide the means for efficiently analyzing and exploring large amounts of semantic data by combining the inference power from the annotation semantics with the analysis capabilities provided by OLAP-style aggregations, navigation, and reporting. We formally present how semantic data should be organized in a well-defined conceptual MD schema, so that sophisticated queries can be expressed and evaluated. Our proposal has been evaluated over a real biomedical scenario, which demonstrates the scalability and applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
