The user's five extremities (head, hands and feet) are extracted, labeled and tracked after silhouette segmentation. As they are the minimal number of points that can be used in order to enable whole body gestural interaction, we will henceforth refer to these features as crucial points. Features are subsequently labelled using 3D triangulation and inter-image tracking. The crucial point candidates are defined as the local maxima of the geodesic distance with respect to the center of gravity of the actor region that lie on the silhouette boundary. Due to its low computational complexity, the system can run at real-time paces on standard personal computers, with an average error rate range between 4% and 9% in realistic situations, depending on the context and segmentation quality.", "paper_title": "3D posture estimation using geodesic distance maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000255866300005"}
