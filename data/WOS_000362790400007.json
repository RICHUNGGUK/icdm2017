They found 14 determinants drawing from interviews with practitioners whose experience exceeds 280 projects. The authors compared their data with prior results from well-developed countries and concluded that determinants and their criticality across the lifecycle depend on the level of economic development. The authors discussed implications and provided recommendations.", "paper_title": "Determinants of Enterprise System Adoption Across the System Lifecycle: Exploring the Role of Economic Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000362790400007"}
