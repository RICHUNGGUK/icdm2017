The difference between the proposed neural network and the conventional Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN) is connection weights between the hidden layer and the output layer which are replaced by a local linear model in the LLRBFN. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with hunter particles is introduced for training the LLRBFN. The proposed methods have been applied for prediction of financial time-series and the result shows the feasibility and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A local linear radial basis function neural network for financial time-series forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000283087200009"}
