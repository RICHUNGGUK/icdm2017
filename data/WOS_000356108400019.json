Design: Meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the association between CD28 polymorphism and cancer. Two authors selected identified studies, extracted, and analyzed the data independently. Results: Individuals carrying a T allele (TT homozygotes and TT+TC heterozygotes) at rs3116496 had a lower incidence of cancer than carriers of a C allele. Subgroup analysis showed that this association held true for Asians, but not Europeans. Conclusion: CD28 polymorphism, rs3116496, contributes to cancer susceptibility in the case of multiple cancers.
