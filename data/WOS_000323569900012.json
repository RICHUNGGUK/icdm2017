Unity power factor and low harmonic distortion are achieved by adapting NLC control with a variable slope ramp. This ramp is created through a slope comparison without any dividers. The proposed method not only achieves a high power factor, but also efficiently simplifies complexity of integrated circuit realization. A 400-W PFC boost rectifier is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed NLC control. The highest power factor reaches to 99.9% with input voltage of 120 V/60 Hz, and the lowest input current harmonic distortion is 4.267%.", "paper_title": "A Simple Implementation of Nonlinear-Carrier Control for Power Factor Correction Rectifier With Variable Slope Ramp on Field-Programmable Gate Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900012"}
