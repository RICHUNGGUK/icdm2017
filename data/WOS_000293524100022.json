Our algorithm exploits the multiscale nature of this optimal transport problem. We iteratively simplify the target using Lloyd's algorithm, and use the solution of the simplified problem as a rough initial solution to the more complex one. This approach allows for fast estimation of distances between measures related to optimal transport (known as Earth-mover or Wasserstein distances). We also discuss the implementation of these algorithms, and compare the original one to its multiscale counterpart.", "paper_title": "A Multiscale Approach to Optimal Transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100022"}
