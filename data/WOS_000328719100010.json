In this paper, we show how the first and second Zagreb indices of rooted product of graphs are determined from the respective indices of the individual graphs. The first and second Zagreb indices of cluster of graphs, thorn graphs and bridge graphs as three important special cases of rooted product are also determined. Using these formulae, the first and second Zagreb indices of several important classes of chemical graphs will be computed.", "paper_title": "Chemical Graphs Constructed from Rooted Product and Their Zagreb Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000328719100010"}
