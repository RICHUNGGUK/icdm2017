Essentially the services received by Cloud users are composite services that consist of not only Cloud computing functions but also networking services. Therefore, composite network-Cloud service provisioning becomes one of the main networking challenges in Cloud computing. In this paper we tackle the problem of modeling and optimization for composite network-Cloud service provisioning. We first present a system model in which a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm is given to facilitate convergence of network and Cloud services; then we formulate QoS-aware network-Cloud service selection as a variant of Multi-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) problem and propose an exact algorithm for solving this problem. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is light-weighted and cost-effective in selecting services for composite network-Cloud service provisioning. Experimental results reported in this paper also validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
