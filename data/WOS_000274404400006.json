The calculation of union and intersection of concave type-2 fuzzy sets using the min t-norm and the max t-conorm are explored and it is proved that the set of concave type-2 fuzzy sets is closed under those operations. It is also shown that the set of LR-normal concave type-2 fuzzy sets forms a commutative semiring under join and meet.", "paper_title": "Concave type-2 fuzzy sets: properties and operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000274404400006"}
