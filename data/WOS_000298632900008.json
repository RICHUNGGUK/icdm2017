Targets can be human victims in search and rescue or materials in foraging. In these scenarios, the environment is incrementally discovered by the robots exploiting exploration strategies to move around in an autonomous and effective way. Most of the strategies proposed in literature are based on the idea of evaluating a number of candidate locations on the frontier between the known and the unknown portions of the environment according to ad hoc utility functions that combine different criteria. In this paper, we show some of the advantages of using a more theoretically-grounded approach, based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), to define exploration strategies for robots employed in search and rescue applications. We implemented some MCDM-based exploration strategies within an existing robot controller and we evaluated their performance in a simulated environment.", "paper_title": "Exploration strategies based on multi-criteria decision making for searching environments in rescue operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632900008"}
