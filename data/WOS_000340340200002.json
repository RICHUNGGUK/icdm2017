CN-FDTD is an improvement on the FDTD method, and it can get rid of the CFL conditions and become wholly unconditional stable form. The advantage of the ICCG method for solving large sparse matrix will be taken in the CN-FDTD equation solving. 1CCG method can accelerate iteration for numerical calculation, reduce memory overhead and be easy to be programmed at the same time. CN-ICCG FDTD method researches the object model of plasma photonic crystals. Plasma photo crystals have unique properties. They can show mainly characteristics of plasma, or have the main properties of photonic crystals. Combination of plasma and photonic crystals makes it possible to adjust the plasma parameters to control the properties of photonic crystals. In this paper, it calculates characteristic parameters of plasma photonic crystals under different conditions, such as the reflection electric field, the transmission electric field, the transmission coefficient, to verify accuracy of CN-ICCG FDTD method. The results of this paper prove the method is accurate, performs stably, and has certain advantages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
