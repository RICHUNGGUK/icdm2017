It only equips a backup feeder fiber to recover the system failure. Additionally, a prediction-based fair wavelength and bandwidth allocation (PFWBA) scheme is proposed to enhance the differentiated services for WDM-EPON based on dynamic wavelength allocation (DWA) and prediction-based fair excessive bandwidth reallocation (PFEBR) from our previous work. PFEBR involves an early-DBA mechanism, which improves prediction accuracy by delaying report messages of unstable traffic optical network units (ONUs), and assigns linear estimation credit to predict the arrival of traffic during waiting time. DWA can operate in coordination with an unstable degree list to allocate the available time of wavelength precisely. Simulation results show that the proposed PFWBA scheme outperforms WDM IPACT-ST and DWBA3 in terms of packet delay, jitter performance, throughput, wasted bandwidth, gain ratio of bandwidth, and packet loss.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant architecture with dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation scheme in WDM-EPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000269209500004"}
