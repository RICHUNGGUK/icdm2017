By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis approaches, new and less conservative delay-derivative-dependent stability criteria are presented to guarantee the neural networks to be globally exponentially stable in the mean square for all admissible stochastic perturbations. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results.", "paper_title": "Spatial Point-Data Reduction Using Pulse Coupled Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000280641700002"}
