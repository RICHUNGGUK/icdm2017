The system is formulated in a way to assist the productive-deductive-inductive design reasoning process of the users. Therefore, complex mathematical functions do not cognitively overload the designers, who are released for more critical tasks of aesthetic assessment and new design rules induction. With the implementation on a graphics-processing unit (GPU), real-time complex marbling patterns can be created by the system. The system encourages creativity in the design process and accelerates new design generation. In addition, the resulting patterns fulfil the textile industry requirements of repeat and can be output as vector images. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
