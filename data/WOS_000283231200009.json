The SOPFN algorithm is derived from the idea of the vector potential field. In the proposed network, the neuron with the best weight is considered as the target with the attractive force, while the neuron with the worst weight is considered as the obstacle with the repulsive force. The competitive and cooperative behaviors of SOPFN provide a remarkable ability to escape from the local optimum. Simulations were performed, compared, and analyzed on eight benchmark functions. The results presented illustrate that the SOPFN algorithm achieves a significant performance improvement on multimodal problems compared with other evolutionary optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Potential Field Network: A New Optimization Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000283231200009"}
