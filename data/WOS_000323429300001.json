In this paper, we answer some open problems they suggested. We show that their conjecture is false but we give bounds, that depend on the two abelian periods, such that the conjecture is true for all words having length at least those bounds and show that some of them are optimal. We also extend their study to the context of partial words, giving optimal lengths and describing an algorithm for constructing optimal words.", "paper_title": "ABELIAN PERIODS, PARTIAL WORDS, AND AN EXTENSION OF A THEOREM OF FINE AND WILF", "paper_id": "WOS:000323429300001"}
