This paper presents the use of the measurement thresholds generated from the propagation of parametric uncertainty using polynomial chaos theory (PCT) to validate the sensor measurements of an AC motor drive by means of fuzzy techniques. If measurements fail the validation check, they are replaced by reconstructed data to maintain the operation. Reconstruction is performed with a PCT observer, which also supports the evaluation of the thresholds. The algorithms proposed here have been implemented and tested both in simulation and in real time experiments on a field oriented controlled induction machine.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy-Based Sensor Validation Strategy for AC Motor Drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400012"}
