The approach unites transshipment models with a superstructure, resulting in a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP). We consider a specific problem based on a network of 72 processing steps (including different pretreatment steps, hydrolysis, fermentation, different separations and fuel blending steps) that can be used to process two different types of feedstock. Numerical results are presented for four different optimization objectives (maximize yield, minimize costs, minimize waste and minimum fixed cost), while evaluating different cases (single product and multi-product).
