By utilizing Razumikhin technique and constructing new Halanay differential inequalities, some sufficient conditions ensuring the mean-square exponential input-to-state stability of the networks are obtained. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the derived results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
