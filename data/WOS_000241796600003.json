Although it is mainly applied to physical systems, there is a growing interest in applying CM to other domains, such as ecological and socio-economic systems. Inspired by this observation, this paper presents a method for extending the conventional CM techniques to suit systems that are fundamentally presented by interacting populations of individuals instead of physical components or processes. The work supports building model repositories for such systems, especially in addressing the most critical outstanding issues of granularity and disaggregation in ecological systems modelling.", "paper_title": "Granularity and disaggregation in compositional modelling with applications to ecological systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241796600003"}
