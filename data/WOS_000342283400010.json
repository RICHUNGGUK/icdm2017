Backbreak can be affected by various parameters such as the rock mass properties, blasting geometry and explosive properties. In this study, the application of the artificial neural network (ANN), an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for prediction of backbreak, was described and compared with the traditional statistical model of multiple regression. The performance of these models was assessed through the root mean square error, correlation coefficient (R (2)) and mean absolute percentage error. As a result, it was found that the constructed ANFIS exhibited a higher performance than the ANN and multiple regression for backbreak prediction.", "paper_title": "Multiple regression, ANN and ANFIS models for prediction of backbreak in the open pit blasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000342283400010"}
