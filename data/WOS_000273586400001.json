The method uses a general pattern similar to the approach of a human expert, and relies on a classification of metals based on metallurgical expertise and fuzzy logic for identifying metals and comparing their chemical and mechanical properties. The algorithm has been tested and deployed in real applications for fast metal identification and finding of unknown equivalents, by the leading companies in the field. The same principles can also be used in other domains for similar problems, such as organic and inorganic materials identification and generic drugs comparison.
