The agents accomplish a hill climbing task by coordinating the dynamics of active elements and responding to the spatial pattern of surface convexity. Transition between discrete movement patterns is observed while moving in a rugged environment. The difference of dynamics between approaching hills and avoiding hollows is distinct and can be interpreted as a dynamic categorization of bumps on the surface.", "paper_title": "Emergence of coherent coordinated behavior in a network of homogeneous active elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300042"}
