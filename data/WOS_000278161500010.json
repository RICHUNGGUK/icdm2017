The study is conducted using the answers of a population of 734 individuals to a collection of 206 items. These items aim at measuring five common different personality traits usually called the big five. These five levels are neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. The traits are estimated using the widely used Samejima's model and then used to discriminate the individuals. Results point biometrics using personality traits as a new promising biometric modality.
