Many organizations have implemented a groupware system to integrate the organizational knowledge and support knowledge creation. However, design methods for flexible form-based knowledge reuse and representation are limited. We developed a methodology based on the enhanced cognitive fit theory; it utilizes factoring and synthesis principles to manipulate form-based knowledge. The methodology was articulated using the design science research methodology. A prototype embedded methodology was built to support a knowledge worker in knowledge creation and reuse in a high tech firm. The resulting system allowed flexible form-based knowledge creation that was useful for problem solving and exploiting opportunities. Implications and conclusions are discussed.
