We show that discrete conics satisfy a number of nice properties. These include optical (billiard) and isogonal properties analogous to those of conics, the property of being Poncelet polygons with the two associated conics sharing a focus, and a nice property similar to Pascal's Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem. We conclude by showing that discrete conics arise naturally from two constructions: a discrete negative pedal construction and via a group associated to focus-sharing pencils of conics.", "paper_title": "Discrete Conics as Distinguished Projective Images of Regular Polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400002"}
