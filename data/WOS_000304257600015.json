As the method utilizes an equidistant discretization, local fine scale effects of geometry or medium inhomogeneities require a refinement of the whole grid which significantly reduces the computational efficiency. For this reason, a multi-domain F-PSTD methodology is presented with a coarse grid covering the complete domain and fine grids acting as a subgrid resolution of the coarse grid near local fine scale effects. Data transfer between coarse and fine grids takes place utilizing spectral interpolation with super-Gaussian window functions to impose spatial periodicity. Local time stepping is employed without intermediate interpolation. The errors introduced by the window functions and the multi-domain implementation are quantified and compared to errors related to the initial conditions and from the time iteration scheme. It is concluded that the multidomain methodology does not introduce significant errors compared to the single-domain method. Examples of scattering from small scale density scatters, sound reflecting from a slitted rigid object and sound propagation through a jet are accurately modelled by the proposed methodology. For problems that can be solved by F-PSTD, the presented methodology can lead to a significant gain in computational efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
