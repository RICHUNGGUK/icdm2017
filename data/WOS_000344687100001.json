Towards the inhomogeneous distribution of legitimate nodes, we novelly construct a circular percolation model under the idea of transforming \"inhomogeneous\" to \"homogeneous.\" Correspondingly, the information is transmitted by two ways: intracluster transmission and intercluster transmission. For intracluster transmission, a per-node secrecy throughput of Omega(root 1/n(1-v)(1 - v)logn) is derived by circular percolation model, where n and n(v) represent the number of nodes and clusters in the network, respectively. As for intercluster case, a connection called \"information pipelines\" is built. Then the per-node secrecy throughput of Omega(root Phi/root n) can be obtained, where Phi denotes the minimum node density in the network. Moreover, when the eavesdropper is equipped with psi(n) antennas, the per-node secrecy throughput of Omega(root 1/n(1-v)(1 - v)logn psi(-2/alpha)(n)) and Omega((root Phi/root n)psi(-2/alpha)(n)) is achieved for intracluster and intercluster transmission, respectively.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Throughput in Inhomogeneous Wireless Networks with Nonuniform Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000344687100001"}
