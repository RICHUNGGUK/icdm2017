A lower bound on the mean squared MAI is referred to as chip-asynchronous version of Welch bound, which depends on chip pulse shapes. Real analysis tells us that a pair of rectangular and sinc functions is one of Fourier transform and its inverse Fourier transform and vice versa. On the other hand, Gaussian pulses have the self-duality property. Gaussian chip pulses sacrifice inter-symbol interference, however, they give smaller mean squared MAI, as well as lower bit error rate, than the conventional Nyquist pulses.", "paper_title": "Chip-asynchronous version of Welch bound: Gaussian pulse improves BER performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000031"}
