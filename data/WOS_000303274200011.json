This paper presents an optimization model to determine attribute weights for MADM problems with incomplete weight information of criteria under IVIFSs environment. In this method, a series of mathematical programming models based on cross-entropy are constructed and eventually transformed into a single mathematical programming model to determine the weights of attributes. In addition, an extended technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is suggested to ranking all the alternatives. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided to compare the proposed approach with existing methods. Finally, the paper concludes with suggestions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
