Thoroughly testing such software to ensure safety is crucial. Function Block Diagram (FBD) is a popular data-flow programming language for PLC. Current practice often involves translating an FBD program into an equivalent C program for testing. Little research has been conducted on coverage of direct testing a data-flow program, such as an FBD program, at the model level. There are no commonly accepted structural test coverage criteria for data-flow programs. The objective of this study is to develop effective structural test coverage criterion for testing model-level FBD programs. The proposed testing scheme can be used to detect mutation errors at the logical function level. Objective: The purpose of this study is to design a new test coverage criterion that can directly test FBD programs and effectively detect logical function mutation errors. Method: A complete test set for each function and function block in an FBD program are defined. Moreover, this method augments the data-flow path concept with a sensitivity check to avoid fault masking and effectively detect logical function mutation errors. Results: Preliminary experiments show that this test coverage criterion is comprehensive and effective for error detection. Conclusion: The proposed coverage criterion is general and can be applied to real cases to improve the quality of data-flow program design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
