In this paper, a semantic Web enabled multi-agent platform for logistic VO supporting is proposed. The issue of extending OWL with multi-attribute constraints for VO modeling is addressed. A constraint rule language SWOCRL is proposed which is based on OWL and SWRL with constraint extension and class-scoped restriction. Important VO concepts such as organizations, activities, resources and their logistic specializations are described with OWL plus SWOCRL.", "paper_title": "Semantic web modeling for Virtual Organization: A case study in logistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800058"}
