SAETA addresses two main aspects of elite sports coaching: 1) technical-tactical effort control, which aims at controlling exercise effort and fatigue levels and 2) exercise quality training, which complements the former by analyzing the execution of player movements. SAETA relies on a sensing infrastructure that monitors both players and their environment, and produces real-time data that is analyzed by different modules of a decision engine. Technical-tactical effort control is based on a dynamic programming model, which selects the best activity and rest durations in interval training, with the goal of maximizing effort while preventing fatigue. Exercise quality control consists of two stages. In the first stage, movements are detected by means of a k-nearest neighbors classifier and in the second stage, movement intensity is classified according to recent statistical data from the player being analyzed. These analyses are reported to coaches and players in real-time. SAETA has been developed in close collaboration with the Universidad Catolica San Antonio de Murcia volleyball team, which competes in the Spanish women's premier league. Data gathered during training sessions has provided a knowledge base for the algorithms developed, and has been used for the validation of results.", "paper_title": "SAETA: A Smart Coaching Assistant for Professional Volleyball Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000358246900003"}
