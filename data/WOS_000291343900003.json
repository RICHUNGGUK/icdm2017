The scale was initially validated for United States online users in 2001 and later for European Union online users in 2005. Our analysis reveals that the lifestyle scale remains valid for online users in China. However, we find that the segmentation of online users in China based on the lifestyle scale differs markedly from what was found earlier in the United States and European Union countries. We profile two new online shopping segments and one new online non-shopping segment. The result provides a refined understanding of the similarities and differences in online shopper lifestyles across the different cultures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
