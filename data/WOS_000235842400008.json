A great number of civil infrastructures under construction can be used as test beds for SHM systems. The Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge in Shandong Province, China. An SHM system has been implemented on this bridge during its construction for monitoring its health status and assessing its safety for long-term services. The system includes a sensor module, a data acquisition module, a wired and wireless data transmit module, a structural analysis module, a database module, and a warning module. It is integrated by using LabVIEW software and can be remotely operated via Internet. The database is available freely to all scientists and engineers in the SHM research area. This article introduces the deployment and functions of this system, and presents the measured responses of the bridge subjected to moving vehicle loads.", "paper_title": "Structural health monitoring system for the Shandong Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge", "paper_id": "WOS:000235842400008"}
