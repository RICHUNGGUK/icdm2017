To model the atmospheric turbulence conditions, the log-normal and the gamma-gamma distribution are used. Extensive numerical and computer simulation results are presented in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed mathematical analysis.", "paper_title": "Average Symbol Error Probability of General-Order Rectangular Quadrature Amplitude Modulation of Optical Wireless Communication Systems Over Atmospheric Turbulence Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000274196200002"}
