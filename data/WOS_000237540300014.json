Each service provider needs flexible relationships between them, and each consumer joins Grid with the intention of getting its purchase requirements satisfied. To allow Grid to reduce the cost of e-business trading, to deal faster and to open up more new opportunities, a market-oriented architecture called GTM (Grid Trading Model) is proposed in order to establish a real-life Grid which provides a business mechanism for organizing users and services efficiently based on market economic rationale. GTM derives from an inherent similarity between typical networks and classical economic market structures based on Virtual Organization (VO) concept and the small-world theory. An emulated environment is presented to illustrate the model's economic feature, performance and cheap service trading cost.", "paper_title": "A market-oriented model for grid service management", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300014"}
