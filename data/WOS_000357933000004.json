By introducing extended state observer approach, decentralised adaptive controllers are designed for distributed systems which have non-identical unknown non-linear dynamics. The non-identical unknown non-linear dynamics allows for a tracked command dynamics which is also non-linear and unknown. State variables of agents can be obtained only in the case where leader agent and the network communication topology for multi-agent systems is strongly connected digraph network structures. A Lyapunov-function-based approach is given to show that the tracking error is ultimately bounded. Some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques in this paper.", "paper_title": "Extended-state-observer-based adaptive control for synchronisation of multi-agent systems with unknown nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000357933000004"}
