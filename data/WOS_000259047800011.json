A model based on the spectral distributions of the cascade photon emissions was proposed to calculate the polarization entanglement of the photon pairs emitted from the non-degenerate biexciton system with spectral filters. The influences of the spectral filter width and the exciton energy splitting between the two orthogonally polarized eigenstates on the entanglement were theoretically analyzed. The dependence of the polarization entanglement on the input pulse area was also discussed.", "paper_title": "Analysis of correlation function and polarization entanglement of photon pairs generated from anisotropic semiconductor quantum dot", "paper_id": "WOS:000259047800011"}
