Evaluating such expressions requires bounds on the dimension of the Hilbert space of these auxiliary registers, for which no nontrivial technique is known; we lack a quantum analog of the Caratheodory theorem. In this paper, we develop a new non-Caratheodory-type tool for evaluating expressions involving a single quantum auxiliary register and several classical random variables. As we show, such expressions appear in problems of entanglement-assisted Gray-Wyner and entanglement-assisted channel simulation, where the question of whether entanglement helps in these settings is related to that of evaluating expressions with a single quantum auxiliary register. To evaluate such expressions, we argue that developing a quantum analog of the Caratheodory theorem requires a better understanding of a notion which we call \"quantum conditioning.\" We then proceed by proving a few results about quantum conditioning, one of which is that quantum conditioning is strictly richer than the usual classical conditioning.", "paper_title": "On Dimension Bounds for Auxiliary Quantum Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600028"}
