These algorithms use learning automata to adjust the number of guard channels to be assigned to cells of network. Then, we introduce a new model for nonstationary environments under which the proposed algorithms work and study their steady state behavior when they use L(R-I) learning algorithm. It is also shown that a learning automaton operating under the proposed nonstationary environment equalizes its penalty strengths. Computer simulations have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The simulation results show that the performances of the proposed algorithms are close to the performance of guard channel algorithm that knows all the traffic parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
