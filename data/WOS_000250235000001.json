Particularly, the anomalous curves introduced by Koblitz allow a complex representation of the keys, denoted tau NAF, that make the computations over these curves more efficient. In this article, we propose an efficient method for randomizing a tau NAF to produce different equivalent representations of the same key to the same complex base tau. We prove that the average Hamming density of the resulting representations is 0.5. We identify the pattern of the tau NAFs yielding the maximum number of representations and the formula governing this number. We also present deterministic methods to compute the average and the exact number of possible representations of a tau NAF.", "paper_title": "On tau-adic representations of integers", "paper_id": "WOS:000250235000001"}
