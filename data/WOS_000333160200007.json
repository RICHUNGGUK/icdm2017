One of the methods used to overcome this is by using method of moments simulation. The method of moments is a highly efficient method of solving wire antenna structures and is commonly used in antenna optimization. A method of transforming a wire antenna structure to a planar antenna structure is presented using a 4-element Yagi-Uda antenna designed to resonate at 905 MHz. The wire to planar transformation is based on the circular cross section wire to planar strip, a spacing adjustment based on interelement capacitance, and a length scaling to compensate for the change in effective permittivity. The planar antenna shows slightly improved impedance performance at the resonance [voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)=1.39]. This transformation decreased the antenna footprint by 15.11% after conversion for a wire antenna to a planar antenna in air with similar radiation characteristics and on FR4 (1.6 mm thickness), the footprint increased by 52%. The antenna simulation time was reduced from 15 min using finite element method to less than 10 s for one cycle by using the method of moments solver. All antenna properties are essentially unchanged. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
