Design/methodology/approach - Microblogging data about emergency events from Sina microblogging (http://weibo.com) are collected and analyzed with text mining technology. The proposed hypotheses are tested with logistic and multiple linear regressions. Findings - The results show that source trustworthiness, source expertise, source attractiveness, and the number of multimedia have significant effects on the information retweeting. In addition, source expertise moderates the effects of user trustworthiness and content objectivity on the information retweeting in microblogging. Practical implications - This study provides an in-depth understanding of what makes information about emergency events in microblogging diffuse so rapidly. Based on these findings the emergency management organizations in China can apply the microblogging to spread useful information, and these findings also provide practical implications for microblogging system designers. Originality/value - The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of information retweeting in microblogging based on Heuristic-Systematic Model. Organizations that would like to adopt the microblogging platform in emergency situations to improve the ability of emergency response can benefit from the findings of this study.", "paper_title": "Determinants of information retweeting in microblogging", "paper_id": "WOS:000309949000003"}
