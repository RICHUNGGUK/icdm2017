In the light of the drawback of the traditional circuit, a simplified circuit is proposed. The simplified circuit can substantially reduce the number of the protective components and the size of the SPD chassis. In order to compare the protective performances between the traditional and simplified circuits, an impulse experimental arrangement is built to measure their residual voltages. The measured results show that the voltage protection level of the simplified circuit is the same as that of the traditional circuit. Therefore, replacement of the traditional circuit by the simplified circuit is really feasible in lightning overvoltage protection of AC power supplies of electronic systems.", "paper_title": "A CIRCUIT SIMPLIFICATION FOR AC POWER SUPPLY SPD", "paper_id": "WOS:000336150600008"}
