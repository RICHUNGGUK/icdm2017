Genetic programming is used for combining the basic image transformations and filters into tree structure, which can accurately estimate noise map. Proposed detector is employed for building switching-scheme filter, where recursively implemented a-trimmed mean is used as the estimator of corrupted pixel values. The proposed evolutionary filtering structure shows very good results in removal of uniform impulse noise, for wide range of noise probabilities and different test images.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary tree-structured filter for impulse noise removal", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100010"}
