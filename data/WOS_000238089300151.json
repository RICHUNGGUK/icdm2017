In this paper, we propose and implement a haptic interaction system that realizes reciprocal reactions. This system is composed of a wire-driven haptic interface and an immersive virtual environment. It enables user to do visual and force feedback in a human-scale interaction spaces. And the virtual human performs intuitive response to changes of user's action. Based on the framework, we implemented a haptic interaction, Virtual Catch Ball, that a user can play the virtual human with one's feeling of contacting real ball. Furthermore we introduce the system's extended function that virtual human imitates user's effective styles acquired by a on-line motion capture, and then reflects them on his behavioral structure. It will be a practical way to produce various motion patterns during playing, and to evolve both behaviors.", "paper_title": "Haptic interaction system for co-evolution with reactive virtual human", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300151"}
