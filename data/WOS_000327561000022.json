One alternative for transcribing the ancient manuscripts is the use of speech dictation by using Automatic Speech Recognition techniques. In the two alternatives similar models (Hidden Markov Model S and n-grams) and decoding processes (Viterbi decoding) are employed, which allows a possible combination of the two modalities with little difficulties. In this work, we explore the possibility of using recognition results of one modality to restrict the decoding process of the other modality, and apply this process iteratively. Results of these multimodal iterative alternatives are significantly better than the baseline uni-modal systems and better than the non-iterative alternatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
