The proposed solution is based on a numerical version of principal component analysis (PCA) of stochastic processes and hence it can be applied simply with knowledge of the first- and second-order moments of the intensity process of interest. The technique provided is valid for solving all types of estimation problems: filtering, prediction and smoothing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
