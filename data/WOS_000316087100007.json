Interesting connections of effective dimension with information theory were also found, in fact the cases of polynomial-space and constructive dimension can be precisely characterized in terms of Kolmogorov complexity, while analogous results for polynomial-time dimension haven't been found. In this paper we remedy the situation by using the natural concept of reversible time-bounded compression for finite strings. We completely characterize polynomial-time dimension in terms of polynomial-time compressors.", "paper_title": "Dimension Is Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087100007"}
