We present a generic approach with which we are able to extract information from documents on the Web. The method exploits redundancy of information to compensate for loss of precision caused by the use of domain independent extraction methods. In this paper, we present the general approach and describe our implementation for a specific relation instance extraction task in the art domain. For this task, we describe experiments, discuss evaluation measures and present the results.", "paper_title": "Extracting instances of relations from Web documents using redundancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574900017"}
