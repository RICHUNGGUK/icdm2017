In this paper, we present a set of data encoding schemes aimed at reducing the power dissipated by the links of an NoC. The proposed schemes are general and transparent with respect to the underlying NoC fabric (i.e., their application does not require any modification of the routers and link architecture). Experiments carried out on both synthetic and real traffic scenarios show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which allow to save up to 51% of power dissipation and 14% of energy consumption without any significant performance degradation and with less than 15% area overhead in the NI.", "paper_title": "Data Encoding Techniques for Reducing Energy Consumption in Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124200021"}
