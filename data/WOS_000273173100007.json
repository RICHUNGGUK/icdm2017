Although there have been many iris segmentation methods, most focus primarily on the accurate detection with iris images which are captured in a closely controlled environment. This paper proposes a new iris segmentation method that can be used to accurately extract iris regions from non-ideal quality iris images. This research has following three novelties compared to previous works; firstly, the proposed method uses AdaBoost eye detection in order to compensate for the iris detection error caused by the two circular edge detection operations; secondly, it uses a color segmentation technique for detecting obstructions by the ghosting effects of visible light; and thirdly, if there is no extracted corneal specular reflection in the detected pupil and iris regions, the captured iris image is determined as a \"closed eye\" image. The proposed method has been tested using the UBIRIS.v2 database via NICE.I (Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation - Part I) contest. The results show that FP (False Positive) error rate and FN (False Negative) error rate are 1.2% and 27.6%, respectively, from NICE.I report (the 5th highest rank). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
