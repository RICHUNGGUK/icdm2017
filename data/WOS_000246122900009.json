The proposed novel access network architecture, which can reduce network complexity and improve system performance, is introduced. Centralized mini-slot packet reservation multiple access (CMPRMA), based on OFDMA, is proposed, which not only can inherit the advantages of MPRMA and support real-time traffic well, but can also supply the resource reservation scheme for data traffic and support transmission for data traffic efficiently.", "paper_title": "Research on the access network and MAC technique for beyond 3G systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246122900009"}
