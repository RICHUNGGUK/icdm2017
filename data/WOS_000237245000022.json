RFID system has many advantages more than other automatic identification system. However, it has some consumer privacy problems, such as location tracking and disclosure of personal information. Most of related works have focused on the cryptographic scheme for the RFID tag and the reader. In this paper, a proxy agent scheme using personal mobile device for the privacy protection. Our MARP, mobile agent for RFID privacy protection, has strong cryptographic modules with a powerful CPU and battery system and guarantees more high-level security than other protection schemes. MARP acquires a tag's secrete information partially and becomes the proxy agent of the tag which is in its sleep mode. All readers can communicate with MARP instead of the tag and can attempt authentication with MARP. Since the tag should have only one hash module in the environment of MARP, we can use the existing tag hardware with slight modification for protection consumer's privacy in RFID system.", "paper_title": "MARP: Mobile agent for RFID privacy protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000237245000022"}
