This study proposes a co-processing intermediary framework integrated cloud and wireless body sensor networks, which is mainly applied to fall detection and 3-D motion reconstruction. In this study, the main focuses includes distributed computing and resource allocation of processing sensing data over the computing architecture, network conditions and performance evaluation. Through this framework, the transmissions and computing time of sensing data are reduced to enhance overall performance for the services of fall events detection and 3-D motion reconstruction.", "paper_title": "A Collaborative Computing Framework of Cloud Network and WBSN Applied to Fall Detection and 3-D Motion Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000332987400008"}
