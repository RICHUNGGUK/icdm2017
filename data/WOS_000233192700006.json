Our method operates directly on the point cloud without any surface reconstruction procedure. Using the Cauchy-Crofton formula, the area of the point-sampled surface is calculated by counting the number of intersection points between the point cloud and a set of uniformly distributed lines generated with low-discrepancy sequences. Based on a clustering technique, we also propose an effective algorithm for computing the intersection points of a line with the point-sampled surface. By testing on a number of point-based models, experiments suggest that our method is more robust and more efficient than those conventional approaches based on surface reconstruction.
