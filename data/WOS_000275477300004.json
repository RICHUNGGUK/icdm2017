Validation is accomplished through signal processing techniques serving the purpose of filtering out electromagnetic noise and gaseous micro-leaks. The 3D spatial localization uses a passive acoustic sound source localization technique using a microphone array (5 elements) and a simple generalised cross-correlation (GCC) time delay of arrival (TDCA) algorithm. The approach for the nucleation validation is new and regarding the localization, as of this writing, we are the first to encleavour its feasibility assessment. Experimental results are shown.
