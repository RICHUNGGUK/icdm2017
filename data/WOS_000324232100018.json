In this paper, a detailed polyhedral study of the SRFLP is performed, and several huge classes of valid and facet-inducing inequalities are derived. Some separation heuristics are presented, along with a primal heuristic based on multi-dimensional scaling. Finally, a branch-and-cut algorithm is described and some encouraging computational results are given.", "paper_title": "A polyhedral approach to the single row facility layout problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100018"}
