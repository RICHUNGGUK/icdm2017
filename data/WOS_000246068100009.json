First, the background and problem domain are introduced. Then the information required to evaluate and negotiate orders is examined in a collaborative manufacturing process. Based on this information, a framework of order evaluation is built on the profit and due date, and then an order negotiation model framework, combined with an order evaluation model, is also presented. At the same time, a standardized negotiation process is described in more detail. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate how business-to-business SMMEs evaluate and negotiate an order with a business-to-customer SMME to obtain the best profit-due date trade-off.", "paper_title": "A framework of order evaluation and negotiation for SMMEs in networked manufacturing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000246068100009"}
