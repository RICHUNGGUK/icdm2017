An arithmetical unit based on this principle containing addition, multiplication, division and square root operations is described. The development of the computation operators model is based on the imprecise computation paradigm and defines the concept of the adjustable calculation of a function that manages delay and the precision of the results as an inherent and parameterized characteristic. The arithmetic function design is based on well-known algorithms and offers progressive improvement in the results. Advantages in the predictability of calculations are obtained by means of processing groups of k-bits atomically and by using look-up tables. We report an evaluation of the operations in path time, delay and computation error. Finally, we present an example of our real-time architecture working in a realistic context.", "paper_title": "Real-time arithmetic unit", "paper_id": "WOS:000239049800004"}
