All these areas strive towards faster and larger scale simulations. Particularly challenging are large-scale simulations with highly organized and structured stacking. We present a stable, robust, and versatile method for multibody dynamics simulation. Novel contributions include a new, explicit, fixed time-stepping scheme for velocity-based complementarity formulations using shock propagation with a simple reliable implementation strategy for an iterative complementarity problem solver specifically optimized for multibody dynamics.", "paper_title": "Velocity-based shock propagation for multibody dynamics animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247971000006"}
