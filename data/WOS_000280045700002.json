An extended HLA-based collaborative simulation platform for multidisciplinary collaborative design is proposed. The architecture of platform is first given. The idea and realization of four key technologies, the dynamic creation of simulation federation based on resource management federation (RMF). HLA enabled template, collaborative simulation algorithm based on stage-data synchronization and TH_RTI, an extensible HLA runtime infrastructure (RTI), which is a web enabled RTI and can be used at Internet, are emphasized. Finally, an industry case is given. The demonstration of these prototype systems shows that extended HLA integration architecture is effective infrastructure for multidisciplinary collaborative modeling and simulation (M&S).
