Most of this models and specifications are complex, difficult to understand and implement in reduced environments. Small and very small organizations (less than 10 employees) can benefit from reuse but, they need easy to understand methodologies, processes and tools; low cost technologies and, flexible development models. We provide a flexible approach to the modelling process proposing an easy model to represent and classify reusable assets, mainly those developed inside the organization but, compliant with standards to allow the use of COTS. Our model deals with functional and nonfunctional properties and, it's able to represent assets from the whole software development life cycle.", "paper_title": "Support to development-with-reuse in very small software developing companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575400037"}
