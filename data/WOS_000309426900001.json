The aim of this work is to reduce, as much as possible, repetitive tasks and to factor out common aspects into different kinds of rules that can be reused across different applications. In particular, exploiting the conceptual elements of the typical models used for the design of a Web application, it defines presentation and layout rules at different levels of abstraction and granularity. A procedure for the automatic layout of the content of a page is proposed and evaluated, and the layout of advanced Web applications is discussed.", "paper_title": "A Model-Driven Methodology to the Content Layout Problem in Web Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000309426900001"}
