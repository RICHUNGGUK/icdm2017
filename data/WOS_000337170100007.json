Traditional approaches specify these interactions as message sequence charts (MSCs), hiding underlying business relationships and, consequently, complicating modification. Comma is a commitment-based approach that produces a business model drawn from an extensible pattern library and yields flexible MSCs. An empirical study shows that models produced via Comma yield superior flexibility, are comprehensible to others, and take less time and effort to produce.", "paper_title": "Engineering Service Engagements via Commitments", "paper_id": "WOS:000337170100007"}
