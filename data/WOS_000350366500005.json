This means that this content should be accessible to anyone, including people with disabilities. Therefore, it should be accompanied by media alternatives (captions, audio description, sign language, extended audio description, etc.), which should be handled by an accessible user agent that provides support for them. This paper presents: (1) an approach with accessibility requirements following standards to include accessibility in a user agent for delivering accessible multimedia content based on it, (2) a conceptualization of these requirements that provides an abstract user interface which may be integrated into the development process, after that, (3) a check of the integration of the accessibility requirements in the models, and (4) finally, some lessons learned and conclusions are shown.", "paper_title": "Approach design of an accessible media player", "paper_id": "WOS:000350366500005"}
