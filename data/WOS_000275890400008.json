Intrusion detection at the network level is an effective way of stopping malicious attacks at the source and preventing viruses and worms from wide spreading. The key component in a successful network intrusion detection system is a high performance pattern matching engine that can uncover the malicious activities in real time. In this paper, we propose a highly parallel, scalable hardware based network intrusion detection system, that can handle variable pattern length efficiently and effectively. Pattern matching for a packet is completed in O(N log M) time where N is the size of the packet and M is the longest pattern length. Implementation is done on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array. Comparison with the other techniques shows promising results.", "paper_title": "Variable Length Pattern Matching for Hardware Network Intrusion Detection System", "paper_id": "WOS:000275890400008"}
