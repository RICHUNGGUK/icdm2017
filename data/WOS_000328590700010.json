Simulation results show that its image quality at different received data rates is better than that without considering the quadtree level. Then, a hybrid fractal image coding scheme based on traditional and no-search fractal image coding with the proposed progressive structure is suggested. The image quality and compression ratio can be controlled by a threshold, which makes it downward compatible to the no-search fractal image coding. Experimental results justify that the progressive performance of the proposed scheme is better than that of traditional fractal image coding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
