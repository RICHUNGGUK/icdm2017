We show that Jones polynomials of the whole family of polyhedral links based on a fixed polyhedron can be obtained in a unified way from the Tutte polynomial of the 1-skeleton of the polyhedron via special parametrizations. As applications, by using computer algebra (Maple) techniques, Jones polynomials of Platonic polyhedral links are obtained and used to detect the chirality of Platonic polyhedral links.", "paper_title": "The Jones Polynomial for Polyhedral Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000289039800016"}
