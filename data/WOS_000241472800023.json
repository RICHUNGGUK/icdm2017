The search engine is capable of automatically adapting the exploration of the search space according to the intrinsic demand of the optimization problem. This proposal unites the concepts of omni-optimization, already proposed in the literature, with distinctive procedures associated with immune-inspired concepts. Due to the immune inspiration, the omni-aiNet presents a population capable of adjusting its size during the execution of the algorithm, according to a predefined suppression threshold, and a new grid mechanism to control the spread of solutions in the objective space. The omni-aiNet was applied to several optimization problems and the obtained results are presented and analyzed.", "paper_title": "Omni-aiNet: An immune-inspired approach for omni optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472800023"}
