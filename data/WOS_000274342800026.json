The algorithm itself is very simple and a natural target for implementation on specialized architectures such as the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/BE). We have developed CellMC, a multiplatform SBML model compiler implementing a vectorized version of SSA for use on Cell/BE or x 86 PCs.", "paper_title": "CellMC-a multiplatform model compiler for the Cell Broadband Engine and x86", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342800026"}
