These failures have been due mainly to problems with providers: lack of experience and capacity to take on the projects, and difficulties of communication. There are good practices frameworks for managing outsourcing projects for clients, but it is not the same for providers, who base the provision of services on their past experience and technical capabilities. The aim of this paper is to state the need of proposing a methodology that guides providers throughout the whole outsourcing life cycle and facilitates the provision of quality services and their management.", "paper_title": "Do Outsourcing Service Providers Need a Methodology for Service Delivery?", "paper_id": "WOS:000368434300003"}
