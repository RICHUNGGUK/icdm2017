As computer networks' complexity increases, communication-related software must be able to adapt to mobile computing's constraints. This study aims to develop a software system that adapts data flows over dynamic wireless network conditions and various mobile devices. With their MobiGATE system,the authors adopt the principle of separation of concerns to support the system's service composition and reconfiguration. This approach can support ease of dynamic reconfiguration and the reusability of adaptation services across applications.", "paper_title": "Applying coordination for service adaption in mobile computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240679200009"}
