We prove the following two results: 1. There exists a partition of N-t into a finite family of polyhedra such that the function f(L) is a quasi-polynomial on each polyhedron of the partition. 2. There exists a partition of N-t into a finite family of rational subsets such that the function f(L) is a polynomial on each set of the partition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
