In this paper, we use the characterization of the isometry group of the metric space (Sym(n), d(H)) in order to develop generating algorithms with rejection of isomorphic objects. To classify the (n,d)-permutation codes up to isometry, we construct invariants and study their efficiency. We give the numbers of nonisometric (4,3)- and (5,4)- permutation codes. Maximal and balanced (n,d)-permutation codes are enumerated in a constructive way.", "paper_title": "Isometries and Construction of Permutation Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000010"}
