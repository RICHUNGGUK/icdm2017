Coupled with the posited severe biasing effects of construct misspecification on structural parameters, these two assertions would lead to concluding that an important portion of our literature is largely invalid. While we do not delve into the issue of when one specification should be employed over another, our work here contends that construct misspecification, but with a particular exception, does not lead to severely biased estimates. We argue, and show through extensive simulations, that a lack of attention to the metric in which relationships are expressed is responsible for the current belief in the negative effects of misspecification.", "paper_title": "REVISITING BIAS DUE TO CONSTRUCT MISSPECIFICATION: DIFFERENT RESULTS FROM CONSIDERING COEFFICIENTS IN STANDARDIZED FORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000300480200008"}
