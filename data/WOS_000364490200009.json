Compared with RBF, HBF neural networks have a more generalized ability with different activation functions. A decision tree algorithm is used to determine the network center. Subsequently, we design an adaptive observer based on HBF neural networks and propose a fault detection and diagnosis method based on the observer for the nonlinear modeling ability of the neural network. Finally, we apply this method to nonlinear systems. The sensitivity and stability of the observer for the failure of the nonlinear systems are proved by simulation, which is beneficial for real-time online fault detection and diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Design of Fault Detection Observer Based on Hyper Basis Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000364490200009"}
