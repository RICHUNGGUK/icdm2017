By approaching the problems of low voltage and high noise from miniaturization of a device from a stochastic point of view, a faint-signal receiving system that can effectively detect subthreshold and noise level signals has been developed. In addition, an alternative to statistical processing is proposed, and would be successfully implemented on a circuit. For the proposed signal detection method, the detection sensitivity was investigated using numerical simulation, and the detection sensitivity was sufficiently high to detect even a signal with a signal-to-inherent-noise ratio of -14 dB. Thus, it is anticipated that the application of this system to an integrated circuit will have a significant impact on signal processing.", "paper_title": "Application of Noise-Enhanced Detection of Subthreshold Signals for Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700011"}
