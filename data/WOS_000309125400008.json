The foundations of the field were laid by physicists such as Georg Ohm and Hermann von Helmholtz and by the physiologist Alfonso Corti. The concepts of pure tone and Fourier analysis have informed hearing research ever since. The miracle of our exquisite capacity for perceiving salient qualities of music and speech such as pitch and prosody has often been explained in terms of Fourier analysis of acoustic stimuli into pure tones. In this article, I combine a historical-philosophical approach with acoustic signal modelling, cochlear mechanics and qualitative experiment. I discuss auditory phenomena irreducible to Fourier analysis of acoustic stimuli and reappraise the conceptual foundations of the field by proposing a pragmatist framework for understanding the sense of hearing in humans.", "paper_title": "Signals, cochlear mechanics and pragmatism: a new vista on human hearing?", "paper_id": "WOS:000309125400008"}
