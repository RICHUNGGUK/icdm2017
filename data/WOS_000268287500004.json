Two simulations are performed. One uses high enough grid resolution in order for it to be considered a direct numerical simulation (DNS). LBM in its traditional form is adopted for this simulation. The other simulation uses lower resolution for which the original method becomes unstable. An entropy condition is used to render this simulation stable. Results from these two numerical experiments are compared with the results from a DNS performed with traditional numerical techniques. It is concluded that LBM can be used as tool to simulate turbulent flows and entropy stabilized LBM schemes can be used to achieve accurate results with reasonably low grid resolution.
