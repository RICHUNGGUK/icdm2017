In classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, the ratings and the weights of the criteria are known precisely. However, if decision makers cannot reach an agreement on the method of defining linguistic variables based on the fuzzy sets, the interval-valued fuzzy set theory can provide a more accurate modeling. In this paper, the interval-valued fuzzy ELECTRE method is presented aiming at solving MCDM problems in which the weights of criteria are unequal, using interval-valued fuzzy set concepts. For the purpose of proving the validity of the proposed model, we present a numerical example and build a practical maintenance strategy selection problem.", "paper_title": "Extension of the ELECTRE method based on interval-valued fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000287451000014"}
