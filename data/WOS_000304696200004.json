The server only takes a vacation when the system has become empty. If he finds the system still empty upon return, he takes another vacation, and so on. Successive vacations are identically distributed, with a general distribution. When the service requirements are exponentially distributed we determine the sojourn time distribution of an arbitrary customer. We also show how the same approach can be used to determine the sojourn time distribution in an M/M/1-PS queue of a polling model, under the following constraints: the service discipline at that queue is exhaustive service, the service discipline at each of the other queues satisfies a so-called branching property, and the arrival processes at the various queues are independent Poisson processes. For a general service requirement distribution we investigate both the vacation queue and the polling model, restricting ourselves to the mean sojourn time.", "paper_title": "Sojourn times in a processor sharing queue with multiple vacations", "paper_id": "WOS:000304696200004"}
