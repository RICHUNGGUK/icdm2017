The method relies on an Iterative Learning Control strategy that exploits the approximated repetitiveness of the daily feeding habits of a patient. The administration strategy for the insulin is based on a mixed feedback and feedforward law whose parameters are tuned through a learning process based on the day-by-day analysis of the glucose response to the infusion of exogenous insulin. The proposed scheme is fully autonomous in the sense that it does not require any a priori information on the insulin/glucose response of the patient, on the amount of ingested carbohydrates, and on the announcement of the mealtimes. A novel filtering strategy of the subcutaneous glucose signal is proposed to provide a robust detection of the meal occurrence despite the significant noise introduced by the subcutaneous glucose sensor. A specific module is proposed to detect and prevent possible hypoglycemia events. Considering a prototype diabetic virtual patient it was showed that, thanks to the learning mechanism, the scheme in a few days is able to bring and to maintain the blood glucose in the normoglycemia region and that the control performance can improve over time. Long-run simulation studies have also shown the robustness of the learning scheme in the presence of realistic uncertainties and interpatient variability.", "paper_title": "A LEARNING STRATEGY FOR THE AUTONOMOUS CONTROL OF TYPE 1 DIABETES", "paper_id": "WOS:000356427100001"}
