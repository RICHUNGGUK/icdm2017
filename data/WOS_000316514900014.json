This paper proposed a multi-layered mass-spring model which can adapt well to the built-in accelerating algorithms in PhysX-Engine of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The gallbladder was first segmented from clinical Computed Tomography (CT) images. From the segmentation result, a surface mesh of a gallbladder was constructed. The inner layers of a mass-spring model were generated from the surface mesh based on the anatomical structure of gallbladder. We configured the parameters of the springs based on the biomechanical properties of gallbladder to ensure the reality of the deformation results. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that our model was able to achieve satisfactory results in terms of both visual perception and time performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
