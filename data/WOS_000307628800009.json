The ALL system demonstrates various interferences to carrier ratio (ICR) characteristics using the power spectral density (PSD) and can be used as a digital receiver for monitoring systems and signal intercepted applications. These numerically evaluated statistical performances of the cross-correlation algorithm are proposed to characterize the properties and variations of correlation. The results are based on explicit closed-form expressions, which we derive for the eigenvalues distribution of autocorrelated matrices. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate separation of the original signals using a good match eigenvalue spread. The system provides a form of secure communication in unfavorable conditions, such as when the transmitted signal is easily detected or discriminated by unnecessary listeners of the system. The system 4 also strictly associated with. digital communication security technology and improved channel capacity of multiple access (MA) systems.", "paper_title": "THE CORRELATION AND EIGENANALYSIS MODELS ON AMPLITUDE-LOCKED LOOP EMBEDDED SECURITY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800009"}
