Arabic numerals occur frequently in scientific and informative texts and deliver significant meanings. Since readings of Arabic numerals depend largely on their context, generating accurate pronunciation of Arabic numerals is one of the critical criteria in evaluating TTS systems. In this paper, (1) contextual, pattern, and arithmetic features are extracted from a transliterated corpus; (2) ambiguities of homographic classifiers are resolved based on the semantic relations in KorLex1.0 (Korean Lexico-Semantic Network); (3) a classification model for accurate and efficient transliteration of Arabic numerals is proposed in order to improve Korean TTS systems. The proposed model yields 97.3% accuracy, which is 9.5% higher than that of a customized Korean TFS system.", "paper_title": "Disambiguation based on wordnet for transliteration of Arabic numerals for Korean TTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700038"}
