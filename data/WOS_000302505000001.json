This domain, which consists of sub-level sets of non-linear functions, generalizes the domain of linear templates introduced by Manna, Sankaranarayanan, and Sipma. In the case of quadratic templates, we use Shor's semi-definite relaxation to derive safe and computable abstractions of semantic functionals, and we show that the abstract fixpoint can be over-approximated by coupling policy iteration and semi-definite programming. We demonstrate the interest of our approach on a series of examples (filters, integration schemes) including a degenerate one (symplectic scheme).", "paper_title": "COUPLING POLICY ITERATION WITH SEMI-DEFINITE RELAXATION TO COMPUTE ACCURATE NUMERICAL INVARIANTS IN STATIC ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000001"}
