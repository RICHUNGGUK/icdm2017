As the dimensions of the channels approach the microlevel, viscous dissipation could be significant due to a high velocity gradient in electric double layer (EDL). Numerical results show that viscous dissipation plays an important role in EOF in microchannels.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann simulation of viscous dissipation in electro-osmotic flow in microchannels", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711700004"}
