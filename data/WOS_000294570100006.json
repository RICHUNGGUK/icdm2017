The 3D reconstruction of such environments can thus be reduced to the localization of lines in the 3D space. Multi-view reconstruction requires the solution of the correspondence problem. The use of a single image to localize space lines is attractive, since the correspondence problem can be avoided. However, using a central camera the line localization from single image is an ill-posed problem, because there are infinitely many lines sharing the same image. In this work we relaxed the constraint on single viewpoint imaging and considered a wide class of non-central catadioptric cameras, constituted by an axial symmetric mirror and a perspective camera placed at a generic relative position. In the paper we report the results of our study on line localization for such cameras, reporting the conditions that allow a line to be localized from a single image. We show how the analysis can be extended to other classes of non-central devices sharing a similar imaging model. We also present a brief overview of the main algorithms for line localization from single image that have been proposed.", "paper_title": "Line Localization from Single Catadioptric Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000294570100006"}
