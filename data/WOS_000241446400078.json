After defining the concept of accepting splicing system we discuss how these systems can be used as problem solvers. Then we construct an accepting splicing system able to uniformly solve SAT in time O(m + n) for a formula of length m over n variables. We also propose a uniform solution based on accepting splicing systems to HPP that runs in time O(n), where n is the number of vertices of the instance of HPP.", "paper_title": "Solving SAT and HPP with accepting splicing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400078"}
