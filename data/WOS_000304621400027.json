The spectral properties are predicted with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). In addition, the charge transport quality has been estimated approximately by the predicted reorganization energy (lambda). As revealed from the calculations, the introduction of methyl has a bigger influence on the spectral properties than phenyl. Furthermore, we find that changing the auxiliary ligand could tune the charge transfer properties.", "paper_title": "Ab initio and DFT study of luminescent cyclometalated N-heterocyclic carbene organogold(III) complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304621400027"}
