While there are plenty of routing metrics and broadcast routing schemes in current literature, it remains an unsolved problem as to which metrics are compatible with a specific broadcast routing scheme. In particular, in the wireless broadcast routing context where transmission has an inherent broadcast property, there is a potential danger of incompatible combination of broadcast routing algorithms and metrics. This paper shows that different broadcast routing algorithms have different requirements on the properties of broadcast routing metrics. The metric properties for broadcast routing algorithms in both undirected network topologies and directed network topologies are developed and proved. They are successfully used to verify the compatibility between broadcast routing metrics and broadcast routing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Compatibility between Three Well-Known Broadcast Tree Construction Algorithms and Various Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000291871900010"}
