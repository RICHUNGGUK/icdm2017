Our procedures are based on the fact that the quantile functions of these probability distributions can be expressed in closed form in terms of the Lambert W function. As a consequence, the extreme order statistics from the above distributions can also be computer generated in a straightforward manner. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
