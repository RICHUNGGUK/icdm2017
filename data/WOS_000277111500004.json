Findings Post-earthquake reconnaissance has improved our knowledge of earthquakes in engineering and science It has rapidly evolved with advances in GPS, digital cameras and web technologies PER should now exploit the benefits of metadata embedded in photos By attaching information to photo files, embedded metadata have the potential of automating and scaling up PER dataflow Embedded metadata may lay the foundation of virtual earthquakes and involve the public in collecting scientific and engineering data Originality/value - The paper introduces the use of embedded metadata in the field of post-earthquake reconnaissance for sharing of scientific and engineering data The paper also contributes to building virtual earthquakes for visualising and understanding earthquake damage and other disasters affecting people and the built environment", "paper_title": "Towards virtual earthquakes: using post-earthquake reconnaissance information", "paper_id": "WOS:000277111500004"}
