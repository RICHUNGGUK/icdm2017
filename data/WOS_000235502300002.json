The Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation operators have been extensively adopted to assign the relative weights of numerous criteria. However, previous aggregation operators ( including OWA) are independent of aggregation situations. To solve the problem, this study proposes a new aggregation model-dynamic fuzzy OWA based on situation model, which can modify the associated dynamic weight based on the aggregation situation and can work like a \"magnifying lens\" to enlarge the most important attribute dependent on minimal information, or can obtain equal attribute weights based on maximal information. Two examples are adopted in this paper for comparison and showing the effects under different weights.", "paper_title": "Dynamic fuzzy OWA model for group multiple criteria decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000235502300002"}
