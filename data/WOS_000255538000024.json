Solving the problem is essential for the generation of flexible process sequences with resource selection and for the decision of the operation schedules that can minimize makespan. We formulate a mixed integer programming model to solve this problem of integration. This model considers alternative resources: sequences and precedence constraints. To solve the model, we develop a new evolutionary search approach based on a topological sort. We use the topological sort to generate a set of feasible sequences in the model within a reasonable computing time. Since precedence constraints between operations are handled by the topological sort, the developed evolutionary search approach produces only feasible solutions. The experimental results using various sizes of problems provide a way to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed evolutionary search approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
