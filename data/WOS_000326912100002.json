In the case of a particularly disruptive event, parts of the distribution infrastructure (e.g., bridges, roads) can be damaged. This damage would make it impossible and/or unsafe for the vehicles to reach all the centers of demand (e.g., towns and villages). In this paper, we propose and solve the problem of planning for recovery of damaged elements of the distribution network, so that the consequent distribution planning would benefit the most. We apply the model, called RecHADS, to a case study based on the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We also show empirically the importance of coordinating recovery and distribution operations optimization.
