By analyzing the fact data of H1N1 influenza provided by Beijing Health Bureau, contact tracing mechanism is used to research H1N1 virus transmission dynamics with this model. Furthermore, the contact tracing coefficient and random checking coefficient are studied to analyze their impact on the peak value of new infections and cumulative number of infections. The simulation result fits well with the statistical data. It shows that the model built in this paper is valid and complex network model to simulate the epidemics of H1N1 influenza is feasible.", "paper_title": "Modeling Disease Spreading on Complex Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500011"}
