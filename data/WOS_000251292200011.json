With the scale down of technology to deep-submicrometer level, the crosstalk effect between adjacent wires becomes more and more serious, particularly between long on-chip buses. In this paper, we propose a deassemble assembler technique to eliminate undesirable crosstalk effects on bus transmission. By taking advantage of the prefetch process, where the instruction/data fetch rate is always higher than the instrucition/data commit rate, the proposed method incurs almost no penalty in terms of dynamic instruction count. In addition, when the bus width is 128 b, the required number of extra bus wires is only 7 as compared to the 85 extra bus wires needed in the work of Victor and Keutzer.", "paper_title": "A bus-encoding scheme for crosstalk elimination in high-performance processor design", "paper_id": "WOS:000251292200011"}
