The main steps of the procedure are: construct the attribute set; construct the evaluation object set; construct evaluation perspectives with corresponding attributes and weights: select evaluation algorithms for different perspectives: and carry out cluster analysis on the multidimensional evaluation results. This framework can effectively solve the problem of attribute overlapping of different perspectives and proper algorithms can be applied to different perspectives according to their characteristics. Based on the business data of a tobacco company, a customer evaluation system is designed according to this framework. Results show that the framework is effective and practical.
