A short history describes the development of the use of technology in business, and discusses the need for a framework to define the skills required by those who develop and manage systems. The European e-Competence Framework (e-CF) for ICT practitioners was developed by the CEN Workshop for ICT Skills, this workshop being part of the European Standards body. The paper discusses the development of the framework and describes how the need for skills in using technology has progressed, as the business landscape has become more complex with ICT becoming an important part of every organisation. It examines the current situation in ICT skill requirements and how the changing landscape of work will necessitate continuous review of these skills.", "paper_title": "THE EUROPEAN E-COMPETENCE FRAMEWORK: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000361965300002"}
