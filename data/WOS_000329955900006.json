Our aim in this work is to evaluate the usefulness of the Emotiv EPOC EEG device to measure brain activations due to the sense of presence in a virtual environment (VE), using for the analysis the sLORETA tool. We compare between three experimental conditions: photographs, video and free navigation through a VE. We also compare the differences in the sense of presence due to the visualization of the VE in different screens: a common desktop screen and a high-resolution power wall screen. We monitored 20 healthy subjects, obtaining significant differences between the navigation and video conditions in the activity of the right Insula for the Theta band. We also found a higher activation of the Insula for the Alpha and Theta bands while navigating, when comparing the two screen types. The Insula activation is related to stimulus attention and self-awareness processes, directly related with the sense of presence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
