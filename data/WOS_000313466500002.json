However, traditional SCADA systems are not suitable for the openness and distribution requirements of smart grid. Distributed SCADA services should be openly composable and secure. Event-driven methodology makes service collaborations more real-time and flexible because of the space, time and control decoupling of event producer and consumer, which gives us an appropriate foundation. Our SCADA services are constructed and integrated based on distributed events in this paper. Unfortunately, an event-driven SCADA service does not know who consumes its events, and consumers do not know who produces the events either. In this environment, a SCADA service cannot directly control access because of anonymous and multicast interactions. In this paper, a distributed security framework is proposed to protect not only service operations but also data contents in smart grid environments. Finally, a security implementation scheme is given for SCADA services.", "paper_title": "Wide-Area SCADA System with Distributed Security Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000313466500002"}
