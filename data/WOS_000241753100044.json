However, in synthenic aperture radar (SAR) images the noise is multiplicative, so the applicability of ICA is seriously reduced. This paper proposes a new robust independent component analysis neural network (RICANN) that improves the robustness of ICA by adding outlier rejection rule. Its application in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is discussed. The results show the potential usage in SAR image processing problems.", "paper_title": "Robust ICA neural network and application on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100044"}
