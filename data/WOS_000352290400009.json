In this way, the augmented penetration of these vehicles mandates employing new operative tools to inspect their impacts on electrical grids. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel optimal stochastic reconfiguration methodology to moderate the charging effect of PHEVs by changing the topology of grid using some remote controlled switches. Uncertainties associated with network demand, energy price, and PHEV charging behavior in different charging frameworks are handled with Monte Carlo simulation and the proposed stochastic problem is solved with krill herd optimization algorithm. Numerical studies on Tai-power distribution system verify the efficacy of proposed reconfiguration to improve the system performance considering PHEV charging loads.", "paper_title": "Expected Cost Minimization of Smart Grids With Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using Optimal Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290400009"}
