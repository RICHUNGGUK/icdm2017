Specifically, such problems are either in ALogtime or are L-hard. This involves demonstrating that if CSP(B) is first-order expressible, and B is a core, then QCSP(B) is in ALogtime. We show that the class of B such that CSP(B) is first-order expressible (indeed trivial) is a microcosm for all QCSPs. Specifically, for any B there exists a C - generally not a core - such that CSP(C) is trivial, yet QCSP(B) and QCSP(C) are equivalent under logspace reductions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
