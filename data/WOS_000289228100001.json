This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored. The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.", "paper_title": "The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000289228100001"}
