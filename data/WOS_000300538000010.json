However, the physical realization could be challenging, especially when the recovery process involves high-rank projection operators and a superoperator. We use operator theory to improve OQEC so that the implementation can always be done by unitary gates followed by a partial trace operation. Examples are given to show that our error correction scheme outperforms the existing ones in various scenarios.", "paper_title": "RECOVERY IN QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION FOR GENERAL NOISE WITHOUT MEASUREMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000010"}
