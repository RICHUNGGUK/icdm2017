This kind of approach is interesting because it allows both storage and access to provenance data in a homogeneous way, even in an environment where different workflow management systems work together. However, current approaches overload scientists with many ad hoc tasks, such as script adaptations and implementations of extra functionalities to provide provenance independence. This paper proposes ProvManager, a provenance management approach that eases the gathering, storage, and analysis of provenance information in a distributed and heterogeneous environment scenario, without putting the burden of adaptations on the scientist. ProvManager leverages the provenance management at the experiment level by integrating different workflow executions from multiple workflow management systems.
