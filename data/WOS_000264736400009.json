Two regression methods were applied to correlate such descriptors with the activities column vector: bilinear (classical) and multilinear (N-way) partial least squares-PLS and WKS, respectively. The PLS-based model for this series of compounds demonstrated higher predictive ability than the N-PLS-based model, in opposition to some published results for other series of compounds. The activities block was taken in logarithmic scale (pMiC(90(cpd))/pMIC(90(bifonazole))) and the statistical performance of both models was found to be significantly better than the CoMFA analysis previously established.
