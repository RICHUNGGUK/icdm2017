Based on their colour contrast, different minerals were manually and automatically digitized on micro to macro scales. Depending on the digitized mineral phase, the accuracy of the automated digitizing procedure varies. Quantification of mineral distribution patterns was performed by box-counting. The results do not depend greatly on the pattern's pixel density and are similar to each other, even if automatic recording is performed at reduced precision in comparison to manual recording. Consequently, box-counting measurement of automatically recorded mineral distribution patterns (i) leads to fast and accurate pattern quantification, (ii) allows analysis of various phase distribution patterns from micro to macro scales, and (iii) forms an excellent basis for receiving information on pattern-forming processes, which is not available otherwise.
