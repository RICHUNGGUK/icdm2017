This paper proposes a novel imaging method using flash/no-flash image pairs. Through transferring the natural tone of the former to the latter, the resulting image has a high SNR and maintains a natural appearance. For realtime implementation, we use two preview images, which are taken with and without flash, to estimate the transformation function in advance. Then we use this function to adjust the tone of the image captured with flash in real time. Thus, the method does not require a frame memory and it is suitable for cell phone cameras.", "paper_title": "A Novel Imaging Method for Cell Phone Camera in Low Ambient Light Conditions Using Flash and No-Flash Image Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000318054200021"}
