Design/methodology/approach - Statistical results were obtained from implementing a recently proposed model of city traffic based on elementary cellular automata in a computer simulation. Findings - The self-organizing method delivers considerable improvements over the green-wave method. Seven dynamical regimes and six phase transitions are identified and analyzed for the self-organizing method. Practical implications The paper shows that traffic light coordination can be improved in cities by using self-organizing methods. Social implications This improvement can have a noticeable effect on the quality of life of citizens. Originality/value - Understanding how self-organization obtains adaptive solutions for complex problems can contribute to building more efficient systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive self-organization vs static optimization A qualitative comparison in traffic light coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000306446600008"}
