Management tasks may be assigned to an agent, which delegates and executes management logic in a distributed and autonomous fashion. MA-based management has been a subject of intense research in the past few years, reflected on the proliferation of MA platforms (MAPs) expressly oriented to distributed management. However, most of these platforms impose considerable burden on network and system resources and also lack of essential functionality, such as security mechanisms, fault tolerance, strategies for building network-aware MA itineraries and support for user-friendly customization of MA-based management tasks. In this paper, we discuss the design considerations and implementation details of a complete MAP research prototype that Sufficiently addresses all the aforementioned issues. Our MAP has been implemented in Java and optimized for network and systems management applications. The paper also presents the evaluation results of our prototype in real and simulated networking environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
