A planar graph is said to have a no-bend orthogonal drawing if at least one of its plane embeddings has a no-bend orthogonal drawing. Every series-parallel graph is planar. In this paper we give a linear-time algorithm to examine whether a series-parallel graph G of the maximum degree three has a no-bend orthogonal drawing and to find one if G has.", "paper_title": "No-bend orthogonal drawings of series-parallel graphs - (Extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300037"}
