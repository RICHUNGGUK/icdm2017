Linear and nonlinear preconditioners have been derived and analyzed. The effectiveness of various combinations of these preconditioners are compared using the source iteration, matrix-free Picard Krylov, and nonlinear Krylov acceleration methods. In one dimension, preconditioning with a linear S(2)SA diffusion equation is found to be essentially equivalent to using a nonlinear diffusion equation. The ability to use a linear diffusion equation has important implications for preconditioning the S-n equations with a strictly nonnegative spatial discretization in multiple dimensions.
