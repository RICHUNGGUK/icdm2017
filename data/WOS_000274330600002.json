A novel current-mode algorithm which uses time to perform analog-to-digital conversion has been described and a 12 bit 100-ksample/s time-based pipeline analog to digital converter has been designed and simulated in standard 90-nm CMOS technology based on introduced structure. Employed circuit techniques include a continues-time comparator, bottom plate sampling, digital correction and a state machine. A time based-mechanism has been used for subtraction and amplification. Simulation results show that the pipelined ADC achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 69.8 dB, a peak spurious-free dynamic range of 75 dB, a total harmonic distortion of 73 dB, and a peak integral nonlinearity of 0.85 least significant bits. The total power dissipation is 90 mu W from a 3-V supply.", "paper_title": "A novel time-based low-power pipeline analog to digital converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000274330600002"}
