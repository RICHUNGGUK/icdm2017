To model light propagation through random media to a specific position, elimination of light reaching the target position is necessary to prevent further reverberation through the simulation space and become a source of noise. Various factors that affect the performance of the optical target are analyzed, including shape of the wavefront and alignment of the impinging light. Simulation results show that incident light can be most effectively eliminated for incident wavefront normally impinging upon the optical target. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
