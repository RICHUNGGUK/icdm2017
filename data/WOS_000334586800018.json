(2013) [3]. The second purpose is to offer a new basis that leads to prolate-collocation systems with condition numbers independent of (c, N), the intrinsic bandwidth parameter and the number of collocation points. We highlight that the collocation scheme together with a very practical rule for pairing up (c, N) significantly outperforms the Legendre polynomial-based method (and likewise other Jacobi polynomial-based methods) in approximating highly oscillatory bandlimited functions.
