The transistor consists of n-relativistic spin qubits moving in classical external electromagnetic fields. It is shown that the tuning of the direction of the external electromagnetic fields generates perturbation on the potential temporally and spatially, determining the type of quantum logic gates. The theory underlying of this scheme is on the proposal of the intertwining operator for Darboux transfomations on one-dimensional Dirac equation amalgamating the vector-quantum gates duality of Pauli matrices. Simultaneous transformation of qubit and energy can be accomplished by setting the {control, cyclic}-operators attached on the coupling between one-qubit quantum gate: the chose of cyclic-operator swaps the qubit and energy simultaneously, while control-operator ensures the energy conservation.", "paper_title": "DIRAC FOUR-POTENTIAL TUNINGS-BASED QUANTUM TRANSISTOR UTILIZING THE LORENTZ FORCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000309484400007"}
