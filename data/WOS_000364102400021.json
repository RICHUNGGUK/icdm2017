We pose the problem as one of classification of human gazing direction. We further fine-tune a regressor based on the learned deep classifier. Next we combine the two models (classification and regression) to estimate approximate regression confidence. We present state-of-the-art results in datasets that span the range of high-resolution human robot interaction (close up faces plus depth information) data to challenging low resolution outdoor surveillance data. We build upon our robust head-pose estimation and further introduce a new visual attention model to recover interaction with the environment. Using this probabilistic model, we show that many higher level scene understanding like human-human/scene interaction detection can be achieved. Our solution runs in real-time on commercial hardware.", "paper_title": "Deep Head Pose: Gaze-Direction Estimation in Multimodal Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000364102400021"}
