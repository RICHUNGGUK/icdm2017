In particular, we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck [Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 25th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, 2010, pp. 247-258] and prove that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed partition bound subsumes all norm-based methods (e.g., the gamma 2 method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g., the rectangle/corruption bound, the smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound. Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication protocols, where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove, using a sampling protocol designed by Braverman and Weinstein [in Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 7408, Springer, Heidelberg, 2012, pp. 459-470], the following compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information complexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has nonabort probability at least 2-(O(I)) and that computes f correctly with high probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a zero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our main theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman [Proceedings of the 44th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2012, pp. 505-524]. First, we show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem [B. Klartag and O. Regev, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2011, pp. 31-40] is Omega(n(1/3)), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential separation between quantum communication complexity and classical information complexity. Moreover, we provide an Omega(n) lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance Problem.", "paper_title": "LOWER BOUNDS ON INFORMATION COMPLEXITY VIA ZERO-COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS AND APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000364454500012"}
