Experimental data, which had been collected continuously within a 6-year period (1998-2003) at the earthquake signal-acquisition center of the University of Patras Seismological Laboratory (UPSL), were studied. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique was used to detect putative clustering tendencies in the ensemble of time-series (TS) segments that could indicate the existence of a possible correlation between the geoelectric signal structure and the impending seismic activity. The end result is a 2-dimensional point diagram with the geometry reflecting important signal characteristics, directly related with the underlying seismic events. In addition, the \"appending technique\", a well-suited data analysis methodology was incorporated as a means of relating any other TS segment directly with the pre-computed, via the MDS, point diagram. Using the proposed EDA framework, we examined the presence of similar temporal patterns in the recorded geoelectric TS field, 10 days before the occurrence of the major earthquakes. The presented experimental results indicated clearly the validity of the introduced approach and, further, motivated the use of such advanced visualization schemes for charting precursor trends of significance seismicity.
