The K-terminal reliability of this graph is the probability that a given set of vertices K are connected to each other. This reliability problem is known to be #P-complete for general graphs, and it remains #P-complete for chordal graphs and comparability graphs. This work proposes an O(n(2d+1))-time algorithm for computing the K-terminal reliability of d-trapezoid graphs. With some modifications, the algorithm is executed in O(n(2)) time for interval graphs.
