One can define convergence in terms of counting homomorphisms from fixed graphs into members of the sequence (left-convergence), or counting homomorphisms into fixed graphs (right-convergence). Under appropriate conditions, these two ways of defining convergence was proved to be equivalent in the dense case by Borgs, Chayes, Lovasz, Sos and Vesztergombi. In this paper a similar equivalence is established in the bounded degree case, if the set of graphs in the definition of right-convergence is appropriately restricted. In terms of statistical physics, the implication that left convergence implies right convergence means that for a left-convergent sequence, partition functions of a large class of statistical physics models converge. The proof relies on techniques from statistical physics, like cluster expansion and Dobrushin Uniqueness. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
