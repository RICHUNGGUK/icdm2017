High-speed services and bulk transmission are now available, and various next-generation converged services are undergoing change as a result of demand by various services. There is also a perceived need now for video-conferencing to exchange know-how between hospitals and medical schools over cloud network. It is now time to elaborate a new wellness service incorporating diverse options. In this paper, we will examine the secure transfer of wellness information over distributed cloud network, especially medical data, and how such information should be disseminated to a network model.", "paper_title": "A virtualized network model for wellness information technology research", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700029"}
