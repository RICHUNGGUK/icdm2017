We applied the data mining approach in data from 1140 children (9-13 years), in order to derive dietary habits related to children's obesity status. Rules emerged via data mining approach revealed the detrimental influence of the increased consumption of soft dinks, delicatessen meat, sweets, fried and junk food. For example, frequent (3-5 times/week) consumption of all these foods increases the risk for being obese by 75%, whereas in children who have a similar dietary pattern, but eat > 2 times/week fish and seafood the risk for obesity is reduced by 33%. In conclusion patterns revealed from data mining technique refer to specific groups of children and demonstrate the effect on the risk associated with obesity status when a single dietary habit might be modified. Thus, a more individualized approach when translating public health messages could be achieved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
