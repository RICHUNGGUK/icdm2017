The controller, which possesses finite-time convergence and strong robustness, consists of two parts, namely a neural network for approximating the nonlinear uncertainty function and a modified variable structure term for eliminating the approximate error and guaranteeing the finite-time convergence. According to the analysis based on the Lyapunov theory and the relative finite-time stability theory, the neural network is asymptotically convergent and the controlled robotic system is finite time stable. The proposed controller is then verified on a two-link robotic manipulator by simulations and experiments, with satisfactory control performance being obtained even in the presence of various uncertainties and external disturbances.
