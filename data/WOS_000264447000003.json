We give short and conceptual proofs with geometric insights and efficient algorithms. In particular, we provide a method to reparameterize an improper parameterization and we also briefly explain how to deal with approximate input data. Finally we provide an algorithmic description of self-intersection loci. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
