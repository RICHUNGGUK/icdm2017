The essential part of fuzzy PID controller is the fuzzy logic control, which is a multi-input-multi-output controller. A design method of the fuzzy PID controller is presented. The simulation results show that the proposed Fuzzy PID controller has preferable performance and significant advantages over the traditional PID controller.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy PID controller for controlling flotation de-inking column", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300010"}
