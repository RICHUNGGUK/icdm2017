In addition, the neighbor nodes are randomly uniformly deployed with the Poisson Point Process. By varying the combination of the physical carrier-sensing range of the transmitter node and the target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) set by the receiver node, we can control the interference level in the network and the degree of spatial reuse of a frequency band. The larger the carrier-sensing range is, the smaller the interference level, while the smaller the opportunity of getting a channel by a node. Similarly, the higher the target SIR value is, the more probable the retransmission (by the exponential random backoff) is, while the better the link quality on successful transmission is getting. Under this tradeoff context, we find the optimal combinations of these two factors that make the end-to-end throughput of the flow maximal for three different retransmission schemes.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Optimization and Network Coding in CSMA/CA-Based Wireless Multihop Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294007700008"}
