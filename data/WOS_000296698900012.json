However, these studies have primarily used lexical decision tasks to examine the nature of syllable frequency effects. This study investigates whether a syllable frequency effect can arise in semantic categorization tasks and whether phonologically or orthographically defined syllables interact with semantically related variables such as morphological family size. If the syllable frequency effect was created by activations and competitions on a lexical level, it is highly possible that the effect was related to semantic categorization tasks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, morphological family size and phonological syllable frequency were factorially manipulated. In Experiment 2, morphological family size and orthographic syllable frequency were factorially manipulated. The results demonstrate that morphemes have no relationship with phonological syllables but do with orthographic syllables. This suggests that phonological syllables and orthographic syllables have different roles in the syllable frequency effect on visual word recognition process.", "paper_title": "The Syllable Frequency Effect in Semantic Categorization Tasks in Korean", "paper_id": "WOS:000296698900012"}
