In this approach, the use of higher ISO settings will reduce exposure times, and thereby the total capture time. This is advantageous in certain environments where it may help minimize ghosting artifacts. However, exposures taken at high sensitivity settings tend to be noisy, which is further amplified by the HDR creation algorithm. We present a robust and efficient technique to significantly reduce noise in an HDR image even when its constituent exposures are taken at very high ISO settings. The method does not introduce blur or other artifacts, and leverages the wealth of information available in a sequence of aligned exposures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
