The design consists of a search tree, matching circuitry, and a custom memory layout. It is implemented using 130-nm silicon technology and supports quality of service (QoS) on networks at line speeds of 40 Gb/s, enabling next generation IP services to be deployed.", "paper_title": "A scalable packet sorting circuit for high-speed WFQ packet scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500001"}
