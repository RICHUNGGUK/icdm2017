This model allows the observed variability to be split into three components: randomness, internal differences between individuals and the presence of other external factors that have not been included as covariates in the model. An application in the field of sports illustrates its capacity for modelling data sets with great accuracy. Moreover, this yields more information than a model based on the negative binomial distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
