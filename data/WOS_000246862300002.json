Moreover, some of these methods have a very simple structure-they involve only few message exchanges between the communicating parties. It is therefore natural to ask whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a \"simpler\" quantum protocol-one that has similar efficiency, but uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a problem such that its k + I message classical communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity. This, in particular, proves a round hierarchy theorem for quantum communication complexity, and implies, via a simple reduction, an Omega(N-1/k) lower bound for k message quantum protocols for Set Disjointness for constant k. Enroute, we prove information-theoretic lemmas, and define a related measure of correlation, the informational distance, that we believe may be of significance in other contexts as well.", "paper_title": "Interaction in quantum communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000246862300002"}
