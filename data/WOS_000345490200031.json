The Ewald summation technique suffers from the high-frequency breakdown when it is applied to Green's functions of wave problems. In the case of the rectangular cavity Green's function, the number of necessary terms in the spectral series grows, therefore, cubically with frequency for a given accuracy. To counteract the high-frequency breakdown, the evaluation of the spectral series is accelerated with an inverse fast Fourier transform in this work. At high frequencies, a speed-up of up to four orders of magnitude is achieved. As an application example, a reverberation chamber containing a metallic enclosure and a modestirrer is modeled.(C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
