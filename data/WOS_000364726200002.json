In this paper, the matrix theory for pin-jointed trusses is firstly recalled. Then, through an elementary cable dome, the role of prestress is outlined and commented. Finally, a special optimization procedure, based on genetic algorithms, allows a thorough comparison between classical structural schemes, whose bearing capacity is due to the mechanical stiffness, and prestressed structures, whose bearing capacity is also due to the geometrical stiffness provided by the prestress.
