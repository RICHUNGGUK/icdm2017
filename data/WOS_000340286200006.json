This topology affords the inclusion of transmission zeros maintaining a cross-sectional structure similar to that of a stripline. Therefore, the manufacturing cost is very close to an all-pole prototype. Two design strategies for the coupling structure are discussed: one of them achieving filters with enhanced performance. Both strategies have been assessed implementing prototypes in low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology. The fabricated filters exhibit operating frequencies at 5775 MHz and 8000 MHz with 2.6% and 3.75% pass-band fractional bandwidths, respectively, and up to 60 dB IL in the rejection band.
