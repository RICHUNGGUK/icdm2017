We rely on two operators to compute the projection: the well-known graph Laplacian and a geometric operator designed to emphasize concavity. The two embeddings reveal distinctive shape semantics of the 3D model and complement each other in capturing the structural or geometrical aspect of a segmentation. Transforming the shape analysis problem to the 2D domain also facilitates our segmentability analysis and sampling tasks. We propose a novel measure of the segmentability of a shape, which is used as the stopping criterion for our segmentation. The measure is derived from simple area- and perimeter-based convexity measures. We achieve invariance to shape bending through multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on the notion of inner distance. We also utilize inner distances to develop a novel sampling scheme to extract two samples along a contour which correspond to two vertices residing on different parts of the sub-mesh. The two samples are used to derive a spectral linear ordering of the mesh faces. We obtain a final cut via a linear search over the face sequence based on part salience, where a choice of weights,for different factors of part salience is guided by the result from segmentability analysis.", "paper_title": "Mesh segmentation via spectral embedding and contour analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500020"}
