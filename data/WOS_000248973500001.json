The problem we address is to design a state feedback controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and satisfies a prescribed H(infinity) performance level. First, a delay-dependent sufficient condition for the solvability of the problem is obtained in terms of matrix inequalities. Then, by using the cone complementarity linearization approach, an H(infinity) controller is developed based on the solvability condition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent H(infinity) controller design for linear neutral systems with discrete and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000248973500001"}
