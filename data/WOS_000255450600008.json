In this paper, we present an extension of the GAM that allows for the introduction of factors and their interactions with continuous variables, for reducing false positives in a CAD system for detecting clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms. The results obtained have shown an increase in the sensitivity from 83.12% to 85.71%, while the false positive rate was drastically reduced from 1.46 to 0.74 false detections per image.
