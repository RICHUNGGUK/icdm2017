In the first, the scores are obtained after an oblique projection of the spectra onto the loadings. In the second, the vector of response values is projected orthogonally onto the scores. A metric is introduced for the oblique projection and a new algorithm for the calculation of the loadings into the variables space is proposed. This work also develops a new parameter, a vector, whose different values lead to different regression models with their own abilities of prediction; one of them is the exact form of the standard PLSR. Two applications are described to illustrate the performance of the proposed method called VODKA regression, which is also a way to build least square regressions by introducing additional knowledge into the models.
