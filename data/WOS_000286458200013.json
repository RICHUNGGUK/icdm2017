Two case studies demonstrate how the analysis procedure works, and provide a basis for comparison of the proposed method to the original TOPSIS and similar methods. In applications, the new method produces results that are generally consistent with the original technique, but offers new features such as a clear interpretation of extreme points, more flexibility in setting extreme points, no normalization distortion, and the ability to handle non-monotonic criteria.
