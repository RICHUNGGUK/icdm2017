The learning activities are always interfered while the network connection is failed. Furthermore, the learning contents become more and more miscellaneous with on-line multimedia presentations, and it is necessary for learners to wait for the learning resources to be downloaded from the remote learning server. In this paper, we propose a solution, called Caching Strategy, to solve those issues under the ubiquitous learning scope. According to some specific factors, we aim to provide the most needed learning resources for learners on the mobile learning devices even if the internet connection is not available intermittently. With our proposed methods, the waiting time of learning contents delivery can be reduced as well to smooth the learning activities online. In order to increase the efficiency of the strategy, we carefully examine some specific factors about the learning sequencing defined in the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM). After applying this strategy to distance learning system, the efficient ubiquitous learning will be easier to come true.", "paper_title": "A SCORM-based caching strategy for supporting ubiquitous learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800054"}
