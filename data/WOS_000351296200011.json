The proposed method uses fuzzy membership value as chromosome. In addition, due to this innovative chromosome setting, a more efficient solution selection technique which selects a solution from non-dominated Pareto front based on the largest fuzzy membership is integrated in the proposed algorithm. The multiple objective functions: fuzzy compactness within a cluster (pi) and separation among clusters (sep) are used to optimize the clustering quality. A series of experiments by using three UCI categorical datasets were conducted to compare the clustering results of the proposed NSGA-FMC with two existing methods: genetic algorithm fuzzy K-modes (GA-FKM) and multi-objective genetic algorithmbased fuzzy clustering of categorical attributes (MOGA (pi, sep)). Adjusted Rand index (ARI), pi, sep, and computation time were used as performance indexes for comparison. The experimental result showed that the proposed method can obtain better clustering quality in terms of ARI, pi, and sep simultaneously with shorter computation time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
