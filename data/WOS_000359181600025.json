To solve the difficult L1 norm problems, the split Bregman iteration is employed. Several synthetic degraded images are used for experiments. Comparison results are also made with total variation and nonlocal total variation based method. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only is robust to noise and different blur kernels, but also performs well on blurring images with more detailed textures, and the stair-casing effect is well suppressed.
