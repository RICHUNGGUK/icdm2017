With the proposed algorithm, we show that although flexible in adaptive modulation (AM) for different users, the BD-VP algorithm is suboptimal in minimizing the total transmit power. To achieve the flexibility and performance (diversity gain and achievable sum rate) tradeoff, we further develop a low complexity user grouping vector perturbation (UG-VP) algorithm. Analysis and simulation results validate the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity User Grouping Vector Perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100012"}
