A random connections model is assumed in which the channel connections between the nodes are drawn independently from a common distribution. Transmitting nodes are subject to an on-off strategy, and receiving nodes employ conventional single-user decoding. The following results are proven: 1) for a class of connection models with finite mean and variance, the throughput scaling is upper-bounded by (n(1/3)) for single-hop schemes, and O(n(1/2)) for two-hop (and multihop) schemes; 2) the Theta(n(1/2)) throughput scaling is achievable for a specific connection model by a two-hop opportunistic relaying scheme, which employs full, but only local channel state information (CSI) at the receivers, and partial CSI at the transmitters; 3) by relaxing the constraints of finite mean and variance of the connection model, linear throughput scaling Theta(n) is achievable with Pareto-type fading models.", "paper_title": "Throughput Scaling of Wireless Networks With Random Connections", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700012"}
