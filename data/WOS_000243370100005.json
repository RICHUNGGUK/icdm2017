They also reflect on the features of the currently available information managers (IMs), from an educational point of view. They found there is a lack of tools for information management at low scale when it has to be used as a resource for teaching and learning. Finally, they propose a solution, which consists of naming a \"small virtual educational library\" (SVEL), and they show how it works in a physics education context.
