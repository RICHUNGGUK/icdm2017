Metal ions (e.g. Cu, Fe, and Zn) are supposed to induce the aggregation of A beta. Recent development of bifunctional molecules that are capable of interacting with A beta and chelating biometal ions provides promising therapeutics to AD. However, the molecular mechanism for how A beta, metal ions, and bifunctional molecules interact with each other is still elusive. In this study, the binding mode of Zn2+-bound A beta with bifunctional molecules was investigated by the combination of conformational sampling of full-length A beta peptides using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations (REMD) and conformational selection using molecular docking and classical MD simulations. We demonstrate that Zn2+-bound A beta((1-40)) and A beta((1-42)) exhibit different conformational ensemble. Both A beta peptides can adopt various conformations to recognize typical bifunctional molecules with different binding affinities. The bifunctional molecules exhibit their dual functions by first preferentially interfering with hydrophobic residues 17-21 and/or 30-35 of Zn2+-bound A beta. Additional interactions with residues surrounding Zn2+ could possibly disrupt interactions between Zn2+ and A beta, which then facilitate these small molecules to chelate Zn2+. The binding free energy calculations further demonstrate that the association of A beta with bifunctional molecules is driven by enthalpy. Our results provide a feasible approach to understand the recognition mechanism of disordered proteins with small molecules, which could be helpful to the design of novel AD drugs.", "paper_title": "Combining conformational sampling and selection to identify the binding mode of zinc-bound amyloid peptides with bifunctional molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000307890600006"}
