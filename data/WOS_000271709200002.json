It is known (Bang-Jensen (1991) [1]) that this problem is NP-complete even if r(1) = r(2). As a special case, it is only known (Bang-Jensen (1991) [1]) that this problem in a tournament can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper, we give a linear-time algorithm for this problem in a directed acyclic graph. We also consider an extension of our problem to the case where we have multiple roots for in-arborescences and out-arborescences, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
