The algorithm is based on a \"compact\" assignment of requested resources for the creation of a virtual network in the data center. The desired balance between the computational complexity and quality of the resultant maps can be specified by limiting the maximally acceptable search depth. Theoretical and experimental results of the investigation of this algorithm's properties are presented.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation algorithm in data centers with a unified scheduler for different types of resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000349909900006"}
