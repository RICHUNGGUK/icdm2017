We do not introduce a new non-classical logic but, based on a related study of Perny and Tsoukias, we introduce paraconsistent semantics of Pavelka style fuzzy sentential logic. Restricted to Lukasiewicz t-norm, our approach and the approach of Perny and Tsoukias partly overlap; the main difference lies in the interpretation of the logical connectives implication and negation. The essential mathematical tool proved in this paper is a one one correspondence between evidence couples and evidence matrices that holds in all injective MV-algebras. Evidence couples associate to each atomic formula p two values a and b that can be interpreted as the degrees of pros and cons for p, respectively. Four values t, f, k, u, interpreted as the degrees of the truth, falsehood, contradiction and unknownness of p, respectively, can then be calculated by means of a and b and finally, the degrees of the truth, falsehood, contradiction and unknownness of any well formed formula alpha are available. The obtained logic is Pavelka style fuzzy sentential logic. In such an approach truth and falsehood are not each others complements. Moreover, we solve some open problems presented by Perny and Tsoukias. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
