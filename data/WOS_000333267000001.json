However, it is difficult to efficiently manage a large number of sensor nodes and their sensing data owing to the limitations ofWSNs. Particularly, in agricultural applications, a WSN installed in a specific region is used for multiple services (i.e., greenhouse environment monitoring and control). However, the network resources (i.e., channel, battery, etc.) are currently being utilized for redundant operations requested from multiple service users owing to the lack of an efficient system for managing large WSN data. In this paper, we propose an agriculture sensor-cloud infrastructure (ASCI) to effectively provide various agricultural services using WSNs. In addition, we propose hierarchical source routing (HSR), aggregation gradient routing (AGR), and a priority-based data transmission technique in order to allow packets to be delivered to the destination fast and reliably in large-scale WSNs.", "paper_title": "Agriculture Sensor-Cloud Infrastructure and Routing Protocol in the Physical Sensor Network Layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000333267000001"}
