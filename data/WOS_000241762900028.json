The new method can deal with some cases in which neither of the existing methods those are based on minimum curvature variation or minimum strain energy can get pleasing shape. The comparison of the new method with the existing methods are given, which shows that none of the new method and the existing ones can deal with all the cases well. The experiments show that combination of the new method with the existing methods can achieve a good result in all cases.", "paper_title": "Geometric hermite curves based on different objective functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900028"}
