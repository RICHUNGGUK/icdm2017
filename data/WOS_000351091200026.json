This paper proposes a new feature selection method based on FIsher criterion and genetic optimization, called FIG for short, to tackle the CISL recognition problem. In our FIG feature selection method, the Fisher criterion is applied to evaluate feature subsets, based on which a genetic optimization algorithm is developed to find out an optimal feature subset from the candidate features. We use the FIG method to select the features for the CISL recognition from various types of features, including bag-of-visual-words based on the histogram of oriented gradients, the wavelet transform-based features, the local binary pattern, and the CT value histogram. Then, the selected features cooperate with each of five commonly used classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), Bagging (Bag), Naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and AdaBoost (Ada) to classify the regions of interests (ROIs) in lung CT images into the CISL categories. In order to evaluate the proposed feature selection method and CISL recognition approach, we conducted the fivefold cross-validation experiments on a set of 511 ROIs captured from real lung CT images. For all the considered classifiers, our FIG method brought the better recognition performance than not only the full set of original features but also any single type of features. We further compared our FIG method with the feature selection method based on classification accuracy rate and genetic optimization (ARG). The advantages on computation effectiveness and efficiency of FIG over ARG are shown through experiments.", "paper_title": "Recognizing Common CT Imaging Signs of Lung Diseases Through a New Feature Selection Method Based on Fisher Criterion and Genetic Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200026"}
