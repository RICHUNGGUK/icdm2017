In this paper, a piezoelectric flow sensor is proposed for use as a wake-up switch in a wireless sensor node to reduce power consumption. A cantilever with a Pb (Zr,Ti) O-3 (PZT) thin film detects airflow changes surrounding the wireless sensor node. A prototype of the flow sensor is used to determine the relationship between the change in flow velocity and piezoelectric voltage of the cantilever. The fabricated sensor generates a piezoelectric voltage of several millivolts when the flow velocity changes at a rate of approximately 1 m/s. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
