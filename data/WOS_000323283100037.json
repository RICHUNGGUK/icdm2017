In order to obtain the optimum location of the drug molecules, as they penetrate into the membrane, umbrella sampling is applied and the free energy is calculated. The effect of protein binding to DMPC membrane on the process of drug diffusion through the membrane is considered. Five simulation systems are designed and by applying the potential of mean force, the molecular dynamics simulation on the system is performed. In light of the obtained results, the electrostatic potential, variation of lipid bilayer's order parameter and the diffusion coefficient of drug are discussed.", "paper_title": "Effects of protein binding on a lipid bilayer containing local anesthetic articaine, and the potential of mean force calculation: a molecular dynamics simulation approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000323283100037"}
