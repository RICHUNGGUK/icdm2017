To position an object, most systems use a predefined coordinate to compute object location while sensing the appearance of the target object. Usually, it is troublesome and costs much to define the base coordinate in advance for most object positioning systems, especially when the target object is locating in an unknown environment. To reduce the cost and complexity of object locating system and improve the accuracy of location, this paper proposed an Object Finding System based on RFID technology to identify the localities of target objects in buildings. In this paper, we introduce the design concepts of the proposed system as well as the algorithms used to calculate the object locations. In addition, the experimental results show that it is a feasibility study.", "paper_title": "Object finding system based on RFID technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100051"}
