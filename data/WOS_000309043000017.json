Not only are they miss-recognized as in-vocabulary (IV) words with similar phonetics, but the error also causes further errors in nearby words. Language models (LMs) for most open vocabulary ASR systems treat OOV words as a single entity, ignoring the linguistic information. In this paper we present a class-based n-gram LM that is able to deal with OOV words by treating each of them individually without retraining all the LM parameters. OOV words are assigned to IV classes consisting of similar semantic meanings for IV words. The World Wide Web is used to acquire additional data for finding the relation between the OOV and IV words. An evaluation based on adjusted perplexity and word-error-rate was carried out on the Wall Street Journal corpus. The result suggests the preference of the use of multiple classes for OOV words, instead of one unknown class.", "paper_title": "Class-Based N-Gram Language Model for New Words Using Out-of-Vocabulary to In-Vocabulary Similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043000017"}
