Preference ratio with a moderate modification for negative fuzzy numbers was used as an efficient ranking method for fuzzy numbers in a relative manner. As human reasoning persuades that distances between two fuzzy numbers should be a fuzzy measure, so all distances between fuzzy numbers (i.e. distances between alternatives, Fuzzy Positive Ideal solutions, and Fuzzy Negative Ideal solutions) have been calculated as fuzzy numbers using an efficient fuzzy distance measurement. The aforementioned arguments make the proposed algorithm unique and well posed for real-life problem modeling. Moreover, the main novelties of the proposed procedure (i.e. the fuzzy distance measurement and Preference Ratio) have been developed for Generalized Fuzzy Numbers (GFNs). The proposed algorithm has efficiently been applied in assessment of traffic police centers which is treated as a FMCGDMP. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
