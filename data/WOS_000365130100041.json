Journal data are analyzed to show the common trends across the disciplines. The single-author papers decline continuously over the years. The multi-author papers rise and fall following one another in succession. The data suggest that small-group collaborations in different disciplines go through the same stages at different times. Besides the common trends, the dramatic growth of the co-author number in Physics after 1990 is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Temporal evolution of multi-author papers in basic sciences from 1960 to 2010", "paper_id": "WOS:000365130100041"}
