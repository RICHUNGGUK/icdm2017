Since the preferred quality of service (QoS) parameters may be distinct among different MTs, we then formulate the vertical handoff decision problem as a Markov decision process, with the objectives of maximizing the expected total reward and minimizing average number of handoffs. A reward function is constructed to assess the QoS during each connection, and the G1 and entropy methods are applied in an iterative way, by which we can work out a stationary deterministic handoff decision policy. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes compared with other existing algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
