Given a globally exponentially stable hybrid neural network, the aim of the paper is to characterize how much delay and noise intensity hybrid neural networks can bear such that the perturbed hybrid neural network remains globally exponentially stable, in the presence of delay and noise simultaneously. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the result.", "paper_title": "On the robustness of global exponential stability for hybrid neural networks with noise and delay perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900003"}
