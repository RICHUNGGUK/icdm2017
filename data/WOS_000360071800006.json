Existing state-of-the-art super resolution methods are learning based methods, where a pair of low-resolution and high-resolution dictionary pair are trained, and this trained pair is used to replace patches in low-resolution image with appropriate matching patches from the high-resolution dictionary. In this paper, we show that by using Approximate Nearest Neighbour Fields (ANNF), and a common source image, we can by-pass the learning phase, and use a single image for dictionary. Thus, reducing the dictionary from a collection obtained from hundreds of training images, to a single image. We show that by modifying the latest developments in ANNF computation, to suit super resolution, we can perform much faster and more accurate SR than existing techniques. To establish this claim we will compare our algorithm against various state-of-the-art algorithms, and show that we are able to achieve better and faster reconstruction without any training phase.", "paper_title": "Synthetic image super resolution using FeatureMatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071800006"}
