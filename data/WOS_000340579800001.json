Here we characterize the power of matchgates acting on arbitrary graphs. Specifically, we show that they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and that they are classically simulable on a cycle. We also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction, a proper subset of matchgates related to some implementations of quantum computing.", "paper_title": "THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER OF MATCHGATES AND THE XY INTERACTION ON ARBITRARY GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579800001"}
