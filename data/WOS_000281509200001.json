Distal pointing pointing directly at a target that is remotely situated with respect to the input device is such a motor behavior A model of distal pointing would be particularly useful in the comparison of different interaction techniques, because the performance of such techniques is highly dependent on user strategy, making controlled studies difficult to perform. Inspired by Fitts' law, we studied four possible models and concluded that movement time for a distal pointing task is best described as a function of the angular amplitude of movement and the angular size of the target Contrary to Fins' law, our model shows that the angular size has a much larger effect on movement time than the angular amplitude and that the growth in the difficulty of the tasks is quadratic, rather than linear We estimated the model's parameters experimentally with a correlation coefficient of 96% (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A human motor behavior model for distal pointing tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281509200001"}
