Previous work is limited to linear integrate-and-fire neurons. In this note, we extend event-driven schemes to a class of nonlinear integrate-and-fire models. Results are presented for the quadratic integrate-and-fire model with instantaneous or exponential synaptic currents. Extensions to conductance-based currents and exponential integrate-and-fire neurons are discussed.", "paper_title": "Event-driven simulations of nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000250751900004"}
