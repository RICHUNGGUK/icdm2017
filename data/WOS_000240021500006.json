We show that the standard notion of size is not captured by sets of parameters that are used in the literature and thus they cannot give a complete characterization in terms of learnability with polynomial resources. We then identify an alternative notion of size and a simple set of parameters that are useful for first order Horn Expressions. These parameters are the number of clauses in the expression, the maximum number of distinct terms in a clause, and the maximum number of literals in a clause. Matching lower bounds derived using the Vapnik Chervonenkis dimension complete the picture showing that these parameters are indeed crucial.", "paper_title": "Complexity parameters for first order classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240021500006"}
