Many research papers about privacy-preserving k-means clustering were published. In this paper, we analyze the existing privacy-preserving k-means clustering schemes based on the cryptographic techniques. We show those schemes will cause the privacy breach and cannot output the correct results due to the faults in the protocol construction. Furthermore, we analyze our proposal as an option to improve such problems but with intermediate information breach during the computation.", "paper_title": "Security and Correctness Analysis on Privacy-Preserving k-Means Clustering Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700041"}
