The flow at Re = 15000 is simulated by solving 2D Navier-Stokes equations in stream function-vorticity formulation. High accuracy compact scheme for space discretization and four stage Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration makes such simulation possible. While numerical solution for this flow field has been reported using a fast viscous-vortex method, to our knowledge, this has not been done at such a high Reynolds number by computing the Navier-Stokes equation before. The importance of scale resolution, aliasing problem and preservation of physical dispersion relation for such vortical flows of the used high accuracy schemes [Sengupta TK. Fundamentals of computational fluid dynamics. Hyderabad, India: University Press; 2004] is highlighted. For the dynamic problem, a novel genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique has been adopted, where solutions of Navier-Stokes equations are obtained using small time-horizons at every step of the optimization process, called a GA generation. Then the objective functions is evaluated that is followed by GA determined improvement of the decision variables. This procedure of time advancement can also be adopted to control such flows experimentally, as one obtains time-accurate solution of the Navier-Stokes equation subject to discrete changes of decision variables. The objective function - the time-averaged drag - is optimized using a real-coded genetic algorithm [Deb K. Multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms. Chichester, UK: Wiley; 2001] for the two decision variables, the maximum rotation rate and the forcing frequency of the rotary oscillation. Various approaches to optimal decision variables have been explored for the purpose of drag reduction and the collection of results are self-consistent and furthermore match well with the experimental values reported in [Tokumaru PT, Dimotakis PE.
