The majority of present algorithms only find disjoint communities, however, community often overlap to some extent in many real-world networks. In this paper, an improved multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (IMOQPSO) based on spectral-clustering is proposed to detect the overlapping community structure in complex networks. Firstly, the line graph of the graph modeling the network is formed, and a spectral method is employed to extract the spectral information of the line graph. Secondly, IMOQPSO is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem so as to resolve the separated community structure in the line graph which corresponding to the overlapping community structure in the graph presenting the network. Finally, a fine-tuning strategy is adopted to improve the accuracy of community detection. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate our method achieves cover results which fit the real situation in an even better fashion.", "paper_title": "Overlapping community detection through an improved multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000358197300005"}
