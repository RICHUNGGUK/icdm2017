Usually, interest points are considered as independent elements described by some local information. Due to the limitations of such an approach, many incorrect correspondences can be obtained. A specific contribution of this paper is the proposition of a topological operator, called Local Morse Context (LMC), computed over Morse complexes, introduced as a way of efficiently computing neighborhoods of interest points to explore the structural information in images. The LMC is used in the development of a matching algorithm, that helps reducing the number of incorrect matches, and obtaining a confidence measure of whether a correspondence is correct or incorrect. The approach is designed and tested for the correspondence of narrow-baseline synthetic and specially challenging underwater stereo pairs of images, for which traditional methods present difficulties for finding correct correspondences.
