Therefore, warehouse management systems (WMSs) have been developed for handling warehouse resources and monitoring warehouse operations. However. it is difficult to update daily operations of inventory level, locations of forklifts and stock keeping units (SKUs) in real-time by using the bar-code-based or manual-based warehouse management systems. In this paper, RFID technology is adopted to facilitate the collection and sharing of data in a warehouse. Tests are performed for evaluating the reading performance of both the active and passive RFID apparatus. With the help of the testing results, the efficient radio frequency cover ranges of the readers are examined for formulating a radio frequency identification case-based logistics resource management system (R-LRMS). The capabilities of R-LRMS are demonstrated in GSL Limited. Three objectives are achieved: (i) a simplification of RFID adoption procedure, (ii) an improvement in the visibility of warehouse operations and (iii) an enhancement of the productivity of the warehouse. The successful case example proved the feasibility of R-LRMS in real working practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
