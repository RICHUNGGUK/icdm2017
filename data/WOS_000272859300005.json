For this reason, there is an increasing need for adequate design tools in order to cope efficiently with tightening budgets for space missions. The paper discusses the main issues related to the modelling and simulation of satellite dynamics for control purposes, and then presents an object-oriented modelling framework, implemented as a Modelica library. The proposed approach allows a unified approach to a range of problems spanning from initial mission design and actuator sizing phases, down to detailed closed-loop simulation of the control system, including realistic models of sensors and actuators. It also promotes the reuse of modelling knowledge among similar missions, thus minimizing the design effort for any new project. The proposed framework and the Modelica library are demonstrated by several illustrative case studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
