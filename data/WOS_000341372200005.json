Split grammars are a promising technology for large-scale procedural generation of urban structures, which are very common in video games. Buildings with curved parts, however, can currently only be approximated by static pre-modelled assets, and rules apply only to planar surface parts. We present an extension to split grammar systems that allow the creation of curved architecture through integration of free-form deformations at any level in a grammar. Further split rules can then proceed in two different ways. They can either adapt to these deformations so that repetitions can adjust to more or less space, while maintaining length constraints, or they can split the deformed geometry with straight planes to introduce straight structures on deformed geometry.", "paper_title": "Procedural architecture using deformation-aware split grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000341372200005"}
