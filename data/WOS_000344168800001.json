Detecting communities in these networks can provide information about the underlying structure and functioning of the original systems. Yet this detection is a complex task and a large amount of work was dedicated to it in the past decade. One important feature is that communities can be found at several scales, or levels of resolution, indicating several levels of organisation. Therefore a graph may have several community structures. Also networks tend to be large and hence require efficient processing. In this work, we present a new algorithm with linear complexity for the fast detection of communities across scales using a local criterion. We exploit the local aspect of the criterion to enable parallel computation and improve the execution speed further. The algorithm is tested against very large generated multi-scale networks and experiments demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Fast multi-scale detection of overlapping communities using local criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000344168800001"}
