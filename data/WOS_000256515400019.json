The sum of k-matching of G is nowadays commonly called the Hosoya index. Denote by An the set of h-polygonal chains with n congruent regular h-polygons (h greater than 4). In this paper, we determine the the extremal polygon chains on k-matchings in the set of molecular graphs An. Thus we extend the main results (for h = 6) of [91, [10], and [11] to a more general case.", "paper_title": "Extremal polygonal chains on k-matchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000256515400019"}
