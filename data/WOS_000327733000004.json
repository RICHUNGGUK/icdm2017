This is a very difficult problem, for which a branch-and-cut algorithm has already been proposed, providing good results when the number of vehicles is small. In this article, we present a branch-price-and-cut method capable of obtaining optimal solutions for this problem when the number of vehicles is larger for the same set of required edges. Extensive computational results on instances from the literature are presented. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
