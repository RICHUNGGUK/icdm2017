We are given a simple polygon P or a polygonal domain D with n vertices and a triplet of input parameters: (s, t, d), where s and t are two points in the plane and d is any direction. We show how to answer a query for the existence of a d-monotone path between s and t inside P (or D) in logarithmic time after preprocessing P in O(En) time, or D in O(En+ERlogR) time, where E is the size of the visibility graph of P (or D), and R is the number of reflex vertices in D. Our approach is based on the novel idea utilizing the dual graph of the trapezoidal map of P (or D). For polygonal domains, our approach uses a trapezoidal map associated with each visibility edge of D, and we show how to compute this large set of trapezoidal maps efficiently. Furthermore, we show how to output a minimum link d-monotone path between points s and t, for an arbitrary input triplet (s, t, d).
