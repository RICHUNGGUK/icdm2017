The proposed optical line terminal and optical network unit modules can be used to prevent and protect the occurrence of fiber failure in the ring-based passive optical networks (PONs). Using the proposed self-healing access network, the ring-based PON can be revived promptly under fiber failure. The protection and restoration time of the access network is measured within 7 ms. In addition, the performance of data traffic in the access network is also discussed.
