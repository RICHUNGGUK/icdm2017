In this paper, we formulate an information theoretic approach to determine whether cooperation among neurons may constitute a governing mechanism of information processing when encoding external covariates. Specifically, we show that conditional independence between neuronal outputs may not provide an optimal encoding strategy when the firing probability of a neuron depends on the history of firing of other neurons connected to it. Rather, cooperation among neurons can provide a \"message-passing\" mechanism that preserves most of the information in the covariates under specific constraints governing their connectivity structure. Using a biologically plausible statistical learning model, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in synergistically encoding a motor task using a subset of neurons drawn randomly from a large population. We demonstrate its superiority in approximating the joint density of the population from limited data compared to a statistically independent model and a pairwise maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model.", "paper_title": "Synergistic Coding by Cortical Neural Ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000275032900018"}
