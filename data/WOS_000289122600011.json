Since bandwidth updates require signaling, it is common to limit the rate of updates to reduce signaling costs. In this article, we propose a model-free asynchronous adaptive hysteresis algorithm for MPLS automatic bandwidth allocation under bandwidth update rate constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it against existing schemes in (i) voice and (ii) data traffic scenarios. The proposed method can also be used in more general GMPLS networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
