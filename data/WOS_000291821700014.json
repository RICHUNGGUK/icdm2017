The entanglement of the initial states as well as the final states is analyzed by adopting the logarithmic negativity as the measure of entanglement. The quantum teleportation task by exploiting the swapped states as the quantum channel is also considered, where a coherent state serves as the target state and the average fidelity is examined.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING OF PAIR CAT STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000291821700014"}
