Single-channel OOFDM and upstream multichannel OFDM-PONs are investigated for up to six users. A number of techniques for mitigating the PAPR and OBI effects are presented and evaluated including adaptive-loading algorithms such as bit/power-loading, clipping for PAPR reduction, and thermal detuning (TD) for the OBI suppression. It is shown that the bit-loading algorithm is a very efficient PAPR reduction technique by reducing it at about 1.2 dB over 100 Km of transmission. It is also revealed that the optimum method for suppressing the OBI is the TD + bit-loading. For a targeted BER of , the minimum allowed channel spacing is 11 GHz when employing six users.", "paper_title": "Reductions of peak-to-average power ratio and optical beat interference in cost-effective OFDMA-PONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100002"}
