In the last decade, substantial research efforts have been made on the surveillance and diagnosis systems for different types of equipment, with the approach of integrating information technologies and intelligent computing methods. This paper presents the conceptual design of a distributed information system of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for a growing number of gas turbine-based power generation systems. Each individual information system that monitors a specific gas turbine system, locally deployed in a power plant, is linked to another information system, deployed at the manufacturer's site, which oversees all the gas turbine systems in parallel. The systems are constructed on the basis of COM components, which are conceptually separated into three tiers. Subsequently, this paper proceeds to present a generic business domain model with components encapsulating physical entities of interest. Finally, this paper addresses the interactions among components, which considerably affect the performance of the system including efficiency and effectiveness. It has been identified that both asynchronous and synchronous communication mechanisms are required for exchanging information for different scenarios. COM+ services are also required for supporting object pooling, transaction coordination, and security control. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
