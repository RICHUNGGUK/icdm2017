The viscoelastic material is modeled in fractional derivative Kelvin sense. The equation of motion is derived and discretized by the Galerkin approximation resulting in a generalized Mathieu-Duffing equation with time delay. Bifurcations in parametric excitation can be eliminated by appropriate feedback gain and time delay. The bifurcating behavior for various fractional orders and material ratios are also investigated. New criteria of stability determination are established. Based on the Runge-Kutta method, numerical results are obtained and compared with analytical solutions for verification.
