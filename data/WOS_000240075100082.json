The Wilson's editing algorithm was the first proposal and then a great variety of new editing techniques have been proposed based on it. This algorithm consists on the elimination of prototypes in the training set that are misclassified using the k-NN rule. From such editing scheme, a general editing procedure can be straightforward derived, where any classifier beyond k-NN can be used. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of this general editing procedure combined with 3 different neighborhood-based classification rules, including k-NN. The results reveal better performances of the 2 other techniques with respect to k-NN in most of cases.", "paper_title": "On the use of different classification rules in an editing task", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100082"}
