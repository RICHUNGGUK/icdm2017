The function of the developed ontology is evaluated using a case study, in which a patent is classified using the defined scheme. The quantitative nature of the classification structure developed to support this procedure offers a mechanism that may be further developed and integrated into research aiming to support the computerisation of the knowledge elicitation and representation process. The ontology developed to enable the classification methodology will support the integration of design by analogy procedures and enable effective information retrieval via the TRIZ based approach.
