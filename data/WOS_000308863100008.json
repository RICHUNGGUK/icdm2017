However, this phenomenon is stigmatised by many negative connotations. This study investigated the influence of intangibility on perceived risks (social, time, financial, physical, performance and psychology) among online gamers. The self-completed market survey questionnaire employs the Intangibility and Perceived Risk scales. Data were gathered in Taipei city, the biggest metropolitan area in Taiwan. Both public (1018) and online (400) voluntary interviews were conducted. The collected data were analysed with a structural equation model. There is a significant positive relationship between intangibility and all dimensions of perceived risk. The findings have managerial implications and future research is suggested.", "paper_title": "Impact of intangibility on perceived risk associated with online games", "paper_id": "WOS:000308863100008"}
