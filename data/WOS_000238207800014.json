Using a Bayesian network approach to model the causal relations among people in social networks, we study the impact of prior probability, influence strength, and society openness to the inference accuracy on a real online social network. Our experimental results reveal that personal attributes can be inferred with high accuracy especially when people are connected with strong relationships. Further, even in a society where most people hide their attributes, it is still possible to infer privacy information.", "paper_title": "Inferring privacy information from social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800014"}
