However, operators normally have to control multiple complex devices simultaneously. For example, controlling a rock breaker and a remote camera at the same time in mining teleoperation. This overloads the operator's control capability of using hands, increases workload and reduces productivity. We present a novel gaze-driven remote camera control with an implemented prototype, which follows a simple and natural design principle: \"Whatever you look at on the screen, it moves to the centre!\". A user study of modeled hands-busy experiment has been conducted, comparing the performance of using gaze-driven control and traditional joystick control through both objective measures and subjective measures. The experimental results clearly show the gaze-driven control significantly outperformed the conventional joystick control. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
