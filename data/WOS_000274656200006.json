Availability, load and status of the resources may change at the time of execution of an application. Therefore, in order to maintain the performance guarantee (as has been agreed upon through service level agreements (SLAs) between the client and the resource providers), an application may need to adapt to its run-time environment on the basis of resource availability and application demands. Often it may be required to migrate the application components to a new set of resources during their execution so that performance guarantee can be maintained. Objective of this paper is to present an adaptive execution scheme for achieving guaranteed performance on the basis of the SLAs. The scheme has been implemented based on the notion of performance properties and by deploying a set of autonomous agents within an integrated performance-based resource management framework.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Execution Scheme for Achieving Guaranteed Performance in Computational Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000274656200006"}
