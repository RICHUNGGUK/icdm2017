The price that has to be paid is the increased complexity of hardware components and algorithms. The sphere detector (SD) algorithm solves the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) detection for MIMO channels by significantly reducing the search space of possible solutions. The main drawback of the SD algorithm is in its sequential nature, consequently, running it on massively parallel architectures (MPAs) is very inefficient. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the SD algorithm, a new parallel sphere detector (PSD) algorithm is proposed. It implements a novel hybrid tree search method, where the algorithm parallelism is assured by the efficient combination of depth-first search and breadth-first search algorithms. A path metric-based parallel sorting is employed at each intermediate stage. The PSD algorithm is able to adjust its memory requirements and extent of parallelism to fit a wide range of parallel architectures. Mapping details for MPAs are proposed by giving the details of thread dependent, highly parallel building blocks of the algorithm. Based on the building blocks proposed, a mapping to general-purpose graphics processing unit is provided, and its performance is evaluated. In order to achieve high-throughput, several levels of parallelism are introduced, and different scheduling strategies are considered.
