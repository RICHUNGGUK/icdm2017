By supporting quantitative characterization of the semantic gaps, more effective inference models can automatically be selected for concept classifier training by: 1) identifying the image concepts with small semantic gaps (i.e., the isolated image concepts with high inner-concept visual consistency) and training their one-against-all SVM concept classifiers independently; 2) determining the image concepts with large semantic gaps (i.e., the visually-related image concepts with low inner-concept visual consistency) and training their inter-related SVM concept classifiers jointly; and 3) using more image instances to achieve more reliable training of the concept classifiers for the image concepts with large semantic gaps. Our experimental results on NUS-WIDE [18] and ImageNet [11] image sets have obtained very promising results.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Characterization of Semantic Gaps for Learning Complexity Estimation and Inference Model Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000308990600004"}
