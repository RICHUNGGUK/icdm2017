The algorithm expands gradually, one node at a time, the offspring of a game. After each step of expansion, the lower and upper bounds of the mean and temperature of the game are re-calculated. As the expanding process continues, the range between the lower and upper bounds is little by little narrowed. The key feature of the algorithm is its ability to generate a path of which the outcome is most likely to reduce the distance between the lower and upper bounds.", "paper_title": "SELECTION SEARCH FOR MEAN AND TEMPERATURE OF MULTI-BRANCH COMBINATORIAL GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000209088700002"}
