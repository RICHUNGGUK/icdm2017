While most previous results have focused on the worst-case complexity, we instead employ the technique of adaptive analysis to give an improvement in many \"easy\" cases. We present two adaptive measures and methods for polynomial multiplication, and also show how to effectively combine them to gain both advantages. One useful feature of these algorithms is that they essentially provide a gradient between existing \"sparse\" and \"dense\" methods. We prove that these approaches provide significant improvements in many cases but in the worst case are still comparable to the fastest existing algorithms.
