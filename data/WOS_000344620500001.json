All avoidable patterns are shown to be D0L-avoidable. For avoidable patterns, the growth rates of the avoiding languages are studied. All such languages, except for the overlap-free language, are proved to have exponential growth. The exact growth rates of languages avoiding minimal avoidable patterns are approximated through computer-assisted upper bounds. Finally, a new example of a pattern-avoiding language of polynomial growth is given.", "paper_title": "BINARY PATTERNS IN BINARY CUBE-FREE WORDS: AVOIDABILITY AND GROWTH", "paper_id": "WOS:000344620500001"}
