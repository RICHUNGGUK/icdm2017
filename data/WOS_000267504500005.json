It introduces new activities and extends existing activities, including partner links, invoke, receive, import, and onmessage activities. It proposes version-related extensions to variables and introduces version handlers. The proposed extensions represent a complete solution for process-level and scope-level versioning at development, deployment, and run-time. It also provides means to version applications that consist of several BPEL processes, and to put temporal constraints on versions. The proposed approach has been tested in real-world environment. It solves major challenges in BPEL versioning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "WS-BPEL Extensions for Versioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000267504500005"}
