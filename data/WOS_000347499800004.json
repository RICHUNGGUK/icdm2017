By using a new Lyapunov function method, the neural network that has a unique almost periodic solution, which is globally exponentially stable is proved. Moreover, the obtained conclusion on the almost periodic solution is applied to prove the existence and stability of periodic solution (or equilibrium point) for delayed memristor-based neural networks with periodic coefficients (or constant coefficients). The obtained results are helpful to design the global exponential stability of almost periodic oscillatory memristor-based neural networks. Three numerical examples and simulations are also given to show the feasibility of our results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
