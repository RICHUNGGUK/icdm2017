The Schrodinger equation is defined on m(n) grids, in which m is the number of grid points discretized on a characteristic phase space of each junction and n is the number of coupled junctions. In this paper, the calculated maximum system is that m = 256 and n = 4, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom reaches 256(4) (=4,294,967,296). We examine possible effective numerical schemes and make a parallel tuning to optimize the communication on the Earth Simulator. We sustain floating-point operation performance exceeding 20% of the peak on 512 nodes (4,096 PEs). From systematic calculations, we find a new concept that \"quantum-assisted synchronization\" occurs with downsizing the junction plane. This is a discovery adding a quantum flavor to the classical concept \"synchronization\".", "paper_title": "HIGH-PERFORMANCE QUANTUM SIMULATION FOR COUPLED JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS ON THE EARTH SIMULATOR: A CHALLENGE TO THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION ON 256(4) GRIDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280611300005"}
