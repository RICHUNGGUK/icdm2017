The traditional method for representing the global state of a system as a cross product of the states of individual nodes in the system results in a state space whose size is exponential in the number of nodes. We propose an alternative way of representing the global state of a system: namely, as a probability mass function (pmf) which represents the fraction of nodes in different states. A pmf corresponds to a point in a Euclidean space of possible pmf values, and the evolution of the state of a system is represented by trajectories in this Euclidean space. We propose a novel performance evaluation method that examines all pmf trajectories in a dense Euclidean space by exploring only finite relevant portions of the space. We call our method Euclidean model checking. Euclidean model checking is useful both in the design phase-where it can help determine system parameters based on a specification-and in the evaluation phase-where it can help verify performance properties of a system. We illustrate the utility of Euclidean model checking by using it to design a time difference of arrival (TDoA) distance measurement protocol and to evaluate the protocol's implementation on a 90-node WSN. To facilitate such performance evaluations, we provide a Markov model estimation method based on applying a standard statistical estimation technique to samples resulting from the execution of a system.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Sensor Networks by Statistical Modeling and Euclidean Model Checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000322740200003"}
