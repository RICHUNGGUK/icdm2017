The upper bounds on the block and bit error probabilities are valid for any memoryless, binary-input and output-symmetric communication channel, and their effectiveness is exemplified for various ensembles of turbo-like codes over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. An expurgation of the distance spectrum of binary linear block codes further tightens the resulting upper bounds.", "paper_title": "Tightened upper bounds on the ML decoding error probability of binary linear block codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000017"}
