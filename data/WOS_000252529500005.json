However, large-scale fading and non-stationary small-scale fading can cause severe QoS violations. To address this issue, we design QoS provisioning schemes, which are robust against time-varying large scale path loss, shadowing, non-stationary small scale fading, and very low mobility. In our design, we utilize our recently developed effective capacity technique and the time-diversity dependent power control proposed in this paper. The key elements of our QoS provisioning schemes are channel estimation, power control, dynamic channel allocation, and adaptive transmission. The advantages of our QoS provisioning schemes are (1) power efficiency, (2) simplicity in QoS provisioning, (3) robustness against large-scale fading and non-stationary small-scale fading. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective in providing QoS guarantees under various channel conditions.
