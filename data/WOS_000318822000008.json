To ensure the security of SARG04 protocol in plug-and-play QKD system with an unknown and untrusted source, the bounds of a few statistical parameters of the source need to be monitored. An active or a passive source monitor schemes are proposed to verify these parameters. Furthermore, the practical issues due to statistical fluctuation and detection noise in the source monitoring process are quantitatively analyzed. Our simulation results show that the passive scheme can be efficiently applied to plug-and-play system with SARG04 protocol.", "paper_title": "THE SECYRITY OF SARG04 PROTOCOL IN PLUG AND PLAY QKD SYSTEM WITH AN UNTRUSTED SOURCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000318822000008"}
