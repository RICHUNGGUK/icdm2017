Misclassification of each binary classifier is formulated as a bit inversion error with probabilistic models by making an analogy to the context of information transmission theory. Dependence between binary classifiers is incorporated into our model, which makes a decoder a type of Boltzmann machine. We performed experimental studies using a synthetic data set, data sets from the UCI repository, and bioinformatics data sets, and the results show that the proposed methods are superior to the existing multiclass classification methods.", "paper_title": "A Multiclass Classification Method Based on Decoding of Binary Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000266959100009"}
