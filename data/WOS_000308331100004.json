The solver implements Newton's method in function space, where instead of the usual Jacobian matrices, the derivatives involved are Frechet derivatives. A major novelty of this approach is the application of automatic differentiation (AD) techniques to compute the operator-valued Frechet derivatives in the continuous context. Other novelties include the use of anonymous functions and numbering of each variable to enable a recursive, delayed evaluation of derivatives with forward mode AD. The AD techniques are applied within a new Chebfun class called chebop which allows users to set up and solve nonlinear BVPs, both scalar and systems of coupled equations, in a few lines of code, using the \"nonlinear backslash\" operator (\\). This framework enables one to study the behaviour of Newton's method in function space.", "paper_title": "Automatic Frechet Differentiation for the Numerical Solution of Boundary-Value Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308331100004"}
