The uncertain design problem is often formulated as a double-loop optimization. Interval arithmetic is introduced to directly evaluate the bounds of interval functions and eliminate the inner loop optimization. A high-order Taylor inclusion function is proposed to compress the overestimation of interval arithmetic. A Chebyshev surrogate model is proposed to approximate the high-order coefficients of the inclusion function. A metaheuristic optimization algorithm is combined with the mathematical programming to search the global optimum. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
