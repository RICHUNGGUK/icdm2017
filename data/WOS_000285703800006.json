With such an implicit representation of the class labels WCCCA is applicable both to regular LDA problems and to problems in which only spatial and/or temporal continuity provides clues to the class labels (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Canonical correlation analysis using within-class coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000285703800006"}
