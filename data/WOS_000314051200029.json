The introduction of a trifluoromethyl group into the ketone structure reduces the activation energy of the tetrahedral intermediates formation due to an increase of the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group and raises the activation and the reaction energies of the C-O bond cleavage in formed carbinol due to the destabilization of the corresponding carbocation. The introduction of the second trifluoromethyl group inhibits the hydroxyalkylation reaction due to a very strong increase of the reaction and activation energies of the C-O bond cleavage which becomes the rate determining step. The most important catalytic effect of TFSA compared to MSA is not the protonation of the ketone carbonyl, but the reduction of the activation and reaction energies of the carbinol C-O bond cleavage due to better protosolvation properties. Even for TFSA no complete proton transfer to carbonyl oxygen has been observed for free ketones. Therefore, the protonation energies of free ketones cannot be considered as a measure of ketone reactivity in the hydroxyalkylation reaction.", "paper_title": "Reactions of ketones with aromatics in acid media.
