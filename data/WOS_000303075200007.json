This paper addresses such a problem by evaluating the feasibility of reactive routing for mobile cognitive radio ad hoc networks. More specifically, we design a reactive routing protocol for the considered scenario able to achieve three goals: (i) to avoid interferences to primary users during both route formation and data forwarding; (ii) to perform a joint path and channel selection at each forwarder; (iii) to take advantage of the availability of multiple channels to improve the overall performance. Two different versions of the same protocol, referred to as Cognitive Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (CAODV), are presented. The first version exploits inter-route spectrum diversity, while the second one exploits intra-route spectrum diversity. An exhaustive performance analysis of both the versions of the proposed protocol in different environments and network conditions has been carried out via numerical simulations. The results state the suitability of the proposed protocol for small mobile cognitive radio ad hoc networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
