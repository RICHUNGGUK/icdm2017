Usually, clustering algorithms construct either clusters of rows or clusters of columns of the input data matrix. Biclustering is a methodology where biclusters are formed by both a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that objects represented by the first are the most similar to each other when compared over the latter. In this paper, we introduce a new biclustering technique, based on association rule mining, which can support different well-known biclustering models proposed in the literature. Experimental tests demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed technique with respect to well known related ones.", "paper_title": "A NEW BICLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON ASSOCIATION RULE MINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617300008"}
