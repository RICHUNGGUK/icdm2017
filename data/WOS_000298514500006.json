We mainly focus on an easy-to-develop and easy-to-use WPAN platform for wireless communication services using both networks. The proposed WPAN platform consists of a WPAN handset platform, a WPAN connection scheme, and a WPAN server platform. The WPAN handset platform provides abstract WPAN API (Application Programming Interface) set and application management module. Using the WPAN connection scheme, the user can enjoy converged network services in a convenient way. The WPAN server platform manages the overall services and digital devices that are connected to the handset. Compared to the existing WPAN related platform, we consider the need for the integrated service components allowing for the development of WPAN applications in the handset and their convenience for the user. Also, illustrative services and devices are implemented using the proposed method, which show the applicability of the proposed WPAN platform.", "paper_title": "A WPAN Platform Design in Mobile Phone Considering Application Development and Usability", "paper_id": "WOS:000298514500006"}
