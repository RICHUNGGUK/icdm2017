We show that a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs in some limits. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A 81, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show that the position measurements per each step with probability p similar to 1/n(beta) can be evaluated, where n is the final time and 0 < beta < 1. We also give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers from the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum walk) can be seen as the parameter beta shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete- and continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we introduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the final time n. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW is obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence theorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties. Finally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently long-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random walks.", "paper_title": "CROSSOVERS INDUCED BY DISCRETE-TIME QUANTUM WALKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652200002"}
