Therefore, modeling and control theories based on continuous control devices are not applicable. On the other hand, conventional on-off control algorithms require frequent switch actions of equipments, which leads to equipment spoilage and energy waste. To address these issues, this paper proposes to control greenhouse climate using a hybrid system approach. Considering the interactive dynamics between the actions of ventilation window and the output of the control system (temperature) according to the value of inside temperature and operational constrains, the ventilation window temperature system in a greenhouse can be regarded as a hybrid dynamical systems. In addition to building models of greenhouse temperature, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm of greenhouse air temperature is proposed for the mixed logical dynamical system. Experiment results in a greenhouse prove the effectiveness of our modeling and control algorithms.", "paper_title": "PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE TEMPERATURE BASED ON MIXED LOGICAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468800036"}
