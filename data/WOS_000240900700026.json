Recently, a three-dimensional structure of the Aquifex aeolicus sigma(28)/FlgM complex (PDB code: 1rp3) was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.3 angstrom resolution. Furthermore, experimental data on bacterial FlgM, including site-directed mutagenesis and structural characterization by NMR are also available. However, an interpretation of the sequence-structure-function relationships combining X-ray and NMR data with the evolutionary information extracted from the increasing number of FlgM-related sequences annotated in databases is not available. In the present study, we combined database sequence searches and sequence-analysis tools to update the multiple sequence alignment of a previously characterized cluster of orthologs (COG2747) and the PFAM classification of protein domains (PF04316) for the FlgM family. A phylogenetic analysis of 77 protein sequences revealed the presence of at least three major sequence clades within the FlgM family. Besides, we predicted functional residues using a SequenceSpace method. We also generated homology models for Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium FlgM proteins, for which sequence-structure-function relationship data are available, and used the docking program ClusPro to hypothesize about the dimer association between FlgM proteins. In conclusion, the analysis presented in this work will be useful in designing new experiments to understand better protein-protein interactions between FglM, sigma factors, and putative molecules from the flagellar export apparatus.
