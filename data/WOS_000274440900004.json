To mitigate such attacks, we propose a p-hop crosscheck mechanism, which requires nodes p, p >= 2, hops apart to authenticate and verify route reply packets using pairwise shared keys. This mechanism can detect route falsification by non-colluding malicious nodes on-the-fly; furthermore, it can identify a group of at most p + 1 nodes that contain the malicious nodes that caused the route falsification. Unlike intrusion detection techniques, which require extensive monitoring and sampling, the proposed crosscheck mechanism is light-weight and fast and hence can be used to augment the existing secure routing protocols and improve intrusion detection capability. We implement a two-hop crosscheck for an on demand ad hoc network routing protocol. Using simulations, we show that the two-hop crosscheck mitigates attacks by multiple malicious nodes with negligible impact on performance.
