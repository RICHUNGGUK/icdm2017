In this manuscript, we present a novel GPU-accelerated algorithm for all-vs-all Tanimoto matrix calculation 1 and nearest neighbor search. By taking advantage of multicore GPU architecture and CUDA parallel programming technology, the algorithm is up to 39 times superior to the existing commercial software that runs on CPUs. Because of the utilization of intrinsic CPU instructions, this approach is nearly 10 times faster than existing GPU-accelerated sparse vector algorithm, when Unity fingerprints are used for Tanimoto calculation. The GPU program that implements this new method takes about 20 min to complete the calculation of Tanimoto coefficients between 32 M PubChem compounds and 10K Active Probes compounds, i.e., 324G Tanimoto coefficients, on a 128-CUDA-core GPU.", "paper_title": "GPU Accelerated Chemical Similarity Calculation for Compound Library Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400002"}
