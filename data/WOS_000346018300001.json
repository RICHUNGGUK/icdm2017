To better utilize the scare radio spectrum, cognitive radios have recently attracted increasing attention, which makes spectrum sharing more viable. Sharing radio spectrum from primary users to secondary users is of great importance. A licensed primary user (PU) can lease its spectrum to secondary users (SUs) for wireless communications. This paper studies the problem of social welfare maximization of distributed spectrum sharing among a PU and SUs. We first formulate the problem of social welfare maximization which takes into account both the cost of the PU and the utility gained by each SU. The social welfare maximization is a convex optimization problem and thus can be solved by a centralized algorithm. However, the utility function of each SU may contain the private information. To avoid privacy leakage of SUs, we propose an iterative distributed algorithm based on a pricing-based decomposition framework. It is theoretically proved that our algorithm converges to the optimal solution. Simulation results are presented to show that our algorithm achieves the optimal social welfare and converges quickly in a practical setting.", "paper_title": "Distributed Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Pricing-Based Decomposition Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000346018300001"}
