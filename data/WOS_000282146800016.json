In order to achieve these purposes, we first transform the secret pixels into the m-ary notational system and then calculate the information data used to reconstruct original pixels from camouflaged pixels such that the information data and transformed secret data are shared using the (t,n)-threshold sharing scheme. In this way, we can retrieve the lossless secret image and reverse the stego image to the original image. Based on our experiments, the shadows can be successfully camouflaged in the cover image, and the stego images have satisfactory quality. Moreover, our scheme allows for a large capacity of embedded secret data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
