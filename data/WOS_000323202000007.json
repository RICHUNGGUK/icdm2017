When the WDFT is considered in digital computation of theWFRFT, the Fourier transform in the definition of theWFRFT should be defined in frequency (Hz) but not angular frequency (rad/s). The sampling period Delta t and sampling duration T should satisfy Delta t - T/N - 1/root N when N-point DFT is utilized. Since Hermite-Gaussian functions are the best known eigenfunctions of the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), digital computation based on eigendecomposition is also carried out as the additional verification and validation for the WFRFT calculation.", "paper_title": "Digital computation of the weighted-type fractional Fourier transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000323202000007"}
