Detailed behavior modeling with constraints specification and formal verification, required for reliability prediction, is a great challenge for hybrid system designers. Train control systems further intensify this challenge with extensive interaction between computing units and their physical environment and their mutual dependence on each other. In this paper, we investigate behavior modeling and formal verification of Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3) using Architectural Analysis & Design Language (AADL) to cope with this challenge. AADL is an architecture description language for embedded systems and is based on model-based engineering paradigm. Along with structural modeling of embedded systems using the core language constructs, AADL also provides support for language extension through annex sublanguages. In system requirements specification document, the behavior of the CTCS-3 is specified as a set of basic operation scenarios that cooperate with each other to achieve safe and secure functionality of trains. Movement Authority (MA) scenario, explored in this paper, is considered as a basic and most crucial scenario to prevent trains from colliding with each other. The detailed discrete behavior of control system is modeled and verified using the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS) annex sublanguage of AADL, and the continuous behavior of train with the cyber-physical interaction (communication between train and control system) is modeled using the Hybrid annex sublanguage. The behavior of the MA scenario at system level is verified using the Hybrid Hoare Logic theorem prover. Behavior constraints are specified as assertions using first-order logic formulas augmented with a simple temporal operator.", "paper_title": "Behavior modeling and verification of movement authority scenario of Chinese Train Control System using AADL", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500013"}
