It is shown that along both the solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation as well as the solution of the semi-discretized equation the actions of the linear Schrodinger equation are approximately conserved over long times. This also allows us to show approximate conservation of energy and momentum along the solution of the semi-discretized equation over long times. These results are obtained by analyzing a modulated Fourier expansion in time. They are valid in arbitrary spatial dimension.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations and Their Spectral Semi-Discretizations Over Long Times", "paper_id": "WOS:000274852100002"}
