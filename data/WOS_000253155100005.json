By specifying a particular set of service parameters, the media access control (MAC) mechanisms defined in the standard are able to offer predefined QoS provisioning on a per-connection basis. However, the design of efficient, flexible, and yet robust MAC scheduling algorithms for such QoS provisioning still remains an open topic. This paper proposes a new QoS control scheme for single-carrier point-to-multipoint mode wireless metropolitan area network (WirelessMAN) systems, which enables the predefined service parameters to control the service provided to each uplink and downlink connection. By MAC-PHY cross-layer resource allocation, the proposed scheme is robust against particular wireless link degradation. Detailed simulation experiments are presented to study the performance and to validate the effectiveness of the proposed QoS control scheme.", "paper_title": "Robust QoS control for single carrier PMP mode IEEE 802.16 systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253155100005"}
