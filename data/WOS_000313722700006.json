The constant-Q active inductor provides a large and swing-independent quality factor such that the phase noise of the CCO utilizing the constant-Q active inductor is comparable to that of CCO with spiral inductors. The current-mode active-transformer loop filter offers the advantage of a large and tunable inductance and low silicon consumption such that the loop bandwidth of the PLL can be made small and tunable. The PLL was designed in TSMC-0.18 mu m 6-metal 1.8V CMOS technology and analyzed using SpectreRF from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM3v3 device models. The phase noise of the PLL was analyzed using Cadence's Verilog-AMS behavioral modeling. The phase noise of the CCO with the constant-Q active inductor is -123.1 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset, over 10 dB better as compared with that of the CCO with conventional active inductors, and is only a few dB higher than that of the CCO with spiral inductors. The phase noise of the PLL with an active-transformer loop filter and a constant-Q CCO is -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset, nearly 20 dB lower than that of the PLL with the same active-transformer loop filter and a conventional active-inductor CCO. The lock time, power consumption, and phase noise of the PLL are 60 ns, 34 mW, and -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset, respectively. The total silicon consumption of the PLL excluding bond pads is 0.013 mm(2).", "paper_title": "Current-mode phase-locked loop with constant-Q active inductor CCO and active transformer loop filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700006"}
