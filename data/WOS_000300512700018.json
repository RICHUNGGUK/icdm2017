Exhaustive-search-based algorithms are too computationally intensive. This paper introduces the Kuhn-Munkres (or Hungarian) algorithm for the general assignment problems (GAPs) and proposes a new efficient algorithm to solve the M-M role transfer problems by converting them to the GAPs. The experiments and results validate the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Efficient Role Transfer Based on Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000300512700018"}
