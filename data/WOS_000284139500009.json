Our method aims to provide physicians with the clues generally overlooked by conventional dialogue analysis to form a cycle of dialogue practice and analysis. We introduce a motif and a pattern cluster in the designs of the hierarchical indices of interaction and exploit the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) metric to reduce the number of usable indices. We applied the proposed interpretation method of interaction patterns to develop a corpus of interviews. The results of a summary reading experiment confirmed the validity of the developed indices. Finally, we discussed the integrated analysis of the topic structure and a nonverbal summary.", "paper_title": "A multi-modal dialogue analysis method for medical interviews based on design of interaction corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000284139500009"}
