In contrast with several existing methods [5,13,15], the main difference of our method is that the functional used for measuring the data fitting is a certain quantity defined over the whole domain under consideration, so that the finite element approximation is quite convenient to implement in practical applications. The theoretical analysis is developed for the new method, whose computational performance is shown by several numerical tests.", "paper_title": "Solving an inverse problem from bioluminescence tomography by minimizing an energy-like functional", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529600016"}
