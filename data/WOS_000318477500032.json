It provides an analysis of the bias of this estimator with respect to the wavelet order. This brief also discusses the performance of this wavelet-based estimator, in comparison with the conventional 2-D Fourier-based spectrum estimator on texture analysis and content-based image retrieval. It highlights the effectiveness of the wavelet-based spectrum estimation.", "paper_title": "2-D Wavelet Packet Spectrum for Texture Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000318477500032"}
