However, existing analytical models of packet loss cannot provide quantitative information of lossy channel systems. In this paper, an analysis on balance state of end-to-end communication channel over probabilistic lossy communication networks (PLCN) is performed firstly. We then discuss the process of modeling end-to-end communication channel over PLCN using Quasi Birth-Death models (QBDs) in detail. Finally, some characteristics of end-to-end communication channel, such as the stability of channel and the performance of channel packet loss, are analyzed. The experimental results show that the proposed model can analyze quantitatively the stability of end-to-end communication channel and the packet loss probability during time interval [0, t]. The results in the work are helpful for designing adaptive end-to-end communication protocols. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
