However, to date, the video codecs based on DSC have been unable to compress as efficiently as traditional predictive video codecs, such as H.264. So, new techniques have to be investigated to improve the performance of the distributed video coding scheme for practical applications. In this paper, I propose a novel distributed video coding scheme based on part intracoding and soft side information estimation. Firstly, at the encoder side, to improve the compression performance of distributed video coding system, we divide the video data into strongly correlative data encoded by Slepian-Wolf codec and weakly correlative data encoded by Intracoding codec. Secondly, at the decoder side, to improve the accuracy of side information estimation, a soft side information estimation method is proposed, which is more suitable for video coding due to the non-stationary feature of video data. Our experimental results show that the performance of our coding system is better than that of the traditional distributed video coding system while keeping the simple encoding property. Also the concept of soft side information is a new idea in distributed video coding and will significantly influence the side information estimation method.", "paper_title": "Distributed video coding based on part intracoding and soft side information estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000261958500001"}
