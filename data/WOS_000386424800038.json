For example, an exploration query could be an aggregate of some measures over time intervals, and a pattern or abnormality can be discovered through a time series plot of the query results. In this paper, we examine a special kind of exploration query, namely object-centric exploration query. Common examples include claims made about athletes in sports databases, such as \"it is newsworthy that LeBron James has scored 35 or more points in nine consecutive games.\" We focus on one common type of visualization, i.e., 2d scatter plot with heatmap. Namely, we consider exploration queries whose results can be plotted on a two-dimensional space, possibly with colors indicating object densities in regions. While we model results as pairs of numbers, the types of the queries are limited only by the users' imagination. In the LeBron James example above, the two dimensions are minimum points scored per game and number of consecutive games, respectively. It is easy to find other equally interesting dimensions, such as minimum rebounds per game or number of playoff games. We formalize this problem and propose an efficient, interactive-speed algorithm that takes a user-provided exploration query (which can be a blackbox function) and produces an approximate visualization that preserves the two most important visual properties: the outliers and the overall distribution of all result points.", "paper_title": "Efficient Evaluation of Object-Centric Exploration Queries for Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800038"}
