Considering the large-scale sensor networks and peculiarity of the deployed environments, aerial data collection based on controllable UAV has more advantages. In this paper, we have designed a basic framework for aerial data collection, which includes the following five components: deployment of networks, nodes positioning, anchor points searching, fast path planning for UAV, and data collection from network. We have identified the key challenges in each of them and have proposed efficient solutions. This includes proposal of a Fast Path Planning with Rules (FPPWR) algorithm based on grid division, to increase the efficiency of path planning, while guaranteeing the length of the path to be relatively short. We have designed and implemented a simulation platform for aerial data collection from sensor networks and have validated performance efficiency of the proposed framework based on the following parameters: time consumption of the aerial data collection, flight path distance, and volume of collected data.", "paper_title": "Efficient Aerial Data Collection with UAV in Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365917100001"}
