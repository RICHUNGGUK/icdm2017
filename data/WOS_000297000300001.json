Under the framework of Filippov solutions, the existence and dissipativity of solutions can be guaranteed by the matrix measure approach and the new obtained generalized Halanay inequalities. Then, for the discontinuous master-response systems with parameter mismatches, quasi-synchronization criteria are obtained by using feedback control. Furthermore, when the proper approximate functions are selected, the complete synchronization can be discussed as a special case that two systems are identical. Numerical simulations on the chaotic systems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
