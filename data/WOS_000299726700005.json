However, products that fall within the specification limits may not be good if their mean is far away from the target. So, developing an acceptance sampling plan with process loss consideration is essential. In this paper, a variable repetitive group sampling plan is proposed to deal with process loss. The design parameters of the proposed plan are tabulated for various combinations of acceptance quality levels. The proposed methodology can be used to determine whether the products meet the desired levels of protection for both producers and consumers.", "paper_title": "Variable repetitive group sampling plans with process loss consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000299726700005"}
