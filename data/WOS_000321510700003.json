This paper proposes a new approach to the development of such combined models (co-models), in which an initial discrete-event model may include approximations of continuous-time behaviour that can subsequently be replaced by couplings to continuous-time models. An operational semantics of co-simulation allows the discrete and continuous models to run on their respective simulators and managed by a coordinating co-simulation engine. This permits the exploration of the composite co-model's behaviour in a range of operational scenarios. The approach has been realised using the Vienna Development Method (VDM) as the discrete-event formalism, and 20-sim as the continuous-time framework, and has been applied successfully to a case study based on the distributed controller for a personal transporter device.", "paper_title": "A formal approach to collaborative modelling and co-simulation for embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321510700003"}
