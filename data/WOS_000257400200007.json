By studying whether the backlink counts and WIFs of websites associate with the comprehensive ratings for these websites, the article demonstrates that the backlink counts can be a better evaluation measure for government websites than WIFs. At length, this article also discusses the correlation between backlink counts and economic capacity, and illustrates that backlink counts can also be an indicator for economic status.", "paper_title": "Hyperlink analysis for government websites of Chinese provincial capitals", "paper_id": "WOS:000257400200007"}
