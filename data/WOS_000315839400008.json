We have been able to identify eight novel inhibitors of SSH1 through the computer-aided drug design protocol involving homology modeling of SSH1 structure, virtual screening of a large chemical library with docking simulations, and in vitro enzyme assays. The identified inhibitors revealed high potencies with the associated IC50 values ranging from 2.8 to 12.7 mu M and were also screened for having desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate. Therefore, they deserve consideration for further development by structure-activity relationship studies to optimize the inhibitory activities. Structural features relevant to the stabilization of the inhibitors in the active site of SSH1 are discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
