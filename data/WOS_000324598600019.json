To support large-scale collaboration, cognitive synergy is exploited to collect the status of multiple radios and layers, namely the network state information (NSI). Based on cognition results, resource virtualization and harmonious collaboration control are applied to optimize the global performance. We present the architecture, design challenges, and key technologies of CHORUS through our initial research efforts. We illustrate how to use cognition to interact with collaboration among multiple base stations (BSs), between BSs and relays, and among heterogeneous networks so as to save the network energy consumption. We also provide examples of cognition design across communication and broadcast networks based on traffic load and service contents information.", "paper_title": "CHORUS: A FRAMEWORK FOR SCALABLE COLLABORATION IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS WITH COGNITIVE SYNERGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000324598600019"}
