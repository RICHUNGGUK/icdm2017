The construction employs interpolatory filters with rational transfer functions. These filters have linear phase. They are amenable either to fast cascading or parallel recursive implementation. Robust error recovery algorithms are developed by utilizing the redundancy inherent in frame expansions. Experimental results recover images when ( as much as) 60% of the expansion coefficients are either lost or corrupted. The proposed approach inflates the size of the image through framelet expansion and multilevel decomposition thus providing redundant representation of the image. Finally, the frame-based error recovery algorithm is compared with a classical coding approach.", "paper_title": "Symmetric interpolatory framelets and their erasure recovery properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284800002"}
