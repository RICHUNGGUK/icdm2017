PaaS evaluation procedure requirements and taxonomy have been specified in this context. The innovative concept exploited by the proposed methodology is its completeness, evidenced by stress, dynamicity, and stability testing scenarios. A theoretical analysis of PaaS under test load conditions has been provided for the each proposed testing scenario. This allows interpretation of the experimental study performed using private and public cloud environments. Results validate the proposed methodology and establish it as a useful tool for benchmarking PaaS deployments.", "paper_title": "PaaS Performance Evaluation Methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000362228100001"}
