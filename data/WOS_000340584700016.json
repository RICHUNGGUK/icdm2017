This system can display hyperchaos, chaos, quasiperiodic and periodic behaviors, and may have a unique equilibrium, three equilibria and five equilibria for the different system parameters. An optimal control law is designed for the novel bounded chaotic system, based on the Pontryagin minimum principle. Furthermore, we propose Lyapunov stability conditions to control the new bounded 4D chaotic system with unknown parameters by a feedback control approach. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed chaos control scheme.", "paper_title": "Chaos control of a bounded 4D chaotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700016"}
