It generalizes the process and analyzes current examples in four areas of the technology. Content-based information retrieval has been shown to be an effective way to search for the type of multimedia documents that are increasingly stored in digital libraries. As a good complement to traditional text-based information retrieval technology, content-based information retrieval will be a significant trend for the development of digital libraries.", "paper_title": "Content-based information retrieval and digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000255466200006"}
