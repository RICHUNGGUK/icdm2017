Instead of employing adders for the core operation when updating check node messages, in the proposed scheme, the main term and correction factor of the core operation are successfully merged into a compact 2D LUT. Simulation results indicate that the proposed 2D LUT not only attains close-to-optimal bit error rate performance but also enjoys a low complexity advantage that is suitable for hardware implementation.", "paper_title": "A Low-Complexity and High-Performance 2D Look-Up Table for LDPC Hardware Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700041"}
