In terms of energy consumption, on-demand time synchronization is better than continuous synchronization. However, currently existing on-demand time synchronization protocols have a very low accuracy and very strong spatial accumulative effect. These features are not suitable for several types of WSN applications, such as applications with stringent temporal requirements, or applications that have a large spatial region of interest. In this paper, we propose an on-demand time synchronization protocol, named AOTSP (Accurate On-demand Time Synchronization Protocol), which differs from other protocols of the same category by having the following advantages, as shown in our theoretical analysis and simulation results: (1) weak spatial accumulative effect; (2) fairly low communication cost; (3) low computational complexity; (4) high accuracy; (5) high scalability. Such features make AOTSP a suitable time synchronization protocol for a broad range of WSN applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
