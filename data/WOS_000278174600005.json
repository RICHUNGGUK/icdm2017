The method produces an approximation cubic B-spline curve tangent to a given curve at a set of selected positions, called tangent points, in a piecewise manner starting from a seed segment. A heuristic method is provided to select the tangent points. The first segment of the approximation cubic B-spline curve can be obtained using an inner point interpolation method, least-squares method or geometric Hermite method as a seed segment. The approximation curve is further extended to other tangent points one by one by curve unclamping. New tangent points can also be added, if necessary, by using the concept of the minimum shape deformation angle of an inner point for better approximation. Numerical examples show that the new method is effective in approximating a given curve and is efficient in computation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
