In this paper, we address the problem of PAPR reduction for FBMC-OQAM systems using Tone Reservation (TR) technique. Due to the overlapping structure of FBMC-OQAM signals, directly applying TR schemes of OFDM systems to FBMC-OQAM systems is not effective. We improve the tone reservation (TR) technique by employing sliding window for the PAPR reduction of FBMC-OQAM signals, called sliding window tone reservation (SW-TR) technique. The proposed SW-TR technique uses the peak reduction tones (PRTs) of several consecutive data blocks to cancel the peaks of the FBMC-OQAM signal inside a window. Furthermore, we propose a method to overlap the sliding windows to control the out-of-window peak regrowth caused by the peak-canceling signal.", "paper_title": "Sliding Window Tone Reservation Technique for the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction of FBMC-OQAM Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200002"}
