Implementation of health-information technology has allowed retrospective analysis of data for cohort identification and recruitment, but few institutions have also leveraged real-time streams to support such activities. Design Duke Medicine has deployed a hybrid solution, The Duke Integrated Subject Cohort and Enrollment Research Network (DISCERN), that combines both retrospective warehouse data and clinical events contained in prospective Health Level 7 (HL7) messages to immediately alert study personnel of potential recruits as they become eligible. Results DISCERN analyzes more than 500 000 messages daily in service of 12 projects. Users may receive results via email, text pages, or on-demand reports. Preliminary results suggest DISCERN's unique ability to reason over both retrospective and real-time data increases study enrollment rates while reducing the time required to complete recruitment-related tasks. The authors have introduced a preconfigured DISCERN function as a self-service feature for users. Limitations The DISCERN framework is adoptable primarily by organizations using both HL7 message streams and a data warehouse. More efficient recruitment may exacerbate competition for research subjects, and investigators uncomfortable with new technology may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment. Conclusion DISCERN's hybrid framework for identifying real-time clinical events housed in HL7 messages complements the traditional approach of using retrospective warehoused data. DISCERN is helpful in instances when the required clinical data may not be loaded into the warehouse and thus must be captured contemporaneously during patient care. Use of an open-source tool supports generalizability to other institutions at minimal cost.", "paper_title": "The design and implementation of an open-source, data-driven cohort recruitment system: the Duke Integrated Subject Cohort and Enrollment Research Network (DISCERN)", "paper_id": "WOS:000314151400013"}
