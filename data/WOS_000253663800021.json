The main result of this paper is a constructive proof of a formula for the upper bound of the approximation error by feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer of sigmoidal units and a linear output. The result can also be used to estimate complexity of the maximum error network. An example to demonstrate the theoretical result is given. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
