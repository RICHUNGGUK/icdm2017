The main advantage of having the resulting integrated questionnaire is that it can be incorporated into other course experience questionnaire surveys to make benchmarking among organizations. This model has been applied to integrate heterogeneous educational questionnaires at the University of Granada.", "paper_title": "A Linguistic Multi-Criteria Decision Making Model Applied to the Integration of Education Questionnaires", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300019"}
