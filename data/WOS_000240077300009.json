One wishes to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G so that the total i-th weights of all vertices in each component is at least l(i) and at most u(i) for each index i, 1 <= i <= q. The problem of finding such a \"uniform\" partition is NP-hard for series-parallel graphs, and is strongly NP-hard for general graphs even for q=1. In this paper we show that the problem and many variants can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time for series-parallel graphs. Our algorithms for series-parallel graphs can be extended for partial k-trees, that is, graphs with bounded tree-width.", "paper_title": "Partitioning a multi-weighted graph to connected subgraphs of almost uniform size", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300009"}
