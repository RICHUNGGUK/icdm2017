These kind of data sets present many values equal to one, the perfect matching, and this justifies the introduction of one-inflation patterns. In addition, matching scores are correlated according to several bivariate patterns: left and right eye, 3 and 12 months of age, etc. Some examples of applications are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
