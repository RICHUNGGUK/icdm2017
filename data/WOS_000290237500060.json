Fire detectors which were calibrated in correlating standard conditions cannot work well in such condition. This paper presents a synthesis method of GM(1. 1) grey prediction model and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in advance to detect fire and to make it work in the environment. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm and experimental evaluation in Tibet are presented. In this process, the grey GM(1, 1) predict model can anticipate the development of fire signals without any assumption, thus allowing earlier fire alarm than traditional fire detection equipments, meanwhile, ANFIS can make sure the data processing more accurate to avoid false alarms. This work will supply useful suggestions with the fire detectors design in low ambient pressure and low oxygen concentration such as Tibet, etc. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
