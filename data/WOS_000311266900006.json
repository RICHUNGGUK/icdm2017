Design/methodology/approach - Based on the definition of traditional GM(0, N) model, the paper considers the limited information and knowledge, and the algorithm of grey numbers with greyness and kernel was designed. A novel GM(0, N) model based on grey number sequences, named the IN-GM(0, N) model, is proposed according to the definition of the grey numbers algorithm. The steps of the proposed model are then given. Finally, a case of domestic commercial aircrafts is developed as an example, based on information gathering and model calculating. Findings - The results of this research indicate that the IN-GM(0,N) model is effective in cost calculating, providing reliable technical support for cost estimation of large-scale complex equipment including commercial aircraft. Practical implications - Cost forecasting of commercial aircraft can be solved effectively and the model can also be utilized to predicate other products. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in constructing a novel grey forecasting model. This work contributes significantly to improving grey forecasting theory and to undoubtedly propose more novel grey forecasting models.", "paper_title": "IN-GM(0, N) cost forecasting model of commercial aircraft based on interval grey numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000311266900006"}
