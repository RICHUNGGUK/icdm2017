Different parameters such as node density, scheduling among neighboring nodes, mobility pattern, and node speed have a tremendous impact on data diffusion in a mobile peer-to-peer environment. In this paper, we develop analytical models for object diffusion time/delay in a wireless mobile network to apprehend the complex interrelationship among these different parameters. In the analysis, we calculate the probabilities of transmitting a single object from one node to multiple nodes using the epidemic model of spread of disease. We also incorporate the impact of node mobility, radio range, and node density in the networks into the analysis. Utilizing these transition probabilities, we estimate the expected delay for diffusing an object to the entire network both for single object and multiple object scenarios. We then calculate the transmission probabilities of multiple objects among the nodes in the wireless mobile network considering network dynamics. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient for data diffusion in the wireless mobile network.
