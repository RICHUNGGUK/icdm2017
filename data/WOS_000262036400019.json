Yet modern programmers typically work with several languages, and the availability of cheap concurrency is exposing fundamental problems in standard concurrent programming techniques ( mutable objects and threads). This situation presents a great opportunity: by exploring nonstandard techniques for gaining intellectual control over concurrent programs, one can motivate and teach important semantic concepts ( such as scoping) and important programming concepts ( such as functional abstraction). Such a curriculum stimulates student interest in exploring new programming paradigms.", "paper_title": "Use Concurrent Programming Models to Motivate Teaching of Programming Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000262036400019"}
