We present an abstract architecture of a multiagent solver and respective algorithm providing decomposition, task allocation, and task delegation. Various features of the abstract architecture, such as computational complexity or admissibility of the underlying optimization heuristics, are analyzed in the paper. Four instances of the abstract architecture implementations are given to demonstrate the applicability of the abstract solver in a wide variety of real-problem domains.", "paper_title": "Abstract Architecture for Task-oriented Multi-agent Problem Solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000285519500004"}
