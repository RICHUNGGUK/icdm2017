AdaBoost learning method is introduced for automatically finding the approximate location of certain object. Then an iterative Graph-Cuts method is used to model the segmentation problem. We call our algorithm as AdaBoost Aggregation Iterative Graph-Cuts (AAIGC). Compared to previous methods based on Graph-Cuts, our method is automatic. Once certain object is trained, our algorithm can cut it out from an image containing the certain object. The segmentation process is reliably computed automatically no additional users' efforts are required. Experiments are given and the outputs are encouraging.", "paper_title": "Certain object segmentation based on AdaBoost learning and nodes aggregation iterative Graph-Cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700020"}
