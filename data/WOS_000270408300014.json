The proposed modulation technique also provides a 3 dB improvement of RF power compared with optical single-sideband modulation. The proposed modulation technique is analyzed in theory and simulation. It is shown that for a given fiber length an optimum electrical phase shift exists to completely cancel the dispersion-induced RF power fading. We verify this proposed modulation technique experimentally for a single-tone RF signal and for a multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultrawideband signal.", "paper_title": "Precompensated Optical Double-Sideband Subcarrier Modulation Immune to Fiber Chromatic-Dispersion-Induced Radio Frequency Power Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408300014"}
