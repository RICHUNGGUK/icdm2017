Design/methodology/approach - The deign features specific to three-phase PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are presented following the proposed chronology for the different choices to be made by motor designers. Findings - It is shown that the selections of the stator core manufacturing method, the number of winding layers, the combination of pole and slot numbers, and the geometry of the tooth tips are crucial during the design stage of the machine. Comprehensive lists of references introducing useful analytical models and prototypes presented in literature are provided. Practical implications - By following the guidelines provided in the paper, motor designers are able to avoid the known drawbacks of PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings, and have a ready list of sources describing useful analytical models. Originality/value - PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings have recently been widely investigated. This paper provides an overview of the main results; pinpointing the choices encountered by the motor designers.", "paper_title": "Design guidelines and models for PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800006"}
