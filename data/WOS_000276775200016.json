In the PHY layer, we focus mainly on system outage performance by analyzing in detail the relationship between the SNR threshold and the outage probabilities. While in the MAC layer, system model is treated as a Jackson queuing network, and the queue discipline for each node is assumed to be GI/M/1 model. System throughput and delay performance for the proposed strategy are also illustrated. Simulation results of the proposed cross-layer scheme are presented to validate our theoretical derivations. It is revealed that, the number of cooperative nodes influences system outage performance at high spectral efficiency regimes in the PHY layer while the proposed strategy provides a better throughput and delay performance than conventional schemes in the MAC layer.", "paper_title": "A novel multi-relay cross-layer cooperative communication strategy based on Jackson queuing model", "paper_id": "WOS:000276775200016"}
