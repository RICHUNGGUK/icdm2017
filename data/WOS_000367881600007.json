This paper describes a new technique of driving pulse edge modulation for insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). By modulating the density and width of the pulse trains, without regulating the hardware circuit, the slope of the gate driving voltage is controlled to change the switching speed. This technique is used in the driving circuit based on complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), and the switching voltage spike of IGBTs can be restrained through software, which is easier and more flexible to adjust. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A driving pulse edge modulation technique and its complex programming logic devices implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367881600007"}
