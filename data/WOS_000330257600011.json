While recent literature has examined this challenge in Western countries, little has been published on Eastern countries. We developed a four-layer model of G2G information sharing across horizontal functional agencies and used it to conduct an analysis of sites within Chinese contexts. Included in the model were the external environment, interagency partnership, organizational readiness, and user expectation. Through empirical testing, we found that the authority of the upper-level leadership, GuanXi, compatibility, top-management support, cost, process security, and expected risks and benefits had a significant influence on the degree of G2G information sharing. However, laws and policies, interagency trust and IT capability had no significant influence on the degree of G2G information sharing. Also, the expected benefits and the degree had positive effect on the performance of G2G information sharing while expected risks had no significant effect on the performance of G2G information sharing.
