This brief extends standard SVMs to SVMs with kernels based on the Mahalanobis distance. The extended SVMs become a special case of the Euclidean distance when the covariance matrix in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is degenerated to an identity. The Mahalanobis distance leads to hyperellipsoidal kernels and the Euclidean distance results in hyperspherical ones. In this brief, the Mahalanobis distance-based kernel in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is developed systematically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hyperellipsoidal kernels slightly outperform the hyperspherical ones, with fewer SVs.", "paper_title": "Hyperellipsoidal Statistical Classifications in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000291355700013"}
