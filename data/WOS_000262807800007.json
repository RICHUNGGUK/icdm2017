This paper presents a continuous no-reset switching iterative learning control algorithm for a novel optical scanning system to achieve the requirements of both fast response and wide field of view. In addition, the proposed method overcomes the non-converging reset error problem experienced by most conventional iterative learning control algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
