Studied previously by Alon et al. [Proceedings of TARK, 2011, pp. 101-110] and by Holzman and Moulin [Econometrica, 81 (2013), pp. 173-196], this problem arises when representatives are selected from within a group or when publishing or funding decisions are made based on a process of peer review. Our main result concerns a randomized mechanism that in expectation selects an agent with at least half the maximum number of nominations. This is best possible subject to impartiality and resolves a conjecture of Alon et al. Further results are given for the case where some agent receives many nominations and the case where each agent casts at least one nomination.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL IMPARTIAL SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000364454500004"}
