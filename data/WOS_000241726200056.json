This problem occurs in most sensor based applications due to the intrinsic drawbacks of fallible physical sensors which can only detect some evidence of real world's situations rather than global views of them. In this paper, we extend ontology based context modeling approach with some descriptive information added to contexts, modify reasoners to support time information, bring in a context life-cycle management strategy, establish a context exploitation mechanism, and propose an inconsistency resolution algorithm, fostering timely, exact and conflict-free contexts. Besides, evaluations and a case study are carried out to attest our design principles.", "paper_title": "Context consistency management using ontology based model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200056"}
