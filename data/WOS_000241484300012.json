Our method allows to combine them together in order to produce complex effects such as automatic texturing, surface imperfections, or biological retina multi-layer cellular behaviours. Our cellular automaton model is defined as a network of connected cells arranged in a natural and dynamic way, which affords multi-behavior capabilities. Based on cheap and widespread computing systems, real-time performance can be reached for simulations involving up to a hundred thousand cells. The efficiency of such an approach is illustrated by a set of CA related to computer graphics -e.g. erosion, sedimentation, or vegetal growing processes- and image analysis -e.g. retina simulation.", "paper_title": "Merging cellular automata for simulating surface effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300012"}
