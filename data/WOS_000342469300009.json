Centralization limits the size of the virtual world as well as the number of players that evolve in it. The present paper shows that it is possible to design a peer-to-peer refereeing system that remains highly efficient, even on a large scale, both in terms of performance and in terms of cheat prevention. Simulations show that such a system scales easily to more than 30,000 nodes, while leaving less than 0.013% occurrences of cheating undetected on a mean total of 24,819,649 refereeing queries.", "paper_title": "Towards a scalable refereeing system for online gaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000342469300009"}
