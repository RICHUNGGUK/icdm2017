Indeed, for reasons of both overhead and privacy, it is common that only the run-time log generated by a system (e. g., syslog) can be shared with the developers. Unfortunately, the ad-hoc nature of such reports are frequently insufficient for detailed failure diagnosis. This paper seeks to improve this situation within the rubric of existing practice. We describe a tool, LogEnhancer that automatically \"enhances\" existing logging code to aid in future post-failure debugging. We evaluate LogEnhancer on eight large, real-world applications and demonstrate that it can dramatically reduce the set of potential root failure causes that must be considered during diagnosis while imposing negligible overheads.", "paper_title": "Improving Software Diagnosability via Log Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000290854400002"}
