A data set containing 24 alkanol and alkanethiol derivatives with known activity was used. Three types of molecular descriptors including QTMS, chemical and quantum chemical was used to derive a quantitative relationship between the anesthetic potency and structural properties. MLR and GA-PLS were employed to model the relationships between molecular descriptors and biological activity of molecules. Some multiparametric equations containing three descriptors with appropriate statistical qualities were obtained Also, GA-PLS regression was used to model the structure-activity relationships more accurately. The results showed that the results obtained by GA-PLS are similar to MLR and confirmed that hydroxyl group might be the most important region in anesthetic activity of alkanols and akanethiols.", "paper_title": "Density Functional Theory-based Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) Study of Alkanol and Alkanthiol Derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000266290200009"}
