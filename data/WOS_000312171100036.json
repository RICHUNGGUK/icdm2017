Through combining reciprocal convex technique with earlier convex one, some previously ignored terms can be reconsidered and the stability criteria are presented in terms of LMIs, whose solvability heavily depends on the information on addressed DNNs as much as possible. Finally, it can be demonstrated by two numerical examples that our derived results reduce the conservatism more efficiently than some present ones with some comparing results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
