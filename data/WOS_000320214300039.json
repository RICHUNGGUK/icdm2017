The multi-objective optimization model is set up by considering the NoC architecture, and addressed by the proposed mapping algorithm that decomposes mapping optimization into a number of scalar subproblems simultaneously. In order to show performance of the proposed algorithm, the application specific benchmark is applied in the simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm has advantages in energy consumption and traffic balance over other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Energy- and Traffic-Balance-Aware Mapping Algorithm for Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000320214300039"}
