These solutions are, however, insufficient to support distributed applications with non-trivial communication patterns among processes or that are structured so as to reflect the organization of resources they are deployed onto. In this paper, we present a generic, adaptable, and extensible component-based middleware that seamlessly enables a transition of non-trivial applications from traditional grids to hybrid grid-cloud platforms. This middleware goes beyond the resolution of well-known technical challenges for multi-domain computing, as it offers mechanisms to exploit the hierarchical, heterogeneous, and dynamic natures of platforms. We validate its capabilities and versatility through two use cases: an Internet-wide federation of Distributed Service Buses and a runtime supporting DD high-performance computing in heterogeneous computing environments using programming that is similar to message-passing interface. Performance results show the efficiency and usefulness of our middleware and so contribute to promote research efforts geared toward flexible, on-demand information technology solutions.
