Our main purpose is to find a robust and computationally efficient density functional to be used specifically and only for describing pi-pi stacking interactions in DNA and other biological molecules in the framework of our recently developed QM/QM approach \"QUILD\". In line with previous studies, most standard density functionals recover, at best, only part of the favorable stacking interactions. An exception is the new KT1 functional, which correctly yields bound pi-stacked structures. Surprisingly, a similarly good performance is achieved with the computationally very robust and efficient local density approximation (LDA). Furthermore, we show that classical electrostatic interactions determine the shape and depth of the pi-pi stacking potential energy surface.", "paper_title": "pi-pi stacking tackled with density functional theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000250308000006"}
