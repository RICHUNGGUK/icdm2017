The key advantage of the proposed scheme is that two very restrictive assumptions in most existing sliding mode control approaches for stochastic fuzzy systems have been removed. It is shown that the closed-loop control system trajectories can be driven onto the sliding surface in finite time almost certainly. It is also shown that the stochastic stability of the resulting sliding motion can be guaranteed in terms of linear matrix inequalities; moreover, the sliding-mode controller can be obtained simultaneously. Simulation results illustrating the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are also provided.", "paper_title": "A New Design of Robust H-infinity Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Stochastic T-S Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342227500007"}
