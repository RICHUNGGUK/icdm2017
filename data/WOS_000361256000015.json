This paper compares the enhancement in information when filtering these noisy EEG signals while using a Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) based Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) model and a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering model, while investigating over multiple classification techniques on several datasets. The RQNN model is designed to efficiently capture the statistical behavior of the input signal using an unsupervised learning scheme. The algorithm is robust to parametric sensitivity and does not make any a priori assumption about the true signal type or the embedded noise. The performance of both the filtering approaches, investigated for the BCI competition IV 2b dataset as well as the offline datasets on subjects in the BCI laboratory, over multiple classifiers shows that the RQNN can potentially be a flexible technique that can suit different classifiers for real-time EEG signal filtering. The average classification accuracy performance across all the subjects with the RQNN technique is better than the SG (and the unfiltered signal) by approximately 5% (and 7%) and 1% (and 4%) during the training and the evaluation stages respectively.
