A wide range of different cryptographic algorithms are used in conjunction with IPsec, such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Message Digest (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm I (SHA-1). We consider the processing and packetization overheads introduced by these algorithms and quantify their impact in terms of communication quality (added delay for the end-user) and resource consumption (additional bandwidth on the radio interface). We conduct a quantitive analysis based on a detailed simulation model of an IPsec enabled handheld device. We verify our simulation results by comparing against analytic results obtained from an approximate analytic model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
