The method is implemented on unstructured grids and the numerical scheme is based on a second-order MUSCL-like upwind Godunov FV discretization for inviscid fluxes and a classical Galerkin FE discretization for the viscous gradients and source terms. The main advantages are: (1) the discretization of SWE written in surface elevation splitting form satisfies the exact conservation property (C-Property) naturally; (2) the simple centred-type discretization can be used for the source terms; (3) the method is suitable for both steady and unsteady shallow water problems; and (4) complex topography can be handled based on unstructured grids. The accuracy of the method was verified for both steady and unsteady problems, including discontinuous cases. The results indicate that the new method is accurate, simple, and robust.
