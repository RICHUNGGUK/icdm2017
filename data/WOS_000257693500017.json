The subspace mainly represents the commonness of human faces but there are a few sights of the individuality owned by a single person's face. In this paper, based on Fast ICA and image reconstruction, we present a novel method for face recognition. When applied to face recognition, the fundamental difference between the traditional ICA and our method is that we obtain the basis images by using each person's pictures respectively, while the traditional way uses the whole training images of the database. After the step above, we obtained the features which would be employed to reconstruct the images by mapping the test images to the basis images. And then we use two ways for face recognition, the first way is adopting the minimum reconstruction error and the second is employing support vector machine (SVM) by using the reconstruction error vectors. Finally, experiments based on three different databases illustrate the effectivity of these methods.", "paper_title": "Image reconstruction for face recognition based on fast ICA", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500017"}
