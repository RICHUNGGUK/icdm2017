The distribution is constructed by normalizing a vector of independent tempered stable random variables. General formulae for all moments and cross-moments of the distribution are derived and they are found to have similar forms to those for the Dirichlet distribution. The univariate version of the distribution can be used as a mixing distribution for the success probability of a binomial distribution to define an alternative to the well-studied beta-binomial distribution. Examples of fitting this model to simulated and real data are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
