Such mapping diversity scheme, adopted in the high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), uses Gray-mapped constellations and is based on suboptimal accumulation of the reliability metrics generated in each of the transmissions. We present an exact model for the logarithmic likelihood ratios (LLR) obtained by means of the so-called max-log approximation, and we show that their conditional probability density functions (pdf) are piecewise Gaussian. We then present the derivation of the Uncoded BER and illustrate it With Simulation results that confirm our formulation. Finally, we propose simplifications which significantly reduce the complexity of the evaluation method and provide results with a very good accuracy: an extension to transmissions over faded channel is also presented.
