For reasonably large values of m and n the NP-hard combinatorial problem GAPS2 becomes intractable for standard mathematical programming software, hence there is a need for heuristic algorithms to solve such problems. It will be shown how an LP-based heuristic developed previously for the well-established generalized assignment problem can be modified and extended to solve GAPS2. Encouraging results, in terms of speed and accuracy, in particular when compared to an existing heuristic for GAPS2, are described.", "paper_title": "An LP-based heuristic procedure for the generalized assignment problem with special ordered sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000244340100010"}
