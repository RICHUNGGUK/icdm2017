The proposed technique differs from the conventional clustering techniques because it eliminates the need for users to determine the number of clusters. In addition, A2DKM incorporates local and spatial information of the data into the clustering analysis. A2DKM is qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the conventional clustering algorithms, namely, the K-Means (KM), Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Moving K-Means (MKM), and Adaptive Fuzzy K-Means (AFKM) algorithms. The A2DKM outperforms these algorithms by producing more homogeneous segmentation results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
