This paper investigated the unexplored potential of kinematic features in assisting the diagnostic decision for CA in the framework of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool. To this end, 15 CAD schemes were designed and were fed with a wide variety of kinematic features of the atherosclerotic plaque and the arterial wall adjacent to the plaque for 56 patients from two different hospitals. The CAD schemes were benchmarked in terms of their ability to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and the combination of the Fisher discriminant ratio, as a feature-selection strategy, and support vector machines, in the classification module, was revealed as the optimal motion-based CAD tool. The particular CAD tool was evaluated with several cross-validation strategies and yielded higher than 88% classification accuracy; the texture-based CAD performance in the same dataset was 80%. The incorporation of kinematic features of the arterial wall in CAD seems to have a particularly favorable impact on the performance of image-data driven diagnosis for CA, which remains to be further elucidated in future prospective studies on large datasets.", "paper_title": "A Novel Computerized Tool to Stratify Risk in Carotid Atherosclerosis Using Kinematic Features of the Arterial Wall", "paper_id": "WOS:000356511900041"}
