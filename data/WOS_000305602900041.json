The adsorbed Pd-4 cluster on the perfect surface prefers to form a tetrahedral structure, while it likely moves to the oxygen defective site to form a distorted tetrahedral structure by removing a bridging oxygen atom. For the defective surface, it exhibits a stronger ability to capture Pd-4 cluster as charge transfer is significantly performed due to the oxygen deficiency. Moreover, it is found that the oxygen defective surface shows higher activity for acetylene hydrogenation, and the possible reason may lie in the weaker adsorption strength between the Pd cluster and the adsorbed molecules on the defective surface as compared to the case on the perfect surface.", "paper_title": "Acetylene hydrogenation on anatase TiO2(101) supported Pd-4 cluster: oxygen deficiency effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900041"}
