The graphical user interface (GUI) functions used in a specific biomass steam-explosion process, intended to be integrated with the PLC device for HMI, thereby providing excellent GUI-based supervision and control functions. Reviewing these specific case study results, we find that the major advantage is maximum system operating performance at minimum cost. Also, the GUI/HMI operation effectively provides user-friendly and reliable interactions. This GUI/HMI approach is a very cost-effective technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
