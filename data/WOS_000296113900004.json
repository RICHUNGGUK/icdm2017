This paper studies real rational ruled surfaces in this context and proves that their conchoid surfaces possess real rational parameterizations, independently of the position of O. Thus any rational ruled surface F admits a rational radius function r(u, v) with respect to any point in space. Besides the general skew ruled surfaces and examples of low algebraic degree we study ruled surfaces generated by rational motions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
