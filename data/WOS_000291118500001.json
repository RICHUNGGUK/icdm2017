However, constructing an accurate and interpretable decision support system (DSS) for any domain is a challenge. In this paper, a novel hierarchical co-evolutionary fuzzy system called HiCEFS is presented that can autonomously derive a fuzzy rule-based DSS from exemplar data. Most of the important components in HiCEFS, including irregular shaped membership functions (ISMFs) and fuzzy rules, are generated using a hierarchical co-evolutionary genetic algorithm that simultaneously co-evolves these components in separate genetic populations. Owing to its generic learning capability, the HiCEFS approach can be easily applied to produce DSSs for classification and regression tasks in various domains. As a case study, HiCEFS is employed to construct a DSS for detecting gamma ray signals. Experimental results show that the system is able to successfully discern the gamma rays from background hadrons, and performs superior to other established techniques.
