However, HCIs are sometimes less user-friendly and intuitive than their traditional counterparts. Our research aims to use every-day objects to create communication channels between spaces and people, which can then strengthen interpersonal emotional relationships through a natural and unobtrusive interface. This study explores how using simpler instruments such as a whiskey glass, a table, and an MP3 player to interact with a dwelling improves user experience in a HCI-equipped smart space. We implemented a real smart space-the Time Home Pub, which not only adjusts the environmental atmosphere (such as background lighting, music, and photos) in response to human activities but also encourages a better connection between humans, their memories, and physical space. Time Home Pub was exhibited at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum in 2007 for the topic of Architecture of Tomorrow. Preliminary evaluations by visitors demonstrate the satisfactory feasibility of the system and how a smart space could change and improve human experiences through the use of new technology and architectural design elements.", "paper_title": "Future home design: an emotional communication channel approach to smart space", "paper_id": "WOS:000323521200021"}
