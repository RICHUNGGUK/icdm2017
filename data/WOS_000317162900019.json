The data used come from acoustic measurements in southern-central Chile. These classifications were carried out by using a diver set of descriptors including morphology, bathymetry, energy, and space positions. In both type of formulations, the deterministic and the stochastic one, the strategy used to classify multi-class SVM consists in employing the criterion one-species-against-the-Rest. We thus provide an empirical way to adjust the parameters involved in the stochastic classifiers with the aim of improving its performance. When this procedure is applied to the classification of fish schools we obtain a classifier with a better performance than the deterministic classifier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
