The high-throughput 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advance Turbo codes require a highly-parallel decoder architecture. Turbo interleaver is known to be the main obstacle to the decoder parallelism due to the collisions it introduces in accesses to memory. The QPP interleaver solves the memory contention issues when several MAP decoders are used in parallel to improve Turbo decoding throughput. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity QPP interleaving address generator and a multi-bank memory architecture to enable parallel Turbo decoding. Design trade-offs in terms of area and throughput efficiency are explored to find the optimal architecture. The proposed parallel Turbo decoder has been synthesized, placed and routed in a 65-nm CMOS technology with a core area of 8.3 mm(2) and a maximum clock frequency of 400 MHz. This parallel decoder, comprising 64 MAP decoder cores, can achieve a maximum decoding throughput of 1.28 Gbps at 6 iterations (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
