The approach comprises two coupled optimizations for adapting size and shape of a Gaussian correlation window at each location and for estimating the flow, respectively. The method copes with a wide range of particle densities and image noise levels without any data-specific parameter tuning. Based on a careful implementation of a multiscale nonlinear optimization technique, we demonstrate robustness of the solution over typical experimental scenarios and highest estimation accuracy for an international benchmark data set (PIV Challenge).", "paper_title": "Variational Adaptive Correlation Method for Flow Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304159800013"}
