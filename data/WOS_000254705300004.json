In a w-anonymous membership broadcast scheme no coalition of up to w receivers, not containing the selected receiver, is able to determine any information about the identity of the selected receiver. We present two new constructions of w-anonymous membership broadcast schemes. The first construction is based on error-correcting codes and we show that there exist schemes that allow a flexible choice of w while keeping the complexities for broadcast communication, user storage and required randomness polynomial in log n,. The second construction is based on the concept of collision-free arrays, which is introduced in this paper. The construction results in more flexible schemes, allowing trade-offs between different complexities.", "paper_title": "New constructions of anonymous membership broadcasting schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254705300004"}
