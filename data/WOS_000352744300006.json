Recent advances in neural simulations of sense-making are opening new venues to explore core issues on modeling complex cognition in the brain. Decision making is a basis element in complex cognition, and despite decades of study, it continues to draw interest from diverse fields. Through the construction and validation of neurocognitive models, the neural origins of complex cognition can be investigated and simulated to explain decision making behavior. We describe the broad landscape of inquiry, interdisciplinary motivation, and specific applications for building neurocognitive models that simulate the complex cognitive processes underlying sense-making.
