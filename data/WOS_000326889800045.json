(Soft Comput 11:573-584, 2007) proposed a method to rank fuzzy numbers. They employed a relative distance metric method to rank fuzzy numbers; however, there were some problems with the ranking method. In this paper, we want to indicate these problems of Chang's method, and then propose a revised method, which can avoid these problems for ranking fuzzy numbers. Since the revised method is based on Chang's method, it is easy to rank fuzzy numbers in a way similar to the original method.", "paper_title": "Selecting the best alternatives of fuzzy decision making units with relative distance metric method", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800045"}
