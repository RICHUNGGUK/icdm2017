The proposed body voltage control method allows the amplifier to achieve small power consumption and large output swing. The proposed amplifier has a power consumption lower than 15.6 mW, almost half of the folded cascode amplifier satisfying 12-bit, 400 MS/s ADC operation. Moreover, the proposed amplifier secures 600 mV output swing, which is one drain source voltage (1705) wider compared with the telescopic amplifier. The 12-bit interpolated pipeline ADC using the proposed amplifier is fabricated in a 1P9M 90 nm CMOS technology with a 1.2 V supply voltage. The ADC achieves an effective number of bit (ENOB) of about 10-bit at 300 MS/s and an figure of merit (FoM) of 0.2 pJ/conv. when the frequency of the input signal is sufficiently low.", "paper_title": "A 12-bit Interpolated Pipeline ADC Using Body Voltage Controlled Amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900025"}
