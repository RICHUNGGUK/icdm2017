This article introduces a methodology for solving the MRCPSP based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that has not been utilized for this and other construction-related problems. The framework of the PSO-based methodology is developed. A particle representation formulation is proposed to represent the potential solution to the MRCPSP in terms of priority combination and mode combination for activities. Each particle-represented solution should be checked against the nonrenewable resource infeasibility and will be handled by adjusting the mode combination. The feasible particle-represented solution is transformed to a schedule through a serial generation scheme. Experimental analyses are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Multimode project scheduling based on particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235482300002"}
