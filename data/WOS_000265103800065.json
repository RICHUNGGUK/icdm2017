In this paper, a Cluster-based location management scheme is introduced, which takes adequately into account the characteristic of the mesh structure. Numerical result reveals that the proposed scheme enables to significantly lessen the signaling cost.", "paper_title": "A Novel Location Management Scheme for Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265103800065"}
