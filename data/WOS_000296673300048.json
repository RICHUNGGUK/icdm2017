The proposed approach takes advantage of the URA feature that the 2D spatial signature of the receive signal can be decomposed into an outer product of two ID spatial signatures. The ID spatial signatures lie in the column and the row spaces of the receive signal matrix, respectively. It follows that the interferers can be successively eliminated by two rounds of ID-based GSC structure. As compared to the conventional 2D-GSC structure, computer simulations show that in addition to having significantly low computational complexity, the proposed adaptive approach possesses higher convergence rate.", "paper_title": "A Low Complexity 1D-Based Successive GSC Structure for 2D Adaptive Beamformer Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300048"}
