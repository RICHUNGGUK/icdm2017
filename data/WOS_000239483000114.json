The improved resource allocating network (IRAN) is developed to design IRBFNN online for nonlinear dynamic system modeling, integrating the typical resource allocating network (RAN) with merging method for similar hidden units, deleting strategy for redundant hidden units, and LMS learning algorithm with moving data window for output link weights of network. The proposed approach can effectively improve the precision and generalization of IRBFNN. The combination of IRBFNN and IRAN is competent for the online modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems. The feasibility and effectiveness of the modeling method have been demonstrated by simulations.", "paper_title": "A new on-line modeling approach to nonlinear dynamic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000114"}
