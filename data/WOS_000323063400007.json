In practice, there are always individuals who try to exert pressure in order to persuade others who could easily be influenced. In these situations, classical group decision making models fail. Thus, there is still the necessity of developing tools to help users reach collective decisions as if they participated in a real face to face meeting. In such a way, a proper negotiation process can lead to successful solutions. Therefore, we propose a new consensus model to deal with the psychology of negotiation by using the power of a fuzzy ontology as weapon of influence in order to improve group decision scenarios making them more precise and realistic. In addition, the use of a fuzzy ontology gives us the possibility to take into account large sets of alternatives.", "paper_title": "A new consensus model for group decision making using fuzzy ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000323063400007"}
