Plenty of studies have been conducted on compact routing, and quite a few universal compact routing schemes have been designed for arbitrary network topologies. However, it is generally believed that specialized compact routing schemes for peculiar network topologies can have better performance than universal ones. Studies on complex networks have uncovered that most real-world networks exhibit power-law degree distributions, i.e., a few nodes have very high degrees while many other nodes have low degrees. High-degree nodes play the crucial role of hubs in communication and inter-networking. Based on this fact, we propose two highest-degree landmark based compact routing schemes, namely HDLR and HDLR+. Theoretical analysis on random power-law graphs shows that the two schemes can achieve better space-stretch trade-offs than previous compact routing schemes. Simulations conducted on random power-law graphs and real-world AS-level Internet graph validate the effectiveness of our schemes.", "paper_title": "Space-Stretch Tradeoff Optimization for Routing in Internet-Like Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000311527600011"}
