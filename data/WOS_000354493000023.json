In this paper, we study an in-vehicle sensor database management system (DBMS). In the proposed approach, simply called in-vehicle DBMS approach, DBMS inside the ego-vehicle manages, gathers, and processes traffic and sensor data onboard such as signal data and multimedia data including map and image data. We classify the requirements of applications using the in-vehicle DBMS into data modeling and query processing. We also propose a system architecture for an in-vehicle DBMS which solves those issues and discuss database techniques offered by the system.", "paper_title": "Towards intelligent in-vehicle sensor database management systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354493000023"}
