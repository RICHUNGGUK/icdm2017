Differing from previous literature that think knowledge capability is the sum total of the knowledge assets of organizations, this paper defines knowledge capability as including both knowledge assets and knowledge operating capacities. And it is proposed that knowledge capability is dynamic, that is to say it will reconstruct with the changing of the environment. Since there are few empirical studies on the relationship between capability and organization performance, this paper suggests a model for further empirical studies on the impact of knowledge capability on organization performance.", "paper_title": "Knowledge capability: A definition and research model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200028"}
