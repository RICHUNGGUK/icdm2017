These estimators based on multivariate autoregressive model are free of pitfalls connected with application of bivariate measures. The examples of applications illustrating the performance of the methods are given. Time-varying estimators of directedness: short-time DTF and adaptive methods are presented.", "paper_title": "Review of the methods of determination of directed connectivity from multichannel data", "paper_id": "WOS:000290772800003"}
