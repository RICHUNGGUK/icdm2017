There are different approaches to creating well-formed summaries. One of the newest methods is the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). In this paper, different LSA-based summarization algorithms are explained, two of which are proposed by the authors of this paper. The algorithms are evaluated on Turkish and English documents, and their performances are compared using their ROUGE scores. One of our algorithms produces the best scores and both algorithms perform equally well on Turkish and English document sets.", "paper_title": "Text summarization using Latent Semantic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000293782600006"}
