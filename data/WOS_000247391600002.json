The parameters of the neurons in the hidden nodes adapt to changes of the input environment, so that different test input sets separately distributed in a large domain can be tackled after training. Effectively, there are different individual neural networks for different sets of inputs. The proposed network exhibits a better learning and generalization ability than the traditional one. An improved real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) Ling and Leung (Soft Comput 11(1):7-31, 2007) is proposed to train the network parameters. Industrial applications on short-term load forecasting and hand-written graffiti recognition will be presented to verify and illustrate the improvement.", "paper_title": "Input-dependent neural network trained by real-coded genetic algorithm and its industrial applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000247391600002"}
