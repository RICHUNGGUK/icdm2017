It supports efficient normalisation of open lambda-terms with respect to beta-reduction and rewrite rules. We have implemented NBE and show both a detailed formal model of our implementation and its verification in Isabelle. Finally we discuss how NBE is turned into a proof rule in Isabelle.", "paper_title": "A compiled implementation of normalisation by evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302029400002"}
