Our general approach is both applicable to two and three dimensions and is very simple compared to previous wall boundary formulations. Based on a local force balance between wall and fluid particles we apply a pressure boundary condition on the solid particles to prevent wall penetration. This method can handle sharp corners and complex geometries as is demonstrated with several examples. A validation shows that we recover hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in a static tank, and a comparison of the classical dam break simulation with state-of-the-art results in literature shows good agreement. We simulate various problems such as the flow around a cylinder and the backward facing step at Re = 100 to demonstrate the general applicability of this new method.
