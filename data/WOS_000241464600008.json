The proposed heuristic, TECH-CYCLES (Two-level Cache Exploration Heuristic considering CYCLES), consists of making a small search in the space of configurations of the two-level cache hierarchy, analyzing the impact of each parameter in terms of energy and number of cycles spent for a given application. Experiments show an average reduction of about 41% in the energy consumption by using our heuristic when compared with the existing heuristic (TCaT), also for two-level caches. Besides the energy improvement, this method also reduces the number of cycles needed to execute a given application by about 25%. In order to validate the proposed heuristic, twelve benchmarks from the MiBench suite have been used.", "paper_title": "Heuristic for two-level cache hierarchy exploration considering energy consumption and performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600008"}
