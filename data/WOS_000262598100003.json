Similarity-based aspect-graph, which contains a set of aspects and prototypes for these aspects, is employed to represent the database of 3D objects. An incremental database construction method that maximizes the similarity of views in the same aspect and minimizes the similarity of prototypes is proposed as the core of the framework to build and update the aspect-graph using 2D views randomly sampled from a viewing sphere. The proposed framework is evaluated on various object recognition problems, including 3D object recognition, human posture recognition and scene recognition. Shape and color features are employed in different applications with the proposed framework and the top three matching rates show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FLEXIBLE 3D OBJECT RECOGNITION FRAMEWORK USING 2D VIEWS VIA A SIMILARITY-BASED ASPECT-GRAPH APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598100003"}
