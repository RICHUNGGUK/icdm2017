Given a set P = {{a(i), b(i)}}(i=1)(m) of pairs of distinct vertices of the n-dimensional hypercube Q(n), is there a path partition {P-i}(i=1)(m) of Q(n) such that a(i) and b(i) are endvertices of P-i? Caha and Koubek showed that for 6m <= n, such a path partition exists if and only if the set P is balanced in the sense that it contains the same number of vertices from both classes of bipartition of Q(n). In this paper we show that this result holds even for 2m - e < n, where e is the number of pairs of P that form edges of Q(n). Moreover, our bound is optimal in the sense that for every n >= 3, there is a balanced set P in Q(n) such that 2m - e = n, but no path partition with endvertices prescribed by P exists.
