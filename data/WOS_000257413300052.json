However, it is known not to lead to unique results when applied to blind source separation (BSS) problems. In this paper we present an extension of NMF capable of solving the BSS problem when the underlying sources are sufficiently sparse. In contrast to most well-established BSS methods, the devised algorithm is capable of solving the BSS problem in cases where the underlying sources are not independent or uncorrelated. As the proposed fitness function is discontinuous and possesses many local minima, we use a genetic algorithm for its minimization. Finally, we apply the devised algorithm to real world microarray data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
