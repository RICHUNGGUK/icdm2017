The main contribution of BS-MAC is that: (a) It uses small size time slots. (b) The number of those time slots is more than the number of member nodes. (c) Shortest job first (SJF) algorithm to schedule time slots. (d) Short node address (1 byte) to identify members nodes. First two contributions of BS-MAC handle adaptive traffic loads of all members in an efficientmanner. The SJF algorithm reduces node's job completion time and to minimize the average packet delay of nodes. The short node address reduces the control overhead and makes the proposed scheme an energy efficient. The simulation results verify that the proposed BS-MAC transmitsmore data with less delay and energy consumption compared to the existing MAC protocols.", "paper_title": "Enhanced TDMA based MAC Protocol for Adaptive Data Control in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358260700005"}
