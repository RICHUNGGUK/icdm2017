All approach of handling the moving free Surface boundary is proposed. Using the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation as the radial basis functions and locating the source points Outside the comptational domain, the problem is solved by collocation of only a few boundary points. Present model is first applied to simulate the generation of periodic finite-amplitude waves with high wave-steepness and then is employed to Simulate the modulation of monochromatic waves passing over a submerged obstacle. Good agreements are observed as compared with experimental data and other numerical models.
