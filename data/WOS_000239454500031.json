Establishing such mappings has been the focus of a variety of research originating from diverse communities. In this paper, we propose a Composite Approach for Ontology Mapping (ACAOM) for semiautomatic ontology mapping based on the combination of the name and instance methods. We conclude that the combination is a promising method.", "paper_title": "A composite approach for ontology mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454500031"}
