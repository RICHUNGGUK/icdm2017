We describe a number of devices that perform basic operations on information coded in pulses of excitation like signal diodes, logical gates, signal comparers and pulse counters. The perspectives for the further development of this branch Of unconventional computing are discussed.", "paper_title": "Basic Information Processing Operations with Pulses of Excitation in a Reaction-Diffusion System", "paper_id": "WOS:000260936400002"}
