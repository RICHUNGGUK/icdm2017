The dynamic data driven paradigm is exploited to promote application advances, application measurement systems and methods, mathematical and statistical algorithms and finally systems software infrastructure relevant to this effort. These advances are intended to enable behavior monitoring and prediction as well as critical event avoidance on multiple time scales.", "paper_title": "Towards a dynamic data driven system for structural and material health monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300061"}
