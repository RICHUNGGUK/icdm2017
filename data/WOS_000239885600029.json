SRPT is perhaps the most well-studied algorithm for minimizing total flow time or stretch. This paper gives the first resource augmentation analysis of the total stretch of SRPT, showing that it is indeed O(1)-speed 1-competitive. This paper also gives a simple lower bound result showing that SRPT is not s-speed 1-competitive for any s < 1.5. This paper also makes contribution to the analysis of SJF. Extending the work of [L. Becchetti, S. Leonardi, A. Marchetti-Spaccamela, K. Pruhs, Online weighted flow time and deadline scheduling, in: RANDOM-APPROX, 2001, pp. 36-47], we are able to show that SJF is O(1)-speed 1-competitive for minimizing total stretch. More interestingly, we find that the competitiveness of SJF can be reduced arbitrarily by increasing the processor speed (precisely, SJF is O(s)-speed (1/s)-competitive for any s >= 1). We conjecture that SRPT also admits a similar result. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
