Quantitative analysis in this paper based on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification shows a high probability of the continuous hidden node collisions (CHNCs), which seriously decreases network throughput. Based on this observation, we propose a cost-efficient recovery mechanism to achieve fast self-healing when LR-WPANs suffer CHNCs, while introducing no overhead when there are no collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed protocol in terms of network throughput and power saving.
