The central problem is the determination of C(n, k, d), the size of an optimal code of length n, weight k, and distance d in the Enomoto-Katona space. The value of C(n, k, d) was known only for some congruence classes of n when (k, d) is an element of{(2, 3), (3, 5)}. In this paper, we obtain new infinite families of optimal codes in the Enomoto-Katona space and verify a conjecture of Brightwell and Katona in certain instances. In particular, C(n, k, 2k - 1) is determined for all sufficiently large n satisfying either n = 1 mod k and n(n - 1) = 0 mod 2k(2), or n = 0 mod k. We also give complete solutions for k = 2 and determine C(n, 3, 5) for certain congruence classes of n with finite exceptions.", "paper_title": "Optimal Codes in the Enomoto-Katona Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000348383500002"}
