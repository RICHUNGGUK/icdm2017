The bidder simultaneously monitors several identical auctions, taking advantage of their price differential. We examined the determinants and outcomes of cross-bidding behavior and the contingent factors that shape it. Using empirical data, we demonstrated that cross-bidders can realize significant price discounts compared to non-cross-bidders; the number of experienced bidders in an auction market contributes to more cross-bidding; and this effect is positively moderated by market liquidity of the product being auctioned.
