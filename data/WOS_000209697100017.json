The derived series are shown to rapidly converge over the range of practical TWDP fading parameters. An efficient low-complexity algorithm is also proposed for evaluation of these series. Infinite series solution are derived for the TWDP moments, and the integral of the TWDP fading PDF against the complementary error function for performance analysis purposes. The BER of a BPSK system operating in TWDP fading is evaluated as an application of the results.", "paper_title": "New Expressions for TWDP Fading Statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100017"}
