The machines are assigned to execute production tasks. We aim to minimize the total preventive maintenance cost such that the maintenance tasks have to continuously be run during the schedule horizon. Such a constraint holds when the maintenance resources are not sufficient. We solve the problem by two exact methods and meta-heuristic algorithms. As exact procedures we used linear programming and branch and bound methods. As meta-heuristics, we propose a local search approach as well as a genetic algorithm. Computational experiments are performed on randomly generated instances to show that the proposed methods produce appropriate solutions for the problem. The computational results show that the deviation of the meta-heuristics solutions to the optimal one is very small, which confirms the effectiveness of meta-heuristics as new approaches for solving hard scheduling problems.", "paper_title": "Earliness-tardiness minimization on a single machine to schedule preventive maintenance tasks: metaheuristic and exact methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200026"}
