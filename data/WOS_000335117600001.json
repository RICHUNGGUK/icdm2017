The categories of cloud services and their QoS (quality of service) indexes are established. From the perspective of QoS indexes, the relationship among QoS key factors for different kinds of cloud services are analysed and elaborated, and the corresponding objective functions and constraints of CSCOS are proposed. A new chaos control optimal algorithm (CCOA) is designed to address the CSCOS problem, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can search better solutions with less time-consumption than widely used algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and typical chaotic genetic algorithm (CGA).", "paper_title": "A chaos control optimal algorithm for QoS-based service composition selection in cloud manufacturing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000335117600001"}
