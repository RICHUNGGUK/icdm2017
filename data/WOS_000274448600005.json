The N-queens problem aims at placing N queens on an NxN chessboard, in such a way that no queen could capture any of the others. The proposed algorithm is a novel hybridization between differential evolution algorithms and quantum computing principles. Accordingly, differential evolution algorithms have been enhanced by the adoption of some quantum concepts such as quantum bits and states superposition. The Use of the quantum interference has allowed this hybrid approach to have a remarkable efficiency and good results.", "paper_title": "A Quantum-Inspired Differential Evolution Algorithm for Solving the N-Queens Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000274448600005"}
