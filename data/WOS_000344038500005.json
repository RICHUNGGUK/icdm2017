Some tools automatically discharge a significant part of them, thus augmenting the efficiency of the formal development. We here investigate the use of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers in addition to the traditional tools, and detail the techniques used for the cooperation between the Rodin platform and SMT solvers. Our contribution is the definition of a translation of Event-B proof obligations to the language of SMT solvers, its implementation in a Rodin plug-in, and an experimental evaluation on a large sample of industrial and academic projects. On this domain, adding SMT solvers to Atelier B provers reduces significantly the number of sequents that need to be proved interactively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
