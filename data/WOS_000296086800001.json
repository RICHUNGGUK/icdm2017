The MET can simultaneously transmit several spatial multiplexing eigenmodes to multiple users which significantly enhance the system performance. The maximum number of users that can be served simultaneously is limited due to the constraints on the number antennas, and thus an appropriate user selection is critical to the MET system. Various algorithms have been developed in previous works such as the enumerative search algorithm. However, the high complexities of these algorithms impede their applications in practice. In this paper, motivated by the necessity of an efficient and effective user selection algorithm, a low complexity recursive user selection algorithm is proposed for the MET system. In addition, the fairness of the MET system is improved by using the combination of the proposed user selection algorithm and the adaptive Proportional Fair Scheduling (PFS) algorithm. Extensive simulations are implemented to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the Fairness of the Multiuser Eigenmode Transmission System", "paper_id": "WOS:000296086800001"}
