The results of existing sample reducing methods are not very satisfactory because the reduced sample cannot contain the most support vectors which mainly determine the classification results. So we investigate the method of sample reducing in support vector machine based on K-Closest Sub-Clusters (KCSC) in this paper. The proposed method employs K-Closest Sub-Clusters to reduce the training samples, remaining the sample datasets near the classification boundary, which would probably be the support vectors, and deletes the sample datasets beyond the classification boundary, which would not contribute to the classification. The proposed method is validated on two artificial datasets and two real world datasets. The results of validation show that the training time of SVM is reduced greatly on the prerequisite of maintaining training and testing classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Sample reducing method in support vector machine based on K-Closest Sub-Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500020"}
