It is shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between (L, M)-fuzzy pseudo-metrics in the sense of Shi and pointwise pseudo-metric chains which preserve boolean OR-boolean AND operations. Also, it is proved that a pointwise pseudo-metric chain can induce an (L, M)-fuzzy topology which coincides with the (L, M)-fuzzy topology induced by an (L, M)-fuzzy pseudo-metric.", "paper_title": "Characterizations of (L, M)-fuzzy pseudo-metrics by pointwise pseudo-metric chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000343806200023"}
