The VTOL vehicle is assumed to be a rigid body, equipped with a minimum sensor suite (camera, 1MU and barometric altimeter) maneuvering over a textured rough terrain made of a concatenation of planar surfaces. Assuming that the forward velocity is separately regulated to a desired value, the proposed control approach ensures terrain following and guarantees that the vehicle does not collide with the ground during the task. The proposed control acquires an optical flow from multiple spatially separate observation points, typically obtained via multiple cameras or non collinear directions in a unique camera. The proposed control algorithm has been tested extensively in simulation and then implemented on a quadrotor UAV to demonstrate the performance of the closed-loop system.", "paper_title": "A terrain-following control approach for a VTOL Unmanned Aerial Vehicle using average optical flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000282783600008"}
