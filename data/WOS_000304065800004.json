Suppose an observer, say Alice, observes a multivalued function f : Z(+) -> Z(d) over time in an online fashion, that is, she only sees f(t) for t <= t(now) where t(now) is the current time. She would like to keep a tracker, say Bob, informed of the current value of f at all times. Under this setting, Alice could send new values of f to Bob from time to time, so that the current value of f is always within a distance of Delta to the last value received by Bob. We give competitive online algorithms whose communication costs are compared with the optimal offline algorithm that knows the entire f in advance. We also consider variations of the problem where Alice is allowed to send predictions to Bob, to further reduce communication for well-behaved functions. These online tracking problems have a variety of application, ranging from sensor monitoring, location-based services, to publish/subscribe systems.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional Online Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000304065800004"}
