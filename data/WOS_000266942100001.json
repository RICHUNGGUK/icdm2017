After recalling definitions and basic properties, we consider episturmian morphisms that allow for a deeper study of these words. Some properties of factors are described, including factor complexity, palindromes, fractional powers, frequencies, and return words. We also consider lexicographical properties of episturmian words, as well as their connection to the balance property, and related notions such as finite episturmian words, Arnoux-Rauzy sequences, and \"episkew words\" that generalize the skew words of Morse and Hedlund.", "paper_title": "EPISTURMIAN WORDS: A SURVEY", "paper_id": "WOS:000266942100001"}
