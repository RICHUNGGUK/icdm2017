Especially for product innovation, crowdsourcing shows huge potential for generating more creative ideas in terms of quantity and innovativeness. However, there are still some deficiencies in the existing crowdsourcing work: i) lack of a crowdsourcing system under a systematic or unified framework to support product innovation; ii) lack of an effective quantitative method to assist the design of crowdsourcing tasks; and iii) insufficient anti-cheating concerns in the initial stage of task design. In this article, a prototype crowdsourcing system is proposed to tackle these problems. Through the establishment of a task development model which consists of i) an innovation target analysis module, ii) an innovation-oriented HIT (human intelligent task) allocation module, and iii) a cheating control module, the proposed system is able to analyze and decompose the innovation target. In addition, it can identify suitable tasks to facilitate innovation and to embed anti-cheating measures in task design. To demonstrate the proposed prototype system, a case study on a future PC design is presented. Through control testing, it appears that the proposed system is effective in generating more valid and innovative ideas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
