Most Grids deployed at large scale are production platforms that are inappropriate research tools because of their limited reconfiguration, control and monitoring capabilities. In this paper, we present Grid'5000, a 5000 CPU nation-wide infrastructure for research in Grid computing. Grid'5000 is designed to provide a scientific tool for computer scientists similar to the large-scale instruments used by physicists, astronomers, and biologists. We describe the motivations, design considerations, architecture, control, and monitoring infrastructure of this experimental platform. We present configuration examples and performance results for the reconfiguration subsystem.", "paper_title": "Grid'5000: A large scale and highly reconfigurable experimental grid testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000242290400005"}
