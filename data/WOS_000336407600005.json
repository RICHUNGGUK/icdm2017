We study certificates of non-membership with respect to several classes of read-once functions, generated by their bases. For the basis {&, boolean OR, (sic)}, we determine the optimal certificate size for every function outside the class and deduce that 6 strings always suffice. For the same basis augmented with a function x(1) ... x(s) V (x) over bar (1) ... (x) over bar (s), we show that there exist n-variable functions requiring Omega(n(s-1)) strings in a certificate as n -> infinity. For s = 2, we show that this bound is tight by constructing certificates of size O(n) for all functions outside the class.", "paper_title": "Certificates of Non-Membership for Classes of Read-Once Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000336407600005"}
