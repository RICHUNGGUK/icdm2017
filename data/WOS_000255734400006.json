The context that helps to understand data over time is usually described separately in text-rich documents. This paper proposes to integrate the traditional corporate data warehouse with a document warehouse, resulting in a contextualized warehouse. Thus, the user first selects an analysis context by supplying some keywords. Then, the analysis is performed on a novel type of OLAP cube, called an R-cube, which is materialized by retrieving and ranking the documents and corporate facts related to the selected context.
