The main result is decidability of strong bisimilarity, known also as performance equivalence, in this class. This extends the earlier decidability result for plain BPP by Christensen et al. Our decision procedure is based on decidability of the validity problem for Presburger arithmetic. We prove also polynomial complexity in positive-duration fragment, thus properly extending a previous result by Berard et al. Both ill-timed and well-timed semantics are treated.
