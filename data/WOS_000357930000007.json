Each k-anonymized aggregate location is a cloaked area that contains at least k persons. However, we identify an attack model to show that overlapping aggregate locations still pose privacy risks because an adversary can infer some overlapping areas with less than k persons that violates the k-anonymity privacy requirement. In this paper, we propose a reciprocal protocol for location privacy (REAL) in WSNs. In REAL, sensor nodes are required to autonomously organize their sensing areas into a set of non-overlapping and highly accurate k-anonymized aggregate locations. To confront the three key challenges in REAL, namely, self-organization, reciprocity property and high accuracy, we design a state transition process, a locking mechanism and a time delay mechanism, respectively. We compare the performance of REAL with current protocols through simulated experiments. The results show that REAL protects location privacy, provides more accurate query answers, and reduces communication and computational costs.", "paper_title": "REAL: A Reciprocal Protocol for Location Privacy in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357930000007"}
