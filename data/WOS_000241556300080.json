Our goal is to prevent inadvertent damage to the carotid artery when targeting the jugular vein for catheterization. We used a portable 10 MHz ultrasound system to acquire cross sectional B-mode ultrasound images of these great vessels at 10 fps. An expert user identified the vessels in the first frame by touching the vessels on the screen with his fingertip, and the computer automatically tracked the vessels and calculated a best-fit ellipse for each vessel in each subsequent frame. Vessel location and radii were further analyzed to produce parameters that proved useful for differentiating between the carotid artery and jugular vein. These parameters include relative location of the vessels, distension of the vessel walls, and consistent phase difference between the arterial and venous pulsations as determined by temporal Fourier analysis.", "paper_title": "Carotid artery and jugular vein tracking and differentiation using spatiotemporal analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300080"}
