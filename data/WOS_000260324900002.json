In this article, we implement the EM algorithm to fit a regression model with censored data when the failure times follow the BISA. Three approaches to implement the E-Step of the EM algorithm are considered. In two of these implementations, the M-Step is attained by an iterative least-squares procedure. The algorithm is exemplified with a single explanatory variable in the model.", "paper_title": "Estimation of parameters for a Birnbaum-Saunders regression model with censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000260324900002"}
