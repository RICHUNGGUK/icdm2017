We focus on problems that originate from a space approximation using high order finite difference methods on summation-by-parts form with weak boundary conditions, and extend that technique to the time-domain. The new time-integration method is global, high order accurate, unconditionally stable and together with the approximation in space, it generates optimally sharp fully discrete energy estimates. In particular, it is shown how stable fully discrete high order accurate approximations of the Maxwells' equations, the elastic wave equations and the linearized Euler and Navier-Stokes equations can obtained. Even though we focus on finite difference approximations, we stress that the methodology is completely general and suitable for all semi-discrete energy-stable approximations. Numerical experiments show that the new technique is very accurate and has limited order reduction for stiff problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
