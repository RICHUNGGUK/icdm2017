To date, however, no studies have analyzed its effects upon the country's scientific system from a scientometric perspective, in terms of resources dedicated to scientific activity and the final output and impact. The present study does so by means of a set of scientometric indicators that reflect economic effort, human resources dedicated to research, publications, collaborative relations, and the international visibility of scientific contributions.", "paper_title": "The impact of the socio-economic crisis of 2001 on the scientific system of Argentina from the scientometric perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000282048200009"}
