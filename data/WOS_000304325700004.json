This incorporates two features that have been consistently identified in the psychology and design literatures: (a) a processing sequence and (b) a distinction between cognition and affect. Suggested advantages include increased clarity with regard to the identification of self-report constructs, stronger links to relevant literature, and improved \"actionability\" of designs. To examine this framework empirically, a study was conducted for which participants were required to imagine selecting a psychology university degree program and to provide a series of ratings of the designs of five department websites. The proposed framework enabled the identification of distinct and interpretable patterns of users' responses. In this regard, a number of consistencies with recent conceptualizations of user experience were noted. Implications and limitations of the proposed approach were considered.", "paper_title": "Structuring Users' Self-Report Responses to Website Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304325700004"}
