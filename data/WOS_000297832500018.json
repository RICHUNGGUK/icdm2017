After initial registration, the internal surface of soft tissue at the nose region was generated by the statistical data for soft tissue thickness adapted by the individual thickness information from the X-ray image. Then, the sketch contour of the 3D scan data on the lateral X-ray image was modified manually or adjusted automatically according to some aesthetic statistical data, to drive the simulation in real time by the state-of-the-art Laplacian surface deformation method. When satisfied with the 3D postoperative appearance, the deformation was mapped to the internal surface of soft tissue, and the change before and after simulation was utilized to generate the patient specific prosthesis model automatically. The surgeons who used the system confirmed that this planning system is attractive and has potential for daily clinical practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
