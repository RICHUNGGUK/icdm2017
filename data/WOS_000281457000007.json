Given two strings s(1) and s(2) over an alphabet Sigma, a set C-s of strings, and a function C-0 : Sigma -> N, the DC-LCS problem consists of finding the longest subsequence s of s(1) and s(2) such that s is a supersequence of all the strings in C-s and such that the number of occurrences in s of each symbol sigma is an element of Sigma is upper bounded by C-0(sigma). The DC-LCS problem provides a clear mathematical formulation of a sequence comparison problem in Computational Biology and generalizes two other constrained variants of the LCS problem that have been introduced previously in the literature: the Constrained LCS and the Repetition-Free LCS. We present two results for the DC-LCS problem. First, we illustrate a fixed-parameter algorithm where the parameter is the length of the solution which is also applicable to the more specialized problems. Second, we prove a parameterized hardness result for the Constrained LCS problem when the parameter is the number of the constraint strings (vertical bar C-s vertical bar) and the size of the alphabet Sigma E. This hardness result also implies the parameterized hardness of the DC-LCS problem (with the same parameters) and its NP-hardness when the size of the alphabet is constant. 2010 Elsevier B.V.
