The source fluctuations of the flow field are computed by a large-eddy simulation (LES) with Dynamic Smagorinsky Model (DSM) and they are fed to the following acoustical computation as input data. An explicit/implicit finite element method with second order accuracy both in time and space is used for flow field discretization. The method is applied to the prediction of sound in three different classes of problems: far-field sound generated from flow around a bluff body, sound resulting from blade-stator interaction of turbomachinery and sound due to a turbulent boundary layer on an aerofoil. The computed frequency spectra of the sound show a fairly good agreement with the measured spectra for all the cases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
