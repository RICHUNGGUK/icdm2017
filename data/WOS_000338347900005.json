Unlike the work available in the literature that solves the problem using the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) the trajectory generation algorithm presented here considers a geometrical approach which is intuitive and easy to understand. This also computes the explicit solution for the length of the optimal path as a function of the initial configuration. Further, using a 6-DOF model of a MAV the generated optimal path is tracked by an autopilot consisting of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The simulation results show the path generation and tracking for different cases.", "paper_title": "Optimal Trajectory Generation for Convergence to a Rectilinear Path", "paper_id": "WOS:000338347900005"}
