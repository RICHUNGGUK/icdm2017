The Stratego language provides rewrite rules for expressing basic transformations, programmable rewriting strategies for controlling the application of rules, concrete syntax for expressing the patterns of rules in the syntax of the object language, and dynamic rewrite rules for expressing context-sensitive transformations, thus supporting the development of transformation components at a high level ofabstraction. The XT toolset offers a collection offlexible, reusable transformation components, and tools for generating such components from declarative specifications. Complete program transformation systems are composed from these components. This paper gives an overview ofStratego/XT 0.17, including a description ofthe Stratego language and XT transformation tools: a discussion of the implementation techniques and software engineering process; and a description of applications built with Stratego/XT.
