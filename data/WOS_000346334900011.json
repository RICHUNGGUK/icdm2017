As an emerging technology, augmented reality (AR) integrates three-dimensional (3D) images of virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of digitalized information into the real-world workspace using AR can provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures with improved accuracy and reduced errors. The limited available research concerning the applications of AR visualization means in assembly highlights the need for a structured methodology of addressing cognitive and usability issues for the application potentials of AR technology to be fully realized. Thus, the focus of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how much improvement in assembly productivity and performance can be achieved by lowering cognitive workload via AR. The AR system was developed in collaboration with Woodside Energy Ltd. following research project ECHO. Evaluation of the prototyped construction piping scenario revealed that the AR visualization yielded shorter task completion time (50% reduction), fewer assembly errors (50% reduction), and lower total task load. More specific findings also indicated that the animated AR visualization significantly shortened the original time (55% reduction) and rework time (46% reduction), payment to assemblers (50% reduction), and cost of correcting erroneous assembly (66% reduction). Questionnaire feedback revealed that the animated AR visualization better aided assembly comprehension and better facilitated information retrieval and collaboration between human and guidance medium. From a technology innovation perspective, by providing a higher level of immersion and interaction with spatial awareness, the dynamic AR guidance can be integrated with building information model (BIM) technology in helping and training practitioners, because all of the models and assembly sequences are designed in BIM and visualized in AR.
