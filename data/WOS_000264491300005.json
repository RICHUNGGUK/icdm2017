Previous algorithms show good localization performances for iris images captured in the ideal conditions. However, in practice, the quality of iris image is greatly influenced by luminance, eyelashes, hair or glasses frame, which will cause mislocalization. In order to improve the robustness of iris localization, this paper proposes a new localization algorithm based on the radial symmetry transform, in which the radial symmetry characteristic of the pupil is utilized to realize iris localization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently avoid the interference of luminance and other bad conditions, and realize robust precise localization in a real-time system.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST IRIS LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM VIA RADIAL SYMMETRY FOR NONIDEAL CAPTURING CONDITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300005"}
