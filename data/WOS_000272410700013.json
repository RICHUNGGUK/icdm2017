Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes two models: Model A: KS process is constructed by capturing personal psychological feelings; and Model B: KS process is not only constructed by personal psychological feelings but also takes into consideration other people's decisions. By comparing the two knowledge-sharing models' predictability performance, the authors are able to characterize the process of KS. Findings - The results show that different companies require different models. On average, Model B with game concept has lower predictive accuracy than the Model A without game concept. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides practical implications for manager to frame effective KS policies and also suggests future studies to improve measurement. Originality/value - The values of this paper are: provide a methodology to determine whether individuals analyze decisions of others in making KS decisions; test the predictive ability of GT analysis in a KS modeling, and build a single-instance two-person game to characterize individuals' tacit KS behavior.", "paper_title": "Knowledge sharing: game and reasoned action perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000272410700013"}
