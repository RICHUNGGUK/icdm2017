The framework uses two collaborative LS functions and a regional adaptive clustering algorithm to delineate the bladder wall for the wall thickness measurement on a voxel-by-voxel basis. It is significantly different from most of the pre-existing bladder segmentation work in four aspects. First of all, while most previous work only segments the inner border of the wall or at most manually segments the outer border, our framework extracts both the inner and outer borders automatically except that the initial seed point is given by manual selection. Secondly, it is adaptive to T(1)-weighted images with decreased intensities in urine, as opposed to enhanced intensities in T(2)-weighted scenario and computed tomography. Thirdly, by considering the image global intensity distribution and local intensity contrast, the defined image energy function in the framework is more immune to inhomogeneity effect, motion artifacts and image noise. Finally, the bladder wall thickness is measured by the length of integral path between the two borders which mimic the electric field line between two iso-potential surfaces. The framework was tested on six datasets with comparison to the well-known Chan-Vese (C-V) LS model. Five experts blindly scored the segmented inner and outer borders of the presented framework and the C-V model. The scores demonstrated statistically the improvement in detecting the inner and outer borders.", "paper_title": "A Coupled Level Set Framework for Bladder Wall Segmentation With Application to MR Cystography", "paper_id": "WOS:000276308800027"}
