The main idea of the approach is to combine the high convergence rate of the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a local search approach based on rough sets that is able to spread the nondominated solutions found, so that a good distribution along the Pareto front is achieved. Our proposed approach is able to converge in several test functions of 10 to 30 decision variables with only 4,000 fitness function evaluations. This is a very low number of evaluations if compared with today's standards in the specialized literature. Our proposed approach was validated using nine standard test functions commonly adopted in the specialized literature. Our results were compared with respect to a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that is representative of the state-of-the-art in the area: the NSGA-II.", "paper_title": "A new proposal for multiobjective optimization using particle swarm optimization and rough sets theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400049"}
