This approach relies on two key points. The first is a learning algorithm that uses a measure of the confusion between the categories to be recognized. The second is a selection scheme that discards weak or redundant decision rules, keeping only the most relevant subset. An experimental study, based on real world data, is then described. It analyzes the improvements achieved by these points first when used independently, then when combined together.", "paper_title": "On determining suitable subsets of decision rules using Choquet integral", "paper_id": "WOS:000254293000001"}
