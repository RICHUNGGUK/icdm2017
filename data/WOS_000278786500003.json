However, data exchange and synchronisation need to be available across different sites and different database systems. In this article we present our data consistency service CONStanza and give details on how we achieve relaxed update synchronisation between different database implementations. The integration in existing Grid environments is one of the major goals of the system. Performance tests have been executed following a factorial approach. Detailed experimental results and a statistical analysis are presented to evaluate the system components and drive future developments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
