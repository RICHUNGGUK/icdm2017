The global state following the transient fault is considered to be the initial state for subsequent execution. An adaptive self-stabilizing algorithm changes its behavior based on characteristics of the initial state. This paper presents an asynchronous, adaptive, self-stabilizing algorithm for any non-interactive task. The algorithm adapts its output stabilization time in relation to the extent of faulty information in the initial state. The paper's presentation emphasizes composition techniques that leverage several self-stabilizing components from previous research, resulting in a concise description of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Parallel composition for time-to-fault adaptive stabilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000248055800004"}
