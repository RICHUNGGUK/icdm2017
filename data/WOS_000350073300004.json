More specifically, for arbitrary coprime polynomials f, g is an element of Z[X, y] and an arbitrary polynomial h is an element of Z[X, y], each of total degree less than n and with integer coefficients of absolute value less than 2(tau), we show that each of the following problems can be solved in a deterministic way with a number of bit operations bounded by (O) over tilde (n(6) + n(5)tau), where we ignore polylogarithmic factors in n and tau: The computation of isolating regions in C-2 for all complex solutions of the system f = g = 0, the computation of a separating form for the solutions of f = g =0, the computation of the sign of h at all real valued solutions of f = g =0, and the computation of the topology of the planar algebraic curve e defined as the real valued vanishing set of the polynomial f. Our bound improves upon the best currently known bounds for the first three problems by a factor of n(2) or more and closes the gap to the state-of-the-art randomized complexity for the last problem.
