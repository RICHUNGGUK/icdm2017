The quasi unit disk graph model contains all edges shorter than a parameter d between 0 and 1 and no edges longer than 1. We show that-in comparison to the cost known for unit disk graphs-the complexity results of geographic routing in this model contain the additional factor 1/d(2). We prove that in quasi unit disk graphs flooding is an asymptotically message-optimal routing technique, we provide a geographic routing algorithm being most efficient in dense networks, and we show that classic geographic routing is possible with the same asymptotic performance guarantees as for unit disk graphs if d >= 1/root 2.", "paper_title": "Ad hoc networks beyond unit disk graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394500012"}
