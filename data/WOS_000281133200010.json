The objective is to find the optimal sequence of jobs and the optimal resource allocation separately. We concentrate on two goals separately, namely, minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total completion time, total absolute differences in completion times and total resource cost; minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total waiting time, total absolute differences in waiting times and total resource cost. We analyse the problem with two different processing time functions. For each combination of these, we provide a polynomial time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence and resource allocation.
