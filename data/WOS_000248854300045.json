The shape derivative measures the sensitivity of boundary perturbations while the topological derivative measures the sensitivity of creating a small hole in the interior domain. The combination of these two derivatives yields an efficient algorithm which has more flexibility in shape changing and may escape from a local optimal. Examples on finding the optimal shapes for maximal band gaps in photonic crystal and acoustic drum problems are demonstrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
