Thus far, only very few ECP applications have been reported. Here, we further investigate the ECP methodology by studying complex classification problems. The analysis involves multi-target data sets with systematically organized subsets of compounds having distinct or overlapping target activities and, in addition, data sets containing classes of specifically active compounds with different mechanism-of-action. In systematic classification trials focusing, on individual compound subsets or mechanistic classes, ECP calculations utilizing numerical descriptors achieve moderate to high sensitivity, dependent on the data set, and consistently : high specificity. Accurate ECP predictions are already obtained on the basis of very small learning sets with only three,positive: training instances which distinguishes the ECP approach from many other machine learning techniques.", "paper_title": "Classification of Compounds with Distinct or Overlapping Multi-Target Activities and Diverse Molecular Mechanisms Using Emerging Chemical Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000321074700003"}
