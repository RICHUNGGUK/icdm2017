They are aggregation operators that use the main characteristics of the fuzzy OWA (FOWA) operator, the induced OWA (IOWA) operator and the generalized (or quasi-arithmetic) OWA operator. Therefore, they use uncertain information represented in the form of fuzzy numbers, generalized (or quasi-arithmetic) means and order inducing variables. The main advantage of these operators is that they include a wide range of mean operators such as the FOWA, the IOWA, the induced Quasi-OWA, the fuzzy IOWA, the fuzzy generalized mean and the fuzzy weighted quasi-arithmetic average (Quasi-FWA). We further generalize this approach by using Choquet integrals, obtaining the fuzzy induced quasi-arithmetic Choquet integral aggregation (Quasi-FICIA) operator. We also develop an application of the new approach in a strategic multi-person decision making problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
