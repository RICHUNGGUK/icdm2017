A PMRI scanner retains all the benefits of acquiring MRI data at low field, but with the higher signal of the polarizing field. Rapidly and efficiently ramping the polarizing coil without disturbing the data acquisition is one of the major challenges of PMRI. With our modular hardware design, we successfully ramp the 0.4-T polarizing coil of a wrist-sized PMRI scanner at up to 100 T/s without causing image artifacts or otherwise degrading data acquisition.", "paper_title": "Rapid polarizing field cycling in magnetic resonance imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000234233600008"}
