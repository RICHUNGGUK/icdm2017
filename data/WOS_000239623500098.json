In this paper, the confusion is improved in terms of chaotic permutation with ergodic matrix, and the diffusion is implemented through a new chaotic dynamic system incorporated with a S-box algebraic operation and a 'XOR plus mod' operation, which greatly enhances the practical security of the system with a little computational expense, and a key scheme is also proposed. Experimental and theoretical results also show that our scheme is efficient and very secure.", "paper_title": "A new chaos-based encryption method for color image", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500098"}
