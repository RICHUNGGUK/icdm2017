The roadside APs are able to improve the bandwidth of VANETs. In this paper, we design a Multicast Network Coding (MCNC) method to aggregate and disseminate data in VANETs. It is appropriate for the areas where APs have been deployed but cannot cover the all range of vehicles movement. Data transmission is divided into 3 stages in MCNC. Network coding, multicast aggregating, and decoding are implemented in the 3 stages, respectively. Simulation results show that MCNC is able to cut down 2/3 overhead messages of Epidemic when the cover area of the APs is only 1/5. Its loss rate and delay are lower than the other methods. We also discuss its benefit for the deployment of VANETs.", "paper_title": "MCNC: Data Aggregation and Dissemination in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks Using Multicast Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000326742000001"}
