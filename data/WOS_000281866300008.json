This article considers radio over fiber links as an essential part of the DAS, connecting the central unit with the remote antenna units. In particular, we analyze and discuss delays and nonlinearities stemming from the RoF links. In addition, we study the compensation for these impairments. Our studies indicate that the RoF links are a viable and cost-effective solution for implementing the DAS, although some of the RoF link non-idealities require compensation.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF AND COMPENSATION FOR NON-IDEAL ROF LINKS IN DAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281866300008"}
