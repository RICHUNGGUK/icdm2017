The EiCP has a solution if and only if these NLP formulations have zero global optimal value. We reformulate the NLP formulations as DC programs which can be efficiently solved by a DC algorithm. Some preliminary numerical results illustrate the good performance of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient DC programming approaches for the asymmetric eigenvalue complementarity problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000320925500010"}
