Steganalysis is a technique to discover the presence of hidden embedded information in a given object. Each steganalysis method is composed of feature extraction and feature classification components. Using features that are more sensitive to information hiding yields higher success in steganalysis. So far, several steganalysis methods have been presented which extract some features from DCT or wavelet coefficients of images. Multi-scale and time-frequency localization of an image is offered by wavelets. However, wavelets are not effective in representing the images in different directions. Contourlet transform addresses this problem by providing two additional properties, directionality and anisotropy. The present paper offers an universal approach to steganalysis called CBS, which uses statistical moments of contourlet coefficients as features for analysis. After feature extraction, a non-linear SVM classifier is applied to classify cover and stego images. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental investigations. The proposed steganalysis method is compared with two well-known steganalyzers against typical steganography methods. The results showed the superior performance of our method.", "paper_title": "CBS: Contourlet-Based Steganalysis Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000282051500010"}
