Simple equations and models for analysis and design of a DMS are presented and extracted. Different configurations of DMS-CPMLs are introduced, and their performances in crosstalk reduction are compared. Finally, the best configuration for far-end crosstalk reduction is fabricated and tested. A maximum of 35 dB reduction in far-end and 38 dB reduction in near-end crosstalk are achieved. The signal integrity performance of the structure is also verified by eye-diagrams. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
