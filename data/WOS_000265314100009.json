Experimental data was used to identify the changing kinetic parameters of the model as acclimatization progresses. It was found that only one key parameter, the specific biomass growth rate function, changed during the acclimatization process. Therefore, an acclimatization model was proposed to explain the changes of this parameter. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
