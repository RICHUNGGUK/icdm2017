The nature of the broad and intense electronic absorptions of H-2(TAzP) in the range of 500-1450 nm is clearly revealed. In addition, different types of pi ->pi* electronic transitions associated with different absorption bands are revealed to correspond to different electron density moving direction between peripherally-fused ten electron-pi-conjugated azulene units and the central eighteen electron-pi-conjugated porphyrin core. Introduction of electron-donating groups onto the periphery of H-2(TAzP) macrocycle is revealed to be able to lead to novel NIR dyes such as H-2[alpha-(NH2)(4)TAzP] and H-2[epsilon(NH2)(4)TAzP] with regulated UV-Vis-NIR absorption bands covering the full solar spectrum in the range of 300-2500 nm. In addition, the basic designing rules for panchromatic organic functional molecules based on tetrapyrrole derivatives are proposed together with the suggestions in experiments, including low molecular symmetry and narrow gap between HOMO and LUMO/LUMO+1, which will be helpful toward the design and synthesis of new panchromatic organic functional molecules.
