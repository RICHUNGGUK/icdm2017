A fish-eye has complete field of view along a route. We mount the fish-eye camera on a vehicle and estimate its pose initially with respect to the vehicle by referring to 3D structure lines of such as roads and buildings on a street. Sampling curves are then allocated in the image frame for dynamic scanning route scenes as the vehicle moves forward. The accurate alignment of the curves ensures less distortion of shapes in the scene tunnel image. We also analyze the scanned results and evaluate alignments of the sampling curves to improve the scanning. The resulting scene tunnel is a continuous archive of the entire route in a city, which can be used for environment visualization and assessment, Internet based virtual navigation, city information indexing, etc.", "paper_title": "Employing a fish-eye for scene tunnel scanning", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300052"}
