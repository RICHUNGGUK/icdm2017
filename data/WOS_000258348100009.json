In 2007, Lu, Cao, Wang, and Sun proposed a secure muting protocol with anonymity property and key exchange for ad hoc networks. However, in this paper, it is demonstrated that the so-called secure, anonymous key exchange protocol introduced by Lu et al. is vulnerable to a passive attack and, as a result, the anonymity property of the protocol may be compromised. A simple improvement is suggested to eliminate the vulnerability.", "paper_title": "Improving the security of a secure anonymous routing protocol with authenticated key exchange for ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258348100009"}
