Interoperability allows the enterprises in the supply chain to collaborate in an efficient manner while preserving their own identities and their own ways of doing business through mechanisms that act as facilitators. However, there are few real practical examples of supply chain interoperability that can be used as a reference. In this paper, we present a framework that can facilitate supply chain interoperability and an example of how it can be applied to a food supply chain.", "paper_title": "SCIF-IRIS framework: a framework to facilitate interoperability in supply chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000311781200007"}
