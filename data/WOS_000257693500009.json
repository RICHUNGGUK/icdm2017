The clustering characteristic of the fuzzy neural network has been improved greatly. But the study of the fuzzy clustering neural network is still in the initial stage, and there are still lots of open problems. The structure optimization of the fuzzy clustering neural network is one of the key issues that needs to be solved. In this paper, we design a structure optimized fuzzy clustering neural network model based on the grid and density and apply it in the clustering of the social development level. By doing this, we can solve the uncertain problems of the class number and can accelerate the speed of the clustering.", "paper_title": "The structure optimized fuzzy clustering neural network model and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500009"}
