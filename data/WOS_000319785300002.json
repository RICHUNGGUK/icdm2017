A more realistic one is actually the Probabilistic Network Model (PNM). Therefore, we study the Snapshot Data Aggregation (SDA) problem, the Continuous Data Aggregation (CDA) problem, and their achievable capacities for probabilistic WSNs under both the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) node distribution model and the Poisson point distribution model in this paper. First, we partition a network into cells and use two vectors to further partition these cells into equivalent color classes. Subsequently, based on the partitioned cells and equivalent color classes, we propose a Cell-based Aggregation Scheduling (CAS) algorithm for the SDA problem in probabilistic WSNs. Theoretical analysis of CAS and the upper bound capacity of the SDA problem show that the achievable capacities of CAS are all order optimal in the worst case, the average case, and the best case. For the CDA problem in probabilistic WSNs, we propose a Level-based Aggregation Scheduling (LAS) algorithm. LAS gathers the aggregation values of continuous snapshots by forming a data aggregation/transmission pipeline on the segments and scheduling all the cell-levels in a cell-level class concurrently. By theoretical analysis of LAS and the upper bound capacity of the CDA problem, we prove that LAS also successfully achieves order optimal capacities in all the cases. The extensive simulation results further validate the effectiveness of CAS and LAS.
