Their main properties, such as solution existence and uniqueness, are characterized by first-order formulae. It is shown that testing solution existence is Pi(1)-complete, while solution uniqueness and existence of a least and of a greatest solution are all Pi(2)-complete problems The families of languages defined by components of unique. least and greatest solutions of such systems are shown to coincide with the classes of recursive, recursively enumerable and co-recursively enumerable sets, respectively (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
