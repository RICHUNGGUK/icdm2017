The lack of an efficient index that can simultaneously handle both the textual and spatial aspects of the documents makes existing geographic search engines inefficient in answering geographic queries. In this paper, we propose an efficient index, called IR-tree, that together with a top-k document search algorithm facilitates four major tasks in document searches, namely, 1) spatial filtering, 2) textual filtering, 3) relevance computation, and 4) document ranking in a fully integrated manner. In addition, IR-tree allows searches to adopt different weights on textual and spatial relevance of documents at the runtime and thus caters for a wide variety of applications. A set of comprehensive experiments over a wide range of scenarios has been conducted and the experiment results demonstrate that IR-tree outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for geographic document searches.", "paper_title": "IR-Tree: An Efficient Index for Geographic Document Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000287586100008"}
