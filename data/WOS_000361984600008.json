A two-stage track-and-hold (T/H) structure enables high input bandwidth and low power consumption at the same time. A sampling clock duty cycle control technique, which allocates more tracking time to the bandwidth-limited second T/H stage, facilitates high sampling rates. A digital offset correction scheme compensates both random and systematic offsets due to process variation and T/H amplifier gain nonlinearity, simultaneously. Two test-chip prototypes were fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. Experimental results of a standalone ADC chip demonstrate 3.8 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 7.5 GS/s. The figure-of-merit (FOM) of the standalone ADC is 0.49 pJ/conversion-step. The second test chip combines two ADCs together in order to demonstrate a time-interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) for use in high-speed backplane receivers. The TI-ADC operates at 10.24 GS/s while achieving 3.5 ENOB and 0.65 pJ/conversion-step FOM.", "paper_title": "A 7.5 GS/s flash ADC and a 10.24 GS/s time-interleaved ADC for backplane receivers in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361984600008"}
