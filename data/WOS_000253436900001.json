We use a paper based analysis and a partial implementation to further the development of a computational cognitive model for disturbance management in anaesthesia. We suggest that our data analysis pattern may be used for the analysis of behavioural data describing cognitive and observable events in other complex dynamic domains. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
