Lately, endowing the functions of GFNs with the structure of nonlinear substitution followed by linear diffusion (substitution-diffusion. SD) has received a great deal of attention. In this contribution, we prove tight lower bounds on the number of differentially and linearly active S-boxes for 3-line GFNs with double SD-functions where two SD-structures are applied one after another. We also show 8-round impossible differentials for 3-line GFNs with bijective functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proportion of active S-boxes in all S-boxes for such GFNs is by up to 14% higher than that for 4-line GFNs with double SD-functions, when instantiated with MDS matrices. This indicates that, rather surprisingly, the 3-line GFNs can be more efficient in practice than those with 4 lines. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
