In an inner triangulated plane graph, every inner face is a triangle although the outer face is not necessarily a triangle. In this paper, we first obtain a sufficient condition for an inner triangulated plane graph G to have an open rectangle-of-influence drawing; the condition is expressed in terms of a labeling of angles of a subgraph of G. We then present an O(n (1.5)/log n)-time algorithm to examine whether G satisfies the condition and, if so, construct an open rectangle-of-influence drawing of G on an (n-1)x(n-1) integer grid, where n is the number of vertices in G.", "paper_title": "Open Rectangle-of-Influence Drawings of Inner Triangulated Plane Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264602600008"}
