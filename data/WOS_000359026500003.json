Such sensors can periodically rotate to monitor nearby objects in order to achieve temporal coverage. Specifically, an object is said to be delta(i)-time covered if it can be monitored by R&D sensors for at least delta(i) portion in each period, where 0 < delta(i) <= 1. Given a set of heterogeneous objects with different delta(i) values, the paper formulates a generalized R&D sensor deployment (GRSD) problem. It determines how to use the minimum number of R&D sensors to accomplish temporal coverage by letting each object be delta(i)-time covered. The GRSD problem is proven to be NP-hard, and an efficient heuristic is developed based on the locations and coverage demands of objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GRSD heuristic significantly reduces the number of deployed sensors compared with existing methods, under various simulation scenarios.
