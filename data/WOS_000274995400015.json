Traditional dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) fails to accurately address the impact of scaling on system power consumption as the leakage power increases exponentially. The combination of DVS and adaptive body biasing (ABB) is an effective technique to jointly optimize dynamic and leakage energy dissipation. In this paper, we propose an optimal soft real-time loop scheduling and voltage assignment algorithm, loop scheduling and voltage assignment to minimize energy, to minimize both dynamic and leakage energy via DVS and ABB. Voltage transition overhead has been considered in our approach. We conduct simulations on a set of digital signal processor benchmarks based on the power model of 70 nm technology. The simulation results show that our approach achieves significant energy saving compared to that of the integer linear programming approach.", "paper_title": "Dynamic and Leakage Energy Minimization With Soft Real-Time Loop Scheduling and Voltage Assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000274995400015"}
