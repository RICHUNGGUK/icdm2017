Given the importance of financial information and the inherent danger introduced by these services, we present in this article an architecture based on additive homomorphic cryptosystems and secret sharing schemes to store information securely while still allowing fast aggregation queries at an outsourced untrusted cloud server. The proposal was evaluated in terms of security, server load, amount of user interaction, computational load at the acquiring terminal and computational load at the untrusted server.", "paper_title": "Secure and Fast Aggregation of Financial Data in Cloud-Based Expense Tracking Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000309340700005"}
