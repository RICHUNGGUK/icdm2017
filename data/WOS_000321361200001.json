However, it is difficult to modify or change an application for a stationary sensor node after installation in the field. Furthermore, there is a limit to installation after developing and testing a new sensor node if it needs to reconfigure the software and hardware of the existing sensor node. Therefore, not only is software reconfiguration needed but also dynamic hardware reconfiguration for various changes in requirements, such as sensor type, communication bandwidth, quality of service, or reduced power consumption depending on the changing environment and requirements of users. This paper proposes a specially designed stationary node called a SMART (system management architecture for reconfigurable technology) node, which is capable of dynamic reconfiguration of the various sensing functions or communication protocols. The SMART node can provide suitable service and change the communication protocol according to various surroundings and user requirements.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Reconfigurable Hub as a Stationary Node in a Hybrid Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000321361200001"}
