This is based on, and proved by, multiple applications of the Reversed Compound Agent Theorem (RCAT) and can describe multi-way synchronizations (seen as chains of pairwise synchronizations) that occur in a prescribed order. The length of the sequence is unbounded but finite with probability 1. Several applications are given to illustrate the methodology, which include various modes of resets in queueing networks with negative customers. In particular, it is shown that there is a type of reset that can propagate further transitions in a chain actively. Furthermore, a number of completely new product-form models, for example, where the transitions in a chain are non-homogeneous, are given.", "paper_title": "Product-Forms in Multi-Way Synchronizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000344649500008"}
