This paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using pornographic web materials as a case study, the authors have developed an effective filtering solution that uses machine intelligence to perform offline web page classification into allowed and disallowed web pages. Findings - The results are stored in a database for fast online retrieval whenever access to a web page is requested. Practical implications - The separation between offline classification and online filtering ensures fast blocking decisions are made from the user's viewpoint. Originality/value - There is an urgent and continued need for effective measures against the proliferation of objectionable materials on the web. In this paper, the authors describe a possible solution in the form of a complete working system. Future research will focus on adding appropriate modules to tackle other types of objectionable materials than the type described. The basic framework, however, should be applicable to a wide range of materials.", "paper_title": "XFighter: an intelligent web content filtering system", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687400010"}
