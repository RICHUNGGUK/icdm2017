We consider the model introduced by von Rickenbach et al. (2005), in which each wireless node is represented by a point in Euclidean space on which is centered a transmission range represented by a ball, and edges in the corresponding graph are symmetric. The problem is NP-complete in two or more dimensions (Buchin 2008), and no polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known. We show how to solve the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad hoc networks. If nodes are represented by a set P of n points selected uniformly and independently at random over a d-dimensional rectangular region, then the topology given by the closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of P has O(log n) maximum interference with high probability and O(1) expected interference. We extend the first bound to a general class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability distributions. We present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from this class; this is the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound on expected maximum interference. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Devroye and Morin (2012) relating the maximum interference of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree to the optimal maximum interference attainable.", "paper_title": "Bounding Interference in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks With Nodes in Random Position", "paper_id": "WOS:000360067600005"}
