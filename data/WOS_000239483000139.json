Therefore in this paper, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy using multiple neural networks is proposed. Instead of using a single neural network as a model, multiple neural networks are developed and combined to model the nonlinear process and then used in NMPC. The proposed technique is applied to water level control in a conic water tank. Application results demonstrate that the proposed technique can significantly improve both setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection performance.", "paper_title": "A nonlinear model predictive control strategy using multiple neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000139"}
