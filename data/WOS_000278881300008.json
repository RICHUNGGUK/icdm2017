In any realistic situation, however, there may exist \"exogenously fixed\" or non-discretionary factors that are beyond the control of a DMU's management, which also need to be considered. In this paper, Banker's definition of scale elasticity and returns to scale is modified so that it includes the non-discretionary factors, as well. Then, an efficient algorithm which is capable of determining scale elasticity in the existence of non-discretionary factors is provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
