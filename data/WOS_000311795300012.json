The proposed model defines contextual state transitions from the joint configuration of the children to the parent nodes. We argue that the bottom-up context postulates different probabilistic assumptions with respect to a top-down approach, leading to different representational capabilities. We discuss classes of applications that are best suited to a bottom-up approach. In particular, the bottom-up context is shown to better correlate and model the co-occurrence of substructures among the child subtrees of internal nodes. A mixed memory approximation is introduced to factorize the joint children-to-parent state transition matrix as a mixture of pairwise transitions. The proposed approach is the first practical bottom-up generative model for tree-structured data that maintains the same computational class of its top-down counterpart. Comparative experimental analyses exploiting synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model can deal with deep structures better than a top-down generative model. The model is also shown to better capture structural information from real-world data comprising trees with a large out-degree. The proposed bottom-up model can be used as a fundamental building block for the development of other new powerful models.", "paper_title": "Compositional Generative Mapping for Tree-Structured Data-Part I: Bottom-Up Probabilistic Modeling of Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000311795300012"}
