The popular Approximate Membership Extraction (AME) provides a full coverage to the true matched substrings from a given document, but many redundancies cause a low efficiency of the AME process and deteriorate the performance of real-world applications using the extracted substrings. The AML problem targets at locating nonoverlapped substrings which is a better approximation to the true matched substrings without generating overlapped redundancies. In order to perform AML efficiently, we propose the optimized algorithm P-Prune that prunes a large part of overlapped redundant matched substrings before generating them. Our study using several real-word data sets demonstrates the efficiency of P-Prune over a baseline method. We also study the AML in application to a proposed web-based join framework scenario which is a search-based approach joining two tables using dictionary-based entity recognition from web documents. The results not only prove the advantage of AML over AME, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our search-based approach.", "paper_title": "AML: Efficient Approximate Membership Localization within a Web-Based Join Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000314188900007"}
