While this approach has been previously described and advocated, it is scarcely used in practice because of a lack of high-level construction algorithms and accompanying implementations. We present in this paper a dimension-independent extrusion algorithm permitting us to construct from any (n-1)-dimensional linear cell complex represented as a generalised map, an n-dimensional one by assigning to each (n-1)-cell one or more intervals where it exists along the nth dimension. We have implemented the algorithm in C++11 using CGAL, made the source code publicly available and tested it in experiments using real-world 2D GIS data sets which were extruded to construct up to 5D models.", "paper_title": "A dimension-independent extrusion algorithm using generalised maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000359723200005"}
