In this field, neural network (NN) approaches could improve prediction performance handling in their inputs additional information. In this contribution we propose a jump NN prediction algorithm (horizon 30 min) that exploits not only past CGM data but also ingested carbohydrates information. The NN is tuned on data of 10 type 1 diabetics and then assessed on 10 different subjects. Results show that predictions of glucose concentration are accurate and comparable to those obtained by a recently proposed NN approach (Zecchin et al. (2012) [26]) having higher structural and algorithmical complexity and requiring the patient to announce the meals. This strengthen the potential practical usefulness of the new jump NN approach.
