The main difference with the previous approaches is that we do not make use of any embedding into the Jacobian of a well-suited curve. We apply this algorithm to the Weil restriction of elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves over small degree extension fields. In particular, our attack can solve an elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem defined over F(q3) in heuristic asymptotic running time (O) over tilde (q(4/3)); and an elliptic problem over F(q4) or a genus 2 problem over F(q2) in heuristic asymptotic running time (O) over tilde (q(3/2)).
