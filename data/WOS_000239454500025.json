The existing metrics cannot sufficiently identify the real cost on tabular microdata anonymization. We define a new cost metric that can be used for k-anonymization with the data generalization approach. The metric is more reasonable than the existing ones as it considers generalization range and range ratio rather than generalization height or height ratio, and the contribution of an attribute to the whole tuple rather than the amount of suppression cells. It can be used in most k-anonymity models for computing more precise anonymity costs.", "paper_title": "Towards a more reasonable generalization cost metric for k-anonymization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454500025"}
