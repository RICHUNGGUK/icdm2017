Solid knowledge of normal development of torsional relationships is essential for treating musculoskeletal problems. As a prerequisite, a normal reference, meaning an objective and quantitative standard of measurement, must be available for comparison prior to making a suitable decision. The aim of this paper is to update normal goniometric values that could be used as a reference for clinical analysis and to discover unknown compensatory mechanisms between the involved segments. A systematic and coherent database made from almost 900 measurements of different parameters has been studied using a process of support vector data description (SVDD) to achieve our outlined targets. The aim is to produce updated decision-making support for clinicians working in the biomechanical exploration of the lower extremities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
