[1995] showed that for any set of n points in R-d, a (1 + epsilon)-spanner with diameter at most 2 (respectively, 3) and O(n log n) edges (respectively, O(n log log n) edges) can be built in O(n log n) time. Moreover, it was shown in Arya et al. [1995] and Narasimhan and Smid [2007] that for any k >= 4, one can build in O(n(log n)2(k) alpha(k)(n)) time a (1+epsilon)-spanner with diameter at most 2k and O(n2(k)alpha(k)(n)) edges. The function alpha(k) is the inverse of a certain function at the left perpendicular k/2right perpendicular th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy, where alpha(0)(n) = inverted right perpendicular n/2inverted left perpendicular, alpha(1)(n) = inverted right perpendicular root n inverted left perpendicular, alpha(2)(n) = inverted right perpendicular log n inverted left perpendicular, alpha(3)(n) = inverted right perpendicular log log n inverted left perpendicular, alpha(4)(n) = log* n, alpha(5)(n) = left perpendicular 1/2 log* n right perpendicular,..., etc. It is also known [Narasimhan and Smid 2007] that if one allows quadratic time, then these bounds can be improved. Specifically, for any k >= 4, a (1+epsilon)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(nk alpha(k)(n)) edges can be constructed in O(n(2)) time [Narasimhan and Smid 2007]. A major open question in this area is whether one can construct within time O(n log n+ nk alpha(k)(n)) a (1+epsilon)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(nk alpha(k)(n)) edges. In this article, we answer this question in the affirmative. Moreover, in fact, we provide a stronger result. Specifically, we show that for any k >= 4, a (1 + epsilon)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(n alpha(k)(n)) edges can be built in optimal time O(n log n).", "paper_title": "Sparse Euclidean Spanners with Tiny Diameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000321646300009"}
