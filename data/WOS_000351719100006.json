By exploiting prior statistics and sparse characteristics of propagation channels, the Bayesian method provides a more accurate and efficient detection of the channel status information (CSI) than do conventional sparse channel estimation methods that are based on compressive sensing (CS) technologies. Using a reasonable approximation of the system model and a skillfully designed pilot arrangement, the proposed estimation scheme is able to address the Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI) with a relatively low complexity. Moreover, to further reduce the computational cost of the channel estimation, we make some modifications to the BMP algorithm. The modified algorithm can make good use of the group-sparse structure of doubly selective channels and thus reconstruct the CSI more efficiently than does the original BMP algorithm, which treats the sparse signals in the conventional manner and ignores the specific structure of their sparsity patterns. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian estimation has a good performance over rapidly time-varying channels.", "paper_title": "Group-Sparse Channel Estimation using Bayesian Matching Pursuit for OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719100006"}
