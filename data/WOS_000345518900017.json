In this brief, we show that a commonly used scale-sensitive dimension, V-gamma, is much less well-behaved under Minkowski summation than its VC cousin, while the fat-shattering dimension retains some compositional similarity to the VC-dimension. As an application, we analyze the fat-shattering dimension of trigonometric functions and series.", "paper_title": "On the Additive Properties of the Fat-Shattering Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518900017"}
