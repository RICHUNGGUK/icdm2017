We demonstrate that employing this general complexity yields mean squared test error measures over a range of regression problems, which are typically superior to those from conventional node count (but never statistically worse). We also analyze the reason that our new method outperforms the conventional complexity measure and conclude that it forms a decision mechanism that balances both syntactic and semantic information.", "paper_title": "Tikhonov Regularization as a Complexity Measure in Multiobjective Genetic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000352277900001"}
