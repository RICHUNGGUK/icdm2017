In doing so, the use of differential-correlation based joint detection is proposed, which considers not only the height of correlation peak but also its plateau. We show via simulations that the proposed detection algorithm is capable of robustly detecting the start of a frame and its mode against the variation of signal-to-noise ratio, providing a performance advantage over the conventional algorithm.", "paper_title": "Mode and Frame Detection Algorithm for DAB OFDM Receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414000018"}
