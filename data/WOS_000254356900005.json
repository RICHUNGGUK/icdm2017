One of the means how to improve the traffic control is to take into the account more significantly the impact of individual human behaviour. Drivers interact with each other and this leads to the emergence of self-organization processes. Description of self-organization is important for more exact modelling of vehicles movement. To achieve this it is possible to introduce human related parameters into the traffic models. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main human depending parameters influencing the traffic flow and consider the possibility of including them into the traffic control modelling on macroscopic level.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing aspects in transportation and their modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900005"}
