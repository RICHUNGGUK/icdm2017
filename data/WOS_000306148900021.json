The group of pigs in a fasting state and the group of pigs with euglycemic supraphysiological hyperinsulinemia were scanned by positron emission tomography after a single dose of [F-18]FDG tracer. Simultaneously frequent sampling of the dynamic data of [F-18]FDG plasma concentration in artery, portal vein and hepatic vein was obtained. A system approach to the liver and/or the whole-body system by the tools of linear dynamic sysztem theory was used. Three kinds of structural models, single input and single output or multiple outputs and multiple inputs and single output, were identified. Differences between the group of fasting pigs and the group of pigs in euglycemic supraphysiological hyperinsulinemia were identified by estimated parameters of the structural models. The suitability of the structural mathematical models for the estimation of physiologically interpreted parameters from PET was validated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
