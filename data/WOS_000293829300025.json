Sufficient conditions for extinction, nonpersistence in the mean, weak persistence, stochastic permanence and global attractivity are established. The critical number between weak persistence and extinction is obtained. Moreover, some simulation figures are introduced to illustrate the main results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
