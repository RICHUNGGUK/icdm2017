In this context, user interfaces for software downloading must be designed carefully. They should provide usable interactions and support users when deciding whether to accept the software product or not. This work proposes to enrich a common browser interface for software downloading with a reputation system - a mechanism for collecting and presenting user feedback. The reputation system is assessed with a usability study. The authors' results show that positive user rankings are effective in increasing user download acceptances for well-known publishers and common name publishers, as well as in increasing acceptance motivations related to trust aspects. In addition, the presence of the reputation system reduces incoherent user behaviors.", "paper_title": "A Social-Feedback Enriched Interface for Software Download", "paper_id": "WOS:000335162500002"}
