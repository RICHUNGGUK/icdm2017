One key step in designing this custom hardware is bit-width allocation where the known-art faces challenges when dealing with applications from the scientific computing domain, thus motivating the use of computational methods based on Satisfiability-Modulo Theory. Many real-life applications are, however, specified in terms of vectors and matrices which are of sufficient size to make expansion into scalar equations infeasible. The proposed vector-magnitude method and its extension via block vectors enable computational methods to be leveraged in tackling calculations of practically relevant complexity. Application to case studies confirms that through a more compact computational instance, search efficiency is improved leading to tighter bounds and thus smaller bit-widths.", "paper_title": "Computational Vector-Magnitude-Based Range Determination for Scientific Abstract Data Types", "paper_id": "WOS:000295273500011"}
