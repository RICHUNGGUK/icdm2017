In the context of the European project PERSONA, we have developed an activity monitoring sub-system characterized by high modularity, little invasiveness of the environment and good responsiveness. In this paper we first illustrate the functional architecture of the proposed solution from a general point of view, discussing the motivations of the design. Then we describe in details the software components-sensor abstraction and integration layer, human posture classification, activity monitor-and the resulting activity monitoring application, presenting also a performance evaluation.", "paper_title": "Sensor data fusion for activity monitoring in the PERSONA ambient assisted living project", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331900006"}
