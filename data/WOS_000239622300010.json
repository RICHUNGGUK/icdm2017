BioFuice follows a peer-to-peer-like data integration based on bidirectional mappings. Sources and mappings are associated with a domain model to support a semantically meaningful interoperability. BioFuice extends the generic iFuice integration platform which utilizes specific operators for data fusion and workflow-like script programs. BioFuice supports explorative data analysis and query and search capabilities. We outline the integration approach by an illustrating scenario, the architecture of BioFuice and its query interface.", "paper_title": "BioFuice: Mapping-based data integration in bioinformatics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239622300010"}
