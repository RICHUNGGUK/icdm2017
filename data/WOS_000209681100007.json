Unlike previous solutions, the number of users selected in each transmission time interval (TTI) is not considered to be a constant. A statistical approximation of the system throughput matrix is employed to choose the number of users in each TTI. This matrix is constructed once before transmission begins, so the computational complexity is low. An optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal user time allocations. Both an exhaustive search and a suboptimal heuristic search are considered. Results are presented which show that the proposed approach provides better performance than existing schemes.", "paper_title": "A New Multicast Scheduling Scheme for Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100007"}
