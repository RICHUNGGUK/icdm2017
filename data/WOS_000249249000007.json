It is enough if the penetrating objects are detected at some point in their trajectory. If a sensor network guarantees that every penetrating object will be detected by at least k distinct sensors before it crosses the barrier of wireless sensors, we say the network provides k-barrier coverage. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for k-barrier coverage. We propose efficient algorithms using which one can quickly determine, after deploying the sensors, whether the deployment region is k-barrier covered. Next, we establish the optimal deployment pattern to achieve k-barrier coverage when deploying sensors deterministically. Finally, we consider barrier coverage with high probability when sensors are deployed randomly. The major challenge, when dealing with probabilistic barrier coverage, is to derive critical conditions using which one can compute the minimum number of sensors needed to ensure barrier coverage with high probability. Deriving critical conditions for k-barrier coverage is, however, still an open problem. We derive critical conditions for a weaker notion of barrier coverage, called weak k-barrier coverage.", "paper_title": "Barrier coverage with wireless sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000249249000007"}
