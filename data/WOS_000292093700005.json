The fundamental case of linear system solution and related concepts is proposed as example of the different ways to approach a problem using object-oriented programming and procedural approaches. The different points of view shows that the traditional approach adopted to deem the conditioning of a system as well as all existing programs to solve linear systems need to be revised. A brief discussion deals with the possibility of parallelizing programs for personal computers and with interaction of parallel computing and object-oriented programming.
