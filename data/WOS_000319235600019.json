One of the main problems that these applications must face is scalability. These applications usually use a client server model-that cannot support a large number of concurrent requests without using a considerable number of servers. In this paper, we present a full comparative study new hybrid P2P schemes for terrain interactive visualization systems. The performance evaluation results show that the best strategy consists of avoiding the periodical reporting among peer nodes about the current information contained in each node, while using some servers as cache memories specialized by regions of the virtual world. The system throughput achieved with this strategy can be more than three times higher than the hybrid P2P schemes proposed in the literature, significantly improving the scalability of these systems.
