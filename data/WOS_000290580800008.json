In broadcasting networks, the content is sent \"one to many\", so a complete personalisation where the user may select any content is not possible. But using the mobile bidirectional return channel (e.g. UMTS connection) visual targeted advertising can be performed in a simple way: by off-line storing the advertisement for selectively replacing the normal broadcasted advertisement. In fact, these concepts provide powerful methods to increase the value of the service, mainly in mobile environments. In this article we present a novel intelligent content personalisation system for targeted advertising over mobile broadcasting networks and terminals, based on user profiling and clustering, as a new solution where the use of content personalisation represents the competitive advantage over traditional advertising.", "paper_title": "Visual Targeted Advertisement System Based on User Profiling and Content Consumption for Mobile Broadcasting Television", "paper_id": "WOS:000290580800008"}
