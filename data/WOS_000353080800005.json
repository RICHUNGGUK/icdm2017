The centralized control plane structure enables the use of flexible heuristic algorithms for route selection in optical networks. Differentiated routing for various traffic types is used in our previous work. The work presented in this paper further optimizes the energy performance in the whole network by utilizing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for route selection. The trade-off between energy optimization and QoS for high priority traffic is examined and results show an overall improvement in energy performance whilst maintaining satisfactory QoS. Energy savings are obtained on the low priority traffic whilst the QoS for the high priority traffic is not degraded. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
