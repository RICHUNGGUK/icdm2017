In this paper, we propose a strong (n, t, n) VSS which is more efficient than Ham n and Lin's VSS. Using the same approach, we propose a (n, t, n) multi-secret sharing scheme (MSS) to allow shareholders to share n - t + 1 secrets. Also, the proposed (n, t, n) MSS can be modified to include the verifiable feature. All proposed schemes are unconditionally secure and are based on Shamir's (t, n) secret sharing scheme.
