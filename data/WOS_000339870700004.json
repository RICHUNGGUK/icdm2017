An LS with the shortest length is called a minimal logarithmic signature (MLS) that is highly favourable to be used for cryptographic constructions. The MLS conjecture states that every finite simple group has an MLS. Recently, Nikhil Singhi et al. proved the MLS conjecture to be true for some families of simple groups. In this paper, we firstly prove the existence of MLSs for the exceptional groups of Lie type.", "paper_title": "All exceptional groups of lie type have minimal logarithmic signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000339870700004"}
