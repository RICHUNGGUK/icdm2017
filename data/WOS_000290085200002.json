This paper presents an algorithm based on simple heuristics for selection of local guides in MOPSO, named as HSG-MOPSO (Heuristics-based-Selection-of-Guides in MOPSO). In the HSG-MOPSO, the set of potential guides (in a PSO iteration) consists of the non-dominated solutions (which are normally stored in an elite archive) and some specifically chosen dominated solutions. Thus, there are two types of local guides in the HSG-MOPSO, i.e., non-dominated and dominated guides: they are named so as to signify whether the chosen guide is a non-dominated or a dominated solution. In any iteration, a guide, from the set of available guides, is suitably selected for each population member. Some specified proportion of the current population members follow their respective nearest non-dominated guides and the rest follow their respective nearest dominated guides. The proposed HSG-MOPSO is firstly evaluated on a number of multi-objective benchmark problems along with investigations on the controlling parameters of the guide selection algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of two well-known guide selection methods for evolutionary multi-objective optimization, namely the Sigma method and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm-2 (SPEA2) implemented in PSO framework. Finally, the HSG-MOPSO is evaluated on a more involved real world problem, i.e., multi-objective planning of electrical distribution system. Simulation results are reported and analyzed to illustrate the viability of the proposed guide selection method for MOPSO. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
