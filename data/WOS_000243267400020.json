For example, by using the Ritz method, it was found that the modal twisting moments and shear forces violate the natural boundary conditions and that they contain erroneous \"oscillations\". This paper presents the least squares finite difference (LSFD) method for solving the freely vibrating plate problem. It will be shown herein that the modal stress-resultants obtained by the LSFD method satisfy the natural boundary conditions at the free edges without any oscillations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
