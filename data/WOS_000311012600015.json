Due to a large number of combinations of coding modes, the computational burden of Rate distortion optimization (RDO) becomes extremely high in intra prediction. In this paper, we proposed an efficient selective intra block size decision (SIB) that selects the appropriate block size for intra prediction, further proposed fast intra prediction algorithm reduces a number of modes required for RDO that significantly reduces the encoder complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed fast mode decision algorithm reduces the encoding time by up to 68% with negligible video quality degradation.", "paper_title": "Selective Intra Block Size Jecision and Fast Intra Mode Decision Algorithms for H.264/AVC Encoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000311012600015"}
