The method is based on unsupervised clustering and the outputs are visualized with contextual information. Grid implementation is crucial for feasibility. We demonstrate it with a mining run for discovering genes-diseases associations from bibliographic sources and annotated databases. The proposed methodology is in view of a Grid architecture specialized in bioinformatics mining tasks. Some performance considerations are provided.", "paper_title": "Discovering Genes-Diseases Associations From Specialized Literature Using the Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000267835800018"}
