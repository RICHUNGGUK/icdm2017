This surveillance system is composed of a stationary camera and a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera. The stationary camera has a wide field of view and detects fall and wandering events by means of motion-based visual tracking. The PTZ camera then tracks and follows the person who triggered an event using colour-based particle filtering. The purpose of tracking in view of the PTZ camera is to continuously keep the person in the camera view in order to obtain identifying details. Experimental results for event detection and people tracking are presented to demonstrate the proposed cooperative hybrid visual tracking system.", "paper_title": "Cooperative hybrid multi-camera tracking for people surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000262431400005"}
