The case sample analyzed consists of 85 dense mammographic images, originating from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography. Mammograms analyzed contain 100 subtle MC clusters (46 benign and 54 malignant). The tissue surrounding MCs is defined on original and wavelet decomposed images, based on a redundant discrete wavelet transform. Gray-level texture and wavelet coefficient texture features at three decomposition levels are extracted from surrounding tissue regions of interest (ST-ROIs). Specifically, gray-level first-order statistics, gray-level cooccurrence matrices features, and Laws' texture energy measures are extracted from original image ST-ROIs. Wavelet coefficient first-order statistics and wavelet coefficient cooccurrence matrices features are extracted from subimages ST-ROIs. The ability of each feature set in differentiating malignant from benign tissue is investigated using a probabilistic neural network. Classification outputs of most discriminating feature sets are combined using a majority voting rule. The proposed combined scheme achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) of 0.989. Results suggest that MCs' ST texture analysis can contribute to computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.", "paper_title": "Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Analyzing Texture of Tissue Surrounding Microcalcifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000260956800006"}
