The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used as a preprocessing algorithm in order to obtain a modified training database for the posterior learning of the classification tree structure; experimental section shows the results obtained by the new algorithm; comparing these results with those obtained by the classification trees when induced from the original training data we obtain that the new approach performs better or equal according to the Wilcoxon signed rank statistical test.", "paper_title": "K nearest neighbor edition to guide classification tree learning: Motivation and experimental results", "paper_id": "WOS:000236545100005"}
