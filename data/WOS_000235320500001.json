Constraint partitioning is attractive because it leads to much easier subproblems, where each is a significant relaxation of the original problem. Moreover, each subproblem is very similar to the original problem and can be solved by any existing solver with little or no modification. Constraint partitioning, however, introduces global constraints that may be violated when subproblems are evaluated independently. To reduce the overhead in resolving such global constraints, we develop in this paper new conditions and algorithms for limiting the search space to be backtracked in each subproblem. Using a penalty formulation of a MINLP where the constraint functions of the MINLP are transformed into non-negative functions, we present a necessary and sufficient extended saddle-point condition (ESPC) for constrained local minimization. When the penalties are larger than some thresholds, our theory shows a one-to-one correspondence between a constrained local minimum of the MINLP and an extended saddle point of the penalty function. Hence, one way to find a constrained local minimum is to increase gradually the penalties of those violated constraints and to look for a local minimum of the penalty function using any existing algorithm until a solution to the constrained model is found. Next, we extend the ESPC to constraint-partitioned MINLPs and propose a partition-and-resolve strategy for resolving violated global constraints across subproblems. Using the discrete-space ASPEN and the mixed-space MIPS planners to solve subproblems, we show significant improvements on some planning benchmarks, both in terms of the quality of the plans generated and the execution times to find them.
