The next generation of the web, the semantic web, seeks to make information more usable by machines by introducing a more rigorous structure based on ontologies. In this context we try to propose a novel and integrated approach for a semi-automated extraction of ontology-based semantic web from data-intensive web application and thus, make the web content machine-understandable. Our approach is based on the idea that semantics can be extracted by applying a reverse engineering technique on the structures and the instances of HTML-forms which are the most convenient interface to communicate with relational databases on the current data-intensive web application. This semantics is exploited to produce over several steps, a personalised ontology.", "paper_title": "Extracting personalised ontology from data-intensive web application: an HTML forms-based reverse engineering approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000252121100002"}
