Formal approaches like Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) are based on strong mathematical notations and proofs as basis for executable modeling languages. Transforming UML diagrams to executable models that are ready for analysis is significant, and providing an automated technique that can transform these diagrams to a mathematical model such as CPNs avoids the redundancy of writing specifications. The use of UML diagrams in modeling Object Oriented Diagrams (OODs) leads to a large number of interdependent diagrams. It is necessary to preserve the diagrams consistency since they are updated continuously. This research proposes a new structure for the mutual integration between OODs and CPNs modeling languages to support model changes, the proposed integration suggest a new structure (Object Oriented Coloured Petri Nets (OOCPN)) to include set of rules to check and maintain the consistency and integrity of the OOCPN model based on OODs relations.", "paper_title": "Consistent Integration between Object Oriented and Coloured Petri Nets Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000339772400012"}
