However. the conventional method is concerned only with one criterion rather than multi-criteria problems. In addition, the crisp value cannot reflect the ambiguity and the uncertainty in practice. In this paper, we propose the fuzzy criteria competence set analysis. In order to obtain Pareto solutions, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed here. A numerical example with two fuzzy criteria is also used to illustrate the proposed method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
