These companies, in turn, are exerting every effort to develop more efficient churn prediction models for managing customer relationships effectively. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to deal with a high-dimensional large data set for constructing better churn prediction models. The proposed method starts by partitioning a data set into small-sized data subsets, and applies sequential manifold learning to reduce high-dimensional features and give consistent results for combined data subsets. The performance of the constructed churn prediction model using the proposed method is tested using an E-commerce data set by comparing it with other existing methods. The proposed method works better and is much faster for high-dimensional large data sets without the need for retraining the original data set to reduce the dimensions of new test samples.
