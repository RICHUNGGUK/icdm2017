It provides upper bounds for the error of multidimensional numerical integration algorithms for functions belonging to weighted function spaces of Sobolev type. In the present paper, we prove several tractability results for the weighted star-discrepancy. In particular, we obtain rather sharp sufficient conditions under which the weighted star-discrepancy is strongly tractable. The proofs are probabilistic, and use empirical process theory.
