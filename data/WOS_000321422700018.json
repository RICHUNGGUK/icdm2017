The wireless sensor node which consists of mote module and sensor board is designed and fabricated. The construction algorithm of the wireless sensor network is based on self-organizing feature map model. The indoor service robot which has the capabilities to follow human commands and handle emergency is designed and implemented. A location algorithm of the robot based on the wireless sensor network is proposed. Stability of the proposed home monitoring system in longtime monitoring tasks is tested. Experimental results also demonstrate the indoor service robot can improve the capabilities of the wireless sensor network and the home monitoring system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
