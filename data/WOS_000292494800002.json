This study uses the world's top 10 oil firms' data series to find that the combination method outperforms other individual models in out-of-sample forecasting of returns. The results indicate that the forecasting performance of the regression method is superior to individual and simple average models. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
