We study a number of different cases, where we assume that a small amount of knowledge on the network structure is available, or can be approximately estimated. We also present a class of real-life networks that prove to be very resilient on intentional attacks, or equivalently much more difficult to immunize completely than most model scale-free networks.", "paper_title": "Attack strategies on complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300143"}
