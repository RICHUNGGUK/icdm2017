However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction (\"FI\"). Among other methods, constraint logic programming and model checking have been adopted to address the two main problems in telephony FIs: detection and resolution. In this paper, we show that model checking is also suitable to detect FIs in more complex domains and we use Email features as an example. Moreover, FI detection may be simultaneously analyzed by model checking tools. Finally, we analyze the implementation performance against a number of parties and message types using the CPAchecker tool. Model checking reveals a superior performance against constraint programming, for the case of FI detection with FI occurrence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
