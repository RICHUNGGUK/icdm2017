Fuzzy XML databases have been proposed to manage data exchanges among different imprecise and uncertain XML documents. However, data collected from different data sources referring to the same real-world object may conflict. It is the task of the data management system to resolve the conflicts and integrate the data without any interference from a user. In order to integrate data from multiple autonomous fuzzy XML databases, an integration of fuzzy XML data has to be performed. In this paper, we take a first step in a fundamental consolidation of the fuzzy XML data model. In particular, we investigate the integration technique, which is designed to integrate fuzzy XML data collected from different data sources. We develop a basic framework for detecting conflicts and overlaps in fuzzy XML documents. In addition, we propose an approach for reconciling the fuzzy XML data collected from different data sources.
