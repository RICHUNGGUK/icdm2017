Due to limited bandwidth of wireless nodes, a QoS multicast call will be blocked if there does not exist a single multicast tree that has the requested bandwidth, even though there is enough bandwidth in the system to support the call. We propose a new QoS multicast routing scheme that uses multiple trees, The aggregate bandwidth of multiple trees can meet the bandwidth requirement and the delay from the source to the farthest destination node shall not exceed a pre-specified bound. Two strategies for constructing multiple trees are studied. The simulation results show that the new scheme significantly improves the request success rate and makes a better use of network resources,", "paper_title": "Bandwidth guaranteed multi-tree multicast routing in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100021"}
