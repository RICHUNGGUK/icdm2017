A compact representation called a RegionNet summarizes color and geometric features of image regions, and geometric relationships between them. Correlations between color property distributions and geometric features of regions are learned from a database of well-colored photos. A probabilistic factor graph model is used to summarize distributions of color properties and generate an overall probability distribution for color suggestions. Given a new input image, we can generate multiple recolored results which unlike previous automatic results, are both natural and artistic, and compatible with their spatial arrangements.", "paper_title": "Learning Natural Colors for Image Recoloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000344369200031"}
