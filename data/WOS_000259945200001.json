The challenge for the education enterprise now is how to attract learners to their c-learning services. In this study, a technology adoption model is developed to predict the users' intention of adoption and their continued use behavior. The results show significant evidence in support of the hypothesis. The findings indicate that perceptions of relative advantage and compatibility are significantly related to users' intention to use e-learning. Also, the intention is significantly related to their actual use of e-learning. Furthermore, the technology adoption of learners with prior e-learning experience is different from those without prior c-learning experience. These findings may contribute to deeper understanding of e-learning users' perceptions in terms of adoption and continued use behavior. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
