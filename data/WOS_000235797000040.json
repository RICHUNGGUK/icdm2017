In this paper, we consider the estimation of the data model of ICA when Gaussian noise is present and the independent components are time dependent. We derive a simple algorithm combining Gaussian moments and complexity pursuit for noisy ICA. Validity and performance of the described approaches are demonstrated by computer simulations.
