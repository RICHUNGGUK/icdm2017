Different from the conventional applications for QR barcode, the designed algorithm conceals the secret into the QR modules directly by exploiting the error correction capability. General browsers can read the QR content from the QR code via barcode readers; however, only the authorized receiver can further reveal the secret from the QR code directly. The new mechanism can convey a larger secret payload along with adjustment of the QR version and error correction level. Moreover, the blind property allows the receiver to reveal the secret without the knowledge of the embedded position of modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm is secure, efficient and feasible for the low-power QR readers and mobile devices.", "paper_title": "Blind QR Code Steganographic Approach Based upon Error Correction Capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000326920200012"}
