It is a combinatorial game in the sense of Conway but can be seen as a graph searching or chip-firing problem as well. We consider only the impartial version and give a characterization of graphs with maximum degree two that are first player wins. We also show that the second player can win on the complete graph K-n provided n >= 3 and the complete bipartite graph K-2,K-n provided n not equal 1, 3. We give the nim-values for all positions on paths, stars, and also the nim-values for complete bipartite graphs where every vertex needs at most 3 more brushes to fire. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
