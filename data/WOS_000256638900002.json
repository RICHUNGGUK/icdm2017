In this article a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is proposed to describe the nonlinear temperature and voltage dynamic properties of the SOFC system. During the process of modeling, a Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) method is used to determine the nonlinear antecedent parameters, and the linear consequent parameters are identified by a recursive least squares algorithm. The validity and accuracy of modeling are tested by simulations. The simulation results show that it is feasible to establish the dynamic model of SOFC by using the T-S fuzzy identification method.
