Powers, T. Grenager, If multi-agent learning is the answer, what is the question? Artificial Intelligence 171 (7) (2007) 365-377, this issue], the ultimate lens through which the multi-agent teaming framework should be assessed is \"what is the question?\". In this paper, we address this question by presenting challenges motivated by engineering applications and discussing the potential appeal of multi-agent learning to meet these challenges. Moreover, we highlight various differences in the underlying assumptions and issues of concern that generally distinguish engineering applications from models that are typically considered in the economic game theory literature.
