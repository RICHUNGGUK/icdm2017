Concretely, the general form of alpha-resolution principle based on the above lattice-valued logic is equivalently transformed into another simpler lattice-valued logic system. Firstly, the general form of alpha-resolution principle for lattice-valued propositional logic is equivalently transformed into that for lattice-valued propositional logic P(X). A similar conclusion is obtained between the general form of alpha-resolution principle for linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued propositional logic P(X) and that for lattice-valued propositional logic P(X). Secondly, the general form of alpha-resolution principle for lattice-valued first-order logic F(X) is equivalently transformed into that for P(X). Similarly, this conclusion also holds for linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued first-order F(X) and P(X). The presented work provides a key theoretical support for automated reasoning approaches and algorithms in linguistic truth-valued logic, which can further support linguistic information processing for decision making, i.e., reasoning with words.", "paper_title": "General form of alpha-resolution principle for linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532700012"}
