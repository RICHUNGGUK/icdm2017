In conventional IB-LBM schemes, explicit calculation of the force density may produce unsatisfactory noslip boundary condition. This further leads to unphysical streamline penetrations and improper force/torque calculations for the stationary/moving spheres. Following an implicit calculation of the force density, a single Lagrangian velocity correction term is prescribed here to satisfy the no-slip condition within a convergence limit. This formulation is mathematically simple and with the help of flexible number of sub-iteration/forcing, the computational time is significantly reduced. The proposed new version of IB-LBM model is validated with three-dimension flow past stationary and moving spheres, and the results are found in excellent agreement with the data obtained from in-house experiments and previous literatures.
