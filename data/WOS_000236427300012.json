We interviewed their senior managers, heads of departments and employees who have been directly affected in their work. Other sources of information are company documents and publicly available background information. The study examines the benefits of the IOS for both corporations. The research also reveals seven critical success factors for the IOS, namely intensive stimulation, shared vision, cross-organizational implementation team, high integration with internal information systems, inter-organizational business process re-engineering, advanced legacy information system and infrastructure and shared industry standard.
