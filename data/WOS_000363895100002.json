To this end, we use human written, crowdsourced descriptions-plot synopses-of the story conveyed in the video. We obtain such synopses from websites such as Wikipedia and propose various methods to align each sentence of the plot to shots in the video. Thus, the semantic story-based video retrieval problem is transformed into a much simpler text-based search. Finally, we return the set of shots aligned to the sentences as the video snippet corresponding to the query. The alignment is performed by first computing a similarity score between every shot and sentence through cues such as character identities and keyword matches between plot synopses and subtitles. We then formulate the alignment as an optimization problem and solve it efficiently using dynamic programming. We evaluate our methods on the fifth season of a TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and show encouraging results for both the alignment and the retrieval of story events.", "paper_title": "Aligning plot synopses to videos for story-based retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000363895100002"}
