By designing an optimal controller to minimize the energy criterion, the proposed method provides a remarkable descend rate of energy consumption in the trunk-rotation walking mechanism. The proposed algorithm is able to optimize the trunk trajectory by minimizing the energy-related cost function while guaranteeing zero-moment point (ZMP) criterion. Simulations and experimental results show the validity of the method.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficiency-Based Gait Control System Architecture and Algorithm for Biped Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000310139700011"}
