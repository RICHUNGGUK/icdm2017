Our aim is to find a coloring W such that the (maximum) load, l(psi) := max {r(psi), b(psi)}, is minimized. The problem has applications in broadcast WDM communication networks (Ageev et al., 2004). After proving that the general problem is NP-hard we give a polynomial time algorithm for optimal colorings of trees and show that the optimal load is at most m/2 + Delta log(2)n. For graphs with genus g > 0, we show that a coloring with load OPT(1 + o(1)) can be computed in O(n + g)-time, if the maximum degree satisfies Delta = o(m(2) /ng) and an embedding is given. In the general situation we show that a coloring with load at most (3)/(4)m + O(root Delta m) can be found in deterministic polynomial time using a derandomized version of Azuma's martingale inequality. This bound describes the \"typical\" situation: in the random multi-graph model we prove that for almost all graphs, the optimal load is at least (3)/(4)m - root 3mn. Finally, we generalize our results to k-colorings 4 for k > 2.", "paper_title": "On the minimum load coloring problem - Extended abtract", "paper_id": "WOS:000236483500002"}
