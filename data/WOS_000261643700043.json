As a non-redundant sparse representation, contourlet transform can effectively reflect visual characteristics of images, and it can be employed to perceptually capture the difference between images. Motivated by this, this paper first proposes an objective reduced-reference image quality evaluation metric based on contourlet transform. Experiments demonstrate that this new objective metric achieves consistent image quality evaluation results with what gained by subjective evaluation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
