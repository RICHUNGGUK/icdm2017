In this paper, we develop a general purpose molecular dynamics code that runs entirely on a single GPU. It is shown that our GPU implementation provides a performance equivalent to that of fast 30 processor core distributed memory cluster. Our results show that GPUs already provide an inexpensive alternative to such clusters and discuss implications for the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
