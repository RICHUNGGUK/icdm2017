We propose to advance the science in the existing network migration models by considering additional critical factors, including (1) synergistic relationships across multiple technologies, (2) reduction in operational expenditures as a reason to migrate, and (3) implications of local network effects on migration decisions. To this end, we propose a novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the model, we analyze the case study of network migration to two emerging networking paradigms, i.e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We validate our model using extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate the synergistic effects of migration to multiple complementary technologies, and show that a technology migration may be eased by the joint migration to multiple technologies. In particular, we find that migration to SDN can be eased by joint migration to PCE, and that the benefits derived from SDN are best exploited in combination with PCE, than by itself.", "paper_title": "Study of Network Migration to New Technologies Using Agent-Based Modeling Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000360549300005"}
