DEF is that two regions of the whole silhouette divided by the centroid are fitted into two ellipses, respectively. We construct the gait fluctuation as a periodic function which depends on the eccentricities of two halves of the silhouette over time. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to scale, translation, direction of walking and carrying a bag. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
