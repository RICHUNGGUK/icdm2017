We use the windowed Fourier transform to obtain the local wave number information in the vicinity of artificial boundaries, and adopt the operator splitting method to obtain an adaptive local artificial boundary condition. Then reduce the original problem into an initial boundary value problem on the bounded computational domain, which can be solved by the finite difference method. By this numerical method, we observe the surface hopping phenomena of the two-level Schrodinger equation with conical crossings. Several numerical examples are provided to show the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
