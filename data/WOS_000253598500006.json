Spatial discretizations with fourthorder accuracy are derived from interpolation functions locally constructed by both cell-integrated values and point values. These values are coupled and time-integrated by solving fluid equations in the flux forms for the cell-integrated values and in the derivative forms for the point values. The IDO-CF scheme exactly conserves mass, momentum, and energy, retaining the high resolution more than the non-conservative form of the IDO scheme. A direct numerical simulation of turbulence is carried out with comparable accuracy to that of spectral methods. Benchmark tests of Riemann problems and lid-driven cavity flows show that the IDO-CF scheme is immensely promising in compressible and incompressible fluid dynamics studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
