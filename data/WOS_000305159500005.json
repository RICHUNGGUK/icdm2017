Accordingly, questions about the utility, usability and cost of DLs have started to arise, and greater attention is being paid to the quality evaluation of this type of information system. Since DLs are destined to serve user communities, one of the main aspects to be considered in DL evaluation is the user's opinion. The literature on this topic has produced a set of varied criteria to judge DLs from the user's perspective, measuring instruments to elicit users' opinions, and approaches to analyse the elicited data to conclude an evaluation. This paper provides a literature review of the quality evaluation of DLs based on users' perceptions. Its main contribution is to bring together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. In addition, the various studies are discussed, and some challenges to be faced in the future are proposed.", "paper_title": "A review of quality evaluation of digital libraries based on users' perceptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000305159500005"}
