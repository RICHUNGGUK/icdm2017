Yet integrity in RFID has not received much attention as regular computer systems. When we evaluate an identification protocol for an RFID system for anti-counterfeiting, it is important to consider integrity issues. Moreover, many RFID, systems are accessed by multiple level trust parties, which makes comprehensive integrity protection even harder. In this paper, we first propose an integrity model for RFID protocols. Then we use the model to analyze the integrity problems in Squealing Euros protocol. Squealing Euros was proposed by Juels and Pappu for RFID enabled banknotes that will support anti-forgery and lawful tracing yet preserve individual's privacy. We analyze its integrity, we then discuss the problems that arise and propose some solutions to these problems. Then an improved protocol with integrity protection for the law enforcement is constructed, which includes an unforgeable binding between the banknote serial number and the RF ciphertext only readable to law enforcement. This same protocol can be applied in many other applications which require a privacy protecting anti-counterfeiting mechanism.", "paper_title": "An anti-counterfeiting RFID privacy protection protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000247077900011"}
