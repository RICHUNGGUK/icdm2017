Multichannel systems can exploit frequency diversity and increase the reliability. Common frequency-hopping protocols change the channel continuously without consideration of the actual channel quality and require regular frame exchange for synchronization. However, in residential application scenarios, control data traffic occurs only very sporadic. In this letter, we describe an asynchronous wireless multichannel system, which utilizes good channels and avoids unnecessary overhead, but at the same time is able to change the frequency in case of a deep fade. The optimal protocol for the initial connection setup is extended for efficient long-term operation. The hopping sequences are modified based on successful transmissions in the past. The method is evaluated and simulated.", "paper_title": "Frequency Hopping for Indoor Fading Channels With Varying Level of Environmental Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600011"}
