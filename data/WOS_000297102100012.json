It was created to help students understand how earthquakes affect humans and how engineered solutions can mitigate damage. One key component of the website is an innovative internet-based structural simulation program that allows students to design and simulate the behavior of a building model under earthquake loads. The simulation component is coupled with a hands-on activity, where students build the model they have designed using wood dowels and pegboards. The students can then use a small shake table to physically simulate and experimentally verify the performance of their models under the design earthquakes. The simulation component has been calibrated to physical models using materials recommended for construction. The website also includes detailed information on earthquake engineering design, lesson plans for implementation in classrooms, a searchable database providing links to authoritative resources on earthquakes and other natural disasters, and national education standards for STEM subject topics.
