Segmentation of news into stories is one of the key issues for achieving efficient treatment of news-based digital libraries. While the relevance of this research problem is widely recognized in the scientific community, we are in presence of a few established solutions in the field. In our approach, the segmentation is performed in two steps: first, shots are classified by combining three different anchor shot detection algorithms using video information only. Then, the shot classification is improved by using a novel anchor shot detection method based on features extracted from the audio track. Tests on a large database confirm that the proposed system outperforms each single video-based method as well as their combination.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of news videos based on audio-video information", "paper_id": "WOS:000246112200006"}
