A key concern in DRE systems is determining the spatial deployment topology, which is how the software components map to the underlying hardware components. Optimizations, such as placing software components with high-frequency communications on processors that are closer together, can yield a number of important benefits, such as reduced power consumption due to decreased wireless transmission power required to communicate between the processing nodes. Determining a spatial deployment plan across a series of processors that will minimize power consumption is hard since the spatial deployment plan must respect a combination of real-time scheduling, fault-tolerance, resource, and other complex constraints. This article presents a hybrid heuristic/evolutionary algorithm, called ScatterD, for automatically generating spatial deployment plans that minimize power consumption. This work provides the following contributions to the study of spatial deployment optimization for power consumption minimization: (1) it combines heuristic bin-packing with an evolutionary algorithm to produce a hybrid algorithm with excellent deployment derivation capabilities and scalability, (2) it shows how a unique representation of the spatial deployment solution space integrates the heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, and (3) it analyzes the results of experiments performed with data derived from a large-scale avionics system that compares ScatterD with other automated deployment techniques. These results show that ScatterD reduces power consumption by between 6% and 240% more than standard bin-packing, genetic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "ScatterD: Spatial Deployment Optimization with Hybrid Heuristic/Evolutionary Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000296034800002"}
