Specifically, for 0 < m < n, we consider the initial (uniform) random mapping digraph G(n) on n labeled vertices, and we delete (if possible), uniformly and at random, in noncyclic directed edges from G(n) The maximal random digraph consisting of the unicyclic components obtained after cutting the in edges is called the trimmed random mapping and is denoted by G(n)(m). If the number of noncyclic directed edges is less than in, then G(n)(m) consists of the cycles, including loops, of the initial mapping G(n). We consider the component structure of the trimmed mapping G(n)(m). In particular, using the exact distribution we determine the asymptotic distribution of the size of a typical random connected component of G(n)(m) as n, m -> infinity. This asymptotic distribution depends on the relationship between n and in and we show that there are three distinct cases: (i) m = o(root n), (ii) in = beta root n, where beta > 0 is a fixed parameter, and (iii) 64 = o(m). This allows us to study the joint distribution of the order statistics of the normalized component sizes of G(n)(m). When in = o(root n), we obtain the Poisson-Dirichlet(112) distribution in the limit, whereas when root n = o(in) the limiting distribution is Poisson-Dirichlet(l). Convergence to the Poisson-Dirichlet (0) distribution breaks down when in = 0(root n), and in particular, there is no smooth transition from the PD(1/2) distribution to the PD(l) via the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution as the number of edges cut increases relative to it, the number of vertices in G(n).
