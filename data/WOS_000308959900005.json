Feeding such data streams to existing stream systems produces results of unknown quality, which is of paramount concern to monitoring applications. In this paper, we present the claro system that supports stream processing for uncertain data naturally captured using continuous random variables. claro employs a unique data model that is flexible and allows efficient computation. Built on this model, we develop evaluation techniques for relational operators by exploring statistical theory and approximation. We also consider query planning for complex queries given an accuracy requirement. Evaluation results show that our techniques can achieve high performance while satisfying accuracy requirements and outperform state-of-the-art sampling methods.", "paper_title": "CLARO: modeling and processing uncertain data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000308959900005"}
