The content pollution is one of the common attacks that have received little attention in P2P live streaming systems. In this paper. we propose a modeling framework of content pollution in P2P live streaming systems. This model considers both unstructured and structured overlays, and captures the key factors including churns, user interactions. multiple attackers and defensive techniques. The models are verified with simulations and implemented in a real working system, Anysee. We analyze content pollution and its effect in live streaming system. We show that: (1) the impact from content pollution can exponentially increase, similar to the random scanning worms, leading to playback interruption and unnecessary bandwidth consumption; (2) content pollution is influenced by peer cooperation, peer degree and bandwidth in unstructured overlays, and topology breadth in structured ones; (3) the structured overlay is more resilient to content pollution; (4) a hybrid overlay result in better reliability and pollution resistance; (5) hash-based chunk signature scheme is most promising against content pollution.
