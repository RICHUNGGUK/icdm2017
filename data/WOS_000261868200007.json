Only t signers can examine and sign an over-large message on behalf of the whole group, by dividing the whole message into a few readable sub-message blocks: then, each signer needs only examine and sign the designated sub-message block rather than the whole message. Consequently, the load on the signer should be substantially reduced to improve the performance. The proposed scheme is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem, which can reach highly efficient performance and comprehensiveness of security, supporting the practical use of the scheme.
