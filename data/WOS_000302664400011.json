The system combines the different advantages of RFID and face recognition technology. This car electronic system is optimal for an innovative specific application. Not only can the system protect the car, but it can determine responsibility in a car accident. Furthermore, the car electronic system integrates RFID, face recognition, general packet radio service (GPRS), Bluetooth and the global positioning system (GPS). It has been trending the merger goal of digitization. Therefore, it creates a tremendous amount of commercial opportunity.", "paper_title": "MULTI-RECOGNITION COMBINED SECURITY SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT CAR ELECTRONICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400011"}
