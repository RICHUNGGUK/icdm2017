Design/methodology/approach - The paper looks at the mathematical and logical development of human society structure. Findings - Existence of relations with positive imperative modality (obligation) would constitute the skeleton of the system. Negative imperative modality (prohibition) would be the immunological system of protection of the system. Modality permission the muscular system, that gives the necessary flexibility to the system, in as much to the modality faculty its neurocerebral system, because it allows him to make decisions. Transactions of energy, money, merchandise, population, etc. would be the equivalent one to the sanguineous system. These economic transactions and inferential relations, depend, as well, of the existence of a legislative body with their obligations, prohibitions and permissions that regulate them. A Social System may be considered like an alysidal set with an only alysidal element. The authors consider two theories: Enlarged theory and Reduced theory. Originality/value - This paper is a continuation of two previous papers Part I published in Kybernetes, Vol. 41 No. 1/2 and Part II published in Vol. 41 No. 5/6 and develops the theory of deontical impure systems.", "paper_title": "An introduction to alysidal algebra (III)", "paper_id": "WOS:000312434100019"}
