The approach has a very small communication overhead since prior knowledge about neighbor existence is not required. Each node selects a random time out and listens to messages sent by other nodes before the time out expires. Sensor nodes whose sensing area is not fully covered (or fully covered but with a disconnected set of active sensors) when the deadline expires decide to remain active for the considered round and transmit an activity message announcing it. There are four variants in our approach, depending on whether or not withdrawal and retreat messages are transmitted. Covered nodes decide to sleep, with or without transmitting a withdrawal message to inform neighbors about the status. After hearing from more neighbors, active sensors may observe that they became covered and may decide to alter their original decision and transmit a retreat message. Our simulations show a largely reduced message overhead while preserving coverage quality for the ideal MAC/physical layer. Compared to an existing method (based on hello messages followed by retreat ones and where excessive message loss contributed to excessive coverage holes), our approach has shown robustness in a model with collisions and/or a realistic physical layer.", "paper_title": "Localized sensor area coverage with low communication overhead", "paper_id": "WOS:000253983100011"}
