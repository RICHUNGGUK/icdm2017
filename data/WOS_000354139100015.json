From the perspective of multi-objective optimization, this paper presents a novel FOPID controller design method based on an improved multi-objective extremal optimization (MOEO) algorithm for an automatic regulator voltage (AVR) system. The problem of designing FOND controller for AVR is firstly formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with three objective functions including minimization of integral of absolute error (IAE), absolute steady-state error, and settling time. Then, an improved MOEO algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by adopting individual-based iterated optimization mechanism and polynomial mutation (PLM). From the perspective of algorithm design, the proposed MOEO algorithm is relatively simpler than NSGA-II and single-objective evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), chaotic anti swarm (CAS) due to its fewer adjustable parameters. Furthermore, the superiority of proposed MOEO-FOPID condoner to NSGA-II-based FOPID, single-objective evolutionary algorithms-based FOPID controllers, MOEO-based and NSGA-II-based PID controllers is demonstrated by extensive experimental results on an AVR system in terms of accuracy and robustness.
