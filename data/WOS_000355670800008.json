The resulting tools are modular and include enhanced structures to deal with convection-diffusion problems, plus several projection operators and the postprocessing implementation that is necessary to realize the superconvergence property of the method. Loops over the elements are exclusively local and, as such, have been parallelized.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 949: MATLAB Tools for HDG in Three Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000355670800008"}
