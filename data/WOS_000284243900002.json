The specialization implied by the latter suggests more expertise in the domain of wines Does it mean that you are more likely to purchase wines recommended by sites such as wine corn and vintagecellars corn au than those recommended by generalist sites such as costco corn and samsclub corn? Our study attempts to answer this question by experimentally investigating how specialization in media technology (specifically web agent web site and computer) influences individuals' perception and attitudes towards sources in online communication particularly consumer trust and purchase behaviors in e commerce All subjects (N = 124) went to a specially constructed online site with a virtual shopping cart for a wine purchasing task, as part of a 2 (specialist vs generalist web agent) x 2 (specialist vs generalist web site) x 2 (specialist computer vs generalist computer) between-subjects experiment Results indicate significant main effects and interactions of the agent, site, and computer specialization on trust and purchase decision time Theoretical and practical implications are discussed (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Effects of specialization in computers, web sites, and web agents on e-commerce trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000284243900002"}
