J. Numer. Methods Fluids 1992; 15:629-648), is examined in a simple 2D horizontal-vertical domain. It is demonstrated that existing mass-conservative low-dissipation semiimplicit methods, which are unconditionally stable in the inviscid limit for barotropic flows, are unstable in the same limit for baroclinic flows. Such methods can be made baroclinically stable when the integrated continuity equation is discretized with a barotropically dissipative backwards Euler scheme. A general family of two-step predictor-corrector schemes is proposed that have better theoretical characteristics than existing single-step schemes.
