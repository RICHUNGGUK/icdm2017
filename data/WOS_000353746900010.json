However, traditional project selection and prioritization processes ignore the organizational relationships. This paper proposes to integrate social network analysis into multi-criteria decision-making processes to enhance the effectiveness of project selection. A set of topological metrics of social network are used to quantitatively measure the organizational relationships and integrated into the analytic network process (ANP) to form a multi-criteria ANP project selection model. Utilizing empirical social network data of a water and food security research for development network in the Mekong River Basin, we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that it will offer companies, government agencies, and other donor organizations the opportunity to prioritize strategic network goals simultaneously with research and development priorities, and help companies and research organizations to increase their impact and reach within networks.
