This results in the fact that the overall performance of a computing system is increasingly contained by the memory performance. This paper describes an approach for improving the cache hit ratio and thereby the efficiency of the memory system. The approach is based on a set of performance tools which are capable of presenting the cache problems, the reason for them, and the solution for tackling them. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
