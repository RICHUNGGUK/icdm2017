We consider optimal deployment of the passive IB-DAS, focusing on mathematical optimization models based on integer programming, for the topology design and optimal equipment selection of IB-DAS. The models minimize the cable cost and keep the transmit power at each antenna within a given interval defined for coverage and interference control. The models can deliver optimal solutions to systems of which the size is of practical relevance. To improve the time efficiency, we develop preprocessing techniques that integrate the building layout data into the system modeling. Application of the models to realistic IB-DAS deployment demonstrates the effectiveness of the models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
