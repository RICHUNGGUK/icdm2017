The performance of the proposed test is compared to a previously published bootstrapbased approach. LRT is shown to be significantly faster and statistically powerful even within non- Normal distributions. An R package named gGranger containing an implementation for both Granger causality identification tests is also provided.", "paper_title": "A fast and robust statistical test based on likelihood ratio with Bartlett correction to identify Granger causality between gene sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000281714100060"}
