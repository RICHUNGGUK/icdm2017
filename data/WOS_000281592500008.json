The weights are obtained so that they minimize the total classification error rate of the ensemble system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have carried out some experiments on three data sets: 2-D normal, Satimage and Phoneme. Experimental results show that the PSO-based weighting method outperforms the MSE and simple averaging methods, especially for diverse networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
