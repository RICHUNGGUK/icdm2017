However, in order to fully exploit the applications facilitated by M2M communications, adequate support from all layers in the network stack must first be provided in order to meet their service requirements. This paper presents a survey of the requirements, technical challenges, and existing work on medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for supporting M2M communications. This paper first describes the issues related to efficient, scalable, and fair channel access for M2M communications. Then, in addition to protocols that have been developed specifically for M2M communications, this paper reviews existing MAC protocols and their applicability to M2M communications. This survey paper then discusses ongoing standardization efforts and open problems for future research in this area.", "paper_title": "A Survey of MAC Layer Issues and Protocols for Machine-to-Machine Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098400008"}
