The energy consumption of server farms significantly contributes to the operational cost. Complementary management actions exploit the capability of the hardware infrastructure and the stochastic nature of computing demands to reduce energy consumption related to the operation of server farms. In this paper, a simple energy-aware policy incorporating allocation schemes of virtual servers is proposed to achieve the aim of green computing. The policy automatically governs physical hosts to a low-energy consuming state when no virtual servers are allocated in a specific physical host and automatically manages a physical host into the operating state of full functionality when virtual servers are assigned. We present an analytical performance model to compare three allocation schemes of dynamic requests for virtual servers in a server farm.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Allocation Schemes for Virtual Machines in Energy-Aware Server Farms", "paper_id": "WOS:000296300500004"}
