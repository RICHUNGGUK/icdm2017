The system architecture consists of a general-purpose 32-bit microprocessor and several slave coprocessors that accelerate the most intensive calculations. The whole iris recognition algorithm has been implemented on a low-cost Spartan 3 FPGA, achieving significant reduction in execution time when compared with a conventional software-based application. Experimental results show that with a clock speed of 40 MHz, an IrisCode is obtained in <523 ms from an image of 640 x 480 pixels, which is just 20% of the total time needed by a software solution running on the same microprocessor embedded in the architecture.", "paper_title": "Hardware-software co-design of an iris recognition algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000295122600008"}
