If the core array of the 2 x 2 x 2 Tucker3 model is of rank 2 the solutions contain exactly the same information, but they do not when the rank of the core array is three. Two illustrative applications show the effect the different core arrays have on the solutions and their interpretability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
