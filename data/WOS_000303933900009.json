The particular focus of this paper is the creation of the RTLS, which provides accurate and robust localization performance in construction sites where it is otherwise very difficult to maintain signal availability because of many (moving) obstacles. Adopted were the Time of arrival method as a localization method, the Chirp spread spectrum as a wireless networking technology, and the Assistant Tag as a way to maintain enough signal availability for effective communication. In addition, the developed RTLS uses RFID to retain the latter's benefits (e.g., data storage, transfer capability, relatively inexpensive installation cost). To demonstrate the RTLS's localization performance, two case studies have been conducted; the results show great potential for use in improving construction site safety management.
