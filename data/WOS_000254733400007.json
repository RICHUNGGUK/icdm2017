The system was developed around a relational database which stores information on PLB risk which is generated using a PLB prediction model implemented in Perl. The model uses data on relative humidity and temperature from a network of automated weather stations in Michigan to estimate if environmental conditions are favorable for PLB epidemic development. Management recommendations are then produced based on the level of risk. Information stored in the database is presented to users through a series of interactive web pages which are dynamically generated through a combination of Perl and PHP scripts which interface between the website and relational database. This system differs from traditional systems in two major ways. Firstly, the system is web-based and interactive, allowing growers to access site specific, weather-based recommendations through their personal computer without the purchase or installation of additional equipment and/or software. Secondly, the system incorporates geographic proximity of known PLB occurrences and data from a network of regional weather stations into daily risk estimates and management recommendations for 48 locations in Michigan. Recommendations include application timing and spray rates for common fungicides. The interactive website is accessible over the web at URL: http://www.lateblight.org. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
