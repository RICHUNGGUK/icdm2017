Our approach samples triangulated surfaces of solids using boundary particles. To prevent fluid particle tunneling in case of large expansions, additional boundary particles are adaptively generated to prevent gaps and undesired leakage. Furthermore, as an object compresses, particles are adaptively removed to avoid unnecessary computations. We demonstrate that our approach produces plausible interactions of smoothed particle hydrodynamics fluids with both slowly and rapidly deforming solids.
