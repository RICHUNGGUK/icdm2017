In this paper, we address these challenges and present a computational framework for an automatic, three-dimensional (3D) morphological reconstruction of live nerve cells. The key aspects of this approach are: (i) detection of neuronal dendrites through learning 3D tubular models, and (ii) skeletonization by a new algorithm using a morphology-guided deformable model for extracting the dendritic centerline. To represent the neuron morphology, we introduce a novel representation, the Minimum Shape-Cost (MSC) Tree that approximates the dendrite centerline with sub-voxel accuracy and demonstrate the uniqueness of such a shape representation as well as its computational efficiency. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method.", "paper_title": "Automatic Morphological Reconstruction of Neurons from Multiphoton and Confocal Microscopy Images Using 3D Tubular Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000356310900004"}
