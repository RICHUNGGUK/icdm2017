Design/methodology/approach - A bibliometric approach has been used to examine e-government research in periodical publications listed in ISI in the field of information science and library science during the period 2000-2014. Findings - The authors found that although e-participation research has increased in the last years, future research should focus on accessibility policies, and on the motives, capabilities and perceptions of disabled and older people to take advantage of e-government initiatives to be involved in the social affairs. Practical implications - The study has shown the need to carry out further research into e-participation in order to understand the true dimension of social networks and their involvement in e-democracy. Also, it is highlighted the need for the design and evaluation of tools for automation of the services and to enable citizens to vote in local initiatives. Originality/value - This historical assessment allows identification of significant insights and trends related to e-government, and patterns in the published articles and develops a cohesive and comprehensive research agenda to guide researchers worldwide in their quest for a better understanding of e-government.", "paper_title": "Understanding e-government research A perspective from the information and library science field of knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000359055600007"}
