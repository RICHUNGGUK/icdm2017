However, many previous works do not scale up to large 3D shape databases. We propose a two layer coding (TLC) framework to conduct shape matching much more efficiently. The first layer coding is applied to pairs of views represented as depth images. The spatial relationship of each view pair is captured with so-called eigen-angle, which is the planar angle between the two views measured at the center of the 3D shape. Prior to the second layer coding, the view pairs are divided into subsets according to their eigen-angles. Consequently, view pairs that differ significantly in their eigen-angles are encoded with different codewords, which implies that spatial arrangement of views is preserved in the second layer coding. The final feature vector of a 3D shape is the concatenation of all the encoded features from different subsets, which is used for efficient indexing directly. TLC is not limited to encode the local features from 2D views, but can be also applied to encoding 3D features. Exhaustive experimental results confirm that TLC achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "3D Shape Matching via Two Layer Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000364831700001"}
