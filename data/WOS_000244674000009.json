Simulations show that, total harmonic distortion on the output current is within 2% for a tuning range of almost five octaves. Although the structure is in the form of an active-input current mirror, keeping the tuned MOSFETs in triode region significantly relaxes the stability problems of an active-input current mirror. This issue is revealed by theoretical analyses and further simulations are included for demonstration. An application example is also supplied.", "paper_title": "Tunable linear CMOS current mirror", "paper_id": "WOS:000244674000009"}
