Recently the theory of a truly nonlocal energy functional has been developed. It has been used mostly as a post-DFT calculation approach. i.e. by applying the functional to the charge density calculated using any standard DFT code, thus obtaining a new improved value for the total energy of the system. Nonlocal calculation is computationally quite expensive and scales as N-2 where N is the number of points in which the density is defined, and a massively parallel calculation is welcome for a wider applicability of the new approach. In this article we present a code which accomplishes this goal.", "paper_title": "JuNoLo - Julich nonlocal code for parallel post-processing evaluation of vdW-DF correlation energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000273192100013"}
