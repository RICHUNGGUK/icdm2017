Active sensing approaches are investigated by utilizing robot kinematics and geometry to improve upon existing sensing methods for contact. Compliant motion control is used so that a robot can actively search for and localize the desired contact location. Robot control in a contact situation is improved by the precise estimation of the contact location. From this viewpoint, we investigate a new control strategy to accommodate the proposed sensing techniques in contact situations. The proposed estimation algorithm and the control strategy both work complementarily. Then, we verify the proposed algorithm through experiments using 7-DOF hardware and a simulation environment. The two major contributions of the proposed active sensing strategy are the estimation algorithm for contact location without any tactile sensors, and the control strategy complementing the proposed estimation algorithm.", "paper_title": "An active sensing strategy for contact location without tactile sensors using robot geometry and kinematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000329294800009"}
