A particular case of this situation appears when we want to study the evolution of an L-fuzzy context in time. In this work, we analyze these situations. First we introduce the fuzzy context sequence definition and remind the main results about OWA operators. With the aid of these operators, we propose an exhaustive study of the different contexts values of the sequence using some new relations. In the second part, we also study the fuzzy context sequences establishing tendencies and temporal patterns. Finally, we illustrate all the results by means of examples.", "paper_title": "The study of fuzzy context sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000315944900008"}
