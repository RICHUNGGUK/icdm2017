This paper provides a case study of an RFID-enabled supply chain ecosystem focusing on a large high tech multi-national corporation based in Singapore. Specifically, the paper provides an implementation framework for the Return on Investment (ROI) calculator which trades off labor cost and productivity gains. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) methodology is used to assess the operational level benefits of RFID implementation. We show how scalability is critical for RFID adoption.
