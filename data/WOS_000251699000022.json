The worst case fault sensitivity measure is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The existence of a robust fault detection system that guarantees i) the L(2)-gain from a fault signal to a residual signal greater than a prescribed value and ii) the L(2)-gain from an exogenous input to a residual signal less than a prescribed value is given in terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Fault detection for uncertain fuzzy systems: An LMI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000022"}
