As soon as the thrown ball is recognized by the visual system, the camera carried by the robot end-effector is forced to follow a baseline in the space so as to acquire an initial dataset of visual measurements from several points of view, providing a first estimate of the catching point through a linear estimation algorithm. Hereafter, additional measurements are acquired to constantly refine the previous estimate by exploiting a nonlinear estimation algorithm. During the robot trajectory, the translational components of the camera are controlled in such a way as to follow the planned path to intercept the ball, while the rotational components are forced to keep the ball into the field of view. Experimental results performed on a common industrial robotic system prove the effectiveness of the presented solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
