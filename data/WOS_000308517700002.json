Consequently, effective and efficient data processing methods for geospatial information extraction and knowledge discovery over the Web are a major challenge for research and industry. The Geoprocessing Web, which consists of light-weight protocols, crowd-sourcing capability, and the capability to process real-time geospatial data sources provided by sensors, enables distributed, interoperable and collaborative processing of geospatial data for information and knowledge discovery. This paper provides a comprehensive overview about the state-of-the-art architecture and technologies, and the most recent developments in the Geoprocessing Web. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
