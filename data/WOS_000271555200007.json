The problem of determining whether an n-card Klondike initial configuration can lead to a win is shown NP-complete. The problem remains NP-complete when only three suits are allowed instead of the usual four. When only two suits of opposite color are available, the problem is shown NL-hard. When the only two suits have the same color, two restrictions are shown in AC(0) and in NL respectively. When a single suit is allowed, the problem drops in complexity down to AC(0)[3], that is, the problem is solvable by a family of constant-depth unbounded-fan-in { AND, OR, mod(3) } -circuits. Other cases are studied: for example, \"no King\" variant with an arbitrary number of suits of the same color and with an empty \"pile\" is NL-complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
