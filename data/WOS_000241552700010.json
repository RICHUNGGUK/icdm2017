Unlike other conventional interpolation methods, the unknown pixel value is not estimated based on its local surrounding neighbourhood, but on the whole image. In particularly, we exploit the repetitive character of the image. A great advantage of our proposed approach is that we have more information at our disposal, which leads to a better reconstruction of the interpolated image. Results show the effectiveness of our proposed method and its superiority at very large magnifications to other traditional interpolation methods.", "paper_title": "An image interpolation scheme for repetitive structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700010"}
