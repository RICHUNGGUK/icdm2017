Its feasibility was proved by the Lasalle principle. Numerical simulation results show that synaptic connection weight can converge to an appropriate strength and the network comes to synchronization. Furthermore, ISI (inter-spike interval) of synchronization orbit in neural network has a typical period doubling bifurcation. It is a further improvement compared with bifurcation of the traditional single neuron model, which promotes our understanding of neuron population activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
