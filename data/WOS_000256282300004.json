We prove that the probability hierarchy is decidable, i.e. there exists an algorithm that receives p(1) and p(2) and answers whether PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p(1) is equivalent to PFIN-type learning with the probability of success p(2). To prove our result, we analyze the topological structure of the probability hierarchy. We prove that it is well-ordered in descending ordering and order-equivalent to ordinal epsilon(0). This shows that the structure of the hierarchy is very complicated. Using similar methods, we also prove that, for PFIN-type learning, team learning and probabilistic learning are of the same power.
