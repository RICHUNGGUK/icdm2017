In these systems, agents represent self-motivated entities that have a social context, including dependency relations among them, and different preferences and beliefs. Without agreement there is no cooperation and thus, complex tasks which require the interaction of agents with different points of view cannot be performed. In this work, we propose a case-based argumentation approach for Multi-Agent Systems where agents reach agreements by arguing and improve their argumentation skills from experience. A set of knowledge resources and a reasoning process that agents can use to manage their positions and arguments are presented. These elements are implemented and validated in a customer support application. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
