Nonnegative feature space (basis matrix) is estimated using the NMF-framework from the sample set of multimedia objects. Subsequently, using a secret key a subspace (basis vector) of the estimated basis matrix is used to decompose the host data for information embedding and detection. Binary dither modulation is used to embed/detect the information into the host signal coefficients. To ensure the fidelity of the embedded information for a given robustness, host media coefficients are selected for information embedding according to the estimated masking threshold. Masking threshold is estimated using the human visual/auditory system (HVS/HAS) and host media. Simulation results show that the proposed NMF-based scheme provides flexible control over robustness and capacity for imperceptible embedding.", "paper_title": "Secure data-hiding in multimedia using NMF", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800035"}
