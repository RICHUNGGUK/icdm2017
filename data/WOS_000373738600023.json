The algorithm, called stochastic residual belief propagation (SR-BP), extends the use of residual belief propagation (R-BP) to distributed networks, improving the accuracy, convergence rate, and communication cost for cooperative spectrum sensing. We demonstrate that SR-BP converges to a unique fixed point under conditions similar to those ensuring convergence of asynchronous BP. Then, we develop a way to derive a probability distribution from the residual of each message. Finally, we provide numerical results to showcase the improvements in convergence speed, message overhead and detection accuracy of SR-BP.", "paper_title": "Informed Scheduling by Stochastic Residual Belief Propagation in Distributed Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600023"}
