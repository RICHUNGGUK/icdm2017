The paper proposes first a general probabilistic setting that formalizes the notion of textual entailment. We then describe a concrete alignment-based model for lexical entailment, which utilizes web co-occurrence statistics in a bag of words representation. Finally, we report the results of the model on the Recognising Textual Entailment challenge dataset along with some analysis.", "paper_title": "A lexical alignment model for probabilistic textual entailment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239583900016"}
