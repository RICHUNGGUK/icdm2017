The main contribution is a stability result: we show that the Gaussian, mean or anisotropic curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K with positive p-reach can be estimated by the same curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K' close to K in the Hausdorff sense. We show how these curvature measures can be computed for finite unions of balls. The curvature measures of the offset of a compact set with positive mu-reach can thus be approximated by the curvature measures of the offset of a point-cloud sample.", "paper_title": "Stability of Curvature Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597500024"}
