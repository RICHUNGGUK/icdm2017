Combined with a pattern-filling technique, the proposed scan-cell reordering techniques can utilize both high response correlations and pattern correlations to simultaneously minimize scan-out and scan-in transitions. Those scan-shift transitions can be further reduced by selectively using the inverse connections between scan cells. In addition, the trade-off between routing overhead and power consumption can also be controlled by the proposed scan-cell reordering techniques. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each of the proposed techniques individually.", "paper_title": "Scan-Cell Reordering for Minimizing Scan-Shift Power Based on Nonspecified Test Cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000284931600010"}
