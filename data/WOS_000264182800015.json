Interval type-2 fuzzy logic system permits us to model rule uncertainties and every membership value of an element is interval itself. The proposed type-2 fuzzy model applies the technical and fundamental indexes as the input variables. This model is tested on stock price prediction of an automotive manufactory in Asia. Through the intensive experimental tests, the model has successfully forecasted the price variation for stocks from different sectors. The results are very encouraging and can be implemented in a real-time trading system for stock price prediction during the trading period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
