We give the complete deciphering of some letters in which we found differences with the deciphered texts given in historical books. We also provide the deciphering of one letter that seems to be unknown so far. Our results provide new proof of Marie-Antoinette's deep affection for Fersen. Finally, we mention some open questions about Marie-Antoinette's correspondence with Axel von Fersen.", "paper_title": "I Shall Love You Until Death (Marie-Antoinette to Axel von Fersen)", "paper_id": "WOS:000277340800002"}
