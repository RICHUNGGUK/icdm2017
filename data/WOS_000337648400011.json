We describe and survey ongoing research and identify challenges in the modeling, design and analysis of information-centric networks and protocols. We discuss performance modeling frameworks and challenges for ICNs, with a particular focus on content flowing through a network of caches, drawing analogies and distinctions from past research in both circuit-switched and packet-switched networks. We also survey the challenges and recent research results associated with finding content in a network of caches and managing the content in those caches. The challenges posed by mobility (of both the end users accessing content as well as content itself) are also discussed. CD (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
