In this paper, we present a novel method for constructing a self-pairing on supersingular elliptic curves with even embedding degrees, which we call the Ateil pairing. This new pairing improves the efficiency of the self-pairing computation on supersingular curves over finite fields with large characteristic. Based on the eta(T) pairing, we propose a generalization of the Ateil pairing, which we call the Ateil(i) pairing. The optimal Ateil(i) pairing which has the shortest Miller loop is faster than previously known self-pairings on supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields with small characteristic. We also present a new self-pairing based on the Weil pairing which is faster than the self-pairing based on the Tate pairing on ordinary elliptic curves with embedding degree one.", "paper_title": "Faster Computation of Self-Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000303204900046"}
