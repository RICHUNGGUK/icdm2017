We introduce a new entity-the trixel-that is an adaptive, local, triangular unit of region-contour Picture description. Adjacent trixels are merged based on certain elementary heuristic criteria of perceptual organization, modeled as geometric filters on trixel edges. The connected components of a trixel grouping graph, with vertices representing trixels and edges between vertices corresponding to merged adjacent trixels, yield polygons that segment the image.
