Such a scenario of full connectivity is however not always realistic. One such motivating example for us is the application of path planning for unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicles (URAVs). URAVs are widely deployed for photography or imagery gathering missions of sites of interest. These sites can be targets in a combat zone to be investigated or sites inaccessible by ground transportation, such as those hit by forest fires, earthquake or other forms of natural disasters. The navigation environment is one where the overall configuration of the problem is a sparse graph. Unlike graphs that are fully connected, sparse graphs are not always Hamiltonian. In this paper, we describe hybrid ant colony algorithms (HACAs) proposed for path planning in sparse graphs since existing ant colony solvers designed for solving TSP do not apply to the present context directly. HACAs represent ant inspired algorithms incorporated with a local search procedure and some heuristic techniques for uncovering feasible route(s) or path(s) in a sparse graph within tractable time. Empirical results conducted on a set of generated sparse graphs demonstrate the excellent convergence property and robustness of HACAs in uncovering low risk and Hamiltonian visitation paths. Further, the obtained results also indicate that HACAs converge to secondary closed paths in situations where a Hamiltonian cycle does not exist theoretically or is not attainable within the bounded computational time window.", "paper_title": "Hybrid ant colony algorithms for path planning in sparse graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256087500004"}
