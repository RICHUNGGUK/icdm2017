The creation process of paper architecture is often labor-intensive and highly skill-demanding, even with the aid of existing computer-aided design tools. We propose an automatic algorithm for generating paper architectures given a user-specified 3D model. The algorithm is grounded on geometric formulation of planar layout for paper architectures that can be popped-up in a rigid and stable manner, and sufficient conditions for a 3D surface to be popped-up from such a planar layout. Based on these conditions, our algorithm computes a class of paper architectures containing two sets of parallel patches that approximate the input geometry while guaranteed to be physically realizable. The method is demonstrated on a number of architectural examples, and physically engineered results are presented.", "paper_title": "Popup: Automatic Paper Architectures from 3D Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600080"}
