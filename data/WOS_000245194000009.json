The 6-stick skeleton model used in the proposed approach is very distinctive in representing a pedestrian simply but effectively. By the experiment using the real sequences provided by PETS, it is shown that the target pedestrian is tracked adequately by the proposed approach with a simple silhouette extraction method which consists of only background subtraction, even if the tracking target moves so complicatedly and is often so cluttered by other obstacles that the pedestrian can not be tracked by the conventional methods. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can track the multiple targets in the complex case that their trajectories intersect.", "paper_title": "Stochastic pedestrian tracking based on 6-stick skeleton model", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194000009"}
