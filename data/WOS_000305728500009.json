We describe the goal of the overall Trading Agent Competition (TA C) and highlight particular competitions. We discuss its significance in the context of today's global market economy as well as AI research, the ways in which it breaks away from limiting assumptions made in prior work, and some of the advances it has engendered over the past 10 years. Since its introduction in 2000, TAC has attracted more than 350 entries and brought together researchers from AI and beyond.", "paper_title": "Competitive Benchmarking: Lessons Learned from the Trading Agent Competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000305728500009"}
