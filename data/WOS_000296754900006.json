The simulation results show that the performance and position accuracy of the improved algorithm is much better than that of the common one. Meanwhile, this paper designs an indoor experimental position system based on the improved algorithm, which selects trilateral ranging method as position method and utilizes CC2510 chip as wireless node. This experimental system realizes indoor position in the 7.4x7.4m(2) meeting room on the 2A Building's 10(th) floor in Science Garden of Harbin Institute of Technology. From the test results, it can be concluded that the practical performance of the improved algorithm is well proved.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL RSSI-BASED POSITION ALGORITHM FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS AND DESIGN OF AN EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900006"}
