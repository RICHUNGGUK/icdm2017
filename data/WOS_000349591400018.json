Compared with the classical learning model for scheduling, this model is more general and realistic. The objectives are to minimize makespan and total completion time. For the single-machine case, we show that both of the objectives are polynomially solvable. For the parallel-machine case, we show that minimizing total completion time is still polynomially solvable, while minimizing makespan is NP-hard, for which we provide a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS).
