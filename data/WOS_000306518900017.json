By using a wired OR scheme; only one transistor is needed to implement both the counting logic and the mode selection control. This can enhance the working frequency of the counter due to a reduced critical path between the E-TSPC flip flops (FFs). Since the number of transistor stacking between the power rails is kept at merely two, the proposed design is sustainable to low V-DD operations (531 MHz at 0.6 V V-DD) for the power saving purpose. Simulation results show that compared with two classic E-TSPC based designs in 0.18 mu m process technology, as much as 16.4% in operation speed and 39% in power-delay-product can be achieved by the proposed design.", "paper_title": "Low Voltage and Low Power Divide-By-2/3 Counter Design Using Pass Transistor Logic Circuit Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900017"}
