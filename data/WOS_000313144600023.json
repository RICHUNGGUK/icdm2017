It should be noted that we here propose a new handover decision scheme for traversing between multi-rate WLANs, while our previous decision scheme works only in fixed-rate WLANs. In this paper, to treat a handover between multi-rate WLANs, we employ two kinds of information: (1) the most frequently used data rate (MFDR) for assessing the stable communication performance of a multi-rate WEAN, and (2) the frame retransmission ratio (FRR) for assessing its exact communication performance. The MFDR enables us to estimate the area where we should start handover. If the MFDRs of two interfaces are same in the area, the FRR allows us to compare the wireless condition on the two interfaces precisely to give an optimal handover point. Through simulation experiments, we show that our proposed scheme certainly estimates an appropriate handover point as a result of multi-path transmission (s), thereby providing handover successfully. That is, the proposed method can determine handover at an optimal point depending on the various distances between access points, the mobile node (MN) velocity, and the MN moving pattern. Moreover, our proposed scheme prevents the redundant network load caused by multi-path transmission as much as possible, thereby providing the ideal TCP communication performance.
