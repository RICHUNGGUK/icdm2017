The challenge inherent to MBS is to ensure that all MBS users can be served, and one effective solution to this problem is to employ MIMO multicast transmit precoding. In previous works on MIMO multicast transmit precoding design, the authors either assumed 1) perfect transmitter-side channel state information (CSIT) or 2) special channel conditions that facilitate precoder design with imperfect CSIT. In this paper, we focus on transmit precoding design for MBS where the CSIT is obtained via limited feedback. In addition, we analyze the average minimum receive signal-noise-ratio (RxSNR) among the MBS users and study the order of growth with respect to the number of MBS users, the number of feedback bits, and the number of transmit antennas. Finally, we propose a threshold based feedback reduction scheme and study the tradeoff between feedback cost and performance loss.", "paper_title": "Precoding Design for Multi-Antenna Multicast Broadcast Services With Limited Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000284540900016"}
