Our study shows that the popularly used histogram-based descriptors, such as scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) are not optimal for this task. This is mainly because histogram representation is relatively expensive to compute on mobile platforms and loses significant spatial clues, which are important for improving discriminative power and matching near-duplicate image patches. To address these issues, we propose to extract a novel binary local descriptor named Edge-SIFT from the binary edge maps of scale- and orientation-normalized image patches. By preserving both locations and orientations of edges and compressing the sparse binary edge maps with a boosting strategy, the final Edge-SIFT shows strong discriminative power with compact representation. Furthermore, we propose a fast similarity measurement and an indexing framework with flexible online verification. Hence, the Edge-SIFT allows an accurate and efficient image search and is ideal for computation sensitive scenarios such as a mobile image search. Experiments on a large-scale dataset manifest that the Edge-SIFT shows superior retrieval accuracy to Oriented BRIEF (ORB) and is superior to SIFT in the aspects of retrieval precision, efficiency, compactness, and transmission cost.", "paper_title": "Edge-SIFT: Discriminative Binary Descriptor for Scalable Partial-Duplicate Mobile Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000321924600030"}
