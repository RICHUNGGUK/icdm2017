To meet the challenge, this paper presents the design and real-time implementation of a robust two-degree-of-freedom servo system for physical 3.5-in. hard disk drive with single voice-coil-motor actuator using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm toolbox. Besides the simplicity in controller structure, such an evolutionary servo control system is capable of meeting various performance specifications of hard disk drives in both the time and frequency domains. It is shown that the servo system optimally moves the magnetic head onto the desired track with minimal control effort, and keeps it on the track robustly against plant uncertainties or runout disturbances. Validation results of the evolutionary servo control system are compared with classical PID and RPT controllers, which show excellent closed-loop response and robustness in the face of practical perturbations in HDD.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary design and implementation of a hard disk drive servo control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240363800004"}
