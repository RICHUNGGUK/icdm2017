Supported by actual system examples and centering on the system architecture and core technology, this article discusses how to use Beautiful Soup to conduct deep information retrieval for partially structured webpage data, obtain directional information, reorganize the information, and then send the information to users via text message. The test results demonstrate that the web crawler achieved over 95% accuracy, satisfying the needs for commercial application.", "paper_title": "A Study of Web Information Extraction Technology Based on Beautiful Soup", "paper_id": "WOS:000366404400003"}
