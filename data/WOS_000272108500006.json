In this paper, we present a sub-grid air entrainment model that quantitatively predicts the rate of air entrainment and subsequent disperse bubbly flow for a plunging jet. The derivation of this model is based on the two-stage (i.e., low and high liquid jet velocity) air entrainment mechanisms suggested by Sene [Sene KJ. Air entrainment by plunging jets. Chem Eng Sci 1988:43(10):2615-23]. This model was validated against extensive experimental data for water jets in air over a wide range of liquid velocities (from around 1 to 10 m/s) for the total rate of air entrainment. it was then implemented into an Eulerian/Eulerian two-fluid computational multiphase fluid dynamics (CMFD) model, wherein the liquid and the bubbles are modeled as two distinct continua. This multiphase model, supplemented by the new sub-grid air entrainment model, was used to predict the void fraction distribution underneath plunging water jets at different depths and water jet velocities. It was found that this approach yields results that match the experimental observations very well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
