The language is based on a filtered merge of several existing languages including sequential valuation networks, asymmetric influence diagrams, and unconstrained influence diagrams. Asymmetry is encoded using a structure resembling a clustered decision tree, whereas the representation of the uncertainty model is based on the (unconstrained) influence diagram framework. We illustrate the proposed language by modeling several highly asymmetric decision problems, and we describe an efficient solution procedure. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
