It has thus become quite critical to all stakeholders to play a leading and dominant role in the generation of information and monitoring of voluminous information uploaded to this space. Dominance in monitoring of large amount of information in cyberspace requires real-time monitoring using new techniques and approaches instead of traditional techniques. Concerned with the latter case, we limit our focus in this paper on Blogs as an important part of the Cyberspace and propose a novel notification system for quick reporting of changes made to Blogs. This is achieved by restricting the search for changes to high volumes of Blogs only to changes to the abstracts of Blogs derived from Blogs. We show that this system works favourably compared to systems that require cooperation and synchronization between information providers.", "paper_title": "AN ONLINE SYSTEM FOR NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO BLOGGING SPACE TO ACHIEVE INFORMATION DOMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000359177900003"}
