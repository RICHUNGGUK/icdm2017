To meet power, performance and cost targets these systems need to be adaptive. The reconfiguration features of recent FPGAs make new approaches for this type of parallel computing possible: Dynamic reconfiguration at runtime offers an important step to adaptive behavior of systems-on-chip (SoCs). This article analyzes the challenges of such an adaptive SoC. It is shown that many of the requirements for an adaptive FPGA-realization are met by the SDVM, the scalable dataflow-driven virtual machine which has been successfully implemented and tested on a cluster of workstations. The SDVM has evolved to a virtualization layer for multicore-FPGAs, now called SDVM (R) . This virtualization layer allows a transparent runtime-reconfiguration of the underlying hardware to adapt to the changing system environment. Results for a basic application for both systems are presented.", "paper_title": "A Self Distributing Virtual Machine for Adaptive Multicore Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000273810700003"}
