Then we use this characterization to obtain a short elementary proof for the uniform decidability of the finite power property for rational languages in all monoids defined by a confluent regular system of deletion rules. This result in particular covers the case of free groups solved earlier by d'Alessandro and Sakarovitch by means of an involved reduction to the boundedness problem for distance automata.", "paper_title": "Algebraic characterization of the finite power property", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500012"}
