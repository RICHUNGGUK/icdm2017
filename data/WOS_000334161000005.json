In mobile computing, software developers will need to develop sense and response applications that will interact with the end user. These applications will notify or ask users what they want based on what they have sensed or on a personal profile. Mobile cloud computing has the potential to empower mobile users with capabilities not found in mobile devices, combining different and heterogeneous data sets. In this work, we discuss the importance and challenges in designing event-driven mobile services that will detect conditions of interest to users and notify them accordingly.", "paper_title": "Cloud-assisted Computing for Event-driven Mobile Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000334161000005"}
