Previous saliency works only consider one or two of them. Further, to avoid some inherent drawbacks of existing three factors, we first over-segment the image into many small coherent regions. And then, we exploit the self-information and regional de-noising, regional contrast and consistency, Gaussian function and regional averaging to get three new factors of global rarity, local contrast and central bias. Finally, we embed them into a nonlinear neural network to figure out their own contributions in saliency detection. Extensive experiments and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of our saliency model with three new built factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
