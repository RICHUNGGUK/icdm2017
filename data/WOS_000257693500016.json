The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks (FLNN) as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This study uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural network (FLNN). The FNFN model can generate the consequent part of a nonlinear combination of the input variables. An efficient learning algorithm, called immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO), is also presented. The proposed IPSO learning algorithm combines the immune algorithm (IA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to perform the parameter learning for the FNFN model. The IPSO employed the advantages of PSO to improve the mutation mechanism of immune algorithm. Illustrative examples were conducted to show the performance and applicability of the proposed FNFN model with IPSO learning.", "paper_title": "An efficient neural fuzzy network based on immune particle swarm optimization for prediction and control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500016"}
