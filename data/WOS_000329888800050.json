By exploring into the mapping solutions of these classifiers, we found that they can be linked by simple feature data scaling. In other words, the key to these relationships lies upon how the replica of feature data are being scaled. This finding leads us directly to an exploration of novel classifiers beyond existing settings. Based on an extensive empirical evaluation, we show that the proposed formulation facilitates a tuning capability beyond existing settings for classifier generalization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
