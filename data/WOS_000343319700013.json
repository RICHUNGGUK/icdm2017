In this paper, we propose a novel tracking approach that can adapt various appearance changes such as illumination, motion, and occlusions, and owns the ability of robust reacquisition after drifting. We utilize a condensation-based method with an online support vector machine as a reliable observation model to realize adaptive tracking. To redetect the target when drifting, a cascade detector based on random ferns is proposed. It can detect the target robustly in real time. After redetection, we also come up with a new refinement strategy to improve the tracker's performance by removing the support vectors corresponding to possible wrong updates by a matching template. Extensive comparison experiments on typical and challenging benchmark dataset illustrate a robust and encouraging performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Robust Object Tracking with Reacquisition Ability using Online Learned Detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000343319700013"}
