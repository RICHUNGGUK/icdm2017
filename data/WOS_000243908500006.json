We show that with an appropriate step-size strategy, our method is optimal both for Lipschitz continuous operators (O(1/epsilon) iterations), and for the operators with bounded variations (O(1/epsilon(2)) iterations). Our technique can be applied for solving non-smooth convex minimization problems with known structure. In this case the worst-case complexity bound is O(1/epsilon) iterations.", "paper_title": "Dual extrapolation and its applications to solving variational inequalities and related problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500006"}
