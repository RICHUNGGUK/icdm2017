Often, a generic solving strategy can be extracted and an interactive exercise system that emulates a tutor can be implemented. In this paper we show how software developed by us can be used to realize this interactivity. In particular, an implementation of a generic exercise for computing the derivative of elementary functions is presented.", "paper_title": "Interactive learning and mathematical calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905900022"}
