Ideally, a broadcasting algorithm should have the ability to quickly disseminate data, while keeping the number of transmissions low. In this paper, we analyze the popular Trickle algorithm, which has been proposed as a suitable communication protocol for code maintenance and propagation in wireless sensor networks. We show that the broadcasting process of a network using Trickle can be modeled by a Markov chain and that this chain falls under a class of Markov chains, closely related to residual lifetime distributions. It is then shown that this class of Markov chains admits a stationary distribution of a special form. These results are used to analyze the Trickle algorithm and its message count. Our results prove conjectures made in the literature concerning the effect of a listen-only period. Besides providing a mathematical analysis of the algorithm, we propose a generalized version of Trickle, with an additional parameter defining the length of a listen-only period.", "paper_title": "On the scalability and message count of Trickle-based broadcasting schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361903700004"}
