The added-value service provides different kind of services for users. In this paper, we propose a stored-value card to provide an added-value service of payment protocol in VANET. When user wants to enjoy the added-value service, the service provider verifies the request and sends it to the payment gateway. Then the payment gateway forwards the transaction message to the Issuer and Acquirer to process it. In our scheme, we use symmetric cryptography and digital signature to solve the security problem of payment scheme in VANET. Our scheme achieves protection against double-spending, unforgeability, non-repudiation, anonymity and the recovery issue.", "paper_title": "Using a Stored-Value Card to Provide an Added-Value Service of Payment Protocol in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000328565800009"}
