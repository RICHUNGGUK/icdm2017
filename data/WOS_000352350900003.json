We have developed the uncertain induced heavy ordered weighted averaging distance (UIHOWAD) operator. It is a new aggregation operator that generalizes a wide range of uncertain aggregation operators such as the uncertain minimum distance, the uncertain weighted Hamming distance (UWHD), the uncertain OWA distance (UOWAD) operator, and the uncertain heavy OWA distance (UHOWAD) operator. We studied some of its main properties and different particular cases. We also present its applicability in a decision-making problem concerning the selection of investments.", "paper_title": "Uncertain Induced Heavy Aggregation Distance Operator and its Application to Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000352350900003"}
