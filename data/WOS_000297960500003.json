After gently rubbing the inorganic alignment film (sputtered silicon oxide, SiO(2)), the decreasing polar anchoring energy results in slightly smaller pretilt angle which gives LC a toppling direction to shorten the transition time while LC cell is applied by an external electric field. The results of our work show that this rubbing remedy can suppress the optical bounce. This simple and efficient surface treatment could be applied to liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) technique for high resolution microdisplays and portable electronic products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
