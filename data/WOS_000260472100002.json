The results of this ranking are then compared to the ordering based on the journals' impact factors as published by Thomson Scientific. The two sets of rankings seem to be positively correlated, but statistically the null hypothesis that the two rankings are uncorrelated cannot be rejected. This observation suggests that researchers interpret the current quality of journals based on other factors in addition to the impact factors.", "paper_title": "Journal evaluation by environmental and resource economists: A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000260472100002"}
