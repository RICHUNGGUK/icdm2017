The Web is a global electronic publishing medium. Its size has been growing with an enormous speed for over a decade. Most of its content is objectionable, but it also contains a huge amount of valuable information. The Web adds a new dimension to the concept of information explosion and tries to solve the very same problem by information retrieval systems known as Web search engines. We briefly review the information explosion problem and information retrieval systems, convey the past and state of the art in Turkish information retrieval research, illustrate some recent developments, and propose some future actions in this research area in Turkey.", "paper_title": "Turkish information retrieval: Past changes future", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200002"}
