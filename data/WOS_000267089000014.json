The bagNLPDA method first projects all the training samples into the range space of a so-called locality preserving total scatter matrix without losing any discriminative information. The projected training samples are then randomly sampled using bagging to generate a set of bootstrap replicates. Null space discriminant analysis is performed in each replicate and the results of them are combined using majority voting. As a result, the proposed method aggregates a set of complementary null space locality preserving discriminant classifiers. Experiments on FERET and PIE subsets demonstrate the effectiveness of bagNLPDA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
