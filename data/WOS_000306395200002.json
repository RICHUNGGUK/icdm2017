The concrete in this study is designed by estimating the blending ratio of aggregate using a densified mixture design algorithm (DMDA) based on an ideal grading curve and estimating the paste volume as the sum of the amount of paste needed to provide an assigned coating paste thickness. So as to obtain appropriate concrete amount, and thus can accurately estimate the property of concrete. Deduction of this mix design formula is simple and easy understanding, and meanwhile to obtain result is fast. This estimation model of mix design can effectively upgrade concrete quality and is expected to be beneficial to industry.", "paper_title": "An approach of using ideal grading curve and coating paste thickness to evaluate the performances of concrete-(1) Theory and formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306395200002"}
