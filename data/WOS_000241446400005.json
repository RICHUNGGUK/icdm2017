By means of the parameter K ruggedness as well as the epistasis can be controlled. NKL are particularly useful to understand the dynamics of evolutionary search. We extend NKL from the traditional binary case to a mixed variable case with continuous, nominal discrete, and integer variables. The resulting test function generator is a suitable test model for mixed-integer evolutionary algorithms (MI-EA) - i.e. instantiations of evolution algorithms that can deal with the aforementioned variable types. We provide a comprehensive introduction to mixed-integer NKL and characteristics of the model (global/local optima, computation, etc.). Finally, a first study of the performance of mixed-integer evolution strategies on this problem family is provided, the results of which underpin its applicability for optimization algorithm design.", "paper_title": "Mixed-integer NK landscapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400005"}
