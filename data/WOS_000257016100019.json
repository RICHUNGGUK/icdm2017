This paper studies the performance of the (OBPSK)-B-3 LDD system over a frequency-nonselective and slowly fading channel. Three types of channel model are considered, namely Rayleigh fading, Nakagami-m fading, and Ricean fading. The analytical results show that channel fading causes a significant degradation in the performance of the (OBPSK)-B-3 LDD receiver. Nevertheless, the receiver still demonstrates a better near-far resistant property than a conventional CDMA receiver over fading channels. This study also analyzes the effect of two well-known diversity combining techniques on the (OBPSK)-B-3 LDD performance over Rayleigh fading channels. The results indicate that diversity combining techniques significantly improve the performance of the (OBPSK)-B-3 LDD scheme over fading channels. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
