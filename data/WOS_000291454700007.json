Many of these companies are tying digital content with their proprietary digital devices. In this study, we develop a consumer demand model for digital device and digital content based on a constant elasticity demand function. In modeling consumer valuation of the digital device, we take consumer surplus on digital content into account. We further derive equilibrium prices for digital devices based on an oligopoly competition model with horizontal product differentiation. We analyze the equilibrium prices and how prices affect firm profits. We find product differentiation and the level of product substitutability affect prices. We also find that content price plays a significant role in affecting the price of the digital device. Content price can either increase or decrease the tied digital device price depending on the profit margin and demand elasticity of the digital content. We further analyze how content and device prices affect their respective profits and the overall profit of the firm. We extend our model to vertical product differentiation and find vertical product differentiation and the level of product quality affect prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
