Following the success of Short Message Services, MMS has the potential to be the next mobile commerce \"killer application\" which is useful and popular among consumers; however, little is known about why people intend to accept and use it. Building upon the motivational theory and media richness theory, the research model captures both extrinsic (e.g., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) and intrinsic (e.g., perceived enjoyment) motivators as well as perceived media richness to explain user intention to use MMS. An online survey was conducted and 207 completed questionnaires were collected. By integrating the motivation and the media richness perspectives, the research model explains 65% of the variance. In addition, the results present strong support to the existing theoretical links as well as to those newly hypothesized in this study. Implications from the current investigation for research and practice are provided.", "paper_title": "Understanding user acceptance of multimedia messaging services: An Empirical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000250741100012"}
