We investigate a first-order fragment of G(V) extended with Delta, that is powerful enough to formalize important properties of fuzzy rule-based systems. The satisfiability problem in this fragment is shown to be NP-complete for all G(V), also in the presence of an additional, involutive negation. In contrast to the one-variable case, in the fragment considered, only two infinite-valued Godel logics extended with Delta differ w.r.t. satisfiability. Only one of them enjoys the finite model property.
