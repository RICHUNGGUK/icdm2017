We noted that the generally acknowledged information of functional annotations of TFs as well as that of their target genes should provide useful hints in determining TF DNA binding preferences. Results: In this contribution, we developed an integrative method based on the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, to predict DNA binding preferences through integrating both the functional/ structural information of TFs and the interaction between TFs and their targets. The accuracy of cross-validation tests on the dataset consisting of 3430 positive samples and 7000 negative samples reaches 87.0% for 10-fold cross-validation and 87.9% for jackknife cross-validation test, which is a much better result than that in our previous work. The prediction result indicates that the improved method we developed could be a powerful approach to infer the TF DNA preference in silico.", "paper_title": "An approach to predict transcription factor DNA binding site specificity based upon gene and transcription factor functional categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249818700013"}
