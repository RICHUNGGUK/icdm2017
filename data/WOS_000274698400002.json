In this paper, a new reputation model of sensors is described, and then by combing the new reputation model with a very simple key pre-distribution scheme, novel dynamic pair-wise key establishment and maintenance algorithms are proposed. In the scheme, each node is pre-assigned a same initial global key before deployment. After deployment, the nodes will establish different I-hop local pair-wise key with its different neighbors dynamically. Theoretic analysis and simulation results show that the new algorithm has much higher probability of direct and indirect pair-wise key establishment than previous traditional pair-wise key establishing methods. Furthermore, it is distributed and has excellent security performance and low key establishing costs simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Reputation Model based Dynamic Pair-wise Key Establishment Scheme for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274698400002"}
