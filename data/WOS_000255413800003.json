Previous constructions of such PRGs were limited to stretching a seed of n bits to n + o(n) bits. This leaves open the existence of a PRG with a linear (let alone superlinear) stretch in NC0. In this work we study this question and obtain the following main results: We show that the existence of a linear-stretch PRG in NC0 implies non-trivial hardness of approximation results without relying on PCP machinery. In particular, it implies that Max3SAT is hard to approximate to within some multiplicative constant. We construct a linear-stretch PRG in NC0 under a specific intractability assumption related to the hardness of decoding \"sparsely generated\" linear codes. Such an assumption was previously conjectured by Aleklmovich (FOCS 2003).", "paper_title": "On pseudorandom generators with linear stretch in NC0", "paper_id": "WOS:000255413800003"}
