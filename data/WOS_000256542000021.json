In this paper we develop a three-variable VAR model to assess empirically the feasibility of forming a currency union in the Greater China area. The empirical results suggest that, from an economic perspective, it is feasible for the Chinese trio to move toward a currency union because of the increasing symmetry of shocks, the dynamic economic integration among the Greater China economies, and the speed of adjustment to shocks.
