In order to enhance the vocational learning of novices, in close collaboration with expert physiotherapists, we designed an innovative simulator dedicated to the training of infant respiratory physiotherapy. This paper describes the simulator's functionalities and the method used to design its physical structure and the learning paradigm. Firstly, regarding a cognitive approach, relevant vocational and didactic criteria were defined in order to characterize the gesture and determine its limits for a nondangerous practice. Subsequently, we chose physical parameters to assess the criteria and define the specifications of the simulator. The mechatronic functions arose from a didactic transposition of the expected simulation-based functionalities. A 6-month-old infant torso physical structure has been designed with the use of finite element simulations. Its mechanical behaviour provides the possibility to deform the mannequin like a real infant during physiotherapy manoeuvres. A prototype has been realized and validated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
