We report the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs using grating structures of nonlinear materials such as Ti-diffused Lithium Niobate. This approach is useful for quantum integrated optics because the size of this element is less than 325 micron. Polarization-entangled photon pairs are created using the nonlinear optical process of type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The pump laser at 800nm was doubled to a wavelength of 400 nm, which was used to produce SPDC in the grating structure of Lithium Niobate. The entangled photon pairs were generated at wavelengths 692nm and 950 nm. The used grating structure consists of two sections. Grating period and length of the first section are 162nm and 129.6 micron, respectively. Grating period of the second section is 193nm and its length is equal to 193 micron.", "paper_title": "THE GENERATION OF POLARIZATION-ENTANGLED PHOTON PAIRS USING GRATING STRUCTURES OF Ti-DIFFUSED LITHIUM NIOBATE WAVEGUIDES IN INTEGRATED OPTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071900006"}
