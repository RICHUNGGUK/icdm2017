We introduce a new measure of Social Cost, defined as the expectation of the square of the maximum congestion on a link; we call it Quadratic Maximum Social Cost. A Nash equilibrium is a stable state where no user can improve her (expected) latency by switching her mixed strategy; a worst-case Nash equilibrium is one that maximizes Quadratic Maximum Social Cost. In the fully mixed Nash equilibrium, all mixed strategies achieve full support. Formulated within this framework is yet another facet of the FMNE Conjecture, which states that the fully mixed Nash equilibrium is the worst-case Nash equilib-rium. We present an extensive proof of the FMNE Conjecture; the proof employs a combination of combinatorial arguments and analytical estimations.", "paper_title": "Facets of the Fully Mixed Nash Equilibrium Conjecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746800005"}
