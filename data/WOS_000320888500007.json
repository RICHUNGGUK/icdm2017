The gain of the VGA is controlled precisely by using a resistor ladder attenuator and a closed-loop fine gain control block together. The bandwidth of the VGA is extended by applying a compensation technique in the fine gain control block. Implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, the proposed VGA demonstrates a decibel-linear gain range of 24 dB (0-24 dB) with a gain step of 0.1 dB, a gain error < 0.08 dB, a maximum input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 22.8 dBm, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 600 MHz.", "paper_title": "A broadband linear-in-decibel variable gain amplifier with low gain error", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500007"}
