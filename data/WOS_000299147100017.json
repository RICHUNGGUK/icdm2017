Harmonic generator is recommended with the THD and the SNHR about 10 dB better than those of the tested ADC. However, this condition creates problems for testing state-of-the-art ADCs. This paper proposes an easy method for testing signal spectral purity. The test signal, which is passed by two simple analog filters, is measured by a common ADC, whose nonlinearity is post-corrected mathematically. The results are then compared with the common approach of applying a notch filter, and uncertainties of results are evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
