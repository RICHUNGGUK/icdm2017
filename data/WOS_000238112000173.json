Usually, many conventional Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods separate the source signals by estimating separated matrix. Different from this way, we present a new BSS approach in this paper. which achieves BSS by directly identifying the mixing matrix. especially for underdetermined case. Some experiments are conducted to check the validity of the theory and availability of the algorithm in this paper.", "paper_title": "Identification of mixing matrix in blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000173"}
