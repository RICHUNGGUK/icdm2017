In case (I), both lowpass and highpass filters are flipping filters. Filters in case (II) have different lengths, and both lowpass and highpass filters are symmetric (antisymmetric). Based on these parametric expressions, some balanced multiwavelets and analysis- ready multiwavelets (armlets) are constructed. Moreover, the application of these multiwavelets constructed in image processing is also studied.", "paper_title": "Parametrization for balanced multifilter banks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300008"}
