However, building arbitrary shapes using LEGO bricks with restrictive colors and sizes is not trivial. It requires careful design process to produce appealing, stable and constructable brick sculptures. In this work, we investigate the novel problem of constructing brick sculptures from pixel art images. In contrast to previous efforts that focus on 3D models, pixel art contains rich visual contents for generating engaging LEGO designs. On the other hand, the characteristics of pixel art and corresponding brick sculpture pose new challenges to the design process. We present Pixel2Brick, a novel computational framework to automatically construct brick sculptures from pixel art. This is based on implementing a set of design guidelines concerning the visual quality as well as the structural stability of built sculptures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with various brick sculptures (both real and virtual) generated from a variety of pixel art images. Experimental results show that our framework is efficient and gains significant improvements over state-of-the-arts.", "paper_title": "Pixel2Brick: Constructing Brick Sculptures from Pixel Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500033"}
