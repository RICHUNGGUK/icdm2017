On the other hand, fuzzy logic is capable of wisely blending different. parameters. This paper proposes an energy-aware distributed dynamic clustering protocol (EDT) which applies three techniques: (1) non-probabilistic cluster head (CH) elections, (2) fuzzy logic, and (3) on demand clustering. The remaining energy of the nodes is the primary parameter for electing tentative CHs via a non-probabilistic fashion. A non-probabilistic CH election is implemented by introducing a delay inversely proportional to the residual energy of each node. Therefore, tentative CHs are selected based on their remaining energy. In addition, fuzzy logic is employed to evaluate the fitness (cost) of a node in order to choose a final CH from the set of neighboring tentative CHs. On the other hand, every regular (non CH) node elects to connect to the CH with the least fuzzy cost in its neighborhood. Besides, in EDT. CH elections are performed sporadically (in contrast to performing it every round). Simulation results demonstrate that our approach performs better than well known protocols (LEACH, HEED, and CHEF) in terms of extending network lifetime and saving energy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
