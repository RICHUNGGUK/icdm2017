This article discusses the needs of ontology development for data mining. Based on a domain analysis of knowledge representations in data mining. it proposes a generic structure of ontologies for data mining. Furthermore, this article specifies the unique ontology resources of the subdomain of innovative data mining with incomplete data. A project on an ontology-based data mining system for discovering knowledge from incomplete data demonstrates the effectiveness of ontology in knowledge management.", "paper_title": "Ontology for data mining and its application to mining incomplete data", "paper_id": "WOS:000258948700006"}
