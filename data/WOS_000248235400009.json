We give constructions for ternary schedules in which each node is in one of three states: transmitting, receiving, or asleep. For each hop (vi, vj), communication is effective only when vi is transmitting, vj is receiving, and no other node in proximity of vj is also transmitting. Since sensor nodes are prone to failure, the schedules should be independent of the detailed topology while supporting spatial reuse. We use arc-decompositions of the complete A-fold directed graph K-n into directed complete bipartite subgraphs K-ab as a model for ternary scheduling in WSNs. We associate the vertices of K-n with the nodes of the WSN, and occurrences of K(a,b)s (blocks) in the decomposition with time slots in the schedule. A block with out-vertices A and in-vertices B corresponds to a slot in which the a, nodes in A are transmitting, the b in B are receiving, and all others are asleep. Such a decomposition of gimel K-n guarantees that every ordered pair of nodes in the WSN can communicate in gimel time slots.", "paper_title": "Ternary schedules for energy-limited sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235400009"}
