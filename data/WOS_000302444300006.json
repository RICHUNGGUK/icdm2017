Of particular interest is the case with the heavier fluid initially lying above the lighter fluid, so that the system is susceptible to the classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability. An electric field acting in the horizontal direction is imposed on the system and it is shown that it can act to completely suppress Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and produces a dispersive regularization in the model. Dispersion relations are derived and a class of nonlinear traveling waves (periodic and solitary) is computed. Numerical solutions of the initial value problem of the system of model evolution equations that demonstrate a stabilization of Rayleigh-Taylor instability due to the electric field are presented.
