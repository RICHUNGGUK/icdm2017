With the Lyapunov method, a suitable kind of controllers with multiplicative noise is designed to stabilize the chaotic state to the equilibrium point. The method is simple and can be put into practice. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllable conditions.", "paper_title": "CONTROL OF A CLASS OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS BY A STOCHASTIC DELAY METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000277828600003"}
