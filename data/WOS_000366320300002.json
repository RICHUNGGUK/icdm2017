Low-latency pitch detection is achieved by using finger position measurements from a resistive fingerboard to inform audio analysis; the combination outperforming audio-only methods. Bow position and pressure are tracked using four optical reflectance sensors placed on the bow stick, allowing the displacement of the hair to be measured under the force of the string. Both sensor arrangements for this system can be fitted to existing violins without damaging the instrument. A case study demonstrating the utility of these techniques is presented finding fingered and bowed note onsets during performance.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost Real-Time Tracking System for Violin", "paper_id": "WOS:000366320300002"}
