The performance of a system supporting this model is rather low, so weaker models are used to improve the efficiency. However, the construction of application for weaker models is more complicated. The idea of this approach is to provide the data to the application along with the consistency model to which they conform. This allows the application to decide about the quality of accessed data.", "paper_title": "Multi-version coherence protocol for replicated shared objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100001"}
