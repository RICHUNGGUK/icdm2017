Therein, beveloid gears and cycloid gears are increasingly used in industry. Gaining a more comprehensive understanding of those types of gears is essential. However, the measurement of the dynamic response of these gears is not an option due to the high cost of the required experiments. Along with the development of computer technology, several numerical tools and methods to study gears with standard and non-standard flank profiles have been introduced. Various works related to standard gears or beveloid and cycloid gears have been published. In this study, a contemporary review about the modelling and contact simulation of beveloid and cycloid gear drives will be given. Some studies will also be introduced to present an efficient approach to simulate contact forces and contact characteristics of gear wheels with standard and non-standard tooth profiles considering deformations too.", "paper_title": "Review on contact simulation of beveloid and cycloid gears and application of a modern approach to treat deformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000355817600003"}
