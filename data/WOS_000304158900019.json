We characterise the class of all claw-free -perfect graphs by forbidden -minors, and show that they are 3-colourable. Moreover, we determine the chromatic number of claw-free -perfect graphs and give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal colouring.", "paper_title": "On claw-free t-perfect graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158900019"}
