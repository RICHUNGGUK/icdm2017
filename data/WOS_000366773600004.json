The first problem has objective to minimize the sum of minimum weighted distances from every vertex of the tree to the two paths, while the second is to minimize the sum of the weighted minimum distances from every vertex of the tree to the two paths. We develop an O(n(2)) algorithm based on the optimal properties for the first problem, and also an O(n(3)) algorithm for the second problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
