The number of edges of G lying closer to u than to v is denoted by n(eu)(e vertical bar G) and the number of edges of G lying closer to v than to u is denoted by n(ev)(elG). The PI polynomial of G is defined as PI(G; x) = Sigma{u,v}subset of V(G)XN(u,v), Where N(u,v) = n(eu)(e vertical bar G) + n(ev)(e/G), if e = uv; and = 0, otherwise. In this paper, we prove a simple formula which is useful for computing PI polynomial of graphs. Using this formula, the PI polynomial of some important classes of benzenoid graphs, which some of them are related to nanostructures, are computed.", "paper_title": "PI polynomial of some benzenoid graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300011"}
