Types of this kind have received some attention in the recent literature; in particular, it has been shown that they admit guarded iteration. Here, we show that they also admit unguarded iteration, i.e. form complete Elgot monads, provided that the underlying base effect supports unguarded iteration.", "paper_title": "Unguarded Recursion on Coinductive Resumptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600012"}
