A time-dependent switching law is designed to obtain the exponential stabilization conditions of the switched systems with unstabilizable subsystems. Based on the multiple Lyapunov functions method depending on singular perturbation parameters, a domain of attraction is constructed. Furthermore, in order to maximize an estimate of the domain of attraction, convex optimization problems are formulated. Finally, a numerical example is presented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the established results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
