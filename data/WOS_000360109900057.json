Since nowadays more and more of such features are captured and stored in the respective computational systems, an appropriate handling of the resulting information overload becomes a highly relevant issue when it comes to build customer retention systems based on churn prediction models. As a consequence, feature selection is an important step of the classifier construction process. Most feature selection techniques; however, are based on statistically inspired validation criteria, which not necessarily lead to models that optimize goals specified by the respective organization. In this paper we propose a profit-driven approach for classifier construction and simultaneous variable selection based on support vector machines. Experimental results show that our models outperform conventional techniques for feature selection achieving superior performance with respect to business-related goals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
