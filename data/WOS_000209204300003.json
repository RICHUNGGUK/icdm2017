Lower and upper approximation operators of rough sets are applied into group theory and so the notion of rough group has been introduced. In this paper, we further study the properties of rough groups and examine relationships between subgroups and their rough approximations and relationships between a normal series of a group and its rough approximations.", "paper_title": "On rough approximations of groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204300003"}
