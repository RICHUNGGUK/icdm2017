It focuses on achieving high performance and sufficient robustness to uncertainties. The design is mainly applicable to analog implementation, but due to the exceptionally low order, it also results in a fast and efficient digital implementation. Experimental results for an analog implementation using a bucket brigade device (BBD), as well as a digital implementation, is presented. RC can provide fast and accurate tracking of periodic reference signals, which is useful in many scanning probe microscopy and nanofabrication applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
