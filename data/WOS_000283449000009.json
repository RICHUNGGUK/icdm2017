With H the channel transfer matrix, H H(dagger) is a narrow band matrix, a fact that does not permit the use of classical random matrices theory. On the other hand, H H(dagger) is in many aspects similar to a random Schrodinger operator. We relate the per-cell sum-rate capacity of the channel to the integrated density of states of a random Schrodinger operator; the latter is then related to the top Lyapunov exponent of a random sequence of matrices via a version of the Thouless formula. We also derive several bounds on the limiting per-cell sum-rate capacity, some based on the theory of random Schrodinger operators, and some derived from information theoretical considerations. Finally, we get explicit results in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime for some particular cases.", "paper_title": "On Information Rates of the Fading Wyner Cellular Model via the Thouless Formula for the Strip", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000009"}
