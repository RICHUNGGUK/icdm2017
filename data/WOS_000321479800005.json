By introducing a a-dominance relation based on inclusion measures between two interval numbers, we propose a variable-precision-dominance-based rough set approach based on the substitution of indiscernibility relation by the a-dominance relation. The knowledge discovery framework is formulated for interval-valued information systems. Furthermore, knowledge reduction of interval-valued decision systems based on the variable-precision-dominance-based rough set model is postulated. Relationships between these reducts and discemibility matrices are also established to substantiate knowledge reduction in the variable-precision-dominance-based rough set model.
