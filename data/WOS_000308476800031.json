Then using a other distance and combining with generalized Hausdorff distance, the similarity measure is defined. The basic properties of the above-mentioned similarity measure are proved in detail. Finally, the concept is illustrated by solving several testing examples.", "paper_title": "A new similarity measure for generalized fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800031"}
