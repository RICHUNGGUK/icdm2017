These are considered from the point of view of passage retrieval, as a form of document retrieval. A retrievable unit (an element chosen as defining suitable passages for retrieval) is a textual document in its own right, but may inherit information from the other parts of the same document. Again, this inheritance is defined in terms of the XML structure. All retrievable units are mapped onto a common field structure, and the ranking function is a standard document retrieval function with a suitable field weighting. A small experiment to demonstrate the idea, using INEX data, is described.", "paper_title": "XML-structured documents: Retrievable units and inheritance", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000011"}
