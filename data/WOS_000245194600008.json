Preserving energy and ensuring a high delivery ratio of broadcast packets are crucial tasks for broadcasting in ad hoc networks. Using individual broadcast relaying nodes to dynamically vary the transmission range can help saving power and reduce interference during communication. We analyzed the performance of the proposed scheme and compared it to other prevalent broadcast schemes for wireless ad hoc networks based on common-range transmission power.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient broadcast scheme for multihop wireless ad hoc networks using variable-range transmission power", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194600008"}
