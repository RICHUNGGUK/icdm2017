Therefore, ID-based scheme without pairing is of great interest in the field of cryptography. Up to now, there still remains a challenge to construct ID-based signature scheme from quadratic residues. Thus, we aim to meet this challenge by proposing a concrete scheme. In this paper, we first introduce the technique of how to calculate a 2(l)th root of a quadratic residue, and then give a concrete ID-based signature scheme using such technique. We also prove that our scheme is chosen message and ID secure in the random oracle model, assuming the hardness of factoring.", "paper_title": "Identity-based signature scheme based on quadratic residues", "paper_id": "WOS:000247829800010"}
