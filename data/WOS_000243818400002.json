POEMS aims to serve as a repository of efficient implementations of relevant algorithms and be applied to varied applications of interest in research, academia and industry. It allows the user to model systems with varied topologies, and choose between different algorithms for generating and solving the equations of motion as well as for time integration. POEMS utilizes a growing number of solvers, integrators, and system types, which lays a good foundation towards its future development as an optimized, customizable, and parallelizable computational tool for multibody dynamics research and application.", "paper_title": "POEMS: parallelizable open-source efficient multibody software", "paper_id": "WOS:000243818400002"}
