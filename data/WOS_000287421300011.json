An analogous quantum Bochner theorem characterises quasi-joint distributions of components of spin. In both cases quantum states in which a true distribution exists are characterised by the intersection of two convex sets. This may be described explicitly in the spin case as the intersection of the Bloch sphere with a regular tetrahedron whose edges touch the sphere.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM BOCHNER THEOREMS AND INCOMPATIBLE OBSERVABLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287421300011"}
