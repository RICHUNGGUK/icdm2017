In an experimental study, we show that the combination or fusion of the information obtained from decision trees built using the NPIM in a Bagging scheme, can improve the process of classification in multi-class classification noise problems. Via a set of statistical tests, we compared this approach with other successful methods used in similar scheme, on a wide set of data sets. It must be remarked that the new approach has a notably performance, compared with the rest of models, when the level of noise is increased. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
