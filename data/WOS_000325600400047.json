We argue that, just like musical pieces, TEL environments need to be created (i.e., orchestrated), adapted (i.e., arranged) and reified (i.e., conducted), and educational research that attempts to make a practical impact needs to consider all three processes. Further, classroom scripts that distribute learning activities over the social planes of the classroom can be regarded as counterparts of the score in an orchestra, which demonstrates the necessity of careful lesson planning across these social levels. And finally, viewing orchestras (and classrooms) as social entities that consist of different sections or subgroups can foster the development of research methodologies that are capable of dealing with hierarchical data structures.
