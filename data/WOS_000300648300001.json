With respect to the set of decision makers (DMs), we consider two levels of certainty for the results. The first level is related to the necessary or possible consequences of indirect preference information provided by each DM, whereas the other refers to the subset of DMs agreeing for a specific outcome. In this way, we investigate spaces of consensus and disagreement between the DMs. The proposed methods are illustrated by examples showing how they can support real-world group decision.
