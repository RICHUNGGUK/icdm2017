A unique ANNAD-based decision-making process is devised to make this distinction by 1) computing all standard EEG parameters in both time and frequency domain and 2) determining which of these parameters will yield the optimal classifier. The temporal parameters include activity, mobility and complexity, and the frequency parameters include the spectral power in delta, theta, alpha, beta I and II, and gamma. A single layer perceptron was used to conduct this analysis without initially setting any conditions on the weight vector, but rather allowed for the random generation of these conditions, with as many trials as necessary. This is an important first step that confines the search space to only those EEG data that have a very high likelihood of being recorded from epileptic patients, significantly minimizing the time for accurate diagnosis. We have evaluated our system using 125 EEG files selected randomly from a database consisting of 10 subjects (5 non-epileptic and 5 epileptic). The proposed ANNAD system was capable of diagnosing subjects with epilepsy with an accuracy of 92.0.4% and a calculated F-measure of 93.39%.", "paper_title": "CLASSIFICATION AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OF SCALP EEG USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500021"}
