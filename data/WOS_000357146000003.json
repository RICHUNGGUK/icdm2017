Maintaining and improving such representation requires to update the internal model involved in the generation of eye movements. From this perspective, action and perception are thus tightly coupled and interdependent. In this work, we encoded the internal model for oculomotor control with an adaptive filter inspired by the functionality of the cerebellum. Recurrent loops between a feed-back controller and the internal model allow our system to perform accurate binocular saccades and create an implicit representation of the nearby space. Simulation results show that this recurrent architecture outperforms classical feedback-error-learning in terms of both accuracy and sensitivity to system parameters. The proposed approach was validated implementing the framework on an anthropomorphic robotic head. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
