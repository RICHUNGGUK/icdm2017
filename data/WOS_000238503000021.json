The implementation is discussed in the context of 19-velocity (D3Q19) MRT-LBE model in conjunction with the Smagorinsky subgrid closure model. The MRT-LBE-LES is then tested in the turbulent square jet flow case. We compare MRT-LBE-LES results with (a) single-relaxation-time (SRT) or BGK LBE results and (b) experimental data. Computed results include the distribution of centerline mean streamwise velocity, jet spread, and spanwise profiles of mean streamwise velocity in the near-field region. The phenomenon of axis switching is investigated. The advantages of MRT over SRT are demonstrated. Reasonable agreement between our numerical results and experimental data demonstrate that the MRT-LBE is a potentially viable tool for LES of turbulence. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
