Replication software is usually designed to tolerate crash faults, but Byzantine (or arbitrary) faults such as software bugs are well-known to affect transactional database management systems (DBMSs) as many other classes of software. Despite the maturity of replication technology, Byzantine fault-tolerant replication of databases remains a challenging problem. The paper presents MITRA, a middleware for replicating DBMSs and making them tolerant to Byzantine faults. MITRA is designed to offer transparent replication of off-the-shelf DBMSs with replicas from different vendors.", "paper_title": "MITRA: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Middleware for Transaction Processing on Replicated Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000337057600004"}
