We also present a multiple-dimension Markov analytical chain to evaluate the performance of this scheme. Both analytical results and simulation results demonstrate that the new scheme can enhance the radio system performance significantly in terms of blocking probability, dropping probability, and throughput of second users. The proposed scheme can work as a non-server-based channel allocation, which has practical values in real engineering design.
