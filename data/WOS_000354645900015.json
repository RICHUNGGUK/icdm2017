For this purpose, a Matlab/Simulink model and three-phase induction motor models using a finite element method (FEM) software were developed. Besides, some experimental tests were conducted for different values of the induction motor load torque and speed reference to validate the models. Design/methodology/approach - To assess the thermal behavior and efficiency of the motor, electromagnetic and thermal models using a FEM software were developed. The coupling with the inverter drive is accomplished through a developed model in Matlab/Simulink which also includes the control system. The simulation tests were performed for a healthy and faulty inverter at different operating points of the three-phase induction motor. To validate the FEM models some experimental tests were performed. Findings - When the inverter operates in reconfigured mode the motor losses are higher and consequently temperature is higher and the motor efficiency is lower. The developed models are an alternative to a more detailed study of the motor when fed by a 3LNPC inverter and consequent optimization of the control system. Originality/value - With the developed tools, a better understanding of the motor behavior and performance is gained, allowing to forecast scenarios and optimize fault-tolerant control strategies for the drive.", "paper_title": "Thermal analysis and efficiency of an induction motor driven by a fault-tolerant multilevel inverter using FEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000354645900015"}
