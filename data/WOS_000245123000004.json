Their complexity calls for a component-based approach where portlets are the technical enabler. That being the case nowadays portals tend to be constructed by means of portlets, i.e. a multi-step, user-facing application to be delivered through a Web application. The proposal for and ample support given to the WSRP (Web Services for Remote Portlets) portlet standard predict an emerging portlet market. A main requirement for the blossoming of this market is the existence of portlet quality models that assist portal developers to select the appropriate portlet. This paper focuses on usability. The aim, therefore, is to develop a usability model for portlets. The paper presents such a model and its realisation for a sample case.", "paper_title": "Improving a portlet usability model", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123000004"}
