However, complex tradeoffs and correlated design impacts between a parallel application and the underlying multicore platform necessitate an effective and adaptable multithreaded design. This paper introduces a hybrid multithreaded object detection with high parallelism and extensive data reuse. A self adaptable flow is proposed to adjust the multithreaded object detection to fully exploit various embedded multicore architectures. The ARM-based cycle accurate simulations of multicore systems have shown the superior performance returned by the proposed design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
