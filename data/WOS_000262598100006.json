In this method, in order to save space, a modified search-order coding (MSOC) technique first transforms the important image, then, a randomization procedure permutes the transformed image to further increase the security. Finally, a modulus function embeds the permuted code in a cover image; notably, in the modules function, the modulus base used for a pixel is determined according to the variance of its neighboring pixels. Experimental results show that the images are of high quality. Comparisons with reported methods are provided.", "paper_title": "HIDING IMAGES USING MODIFIED SEARCH-ORDER CODING AND MODULUS FUNCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598100006"}
