The images are firstly sparsely represented by a translation invariant dictionary and then the coefficients are denoised using some learned multiscale dictionaries. Dictionaries learning can be reduced to a non-convex l(0)-norm minimization problem with multiple variables, so an evolution-enhanced algorithm is proposed to alternately optimize the variables. Some experiments are taken on comparing the performance of our proposed method with its counterparts on some benchmark natural images, and the superiorities of our proposed method to its counterparts can be observed in both the visual result and some numerical guidelines.
