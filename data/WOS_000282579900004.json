Assume that the driving subsystem and the driven subsystem are both homogeneous and locally uniformly asymptotically stable. If the cascaded term satisfies a given inequality, then the cascaded system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable. Furthermore, in the case that both degrees of homogeneity are negative, the cascaded system is globally uniformly finite-time stable. Compared with the existing methods, the conditions given in this article are much easier to verify. These stability results are applied to the global tracking control problem of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the methods.", "paper_title": "Global uniform asymptotical stability of a class of nonlinear cascaded systems with application to a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000282579900004"}
