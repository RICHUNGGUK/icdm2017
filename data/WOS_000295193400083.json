Among the mining approaches, finding temporal patterns and regularities is very important due to its practicality. In the past, Hong et al. proposed the up-to-date patterns, which were frequent within their up-to-date lifetime. Formally, an up-to-date pattern is a pair with the itemset and its valid corresponding lifetime in which the user-defined minimum support threshold must be satisfied. They also proposed an Apriori-like approach to find the up-to-date patterns. This paper thus proposes the up-to-date pattern tree (UDP tree) to keep the up-to-date 1-patterns in a tree structure for reducing database scan. It is similar to the FP-tree structure but more complex due to the requirement of up-to-date patterns. The UDP-growth mining approach is also designed to find the up-to-date patterns from the UDP tree. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better performance than the level-wise mining algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
