Those superpixels are modeled by multi-variate normal distributions in CIE-Lab color space, which are estimated from the pixels they comprise. This fitting facilitates an efficient application of the Wasserstein distance on the Euclidean norm (W-2) to measure perceptual similarity between elements. Saliency is computed in two ways. On the one hand, we compute global saliency by probabilistically grouping visually similar superpixels into clusters and rate their compactness. On the other hand, we use the same distance measure to determine local center-surround contrasts between superpixels. Then, an innovative locally constrained random walk technique that considers local similarity between elements balances the saliency ratings inside probable objects and background. The results of our experiments show the robustness and efficiency of our approach against 11 recently published state-of-the-art saliency detection methods on five widely used benchmark data sets.", "paper_title": "A Multisize Superpixel Approach for Salient Object Detection Based on Multivariate Normal Distribution Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344481700007"}
