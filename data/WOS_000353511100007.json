The controller design has two main objectives. The first one is to robustify the control law against plant uncertainties. The other one is to achieve good performance by minimising the variance of the error signal. Data losses are modelled as an independent and identically distributed sequence of Bernoulli random variables. For analysis and design, this random variable is replaced by an additive noise plus gain channel model. To cope with structural uncertainties in the model of the plant, an H-infinity control technique is employed. The controller is synthesised in order to make the closed-loop system robust against structural uncertainties of the nominal model, while achieving optimal performance of the system in the presence of dropouts.", "paper_title": "An H-infinity suboptimal robust control approach for systems with uncertainties and data dropouts", "paper_id": "WOS:000353511100007"}
