For instance, a stop sign is a piece of information implanted in a particular location. In this paper, we propose a storage underlay platform called \"ELIAS\" (Every Location Is A Storage) for a mobile peer-to-peer system. ELIAS enables user applications to transparently save/retrieve data items to/from a location without concerning with low-level detailed implementation. The underlying platform chooses appropriate mobile nodes to store/retrieve data items. We discuss an efficient implementation of ELIAS, and present a detailed analytical model that is validated by simulation. Finally, we show results of sensitivity analysis on a variety of factors that impact the performance of ELIAS.", "paper_title": "ELIAS: An Efficient Storage Underlay for Mobile Peer-to-Peer Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295163500010"}
