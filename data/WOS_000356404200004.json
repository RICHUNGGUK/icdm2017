Due to the lack of a dedicated synchronization link, the usage of navigation signals and the system complexity, traditional synchronization and imaging solutions are not applicable for GNSS-based BSAR. To resolve this problem, this paper focuses on the integrative signal processing algorithm for GNSS-based BSAR. Firstly, to remove the effect of navigation signals, synchronization pre-processing is developed. Then the principle of measuring errors neutralization is theoretically proved by considering the geometric peculiarity of the system. Based on this principle, an integrative synchronization and imaging algorithm is proposed. Finally, the validity of the developed algorithm is confirmed by experimentally obtained data.", "paper_title": "An integrative synchronization and imaging algorithm for GNSS-based BSAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000356404200004"}
