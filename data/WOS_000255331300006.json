Accordingly, we develop a generic variable step-size adaptive filter. Variable step-size normalized LMS (VSSNLMS) and VSS affine projection algorithms (VSSAPA) are particular examples of adaptive algorithms covered by this generic variable step-size adaptive filter. In this paper we introduce two new VSS adaptive filter algorithms named the variable step-size BNLMS (VSSBNLMS) and the variable step-size NDRLMS (VSSNDRLMS) based on the generic VSS adaptive filter. The proposed algorithms show the higher convergence rate and lower steady-state mean square error compared to the ordinary BNLMS and NDRLMS algorithms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
