Enhancing such applications with olfactory stimuli has the potential to create a more complex-and richer-user multimedia experience, by heightening the sense of reality and diversifying user interaction modalities. Nonetheless, olfaction-enhanced multimedia still remains a challenging research area. More recently, however, there have been initial signs of olfactory-enhanced applications in multimedia, with olfaction being used towards a variety of goals, including notification alerts, enhancing the sense of reality in immersive applications, and branding, to name but a few. However, as the goal of a multimedia application is to inform and/or entertain users, achieving quality olfaction-enhanced multimedia applications from the users' perspective is vital to the success and continuity of these applications. Accordingly, in this paper we have focused on investigating the user perceived experience of olfaction-enhanced multimedia applications, with the aim of discovering the quality evaluation factors that are important from a user's perspective of these applications, and consequently ensure the continued advancement and success of olfaction-enhanced multimedia applications.", "paper_title": "Olfaction-enhanced multimedia: perspectives and challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000294504600011"}
