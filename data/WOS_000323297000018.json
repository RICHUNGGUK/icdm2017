A new opportunity for the application of statistical methods is driven by growing interest in biometric performance evaluation. Methods for performance evaluation seek to identify, compare and interpret how characteristics of subjects, the environment and images are associated with the performance of recognition algorithms. Some central topics in face recognition are reviewed for background and several examples of recognition algorithms are given. One approach to the evaluation problem is then illustrated with a generalized linear mixed model analysis of the Good, Bad, and Ugly Face Challenge, a pre-eminent face recognition dataset used to test state-of-the-art still-image face recognition algorithms. Findings include that (i) between-subject variation is the dominant source of verification heterogeneity when algorithm performance is good, and (ii) many covariate effects on verification performance are 'universal' across easy, medium and hard verification tasks. Although the design and evaluation of face recognition algorithms draw upon some familiar statistical ideas in multivariate statistics, dimension reduction, classification, clustering, binary response data, generalized linear models and random effects, the field also presents some unique features and challenges. Opportunities abound for innovative statistical work in this new field. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
