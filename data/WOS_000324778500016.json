In particular, positions of superhelically destabilized regions correlate with regulatory sites along the genome. Based on a self-consistent linearization of a thermodynamic model of superhelical DNA introduced by Benham, we have developed a program that predicts the locations of these regions by efficiently computing base-pair and bubble opening probabilities in genomic DNA. The program allows visualization of results in standard genome browsers to compare DNA opening properties with other available datasets.", "paper_title": "Twist-DNA: computing base-pair and bubble opening probabilities in genomic superhelical DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000324778500016"}
