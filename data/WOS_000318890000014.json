We present new combinatorial results for V-order, in particular concatenation under V-order. We propose linear-time RAM algorithms for string comparison in V-order and for Lyndon-like factorization of a string into V-words. This asymptotic efficiency thus matches that of the corresponding algorithms for lexicographical order. Finally, we introduce Hybrid Lyndon words as a generalization of standard Lyndon words, and hence propose extensions of factorization algorithms to other forms of order. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
