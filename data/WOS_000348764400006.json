The pair (V, F) determines a vector bundle E of rank s-p over W := {x is an element of V vertical bar rk F(x) = p}. We associate with (V, F) a descending chain of degeneracy loci of E (the generic polar varieties of V represent a typical example of this situation). The maximal degree of these degeneracy loci constitutes the essential ingredient for the uniform, bounded-error probabilistic pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm that we will design and that solves a series of computational elimination problems that can be formulated in this framework. We describe applications to polynomial equation solving over the reals and to the computation of a generic fiber of a dominant endomorphism of an affine space.", "paper_title": "Degeneracy Loci and Polynomial Equation Solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000348764400006"}
