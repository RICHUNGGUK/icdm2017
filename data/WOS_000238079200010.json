It is a part of the AVS (Audio and Video coding Standard) of China. AVS Trusted Decoder (ATD) that plays back digital media program according to rights conditions is the core of AVS DRM architecture. Adaptation layers are responsible for translating or negotiating between ATD and peripheral systems. The Packaging Adaptation Layer (PAL), Licensing Adaptation Layer (LAL) and Rendering Adaptation Layer (RAL) will help ATD to gain the interoperability in various DRM environments.", "paper_title": "Basic considerations on AVS DRM architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238079200010"}
