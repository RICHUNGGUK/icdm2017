Introduction of new neuropsychological rehabilitation tools based both on the new knowledge on brain plasticity and on the latest developments in computer sciences is both necessary and scientifically challenging for health professionals, particularly neuropsychologists. Here we present a pilot study in which the use of a new Apple iPad software for neuropsychological rehabilitation, has demonstrated high level of appreciation and efficacy in cognitive rehabilitation.", "paper_title": "Rehabilitation Tool: A Pilot Study On A New Neuropsychological Interactive Training System", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900031"}
