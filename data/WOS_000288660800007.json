Workload characterization is crucial in IP traffic engineering to deploy an efficient network. However, traffic characteristics in commercial multiservice IP networks aren't well known because relevant datasets are rarely available. This article presents statistical analysis and modeling results of multimedia workload characteristics in a nationwide commercial IP network in Korea. The authors survey broadband Internet service market trends and the growth of network multimedia services. To investigate workload characteristics, they analyze service log information and session-level traffic models.", "paper_title": "Analyzing and Modeling Workload Characteristics in a Multiservice IP Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000288660800007"}
