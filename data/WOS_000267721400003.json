We can show for simply generated tree families that the mean and the variance of each of the three parameters under consideration behave for a randomly chosen tree of size it asymptotically similar to mu z and similar to nu n, where the constants mu and nu depend on the tree family and the parameter studied. Furthermore we show for all parameters, suitably normalized, convergence in distribution to a Gaussian distributed random variable. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
