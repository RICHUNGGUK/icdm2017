Typically, the set of obtained results is extensive containing many non-interesting documents and consists in a flat list, i.e., not organized or indexed in any way. This work proposes BioDR, a novel approach that allows the semantic indexing of the results of a query, by identifying relevant terms in the documents. These terms emerge from a process of Named Entity Recognition that annotates occurrences of biological terms (e.g. genes or proteins) in abstracts or full-texts. The system is based on a learning process that builds an Enhanced Instance Retrieval Network (EIRN) from a set of manually classified documents, regarding their relevance to a given problem. The resulting EIRN implements the semantic indexing of documents and terms, allowing for enhanced navigation and visualization tools, as well as the assessment of relevance for new documents.
