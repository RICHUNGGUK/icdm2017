The finite volume method proposed by Peng et al. works on unstructured grids, thus allowing an increased geometrical flexibility. However, the method suffers from substantial numerical instability compared to the standard LBE models. The computational efficiency of the scheme is not competitive with standard methods. We propose an alternative way of discretizing the convection operator using an upwind scheme, as opposed to the central scheme described by Peng et al. We apply our method to some test problems in two spatial dimensions to demonstrate the improved stability of the new scheme and the significant improvement in computational efficiency. Comparisons with a lattice Boltzmann solver working on a hierarchical grid were done and we found that currently finite volume methods for the discrete Boltzmann equation are not yet competitive as stand alone fluid solvers.
