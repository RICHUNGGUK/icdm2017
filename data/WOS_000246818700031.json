The parameters of the proposed algorithm are extracted through a theoretical analysis and an experimental estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed modified Gaussian filter is effective for the arbitrary scale LP enlargement method.", "paper_title": "A modified Gaussian filter for the arbitrary scale LP enlargement method", "paper_id": "WOS:000246818700031"}
