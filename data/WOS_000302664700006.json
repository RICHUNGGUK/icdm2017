We previously presented a cell micropatterning technique that localizes live cells within hydrogels using dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces. We also demonstrated the ability to modulate tissue function through the control of microscale cell architecture. In this study, we developed a novel cell patterning technology for accumulating cells around collagen microbeads using DEP forces. As a case study, we produced collagen-alginate microbeads as a cell-adhesive scaffold and accumulated bovine chondrocytes to cover the microbeads by combining the DEP forces with a flow of buffer solution. This approach allows studies to better examine the influence of three-dimensional cellular architecture on microscale levels.", "paper_title": "CONTROL OF CELLULAR ORGANIZATION AROUND COLLAGEN BEADS USING DIELECTROPHORESIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664700006"}
