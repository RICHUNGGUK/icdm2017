In this letter, a fast Intra mode decision algorithm using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients distribution is proposed to reduce the H.264 encoder complexity. The proposed method reduces the encoder complexity on average 63.44%. while the coding efficiency is slightly decreased compared with the H.264/AVC encoder.", "paper_title": "Fast Intra Mode Decision Using DCT Coefficient Distribution in H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000276761000014"}
