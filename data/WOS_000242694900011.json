Nowadays the competition among companies, joined to the environmental protection rules, is so compelling that they should not only be on the top of technology in the area, but also run their business according to life-long models. The emphasis on the product post-sale life is common for these models. The most popular model is Product Life-cycle Management, for manufacturing companies, or Service Engineering (SE), for service-oriented companies, and, for both, common paradigms are in maintenance, with conformance-to-use certification. The paper introduces some basic research results achieved in the application of Ambient Intelligence, and suggests considering maintenance as a cross section of the two business paradigms. The importance of SE is specially underlined in this work. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
