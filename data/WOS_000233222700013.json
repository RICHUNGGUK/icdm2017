The analysis of the function is linked to spectral decomposition of the Laplacian of a graph. Moreover, the function is maximized using two algorithms. Experimental results show the effectiveness and some specific characteristics of our algorithms. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
