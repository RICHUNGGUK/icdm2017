Our protocol is secure against an active adversary which may adaptively corrupt up to some constant fraction of the players. The protocol can be implemented in a constant number rounds assuming the existence of a \"computationally simple\" pseudorandom generator, or in a small non-constant number of rounds assuming an arbitrary pseudorandom generator.", "paper_title": "Scalable secure multiparty computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079900030"}
