In this paper, we develop an O(k4(k)n(3)) time algorithm for this problem, significantly improving the previous algorithm of time O(4k(3)n(5)) for the problem. Our result gives the first polynomial time algorithm for the MINIMUM NODE MULTIWAY CUT problem when the separator size is bounded by O(log n).", "paper_title": "An Improved Parameterized Algorithm for the Minimum Node Multiway Cut Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000266337100001"}
