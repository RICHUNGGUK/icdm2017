In particular, we focus on simple and multiple 'bottlenecks', and on 'swamps'. Existing theoretical results are surveyed, some numerical algorithms are described in details, and their numerical complexity is calculated. In particular, the interest in using the enhanced line search (ELS) enhancement in these algorithms is discussed. Computer simulations feed this discussion.
