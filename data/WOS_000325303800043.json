However, such a feature is often deteriorated by redundant electrode channels which may result in low classification accuracy, extra subsequent computational load and difficulty in understanding which part of the brain relates to classification-relevant activity. In this paper, we present a channel selection method to deal with these problems, in which an improved genetic algorithm based on the Rayleigh coefficient feature is conducted to determine the optimal subset of channels. Experiment results on two motor imagery EEG datasets verify that our method is effective in channel selection for classifying motor imagery EEG signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
