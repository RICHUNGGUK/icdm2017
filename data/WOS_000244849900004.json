This compares to an upper bound of about O(n(0.25)n!/2(n)) for arbitrary tournaments due to Friedgut and Kahn (somewhat improving Alon's bound of O(n(0.5)n!/2(n))). A key ingredient of the proof is a martingale analysis of self-avoiding walks on a regular tournament.", "paper_title": "Hamiltonian cycles in regular tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000244849900004"}
