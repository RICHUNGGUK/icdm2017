Employing the comparison principles and the theory of differential inequalities, stability and instability, involving two measures, of impulsive stochastic functional differential systems are investigated. Several stability and instability criteria are obtained, and two examples are also given to illustrate our results.", "paper_title": "Stability of impulsive stochastic functional differential systems in terms of two measures via comparison approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300008"}
