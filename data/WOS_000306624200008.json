The synthesis is done on the basis of inheriting features from inter and intra face classes in face space. Face images without artifacts and expressions are transformed to images with artifacts and expressions with the help of the developed methods. Most of the test images are generated using the proposed method. The measured PSNR values for the generated faces with respect to the training faces reflect the well accepted quality of the generated images. The generated faces are also classified properly to their respective face classes using nearest neighbor classifier. Validation of the method is demonstrated on AR and FIA datasets. Classification accuracy is increased when the new generated faces are added to the training set. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
