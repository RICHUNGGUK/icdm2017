Assuming that the transmitter locations are distributed as a Poisson point process, this paper derives upper and lower bounds on the transmission capacity of an ad-hoc network when each node is equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter either uses eigen multi-mode beamforming or a subset of its antennas without channel information to transmit multiple data streams, while the receiver uses partial zero forcing to cancel certain interferers using some of its spatial receive degrees of freedom (SRDOF). The receiver either cancels the nearest interferers or those interferers that maximize the post-cancellation signal-to-interference ratio. Using the obtained bounds, the optimal number of data streams to transmit, and the optimal SRDOF to use for interference cancellation are derived that provide the best scaling of the transmission capacity with the number of antennas. With beamforming, single data stream transmission together with using all but one SRDOF for interference cancellation is optimal, while without beamforming, single data stream transmission together with using a fraction of the total SRDOF for interference cancellation is optimal.", "paper_title": "Transmission Capacity of Ad-hoc Networks With Multiple Antennas Using Transmit Stream Adaptation and Interference Cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900019"}
