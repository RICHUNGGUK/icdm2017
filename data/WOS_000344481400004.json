The proposed algorithm is based on algebraic distance minimization and consists of solving a few generalized eigenvalue (or singular value) problems and is not iterative. Nonetheless, the algorithm produces accurate estimates, close to those obtained with maximum likelihood, while the constraints are also guaranteed to be satisfied. Important special cases, fitting ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipsoids to noisy data are discussed.", "paper_title": "Constrained quadratic errors-in-variables fitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000344481400004"}
