Built upon the local binary patterns that are encoded at multiple scales, a statistical descriptor, called pattern fractal spectrum, characterizes the self-similar behavior of the local pattern distributions by calculating fractal dimension on each type of pattern. Compared with other fractal-based approaches, the proposed descriptor is compact, highly distinctive and computationally efficient. We applied the descriptor to texture classification. Our method has demonstrated excellent performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on four challenging benchmark datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.
