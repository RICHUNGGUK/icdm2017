A local adaptive model is proposed to investigate the effects of local information on the opinion formation, including local rewiring and influencing mechanism. The results show that under the local adaptive mechanism, systems could reach steady state of consensus or fragmentation. Considering the local influencing factor only, we find that transition occurs under proper condition and local parameter affects the transition point. At last, the diversity of opinions is considered, and hierarchic social entropy is used as a macroscopic measurement which is proved to be well. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
