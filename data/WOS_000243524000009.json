However, this proof is made only in a weak sense that the conjecture is true when the global optimal solution of an independent component analysis criterion is reached. Thus, it cannot support the successes of many existing iterative algorithms that usually converge at one of the local optimal solutions. This article presents a new mathematical proof that is obtained in a strong sense that the conjecture is also true when any one of local optimal solutions is reached in helping to investigating convex-concave programming on a polyhedral set. Theorems are also provided not only on partial separation of sources when there is a partial matching between the kurtosis signs, but also on an interesting duality of maximization and minimization on source separation. Moreover, corollaries are obtained on an interesting duality, with supergaussian sources separated by maximization and subgaussian sources separated by minimization. Also, a corollary is obtained to confirm the symmetric orthogonalization implementation of the kurtosis extreme approach for separating multiple sources in parallel, which works empirically but lacks mathematical proof. Furthermore, a linkage has been set up to combinatorial optimization from a distribution approximation perspective and a Stiefel manifold perspective, with algorithms that guarantee convergence as well as satisfaction of constraints.", "paper_title": "One-bit-matching theorem for ICA, convex-concave programming on polyhedral set, and distribution approximation for combinatorics", "paper_id": "WOS:000243524000009"}
