Service is skill-based, so that server m(i) can serve a subset of job types C(m(i)). Waiting jobs are served on a first-come-first-served basis, while arriving jobs that find several idle servers are assigned to a feasible server randomly. We show that there exist assignment probabilities under which the system has a product-form stationary distribution, and obtain explicit expressions for it. We also derive waiting time distributions in steady state.", "paper_title": "A product form solution to a system with multi-type jobs and multi-type servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000301604100003"}
