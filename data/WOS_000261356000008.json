Although spatial information is necessary for performing basic robot operations (navigation and localization), the use of deeper domain knowledge is pivotal to endow a robot with higher degrees of autonomy and intelligence. In this paper, we focus oil semantic knowledge, and show how this type of knowledge call be profitably used for robot task planning. We start by defining a specific type of semantic maps, which integrates hierarchical spatial information and semantic knowledge. We then proceed to describe how these semantic maps can improve task planning in two ways: extending the capabilities of the planner by reasoning about semantic information, and improving the planning efficiency in large domains. We show several experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions in a domain involving robot navigation in a domestic environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
