The steel slags used in this study included basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag and desulfurization slag (DS), which replaced 5-50% of natural river sand by weight in cement mixtures. The steel slag mortars were tested by high-temperature (100 degrees C) curing for 96 h and autoclave expansion. The results showed that the effects of the steel slag content varied based on the free lime (f-CaO) content. No more than 30% of the natural river sand should be replaced with steel slag to avoid fracture failure. The expansion fracture threshold value was 0.10%, above which there was a risk of potential failure. Based on the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, the high-temperature catalysis resulted in the immediate extrusion of peripheral hydration products from the calcium hydroxide crystals, leading to a local stress concentration and, eventually, deformation and cracking.", "paper_title": "Expansion behavior of low-strength steel slag mortar during high-temperature catalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000362034400005"}
