Moreover, the resulting wavelet transforms have a linear computational complexity, as they are composed of local and in-place lifting operations only. Feature lines can also be effectively integrated into the wavelet transforms as self-governed boundary curves. The introduced wavelet analysis can be used in a variety of applications such as progressive transmission, data compression, shape approximation and multi resolution rendering. The experiments have shown sufficient stability as well as better performance of the introduced wavelet analysis, as compared to the existing wavelet analyses for quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology.
