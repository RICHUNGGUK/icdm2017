However, how the encrypted data stored in public clouds can be effectively shared becomes a new challenge. Proxy re-encryption is a public-key primitive that can delegate the decryption right from one user to another. In a proxy re-encryption system, a semi-trusted proxy authorized by a data owner is allowed to transform an encrypted data under the data owner's public key into a re-encrypted data under an authorized recipient's public key without seeing the underlying plaintext. Hence, the paradigm of proxy re-encryption provides a promising solution to effectively share encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a new certificate-based proxy re-encryption scheme for encrypted data sharing in public clouds. In the random oracle model, we formally prove that the proposed scheme achieves chosen-ciphertext security. The simulation results show that it is more efficient than the previous certificate-based proxy re-encryption schemes.", "paper_title": "Efficient Certificate-Based Proxy Re-encryption Scheme for Data Sharing in Public Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000358997000021"}
