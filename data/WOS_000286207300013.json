Recently, Chien proposed an ultralightweight RFID authentication protocol in order to achieve privacy and authenticity with limited computation and transmission resources. However, we find two desynchronization attacks to break the protocol. In order to repair the protocol, two patches that slightly modify the protocol are presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "On the Security of Chien's Ultralightweight RFID Authentication Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000286207300013"}
