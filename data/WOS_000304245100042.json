These chips are highly vulnerable to a special type of byte error, called an m-spotty byte error, which can be effectively detected or corrected using byte error-control codes. In this paper, we present joint m-spotty weight enumerator and split m-spotty weight enumerator for byte error-control codes over the ring of integers modulo l (l >= 2 is an integer) and over arbitrary finite fields. We also derive MacWilliams type identities for each of the aforementioned enumerators and discuss some of their applications.", "paper_title": "MacWilliams Type Identities for Some New m-Spotty Weight Enumerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100042"}
