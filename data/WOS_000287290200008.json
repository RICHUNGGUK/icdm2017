The proposed method is suitable for both grid and quadtree data structures. As for distribution strategy, cross distribution of the dataset would be more efficient than serial distribution in terms of non-redundant datasets, since a dataset is more uniformly distributed in the former arrangement. However, redundant datasets are necessary in order to meet the frequent need of input and output operations in multi-client scenarios: the first copy would be distributed by a cross distribution strategy while the second (and later) would be distributed by an iterated exchanging distribution strategy. Such a distribution strategy would distribute datasets more uniformly to each data server. In data retrieval, a greedy algorithm is used to allocate the query task to a data server, where the computing load is lightest if the data block needing to be retrieved is stored among multiple data servers. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can satisfy the demands of frequent and fast data query. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
