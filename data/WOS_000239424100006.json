A probability measure is given and a version of the Martin-Lof Test for randomness is defined. 1720 random closed sets exist but there are no random Pi(0)(1) closed sets. It is shown that a random closed set is perfect, has measure 0, and has no computable elements. A closed subset of 2(N) may be defined as the set of infinite paths through a tree and so the problem of compressibility of trees is explored. This leads to some results on a Chaitin-style notion of randomness for closed sets.", "paper_title": "Random closed sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100006"}
