However, it is common that not all the time scales are of interest for a particular problem. When the long time scales are of primary interest, a number of techniques are available to eliminate the unwanted short time scales from consideration. When the short time scales are of primary interest, a technique for mitigating the consequences of anomalously long time scales is needed. The \"slow-time acceleration\" technique presented here has been developed to address this problem. In the slow-time acceleration technique, a modified evolution equation is developed in which the longest time scale is much shorter than that of the original system, and which has the same multi-time scale asymptotic structure as the original system. As an example, this approach is applied to the numerical simulation of solid-propellant rockets in which the long time scale is associated with the regression of the burning propellant.
