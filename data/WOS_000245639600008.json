Based on the Progressive Edge-Growth (PEG) algorithm, a new algorithm which can both eliminate short cycles and keep the distribution of the random code structure is presented. The experimental results show that the performance of the irregular LDPC codes constructed by the new algorithm is superior to that of the PEG algorithm.", "paper_title": "Study on the distribution law of random code structure of irregular LDPC codes and its application in eliminating short cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000245639600008"}
