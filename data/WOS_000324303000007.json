In the Internet of Things, where a plethora of connected devices produces and consumes information, there are many actors who will play the roles of context providers and context consumers. However, in a global environment, acquisition, processing and consumption of user's context information would be much easier if performed in a controlled and ordered fashion within an information exchange framework. In this paper, a proposal for a Convergent Context Enabler (CCE) is described and specific details are provided about the user's context processing and the interfaces designed to support the architecture. Finally, a use case of context-aware services in the Internet of Things is presented and analysed in detail.", "paper_title": "Intelligent context retrieval and management for services in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000324303000007"}
