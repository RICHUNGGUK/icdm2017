[1], Borozan and Cornuejols [6] and Cornuejols and Margot [9] have characterized the extreme valid inequalities of a mixed integer set consisting of two equations with two free integer variables and non-negative continuous variables. These inequalities are either split cuts or intersection cuts derived using maximal lattice-free convex sets. In order to use these inequalities to obtain cuts from two rows of a general simplex tableau, one approach is to extend the system to include all possible non-negative integer variables (giving the two row mixed-integer infinite-group problem), and to develop lifting functions giving the coefficients of the integer variables in the corresponding inequalities. In this paper, we study the characteristics of these lifting functions. We show that there exists a unique lifting function that yields extreme inequalities when starting from a maximal lattice-free triangle with multiple integer points in the relative interior of one of its sides, or a maximal lattice-free triangle with integral vertices and one integer point in the relative interior of each side. In the other cases (maximal lattice-free triangles with one integer point in the relative interior of each side and non-integral vertices, and maximal lattice-free quadrilaterals), non-unique lifting functions may yield distinct extreme inequalities. For the latter family of triangles, we present sufficient conditions to yield an extreme inequality for the two row mixed-integer infinite-group problem.", "paper_title": "Two row mixed-integer cuts via lifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000280154400009"}
