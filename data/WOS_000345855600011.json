Given a surface or volumetric domain equipped with a Riemannian metric that encodes the desired anisotropy, we transform the problem to one of functional approximation. We construct a convex function over each mesh simplex whose Hessian locally matches the Riemannian metric, and iteratively adapt vertex positions and mesh connectivity to minimize the difference between the target convex functions and their piecewise-linear interpolation over the mesh. Our method generalizes optimal Delaunay triangulation and leads to a simple and efficient algorithm. We demonstrate its quality and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods on a variety of domains and metrics.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Simplicial Meshing Using Local Convex Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600011"}
