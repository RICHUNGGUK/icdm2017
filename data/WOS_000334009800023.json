Particularly the design of overcurrent relay coordination in such system is an independent area of research. With the availability of new artificial based optimization algorithm relay coordination research gain a new momentum. Well established artificial based optimization algorithm such as genetic and particle swam optimization are successfully applied for such applications. This paper discusses the application of informative differential evolution algorithm with self adaptive re-clustering technique for selection of TDS and PSM for optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays. Both continuous as well as discrete version of informative differential evolution algorithm are used for optimization of relay setting. Proper combination of backup relays for each primary relay are identified by using LINKNET graph theory approach. Coordination of directional overcurrent is developed for 9 bus and IEEE 30 bus distribution systems. The aim of problem is to minimize the total operating time of primary relays and eliminate the miscoordination among the primary and backup relay pairs. Discrete types of settings for electromechanical types of relay are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, the relay coordination problem is modified for providing optimal coordination time interval between 0.2 and 0.8 s among all primary and backup relays pairs. The results are compared with hybrid of genetic algorithm - nonlinear programming and sequential quadratic programming. Digsilient power factory software is used for verification of result.
