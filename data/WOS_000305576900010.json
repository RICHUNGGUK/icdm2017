The proposed scheme has two placement methods, distributed and continuous placement. Distributed placement method has better PAPR reduction and BER performances under the solid state power amplifier (SSPA)-type nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) model, while the number of total subcarriers increases. In contrast, continuous placement performs better while the number of total subcarriers decreases.", "paper_title": "Tone Placement Methods for PAPR Reduction under the SSPA-Type Nonlinear HPA Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900010"}
