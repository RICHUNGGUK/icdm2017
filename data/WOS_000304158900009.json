In this paper we construct the theta bodies of the vanishing ideal of cycles in a binary matroid. Applied to cuts in graphs, this yields a new hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of the cut polytope of the graph. If the binary matroid avoids certain minors we can characterize when the first theta body in the hierarchy equals the cycle polytope of the matroid. Specialized to cuts in graphs, this result solves a problem posed by Lovasz.", "paper_title": "A new semidefinite programming hierarchy for cycles in binary matroids and cuts in graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158900009"}
