First, theoretical optimality of a simple layered scheme is shown; then, a practical coding scheme based on a simple modification of standard binary LDPC decoding is proposed. The decoder is derived from first principles and using a factor-graph representation of a front end that maps q-ary symbols to groups of m bits connected to a binary code. The front end can be processed with a complexity that is linear in m = log(2) q. An extrinsic information transfer chart analysis is carried out and used for code optimization. Finally, it is shown how the same decoder structure can also be applied to a larger class of q-ary channels.", "paper_title": "A Fresh Look at Coding for q-ary Symmetric Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000310156500021"}
