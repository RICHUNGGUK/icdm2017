Within the Bayesian formulation, the proposed methodology incorporates prior knowledge on the expected characteristics of multispectral images; that is, it imposes smoothness within each band by means of the energy associated with the a\"\"1 norm of vertical and horizontal first order differences of image pixel values and also takes into account the correlation among the bands of the multispectral image. The observation process is modeled using the sensor characteristics of both panchromatic and multispectral images. The method is tested on real and synthetic images, compared with other pansharpening methods, and the quality of the results assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "paper_title": "Super Resolution of Multispectral Images using l1 Image Models and Interband Correlations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296798200019"}
