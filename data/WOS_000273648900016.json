A new bias-compensation based method, named the bias-compensated instrumental variable type (BCIV-type) method, has been proposed for the quantized EIV models identification. The proposed BCIV-type method is based on compensation of asymptotic bias on the instrumental variable type (IV-type) estimates by making use of noises variances and quantization. errors variances estimates. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can give consistent parameter estimate via simulation results.", "paper_title": "IDENTIFICATION OF ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES MODELS FROM QUANTIZED INPUT-OUTPUT MEASUREMENTS VIA BIAS-COMPENSATED INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TYPE METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900016"}
