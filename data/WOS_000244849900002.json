We give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the Tutte polynomial of a multi-path matroid, we describe their basis activities, and we prove some basic structural properties. Key elements of this work are two complementary perspectives we develop for these matroids: on the one hand, multi-path matroids are transversal matroids that have special types of presentations; on the other hand, the bases of multi-path matroids can be viewed as sets of lattice paths in certain planar diagrams.", "paper_title": "Multi-path matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000244849900002"}
