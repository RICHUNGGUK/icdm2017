The proposed GVG has a faster Gaussian sample generation rate and higher tail accuracy with a lower hardware cost than published designs. The GVG design can be readily configured to achieve arbitrary tail accuracy (i.e., with a proposed 16-bit datapath tip to +/- 15 times the standard deviation sigma) with only small variations in hardware utilization, and without degrading the output sample rate. Polynomial curve fitting is utilized along with a hybrid (i.e., combination of logarithmic and uniform) segmentation and a scaling scheme to maintain accuracy. A typical instantiation of the proposed GVG occupies only 534 configurable slices, two on-chip block memories, and three dedicated multipliers of the Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V4000-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and operates at 248 MHz, generating 496 million Gaussian variates (GVs) per second within a range of +/- 6.66 sigma. To accurately achieve a range of +/- 9.4 sigma, the GVG uses 852 configurable slices, three block memories, and three on-chip dedicated multipliers of the same FPGA while still operating at 248 MHz, generating 496 million GVs per second. The core area and performance of a GVG implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology are also given. The statistical characteristics of the GVG are evaluated and confirmed using multiple standard statistical goodness-of-fit tests.", "paper_title": "A compact and accurate Gaussian variate generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000258762700003"}
