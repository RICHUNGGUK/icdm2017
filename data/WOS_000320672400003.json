This is also known as Guy's conjecture as he later popularized it. Towards the end of the century, substantially different drawings of K-n with Z(n) crossings were found. These drawings are 2-page book drawings, that is, drawings where all the vertices are on a line l (the spine) and each edge is fully contained in one of the two half-planes (pages) defined by l. The 2-page crossing number of K-n, denoted by nu(2)(K-n), is the minimum number of crossings determined by a 2-page book drawing of K-n. Since cr(K-n)<= nu(2)(K-n) and nu(2)(K-n) <= Z(n), a natural step towards Hill's Conjecture is the weaker conjecture nu(2)(K-n) = Z(n), popularized by Vrt'o. In this paper we develop a new technique to investigate crossings in drawings of K-n, and use it to prove that nu(2)(K-n) = Z(n). To this end, we extend the inherent geometric definition of -edges for finite sets of points in the plane to topological drawings of K-n. We also introduce the concept of <=<= k-edges as a useful generalization of <= k-edges and extend a powerful theorem that expresses the number of crossings in a rectilinear drawing of K-n in terms of its number of <= k-edges to the topological setting. Finally, we give a complete characterization of crossing minimal 2-page book drawings of K-n and show that, up to equivalence, they are unique for n even, but that there exist an exponential number of non homeomorphic such drawings for n odd.", "paper_title": "The 2-Page Crossing Number of", "paper_id": "WOS:000320672400003"}
