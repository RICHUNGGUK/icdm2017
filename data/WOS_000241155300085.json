In our approach, the selection of methods is based on method execution statistics that are constantly gathered in our prototype system. Based on the statistics, the prototype selects methods whose materialization is profitable. The proposed mechanism was extensively evaluated by experiments whose results are shown in this paper.", "paper_title": "Dynamic method materialization: A framework for optimizing data access via methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300085"}
