We use fuzzy AHP in the first stage of the proposed model to account for the inherent ambiguity and vagueness in real-life maintenance scheduling problems. In the second stage, we use TOPSIS to reduce the multi-objective problem into an efficient bi-objective problem. Finally, we use GP to solve the resulting bi-objective problem and develop an optimal maintenance schedule in the third stage of the model. We use a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
