The techniques sample the parameter space using example motions, and interpolate them to compute the blend weights corresponding to the given parameters. A main problem of the techniques is that, as the dimension n of the parameter space increases, the number of required example motions increases exponentially, i.e. O(c(n)). To resolve the problem, this paper proposes to use two decoupled parameter spaces for controlling the upper body and the lower body separately. At each frame time, a parameterized motion space produces a source frame, and the target frame is synthesized by splicing the upper body of one source frame with the lower body of the other. In order to have the two source frames correlated with each other, a time-warping scheme has been developed. Furthermore, in order to handle the dynamic properties of the parameter samples of the upper body, we have developed an approximation technique for quickly determining the sample positions in its parameter space. This decoupled parameterization method alleviates the complexity problem, e.g. from O(c(6)) to O(c(3)), while providing the users with the capability of convenient control over the character.", "paper_title": "Motion synthesis with decoupled parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800014"}
