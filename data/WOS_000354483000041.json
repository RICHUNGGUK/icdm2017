In the transport sector and in companies where the equipment is mainly combustion engine means, this energy management process is principally oriented to control the vehicle fuel consumption. In this paper, we present a service capable of monitoring how and when the fuel is consumed and offering tools to the fleet responsible to analyze and manage it. The service produces the required information and tools to support the ISO 50001 certification. To evaluate its performance, the service has been deployed in several vehicles of a garbage collector company making possible a reduction in the fuel consumption by approximately 20%.", "paper_title": "Service To Manage The Efficient Driving Of Combustion Vehicle Fleets To Support ISO 50001", "paper_id": "WOS:000354483000041"}
