Since commutative basic algebras are similar to MV-algebras up to associativity of the binary operation we try to get a similar relationship between commutative basic algebras and so-called near semirings and we show that this is possible. This means that associativity does not play an important role in establishing a connection between an algebra of many-valued logic and a structure similar to a semiring.", "paper_title": "Commutative basic algebras and coupled near semirings", "paper_id": "WOS:000351472300001"}
