We show how to use the package to fit marginal structural models through inverse probability weighting, to estimate causal effects. Our package can be used with data from a point treatment situation as well as with a time-varying exposure and time-varying confounders. It can be used with binomial, categorical, ordinal and continuous exposure variable.", "paper_title": "ipw: An R Package for Inverse Probability Weighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000294837000001"}
