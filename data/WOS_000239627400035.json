It is shown that this problem can be approximately solved up to any desired precision by using an indexed family of state-unconstrained optimal control problems. The existence of solutions is proved and the resulting approximation is characterized by appropriate two-sides inequalities. Simulations are provided to show the efficiency and relevance of the proposed formulation.", "paper_title": "State-constrained optimal control applied to cell-cycle-specific cancer chemotherapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400035"}
