In this paper, we consider a new classification algorithm with a reject option. Based on the majority vote strategy and plug-in rules, we provide error analysis for this algorithm in ideal and realistic settings, respectively. In addition, some discussions of semi-supervised classification are given to demonstrate our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF CLASSIFICATION WITH A REJECT OPTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000266352000008"}
