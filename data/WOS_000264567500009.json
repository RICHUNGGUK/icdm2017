These trees are extensively used as data structures for sorting and searching. We embed several subclasses of height-balanced trees of height h in Q(h+1) under certain conditions. In particular, if a tree T is such that the balance factor of every vertex in the first three levels is arbitrary (0 or 1) and the balance factor of every other vertex is zero, then we prove that T is embeddable in its optimal hypercube with dilation I or 2 according to whether it is balanced or not.
