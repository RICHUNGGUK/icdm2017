In order to gain the structural fingerprint, the in-degree, out-degree and adjacency relationship are exacted from call graph to construct a. structural matrix. Then this matrix is mapped to RGB image and to compute the color moments of this image. Comparing with the traditional binary comparison way in which finding graph isomorphism is based on control flow graph or instruction similarity, this method offers many advantages in application. First of all, the image processing techniques are made full use of to gain the color moments that are considered as the structural fingerprint to identify different programs. And secondly, the distance of structural fingerprint can be used to find the same source programs from a large number of programs. Last but not least, the runtime of our method is significantly shorter than the traditional methods. It takes only seconds comparing to minutes and even hours taken by other methods.", "paper_title": "FINDING THE SAME SOURCE PROGRAMS BASED ON THE STRUCTURAL FINGERPRINT DISTANCE OF CALL GRAPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000273729800002"}
