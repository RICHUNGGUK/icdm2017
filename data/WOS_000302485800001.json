Design/methodology/approach Methods - include a review of relevant literature in both English and Chinese, case studies of different types of support frameworks in the UK, the USA, Singapore and Hong Kong, formulation of a meta-synthetic support framework for Beijing City, and justification of its application to policy development by various studies. Three stages of meta-synthetic support frameworks are proposed. Findings - The suggested meta-synthetic support frameworks are highly appropriate for the optimisation of, and innovation in, management and services systems of government information resources. The proposed knowledge asset management approaches offer significant practical value in improving the competence and capabilities of service-oriented government, providing a set of solutions to identified, urgent problems, including a joint administration system for creating value, a release and distribution management system for sharing and protecting value, and a licensing and authorisation management system for adding value. Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on the formulation of a theoretical support framework for the reuse of government information resources and the justification of its effectiveness to guide policy development at strategic level. Case studies of its application at operational level are ongoing and will be discussed in future papers. Practical implications - The suggested meta-synthetic support frameworks support the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of intelligent traffic administration, good governance of value-added services based on government information resources, and intellectual activity around city travel and traffic. The study has wide implications for the improvement of service-oriented government performance, public satisfaction and the image of government. Originality/value - The paper presents the adaptation of meta-synthetic ideas and knowledge asset management approaches to collaboration, optimisation, innovation and compliance management issues in the reuse of government information resources. The advantages of different types of support systems and frameworks are integrated as a coherent whole for a strategic framework of legal, regulatory and standards support to China and Beijing.", "paper_title": "Meta-synthetic support frameworks for reuse of government information resources on city travel and traffic The case of Beijing", "paper_id": "WOS:000302485800001"}
