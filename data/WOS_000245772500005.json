Combined with a laser source mounted on its own slide, the platform can be used to produce fully three-dimensional micro-scale components. We investigate the kinematics, workspace, Jacobian matrix, and singularities of this parallel mechanism, and analyze the geometry of the laser machining of a polymer. Based on these results, we have developed algorithms to generate cutter paths for roughing, finishing, and slot-cutting, which we have verified using Vericut (Pro Engineer) and kinematic simulator developed by authors for the platform, written in OpenGL.
