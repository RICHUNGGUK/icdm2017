It is shown that with a suitable parameter ininitial states, the entropies in each stretch are positively correlated or anticorrelated, which depend on initial states and a molecule. The entropy correlation is also studied in terms of a correlation index. It is demonstrated that the correlation index and the sum of linear entropies in each stretch are identical in oscillation. The differences in the linear entropy in each stretch and the correlation index of the thermal states and the squeezed states between H(2)O and SO(2) are noticed. These may be useful for quantum computing and quantum information processing based on two stretching modes in both molecules.", "paper_title": "ENTROPY EXCHANGE AND CORRELATION IN u(2) ALGEBRAIC MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000261383000002"}
