The new construction method provides optimal quaternary LCZ sequence sets even if the employed binary LCZ sequence set is suboptimal. The optimality is improved at the price of alphabet extension.", "paper_title": "A Construction of Quaternary Low Correlation Zone Sequence Sets from Binary Low Correlation Zone Sequence Sets Improving Optimality", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300022"}
