Then the analytical layer-element of a single soil layer can be obtained in the transformed domain by synthesizing the generalized displacements and stresses, which are both expressed by six arbitrary constants. The elements of the analytical layer-element only contain negative exponential functions, which leads to a considerable improvement in computation efficiency and stability. The global stiffness matrix equation of multilayered soils is further obtained by assembling the interrelated layer-elements, and the actual solution is achieved by numerical inversion of the Laplace-Hankel transform after the solution in the transformed domain is obtained. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of this method and to study the influence of the layered soil properties and time history on the consolidation behavior.
