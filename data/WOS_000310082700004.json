Developing a USN application considering such problems is a difficult task. In this paper, a framework for automated construction of node software using low-level attributes is presented in order to support the developers who are not familiar with developing USN applications for their effective development of USN applications. The presented framework consists of attributes necessary for designing an application, code templates necessary for generating softwares for sensor nodes in the application, and tools necessary for designing and generating the application. Through the presented framework, the developers can easily design a USN application by using low-level attributes and automatically generate node softwares for the USN application. Therefore, development productivity will be increased.", "paper_title": "A FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATED CONSTRUCTION OF NODE SOFTWARE USING LOW-LEVEL ATTRIBUTES IN USN APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000310082700004"}
