First, an attribute weight iterative optimization using GA is discussed in the case retrieval phase. Then, a case reuse method is carried out by using the GDM theory. Finally, the historical data of DO concentration in a wastewater treatment process are used to carry out a comparison experiment by 10-fold cross validation. The results show that this proposed GGCBR is superior to other methods and significantly reduces the fitting error of DO concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
