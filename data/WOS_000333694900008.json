The proposed method uses a given set of zeroing masks for various resampling factors to evaluate the convolution values of the input image with the zeroing masks. Improving upon our previous work, the proposed method detects more resampling factors by checking for some periodicity with an approximate detection mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "Approximate Detection Method for Image Up-Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000333694900008"}
