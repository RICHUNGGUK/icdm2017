In contrast to ICA, TCA allows dependent structure of latent variables and also consider non-spanning trees (forests). In this paper, we present a TCA-based method of clustering gene expression data. Empirical study with yeast cell cycle-related data, yeast metabolic shift data, and yeast sporulation data, shows that TCA is more suitable for gene clustering, compared to principal component analysis (PCA) as well as ICA.", "paper_title": "Tree-dependent components of gene expression data for clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200087"}
