We study for the. first time positive aspects of prior entanglement and show how it can be used to parallelize any multi-prover quantum interactive proof system to a one-round system with perfect completeness, soundness bounded away from one by an inverse-polynomial in the input size, and one extra prover. Alternatively, we can also parallelize to a three-turn system with the same number of provers, where the veri. er only broadcasts the outcome of a coin. flip. This \"public-coin\" property is somewhat surprising, since in the classical case public-coin multi-prover interactive proofs are equivalent to single-prover ones.", "paper_title": "USING ENTANGLEMENT IN QUANTUM MULTI-PROVER INTERACTIVE PROOFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267365500006"}
