The objective function is the minimization of the project completion time. Heuristics based on Minslack priority rules are considered as initial solution procedures for this problem. Nevertheless, the NP-hard nature of the problem which is difficult to use to solve realistic sized projects makes necessary the use of heuristic and metaheuristics in practice. A global search metaheuristics taboo search algorithm (TSA) is proposed to solve this NP-hard problem. Two heuristic algorithms are developed to solve an F/C-MM-RCPSP. The first one is a minslack priority scheduling algorithm which includes a combination of an activity and a mode selection rule; the second one is a TSA. The solutions obtained by the former algorithm with the best activity and mode-priority rule combination are used as a baseline to compare those obtained by the latter. Finally, we present the results of our through computational study. A computational experiment is described, performed on a set of instances based on standard test problems from the PSPlib for the MM-RCPSPs. The algorithms are computationally compared, the results are analyzed and discussed and some conclusions are given.", "paper_title": "Resource-constrained project scheduling problem with multiple execution modes and fuzzy/crisp activity durations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500035"}
