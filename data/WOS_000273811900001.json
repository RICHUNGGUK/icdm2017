The high dimensionality and the huge size of the data set require an index structure to facilitate the search. State-of-the-art index structures are built by partitioning the data set based on distances to certain reference point(s). Using the index, search is confined to a small number of partitions. However, these methods either ignore the property of the data distribution (e.g., VP-tree and its variants) or produce non-disjoint partitions (e.g., M-tree and its variants, DBM-tree); these greatly affect the search efficiency. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a new index structure, called Nested-Approximate-eQuivalence-class tree (NAQ-tree), which overcomes the above disadvantages. NAQ-tree is constructed by recursively dividing the data set into nested approximate equivalence classes. The conducted analysis and the reported comparative test results demonstrate the effectiveness of NAQ-tree in significantly improving the search efficiency.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness of NAQ-tree as index structure for similarity search in high-dimensional metric space", "paper_id": "WOS:000273811900001"}
