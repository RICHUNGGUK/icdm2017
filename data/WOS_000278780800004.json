Although many of these agents have been described as \"targeted therapy\", they will typically inhibit multiple kinases with varying potency. Pre-clinical model testing has not predicted the numerous significant toxicities identified during clinical development. The purpose of this study was to develop a bioinformatics-based method to predict specific adverse events (AEs) in humans associated with the inhibition of particular kinase targets (KTs). Methods: The AE frequencies of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) were curated from three sources (PubMed. Thompson Physician Desk Reference and PharmGKB), and affinities of 38 PKIs for 317 kinases, representing >50% of the predicted human kinome, were collected from published in vitro assay results. A novel quantitative computational method was developed to predict associations between KTs and AEs that included a whole panel of 71 AEs and 20 PKIs targeting 266 distinct kinases with K(d) < 10 mu M. The method calculated an unbiased, kinome-wide association score via linear algebra on (i) the normalized frequencies of AEs associated with 20 PKIs and (ii) the negative log-transformed dissociation constant of kinases targeted by these PKIs. Finally, a reference standard was calculated by applying Fisher's exact test to the co-occurrence of indexed Pubmed terms (p <= 0.05, and manually verified) for AE and associated kinase targets (AE-KT) pairs from standard literature search techniques. We also evaluated the enrichment of predictions between the quantitative method and the literature search by Fisher's exact testing. Results: We identified significant associations among already empirically well established pairs of AEs (e.g. diarrhea and rash) and KTs (e.g. EGFR). The following less well recognized AE-KT pairs had similar association scores: diarrhea-(DDR1;ERBB4), rash-ERBB4, and fatigue-(CSF1R;KIT). With no filtering, the association score identified 41 prioritized associations involving 7 AEs and 19 KTs. Among them, eight associations were reported in the literature review. There were only 78 out of a total of 4522 AE-KT pairs meeting the evaluation threshold, indicating a strong association between the predicted and the text mined AE-KT pairs (p = 3 x 10(-7)). As many of these drugs remain in development, a larger volume of more detailed data on AE-PKI associations is accessible only through non-public databases. These prediction models will be refined with these data and validated through dedicated prospective human studies. Conclusion and future directions: Our in silica method can predict associations between kinase targets and AE frequencies in human patients. Refining this method should lead to improved clinical development of protein kinase inhibitors, a large new class of therapeutics. http://www.lussierlab.org/publication/PAS/. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
