However, in order to meet the requirements of these tasks, advanced model based controllers such as the Extended CTC scheme are required. This CTC-based scheme requires the introduction of extra sensors in the passive joints of the parallel robot. This redundant information allows to increase the robustness and performance of the control law, leading to better trajectory tracking. However, in order to achieve the best performance, a proper extra sensor distribution is required. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis based approach is applied to the well known Gough Platform in order to evaluate different extra sensor distributions. The obtained results are compared with those obtained by a statistically significant set of simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
