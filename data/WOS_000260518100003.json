For this purpose, this paper first presents several novel convergence concepts for sequences of fuzzy random variables, such as convergence in chance, convergence in distribution and convergence in optimistic value; then deals with the convergence criteria and convergence relations among various types of convergence. Finally, we deal with the convergence theorems for sequences of integrable fuzzy random variables, including dominated convergence theorem and bounded convergence theorem.", "paper_title": "The modes of convergence in the approximation of fuzzy random optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260518100003"}
