Based on these parametric expressions, some balanced multiwavelets and analysis-ready multiwavelets are constructed, which are symmetric, or antisymmetric. Moreover, on the basis of balanced multiwavelet transform, a new method of multiple description coding is given, and experiments show that this method works well. Compared with the traditional multiple description coding method, this method has low redundancy.", "paper_title": "Balanced Multifilter Banks for Multiple Description Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000287400700021"}
