The former affects service disruption time while the latter affects packet delivery delay. Although existing region-based mobile multicast schemes offer a trade-off between two costs to some extent, most of them do not determine the size of the service range, which is critical to network performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Distributed Dynamic Mobile Multicast ((DM2)-M-2), to dynamically determine the optimal service range according to the mobility and service characteristics of a user. We derive an analytical model to formulate the costs of multicast tree reconfiguration and multicast packet delivery. The model is based on a Markov chain that analyzes a mobile node's movement in a 2D mesh network. As the complexity of computing steady probability is high, we aggregate the Markov states by leveraging mobility symmetry. Simulation shows that the network performance is enhanced through (DM2)-M-2.
