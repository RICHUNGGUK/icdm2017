Operations models that account for supply costs and constraints as well as a supplier's ability to influence demand characteristics can lead to an improved match between supply and demand. This paper presents a class of optimization models that allow a supplier to select, from a set of potential markets, those markets that provide maximum profit when production/procurement economies of scale exist in the supply process. The resulting optimization problem we study possesses an interesting structure and we show that although the general problem is -complete, a number of relevant and practical special cases can be solved in polynomial time. We also provide a computationally very efficient and intuitively attractive heuristic solution procedure that performs extremely well on a large number of test instances.", "paper_title": "Integrated market selection and production planning: complexity and solution approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000307998000004"}
