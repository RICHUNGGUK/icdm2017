Nowadays, modelling an agent in multi-agent systems is increasingly becoming more complex and significant. Also, robotic soccer domain is an interesting environment where agent modelling can be used. In this paper, we present an approach to classify and compare the behaviour of a multi-agent system using a coach in the soccer simulation domain of the RoboCup.", "paper_title": "A comparing method of two team behaviours in the simulation coach competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600013"}
