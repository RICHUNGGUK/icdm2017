By incompatible job families, we mean that jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The processing time of a job becomes known only upon its arrival. The objective is to minimize the makespan. The problem is difficult to solve so we consider the case where the number of families is equal to the number of machines. We give a lower bound root 5+1/2 approximate to 1.618 on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm for this restricted problem. We also provide an online algorithm H(m)(theta), where theta is an element of (0, 1) is a parameter, and show that its competitive ratio is no less than 1 + root 10/5 approximate to 1.632. When m = 2 or under the condition that jobs belonging to the same family have identical processing times, we show that H(m)(alpha), where alpha = root 5-1/2, is a best possible online algorithm. When m >= 3, we prove that H(m)(beta), where beta = root 2-1, has a competitive ratio no greater than 1 + 1/beta+1 approximate to 1.707. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
