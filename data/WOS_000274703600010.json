This paper proposes a scheme for assessment of quality of service (QoS) for train control data transmission based on grey Clustering (GC) theory. According to the GSM-R QoS index model, the proposed scheme quantitatively assesses QoS of GSM-R network through a simple way, grades the system performance. Moreover, a GSM-R QoS test report analysis is taken as an example to illustrate the rationality and feasibility of the proposed scheme, which shows that the assessment results can indicate the QoS of GSM-R network exactly.", "paper_title": "Assessment Scheme for Performance of GSM-R", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600010"}
