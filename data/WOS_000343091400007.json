Method: To address the brain deformation, we developed a hybrid non-rigid registration method to register high-field preoperative MRI with low-field intra-operative MRI in order to recover the deformation induced by brain shift and tumor resection. The registered DTI and BOLD are fused with low-field intra-operative MRI for image-guided neurosurgery. Results: The proposed hybrid registration method was evaluated by comparing the landmarks predicted by the hybrid registration method with the landmarks identified in the low-field intra-operative MRI for 10 patients. The prediction error of the hybrid method is 1.92 +/- 0.54 mm, and the compensation accuracy is 74.3 +/- 5.0%. Compared to the landmarks far from the resection region, those near the resection region demonstrated a higher compensation accuracy (P-value = .003) although these landmarks had larger initial displacements. Conclusions: The proposed hybrid registration method is able to bring preoperatively acquired BOLD and DTI into the operating room and compensate for the deformation to augment low-field intra-operative MRI with rich anatomical and functional information.
