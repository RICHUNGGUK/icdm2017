For the commonly used precision stage that has six supporting points, there will be different deformation types of the stage when the workpiece is located at different positions of the stage. Simulation and analysis of the deformation types would be helpful in order to level the stage correctly. Using the finite element software ANSYS, this study simulated and analyzed the deformation types of the stage when the workpiece is located at different positions. According to the simulation results, the stage was divided into eight areas, an automatic judgement method was designed to judge the exact area where the workpiece is located, and leveling methods of this judged area were proposed. The experimental results show that the deformation types of the stage are well consistent with the simulation analysis, and the workpiece's location judged by the proposed method is the same as the real location.
