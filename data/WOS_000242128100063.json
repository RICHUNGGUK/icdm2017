In PEL one defines a class of minimal 2 models, called partial equilibrium models, in a non-classical logic, HT On logic programs partial equilibrium models coincide with Przymusinski's partial stable (p-stable) models, so that PEL can be seen as a way to extend WFS and p-stable semantics to arbitrary propositional theories. We study several extensions of PEL with strong negation and compare these with previous systems extending WFS with explicit negation, notably WSFX [10] and p-stable models with \"classical\" negation [11].", "paper_title": "Strong negation in well-founded and partial stable semantics for logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100063"}
