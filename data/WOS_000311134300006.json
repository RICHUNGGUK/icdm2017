Results indicate that addition of TR to blended cements, compared to SF addition, leads to higher compressive strength and lower weight loss at elevated temperatures. In order to model the influence of the different parameters on the compressive strength and the weight loss of specimens, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were adopted. Different diagrams were plotted based on the predictions of the most accurate networks to study the effects of temperature, different fillers and cement content on the target properties. In addition to the impressive RMSE and R-2 values of the best networks, the data used as the input for the prediction plots were chosen within the range of the data introduced to the networks in the training phase. Therefore, the prediction plots could be considered reliable to perform the parametric study.", "paper_title": "An investigation on the mortars containing blended cement subjected to elevated temperatures using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models", "paper_id": "WOS:000311134300006"}
