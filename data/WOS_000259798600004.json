In this problem an evader attempts to minimize the length of the shortest path between the origin and the destination in a network, while an interdictor attempts to maximize the length of this shortest path by interdicting network arcs using limited resources. We consider the case where there is asymmetric information, i.e., the evader and the interdictor have different levels of information about the network. We formulate this problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program and show that this formulation can be converted to a linear mixed integer program. Computational results demonstrate improvements in the objective function values over the shortest path network interdiction problem with symmetric information.
