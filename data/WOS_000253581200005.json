A reflexive ontology is a description of the concepts and relations in a domain with self-contained queries. This approach presents several advantages; (1) the speeding of the query process; (2) the addition of extra knowledge about the domain extending it with queries and answers; and (3), the self-containment of the knowledge structure. We present a framework that can be used to extend any existing ontology with the reflexivity approach. Additionally, as case study, we test the architecture with a previously presented knowledge structure called Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS).", "paper_title": "Reflexive ontologies: Enhancing ontologies with self-contained queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000253581200005"}
