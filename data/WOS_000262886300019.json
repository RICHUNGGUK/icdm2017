Firstly, the original image is transformed into some subband coefficients using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT), and then a Gaussian pseudo-random watermark sequence is embedded in the factorized decomposition coefficients using NMF. Because of the multiresolution decomposition for DWT and physically meaningful factorization for NMF, the proposed scheme can achieve good robustness, which is also demonstrated in the following experiments.
