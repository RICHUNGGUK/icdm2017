In this study, an automated PCB inspection system based on statistical learning strategies is developed. First, the partial Hausdorff distance is used to ascertain the positions of defects. Next, the defect patterns are categorized using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Defects without regularities in appearance, which cannot be categorized, are identified through the regional defectiveness by comparing the block-wise probability distributions. Experimental results on a real visual inspection platform show that the proposed system is very effective for inspecting a variety of PCB defects.", "paper_title": "A Flexible PCB Inspection System Based on Statistical Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000303383700007"}
