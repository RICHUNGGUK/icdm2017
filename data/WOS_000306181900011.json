Different from traditional device-to-device communication technologies such as Bluetooth and WiFi-direct, the operator controls the communication process to provide better user experience and make profit accordingly. The related usage cases and business models are analyzed. Some technical considerations are discussed, and a resource allocation and data transmission procedure is provided.", "paper_title": "OPERATOR CONTROLLED DEVICE-TO-DEVICE COMMUNICATIONS IN LTE-ADVANCED NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181900011"}
