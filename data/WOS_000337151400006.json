Although the exact mechanism is not clear, chronic inflammation caused by E. coli and other related events are suggested as possible causes behind E. coli-induced colon cancer. It has been found that CRC cells, but not normal cells, are colonized by an intracellular form of E. coli. We predicted nuclear targeting of bacterial proteins in the host cell through computational tools nuclear localization signal (NLS) mapper and balanced subcellular localization predictor (BaCeILo). During intracellular E. coli residence, such targeting is highly likely and may have a possible role in colon cancer etiology. We observed that several gene expression-associated proteins of E. coli can migrate to the host nucleus during intracellular infections. This situation provides an opportunity for competitive interaction of host and pathogen proteins with similar cellular substrates, thereby increasing the chances of development of colon cancer. Moreover, the results indicated that proteins localized in the membrane of E. coli mostly act as secretary proteins in host cells. No exact correlation was observed between NLS prediction and nuclear localization prediction by BaCeILo. This is partly because of a number of reasons, including that only 30% of nuclear proteins carry NLS and that proteins <40 kDa molecular weight can passively target the host nucleus. This study concludes that detection of gene expression-specific E. coli proteins and their targeting of the nucleus may have a profound impact on CRC etiology.", "paper_title": "In Silico Prediction of Escherichia coli Proteins Targeting the Host Cell Nucleus, with Special Reference to Their Role in Colon Cancer Etiology", "paper_id": "WOS:000337151400006"}
