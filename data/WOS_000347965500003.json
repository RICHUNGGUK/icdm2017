Some key properties of HR model are studied and proved to meet the requirements of CPG. Pros and cons of HR model are provided. A CPG network based on HR model is developed and the related properties are investigated. We explore the bipedal primary gaits generated by the CPG network. The preliminary applications of HR model are tested on humanoid locomotion model and functional electrical stimulation (FES) walking system. The positive results of stimulation and experiment show the feasibility of HR model as a valid CPG.", "paper_title": "Exploring a Type of Central Pattern Generator Based on Hindmarsh-Rose Model: From Theory to Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000347965500003"}
