A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy is proposed that employs a tradeoff-analysis technique to identify compromise designs for which the competing criteria are mutually satisfied in a Pareto-optimal sense. The MCDM strategy is initially developed for the case of design governed by n = 2 objective criteria. It is then extended to design governed by n > 2 objective criteria, by introducing the concept of primary and aggregate criteria. It is proved that, from among the theoretically infinite number of feasible designs forming the Pareto front for a design problem governed by n independent objective criteria, there exists a unique Pareto-compromise design that represents a mutually agreeable tradeoff between all n criteria. This remarkable result is illustrated for a flexural plate design governed by n = 2 criteria, a bridge maintenance-intervention protocol design governed by n = 3 criteria, and a media centre envelop design governed by n = 11 criteria.
