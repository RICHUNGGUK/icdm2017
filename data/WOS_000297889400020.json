As a first step toward optimal churn management program for marketing managers, this paper focuses on building an accurate and concise predictive model for the purpose of churn prediction utilizing a partial least squares (PLS)-based methodology on highly correlated data sets among variables. A preliminary experiment demonstrates that the presented model provides more accurate performance than traditional prediction models and identifies key variables to better understand churning behaviors. Further, a set of simple churn marketing programs device management, overage management, and complaint management strategies is presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
