A graph G of order n is said to be borderenergetic if its energy equals the energy of the complete graph K-n, i.e., if epsilon(G) = 2(n - 1). The problem of finding all the borderenergetic graphs on n vertices tends to be very complicated. Recently, Gong at al. gave complete lists of non-complete borderenergetic graphs on n = 7, 8, 9 vertices, and there is no non-complete borderenergetic graph on n <= 6 vertices. However, the problem becomes very difficult when n > 9. In this paper, we use a computer search to find out all the borderenergetic graphs on n = 10 vertices. The number of such graphs is 47, among which 37 are non-cospectral. This could provide experience for further study on the borderenergetic graphs with large number of vertices.", "paper_title": "A Computer Search for the Borderenergetic Graphs of Order 10", "paper_id": "WOS:000361847100009"}
