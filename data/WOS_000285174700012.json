In this paper, we propose a Uniformity Estimation Method (UEM) for local brightness and structure to detect the pathological change in the chest CT images. Based on the characteristics of the chest CT images, we extract texture features by proposing an extension of rotation invariant LBP (ELBP(riu4)) and the gradient orientation difference so as to represent a uniform pattern of the brightness and structure in the image. The utilization of the ELBP(riu4) and the gradient orientation difference allows us to extract rotation invariant texture features in multiple directions. Beyond this, we propose to employ the integral image technique to speed up the texture feature computation of the spatial gray level dependent method (SGLDM). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
