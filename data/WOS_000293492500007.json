Simply omitting these infeasible points leads to a DoE with fewer experiments than desired and to a set of points that is not optimally distributed. By using the same number of points a better mapping of the feasible space can be achieved. This paper describes the development of a procedure that creates OLHs for constrained design spaces. An existing formulation is extended to meet this requirement. Here. the OLH is found by minimizing the Audze-Eglais potential energy of the points using a permutation genetic algorithm. Examples validate the procedure and demonstrate its capabilities in finding space-filling Latin ypercubes in arbitrarily shaped design spaces. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
