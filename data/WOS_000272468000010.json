Singular source terms due to the point particle appear in the equation in the form of the Dirac delta-function and its derivative. For the approximation of singular source terms, we use the direct derivative projection method proposed in Ref. 9 without any regularization. The gravitational waveforms are evaluated as a function of time. We compare the results of the spectral collocation method with those of the explicit second-order central-difference method. The numerical results show that the spectral collocation approximation with the direct projection method is accurate and converges rapidly when compared with the finite-difference method.", "paper_title": "A SPECTRAL COLLOCATION APPROXIMATION FOR THE RADIAL-INFALL OF A COMPACT OBJECT INTO A SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000272468000010"}
