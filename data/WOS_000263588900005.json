Our approach can re-distribute jobs as node availability changes. The architecture of the system, its components, and their deployment across the Cardiff University Campus Grid (consisting of 2500 machines) are presented. Challenges in image processing applications that can be deployed over such infrastructure are presented, along with performance results that demonstrate the use of our system alongside a standard Condor deployment, demonstrating a significant increase in throughput using our approach(double dagger).
