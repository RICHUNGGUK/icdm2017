It is found that, when the computational domain of the simulation is made large enough, the magnitude of the LBM's overprediction of the pressure fluctuations in the near-wall region is on the order of that expected from compressibility effects. However, the relationship between density, temperature, and pressure in the LBM is different from that found in a fully-compressible simulation. For this reason, it is recommended that the athermal LBM should not be used for simulations in which the density and temperature fluctuations may play an important role. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
