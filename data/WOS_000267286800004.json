We exploit the coupling of application layer and fabric layer of grid architecture for resource scheduling in grid computing environment. The objectives of the individual grid applications at the application layer, and individual grid resources at the fabric layer are likely to be in conflict. Interplay of application layer and fabric layer strives to find an optimal balance between application performance and resource utilisation. The two-layer optimisation model attempts to maximise the aggregate grid user utilities and revenues of resource provider. The article uses the Lagrangian method that leads to a decomposition of the utility maximisation problem into two smaller subproblems, each of which may be solved independently. This article presents a two-layer optimisation grid scheduling algorithm. The simulation studies show how the performance of two-layer optimisation algorithm is affected by the change of different environment parameters.", "paper_title": "Two-layer optimisation policy for improvement of application performance and resource utilisation in grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000267286800004"}
