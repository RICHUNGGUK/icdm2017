By pre-configuring the resources of dynamic optical networks, we can reconstruct the topology, increase the number of direct routes, and then optimize the performance of routing and forwarding. This article analyzes the characteristics of the pre-configuration process, and gives the corresponding mathematical description. A planning scheme of resource pre-configuration that forms a pre-configured topology different from physical topology and virtual topology has been introduced for dynamic optical networks. Two dynamic routing algorithms have been run on the pre-configured topology. Simulations results show that the connection establishing time of the control plane could be significantly reduced by using the resource pre-configuration strategy.", "paper_title": "Routing on pre-configured topology for dynamic optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265924000012"}
