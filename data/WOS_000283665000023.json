Thus, denoising techniques are needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. XMSF (Microscopy Mean Shift Filtering) is a fast, user-friendly application that succeeds in filtering noise while preserving the structures of interest. It is based on the extension to 3D of a method widely applied in other image processing fields under very different scenarios. XMSF has been tested for a variety of tomograms, showing a great potential to become a state-of-the-art filtering program in electron tomography. Applied iteratively, the algorithm yields pre-segmented volumes facilitating posterior segmentation tasks. Moreover, execution times remain low thanks to parallel computing techniques to exploit current multicore computers.", "paper_title": "XMSF: Structure-preserving noise reduction and pre-segmentation in microscope tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000023"}
