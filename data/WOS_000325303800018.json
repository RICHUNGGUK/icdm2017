By constructing a novel augmented Lyapunov functional which contains some triple-integral terms, improved delay-dependent stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) by introducing some free-weighting matrices and using integral inequality technique and convex combination method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
