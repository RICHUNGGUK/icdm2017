Using the tropical geometry of the orthogonal group, we prove that this monoid is a finite polyhedral fan of dimension , and we compute the structure of this fan for up to . The monoid captures gossip among gossipers over lossy phone lines, and contains the gossip monoid over ordinary phone lines as a submonoid. We prove several new results about this submonoid as well. In particular, we establish a sharp bound on chains of calls in each of which someone learns something new.", "paper_title": "Lossy Gossip and Composition of Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400012"}
