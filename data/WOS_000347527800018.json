This block is used in passive phase shifters. The structure of 90A degrees used double single port double throw (SPDT) in both input/output. The SPDT used a high yield and good performance switch. The switches have low insertion loss and phase variation. The measurement results of 90A degrees block with -6 V control voltage indicate that the insertion loss is less than -1.6 dB and phase shift is 87 +/- A 3.5A degrees over 8-12 GHz. The 1 dB compression point (P(1)dB) is more than 25 dBm. The die size is 1 mm(2). The measurements show good correlation between simulation and measurement results. So, the result demonstrates the great potential of the proposed block for high performance phased array radar systems.", "paper_title": "Low insertion loss, high power handling and good performance 90(o) phase shifter for X-band radar application", "paper_id": "WOS:000347527800018"}
