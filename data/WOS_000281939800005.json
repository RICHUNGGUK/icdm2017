The stochastic intensity of the process for counting emitted particles is estimated by functional principal components analysis and confidence bands are provided for two radioactive isotopes, (226)Ra and (137)Cs. A hypothesis test to assess the coherence of the new observed data with the estimated model is also included. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
