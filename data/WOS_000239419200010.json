The first one is a substantial generalization of Coons' method, where instead of four curves four surface patches are the input data in the surface definition. The second scheme generalizes the Gordon-Coons construction of triangular patches by combining three surfaces and an appropriate correction term. In both cases the resulting surface fits one boundary curve of each constituent, and its shape is influenced not only by boundary data but also by the shapes of the given surfaces and additional shape parameters.
