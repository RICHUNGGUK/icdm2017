The proposed system reroutes data on erroneous links to a set of spare wires without interrupting the data flow. To detect permanent errors at runtime, a novel in-line test (ILT) method using spare wires and a test pattern generator is proposed. In addition, an improved syndrome storing-based detection (SSD) method is presented and compared to the ILT method. Each detection method (ILT and SSD) is integrated individually into the noninterrupting adaptive system, and a case study is performed to compare them with Hamming and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code implementations. In the presence of permanent errors, the probability of correct transmission in the proposed systems is improved by up to 140% over the standalone Hamming code. Furthermore, our methods achieve up to 38% area, 64% energy, and 61% latency improvements over the BCH implementation at comparable error performance.", "paper_title": "Self-Adaptive System for Addressing Permanent Errors in On-Chip Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000276036800002"}
