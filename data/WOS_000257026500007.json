Among these requirements, those known as crosscutting concerns transpass components boundaries, leading to maintainability and comprehension problems. This paper presents CrossMDA, a framework that encompasses a transformation process to integrate crosscutting concerns in model-oriented systems. It uses the concepts of horizontal separation of concerns from AOP to create independent business and aspect models, integrating those models through MDA transformations ( vertical separation of concerns). CrossMDA comprises a development process, a set of services and support tools. The main advantages of this approach are to raise the abstraction level of aspect modeling, to promote the reuse of crosscutting concerns modeled as PIM elements, besides automating the process of mapping the relationship of crosscutting concerns and business models through the process of MDA transformations.", "paper_title": "CrossMDA: a model-driven approach for aspect management", "paper_id": "WOS:000257026500007"}
