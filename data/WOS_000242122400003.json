Designers mainly use Ortony et al.'s typology of emotions, that provides a formalization of twenty-two emotions based on psychological theories. But most of them restrain their agents to a few emotions among these twenty-two ones, and are more or less faithful to their definition. In this paper we propose to extend standard BDI (belief, desire, intention) logics to account for more emotions while trying to respect their definitions as exactly as possible.", "paper_title": "OCC's emotions: A formalization in a BDI logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122400003"}
