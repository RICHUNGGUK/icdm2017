(1999, Soft computing, 3 (4), 197-199) and Trillas and Cubillo (1999, On non-contradictory input/output couples in Zadeh's CRI proceeding, 28-32) introduced the study of contradiction in the framework of fuzzy logic because of the significance of avoiding contradictory outputs in inference processes. Later, the study of contradiction in the framework of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets (A-IFSs) was initiated by Cubillo and Castineira (2004, Contradiction in intuitionistic fuzzy sets proceeding, 2180-2186). The axiomatic definition of contradiction measure was stated in Castineira and Cubillo (2009, International journal of intelligent systems, 24, 863-888). Likewise, the concept of continuity of these measures was formalized through several axioms. To be precise, they defined continuity when the sets 'are increasing', denominated continuity from below, and continuity when the sets 'are decreasing', or continuity from above. The aim of this paper is to provide some geometrical construction methods for obtaining contradiction measures in the framework of A-IFSs and to study what continuity properties these measures satisfy. Furthermore, we show the geometrical interpretations motivating the measures.", "paper_title": "Some geometrical methods for constructing contradiction measures on Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000292641700001"}
