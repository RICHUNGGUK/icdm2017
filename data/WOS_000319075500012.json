In this direction, the IEEE802.16 has defined wireless access systems called WiMAX. These systems provide high-speed communications over a long distance. For this purpose some service classes with QoS requirements are defined; but the QoS scheduler is not standardized in IEEE802.16. The scheduling mechanism has a significant effect on the performance of WiMAX systems for use of bandwidth and radio resources. Some scheduling algorithms have been introduced by researchers; but they only provide some limited aspects of QoS. An intelligent decision support system is therefore necessary for scheduling. In this paper a fuzzy based scheduling system is proposed for compounds of real-time and non-real-time polling services which provide QoS requirements and fairness in dynamic conditions. A series of simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm in terms of latency and throughput QoS parameters. The results show that the proposed method performs effectively regarding both of these criteria and achieves proportional system performance and fairness among different types of traffic.", "paper_title": "An intelligent scheduling system using fuzzy logic controller for management of services in WiMAX networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500012"}
