It is proposed that the users obtain the credentials that allow them to surf the web after sending a Premium-rated SMS, thus avoiding a direct payment relationship between the user and the WISP. Mobile users are familiar with Premium SMS and consider them a secure and convenient payment method, because of the existing trust relationship between users and Mobile Network Operators. A third party named SMSBroker that acts as intermediary between the MNO and the WISP is also required in practice. The concept has been implemented and tested in a real wireless access network.", "paper_title": "Adapting a captive portal to enable SMS-based micropayment for Wireless Internet Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426900008"}
