This model aims to study the regulatory governance of the Brazilian financial system. In this article, the regulatory governance is understood as a phenomenon that results from several interactions and transactions among all actors that influence or are influenced by the activities of the regulation policies. The study focuses on the short-term interest rates and incorporates behavioral aspects and no-explicit interests of social and economical agents. The developed method integrates content analysis research and in-depth interviews to model the agent' behavior by means of fuzzy logic rules. It provides systematic collection and interpretation of data produced in textual form as well as knowledge from experts. The results of the model validation have shown that this approach contributes to the development of a methodology for the modeling and representation of agent behavior in social applied simulation models.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURING AND MODELING DATA FOR REPRESENTING THE BEHAVIOR OF AGENTS IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE BRAZILIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264751200002"}
