Despite their success, it is not known how to evaluate decision confidence from them. I introduce a broader class of models consisting of two partially correlated neuronal integrators with arbitrarily time-varying decision boundaries that allow a natural description of confidence. The dependence of decision confidence on the state of the losing integrator, decision time, time-varying boundaries, and correlations is analytically described. The marginal confidence is computed for the half-anticorrelated case using the exact solution of the diffusion process with constant boundaries and compared to that of the independent and completely anticorrelated cases.", "paper_title": "Decision Confidence and Uncertainty in Diffusion Models with Partially Correlated Neuronal Integrators", "paper_id": "WOS:000278530200006"}
