The proposed scheme integrates the super-increasing sequence and perturbation techniques into compressed data aggregation, and has the ability to combine more than one aggregated data into one. Compared with the traditional data aggregation schemes, the proposed scheme not only enhances the privacy preservation in data aggregation, but also is more efficient in terms of energy costs due to its unique multidimensional aggregation. Extensive analyses and experiments are given to demonstrate its energy efficiency and practicability.
