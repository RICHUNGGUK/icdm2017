Besides solving the authentication problem of public keys, the protocol relaxes excessive trust on the adjudicator since the adjudicator needs to be trusted only by the signer. The protocol is secure against three types of inside adversaries under the DL assumption in the random oracle model. It suits much more the actual circumstances of the Internet.", "paper_title": "Certificate-based Fair Exchange Protocol of Schnorr Signatures in Chosen-key Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000361626300005"}
