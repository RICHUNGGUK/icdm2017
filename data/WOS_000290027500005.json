We first identify the limitations of existing cooperative schemes. While we previously proposed a multi-hop cooperative data dissemination scheme, REER, to address these limitations, the construction of such structure relies on a pre-established reference path. The partially centralized approach makes REER unscalable when encountering network dynamics. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel distributed multi-hop cooperative communication scheme (DMC), which is fully distributed and consists of two operation phases: (1) cooperative mesh structure (CMS) construction, and (2) CMS-based data dissemination, which includes random value-based scheme and distance-based scheme for forwarding node selection. Simulation results show that DMC performs well in terms of a number of QoS metrics, and fits well in large-scale networks and highly dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "Distributed multi-hop cooperative communication in dense wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290027500005"}
