However, implementing ray tracing codes can be very time consuming. This article presents a computer library to trace rays in 2.5D media composed by a stack of layers. The velocity profile inside each layer is such that the eikonal equation can be analytically solved. Therefore, the ray tracing within such profile is Made fast and accurate. The great advantage of an analytical ray tracing library is the numerical precision of the quantities computed and the fast execution of the implemented codes. Even though ray tracing programs exist for a long time, for example the seis88 package by Cerveny, most of those programs use a numerical approach to compute the ray. Regardless of the fact that numerical methods can solve more general problems, the analytical ones could be part of a more sophisticated simulation process, where the ray tracing time is completely relevant. We demonstrate the feasibility of our codes using several examples (Miqueles et al., 2013) [1]. The library can also be used for other applications besides seismic, e.g., optics and tomography.
