If one can observe increments but does not know their probabilistic properties, what are the statistical limits of estimating the tail exponent of Loynes' distribution? We conjecture that in broad generality a consistent sequence of non-parametric estimators can be constructed that satisfies a large deviation principle. We present rigorous support for this conjecture under restrictive assumptions and simulation evidence indicating why we believe it to be true in greater generality.", "paper_title": "Estimating Loynes' exponent", "paper_id": "WOS:000294348600009"}
