They outperform the simultaneous uniattribute charts for monitoring multiattribute processes in many applications. Jolayemi [A statistical model for the design of multiattribute control charts. Indian J Stat. 1999;61:351-365] developed a statistical model for the design of a multiattribute np (Mnp) chart. Based on this model, a multiattribute synthetic (MSyn) chart is proposed in this article. Furthermore, the main features of the MSyn chart and Mnp chart are integrated to build a multiattribute Syn-np (MSyn-np) chart. The results of the comparative studies indicate that the new MSyn-np chart significantly outperforms the Mnp chart and MSyn chart by 83% and 27%, respectively, in terms of the average number of defectives over a wide range of process shifts under different circumstances.", "paper_title": "Development of a multiattribute synthetic-np chart", "paper_id": "WOS:000335853000003"}
