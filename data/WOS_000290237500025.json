Prediction of burden, one of the most significant variables in the blast design, is very essential. The Mamdani fuzzy system model can be applied to solve complex problems where number of variables is high and the relationship amongst them is not so clear. In this paper, a new fuzzy model was developed to predict burden incorporating rock geomechanical properties in blasting operation of Mouteh gold mine, Iran. To develop the model 95 datasets were utilized out which 80 datasets were used for constructing the model. Model inputs were considered to be rock quality designation, unconfined compressive strength, density, cohesive strength and blastability index. The very high prediction accuracy was examined by calculating indices such as variance account for, root mean square error and coefficient of determination. Sensitivity analysis showed that rock blastability index and unconfined compressive strength are the most effective parameters on the burden, whereas density is the least effective.
