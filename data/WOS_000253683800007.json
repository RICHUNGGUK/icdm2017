Such challenging structures need to be protected against wind-induced instabilities as flutter. The authors envision that a set of scientific disciplines not currently used in bridge engineering may help along the design process and constitute a useful tool. First, the formulation of sensitivity analysis of flutter speed is described, indicating how this technique can be a guide for engineers making changes in the prototype; two examples of important bridges, as the Great Belt and Messina Strait, are used to demonstrate the capability of this approach. Then, the idea of producing computer animations to represent the aeroelastic deformation of bridges simulating virtual boundary layer wind tunnel testing is presented showing pictures of the Tacoma Narrows and Messina Bridges. Finally, the advantages of introducing distributed computing to make easier to implement the previously mentioned techniques are demonstrated. The authors have previously published papers related with sensitivity analysis in bridges or computer animations of the aeroelastic behaviour of suspension bridges. However, this is the first time that their comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is presented.", "paper_title": "Multidisciplinary approach to aeroelastic studies of long-span bridges", "paper_id": "WOS:000253683800007"}
