We propose two major sources of work-family conflict: the structure of work and individual mindsets toward work. Furthermore, we examine beliefs about the employer that can diminish work-family conflict. We test our hypotheses using data gathered from 126 IT professionals. Our model explains more than 45% of the variance in work-family conflict. Our findings suggest: (1) skill variety requirements increase work-family conflict, (2) work ethic positively relates to work-family conflict, (3) leisure ethic negatively relates to work-family conflict, and (4) professionalism has mixed effects on work-family conflict. Finally, we found that when IT professionals perceive high levels of job security and are satisfied with supervision, work-family conflict diminishes. The study concludes with implications for research and practice.", "paper_title": "A STUDY OF WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT AMONG IT PROFESSIONALS: JOB CHARACTERISTICS, INDIVIDUAL VALUES, AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000274736400006"}
