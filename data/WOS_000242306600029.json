Because data in different data sources may beconflictive or untrue, researchers and practitioners must intensify efforts to develop appropriate techniques for its efficient use and management. In this paper, a logical framework is designed for identifying quality knowledge from different data sources, thus working towards the development of an agreed ontology. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the approach is promising, and that a minor data enhancement adjustment could bring higher effectiveness. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
