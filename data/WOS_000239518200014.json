A common thread is the quest for ever more expressive computational logics, on which executable formal specifications of increasingly broader classes of systems can be based. Several recent extensions, beyond Maude itself, are also discussed.", "paper_title": "From OBJ to Maude and beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000239518200014"}
