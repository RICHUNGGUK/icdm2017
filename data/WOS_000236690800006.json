An experimental flexible manipulator rig and corresponding simulation environment are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. A collocated proportional-derivative (PD) controller utilizing hub-angle and hub-velocity feedback is developed for control of rigid-body motion of the system. This is then extended to incorporate iterative learning control with acceleration feedback and genetic algorithms (GAs) for optimization of the learning parameters and a feedforward controller based on input shaping techniques for control of vibration (flexible motion) of the system. The system performance with the controllers is presented and analysed in the time and frequency domains. The performance of the hybrid learning control scheme with input shaping is assessed in terms of input tracking and level of vibration reduction. The effectiveness of the control schemes in handling various payloads is also studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
