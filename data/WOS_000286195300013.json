Packets are successfully received, even in case of collision, if the signal to interference plus noise ratio at the access point exceeds some threshold (power capture). The user problem of finding appropriate transmission probabilities is formulated as a static non-cooperative game and the performance limits for stationary and mobile scenarios are determined. The equilibrium analyses show that for stationary scenarios, users with high pathgains share the channel fairly while others never transmit. In the mobile case users utilize a binary strategy where they try to monopolize the channel when their pathgain exceeds some threshold that depends on system parameters (number of users, transmission costs, etc.). Otherwise they shut their transmitters off. Compared to traditional nondiscriminatory distributed multiaccess protocols the operating points achieved by selfish users generally increase sum-utility although this comes at the expense of larger user performance variations.", "paper_title": "Selfish users in energy constrained ALOHA systems with power capture", "paper_id": "WOS:000286195300013"}
