In spite of many empirical measurements in the literature, we still lack in-depth understanding on how and to what extent different factors contribute to the overall packet losses for a complete stack of protocols at large scale. Specifically, very little is known about: 1) when, where, and under what kind of circumstances packet losses occur; 2) why packets are lost. As a step toward addressing those issues, we deploy a large-scale WSN and design a measurement system for retrieving important system metrics. We propose MAP, a step-by-step methodology to identify the losses, extract system events, and perform spatial-temporal correlation analysis by employing a carefully examined causal graph. MAP enables us to get a closer look at the root causes of packet losses in a low-power ad hoc network. This study validates some earlier conjectures on WSNs and reveals some new findings. The quantitative results also shed lights for future large-scale WSN deployments.", "paper_title": "Measurement and Analysis on the Packet Delivery Performance in a Large-Scale Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000346796000020"}
