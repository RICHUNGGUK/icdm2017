Flow fields are predicted by solution of the density-weighted transport equations expressing conservation of mass and momentum, with closure achieved through the kappa-epsilon turbulence model and a second-moment closure. The particle phase is calculated using a Lagrangian particle tracking technique which involves solving the particle momentum equation in a form that accounts for the spatial, temporal and directional correlations of the Reynolds stresses experienced by a particle. The two phases are coupled via modification of the fluid-phase momentum equations. Predictions of the complete model are validated against available experimental data on a number of single-phase and two-phase, gas-solid jet flows with various particle loadings, and both mono- and poly-dispersed particle size distributions. Overall, predictions of the models compare favourably with the data examined, with results obtained from the anisotropic second-moment turbulence closure being superior to eddy viscosity-based predictions.
