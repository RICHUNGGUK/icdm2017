The OWA operator properties associated with the orness level are extended. Then, with the generating function representation of Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier, all these conditions and properties are extended to the case of RIM quantifiers, which can be seen as the continuous OWA operator with free dimension. Some families of consistency RIM quantifiers and their corresponding OWA operators are summarized. Some existing linguistic term RIM quantifiers are collected and two parameterized generalization forms of them are proposed, which can be useful for the selection and comparison of the linguistic quantifier in theory and applications.
