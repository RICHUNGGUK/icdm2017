SNPs account for most of the genetic variability between individuals and mapping SNPs in the human population has become the next high priority in genomics after the completion of the Human Genome Project. In diploid organisms such as humans, there are two nonidentical copies of each autosomal chromosome. A description of the SNPs in a chromosome is called a haplotype. At present, it is prohibitively expensive to directly determine the haplotypes of an individual, but it is possible to rather easily obtain the conflated SNP information in the so-called genotype. Computational methods for genotype phasing, that is, inferring haplotypes from genotype data, have received much attention in recent years as haplotype information leads to an increased statistical power of disease association tests. However, many of the existing algorithms have impractical runtime for phasing large genotype data sets such as those generated by the international HapMap Project. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable algorithm based on entropy minimization. Our algorithm is capable of phasing both unrelated and related genotypes coming from complex pedigrees. Experimental results on both real and simulated data sets show that our algorithm achieves a phasing accuracy worse than but close to that of the best existing methods while being several orders of magnitude faster. The open source code implementation of the algorithm and a Web interface are publicly available at http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/similar to software/ent/.", "paper_title": "Highly scalable genotype phasing by entropy minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000255443900009"}
