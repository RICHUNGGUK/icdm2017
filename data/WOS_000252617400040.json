A novel algorithm, called GDME, is proposed to combine grey relational clustering and DME approach for solving the problem of clock tree construction. Grey relational analysis can cluster the best pair of clock sinks and that guide a tapping point search for a DME algorithm for constructing a clock tree with zero skew and minimal delay. Experimentally, the proposed algorithm always obtains an RC- or RLC-based clock tree with zero skew and minimal delay for all the test cases and benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that the GDME improves up to 3.74% for total average in terms of total wire length compared with other DME algorithms. Furthermore, our results for the zero-skew RLC-based clock trees compared with Hspice are 0.017% and 0.2% lower for absolute average in terms of skew and delay, respectively.", "paper_title": "GDME: Grey relational clustering applied to a clock tree construction with zero Skew and minimal delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400040"}
