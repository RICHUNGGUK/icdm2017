Based on the Lyapunov function method and the Razumikhin technique, several synchronization criteria are derived for exponential synchronization of impulsive discrete-time complex networks. Using the concept of \"average impulsive interval\", the derived results are proved to be effective in dealing with synchronizing and desynchronizing impulses. Several numerical simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the simulation results show that the criteria are less conservative than the existing results considering the upper or lower of impulsive intervals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
