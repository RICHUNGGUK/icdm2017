The micro-ring resonator is the key switching component to build such an architecture. However, there is a major concern in accumulated signal insertion loss, especially for large-scale ONoC architectures. In this paper, we propose a new method to transform the ONoC topologies such that the insertion loss can be reduced. Analytical results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in insertion-loss reduction.", "paper_title": "On Reducing Insertion Loss in Wavelength-Routed Optical Network-on-Chip Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000343163300006"}
