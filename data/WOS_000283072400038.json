That is, an upper bound to the number of times a channel must be applied, so that it maps any density operator to one with full rank, is found. Using this bound, dichotomy theorems for the zero-error capacity of quantum channels and for the Matrix Product State ( MPS) dimension of ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians are derived. The obtained inequalities also imply new bounds on the required interaction-range of Hamiltonians with unique MPS ground state.", "paper_title": "A Quantum Version of Wielandt's Inequality", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400038"}
