The problem of broadcast orbit correction, resulting from precise ephemerides, has already been solved using traditional polynomial and trigonometric interpolation. As an alternative approach RBFN broadcast orbit correction produces results within the accuracy range of the traditional methods. Our study shows RBFN broadcast orbit correction performs well also near the end of data intervals and for short data spans (similar to 20 min). Regarding limitations of polynomial and trigonometric extrapolation, the most significant advantage of using RBFNs over the traditional methods for GPS broadcast orbit approximation arises from its short time prediction capability.
