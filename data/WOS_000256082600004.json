We model the behaviour of individual service by a guarded design, which enables one to separate the responsibility of clients from the commitment made by the system, and to identify a component by a set of failures and divergences. Protocols are introduced to coordinate the interactions between a component with the external environment. We adopt the notion of process refinement to formalize the substitutivity of components, and provide a complete proof method based on the notion of simulations.", "paper_title": "Service refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082600004"}
