The network-induced delay can be less or longer than one sampling period. A sufficient condition is presented for the exponentially mean square stability of the closed-loop WNCS, and corresponding state feedback controller is designed by using the augmenting technique and multi-Lyapunov approach. Then, combined with carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) algorithm, a method is given to choose proper parameter values. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Modelling and control of Zigbee-based wireless networked control system with both network-induced delay and packet dropout", "paper_id": "WOS:000319179800003"}
