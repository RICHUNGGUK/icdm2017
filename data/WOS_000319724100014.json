Unfortunately, it also poses a serious risk on both clients' privacy and intellectual property of monitoring service providers, which could deter the wide adoption of mHealth technology. This paper is to address this important problem and design a cloud-assisted privacy preserving mobile health monitoring system to protect the privacy of the involved parties and their data. Moreover, the outsourcing decryption technique and a newly proposed key private proxy reencryption are adapted to shift the computational complexity of the involved parties to the cloud without compromising clients' privacy and service providers' intellectual property. Finally, our security and performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed design.", "paper_title": "CAM: Cloud-Assisted Privacy Preserving Mobile Health Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000319724100014"}
