We use a wide range of aggregation operators involving interval numbers such as the uncertain weighted average (UWA), the uncertain ordered weighted average (UOWA), the uncertain generalized weighted average (UGWA) and the uncertain generalized ordered weighted average (UGOWA). We present a new approach to using interval weights in these uncertain aggregation operators. By using these aggregation operators within a D-S framework, we obtain various belief structures (BS), including the UWA (BS-UWA), the BS-UOWA, the BS-UGWA and the BS-UGOWA. We also use more complete formulations by using induced, hybrid and quasi-arithmetic aggregation operators. We end the paper by applying these operators to a decision-making problem regarding strategic management.", "paper_title": "DECISION-MAKING WITH UNCERTAIN AGGREGATION OPERATORS USING THE DEMPSTER-SHAFER BELIEF STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100003"}
