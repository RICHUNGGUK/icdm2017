These integrators use the input translinear cell of a CMOS current controlled conveyor. The frequency ranges of correct operation of the compensated integrator are analyzed. It is shown that the high cut-off frequency now becomes located to the higher possible values. These integrators are designed and simulated using a 0.8 mu m CMOS process. The frequency ranges of right operation of the compensated and uncompensated integrators are compared. They confirm very well the theory and underline the efficiency of the compensation methods.", "paper_title": "A new balanced CMOS controlled integrator for ultra high frequency applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236031400002"}
