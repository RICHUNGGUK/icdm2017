In the present paper we propose a new digital video watermarking scheme based on scene change analysis. By detecting the motion scene of video and using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques the watermark is embedded into mid-frequency sub-bands of wavelet coefficients. In this experiment in order to enhance the security of our algorithm four keys are considered. Three of them are formed in watermark encryption process and one key is related to CDMA embedding process. Also, with the aim of making a good compatibility between the proposed scheme and Human Visual System (HVS), the blue channel of RGB video is utilized to embed the watermark. Experimental results show the high robustness of the proposed method against both intentional and unintentional attacks during the transfer of video data. The implemented attacks are Gaussian noise, median filtering, frame averaging, frame dropping, geometric attacks and different kinds of lossy compressions including MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MJPEG and H.264/AVC.", "paper_title": "Content Protection in Video Data Based on Robust Digital Watermarking Resistant to Intentional and Unintentional Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334326100012"}
