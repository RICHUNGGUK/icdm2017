But with its widely application, many relevant problems, especially the safety issues of RFID system and the low cost issue of label have been raised more and more attention by people; therefore, a new and more appropriate security authentication protocol becomes necessary. In this paper, firstly introducing several now available security authentication protocols, and analyzing their strengths and drawbacks, then proposed a new authentication scheme based on Hash function, doing security properties and feasibility analysis of it in theory, and proving that the security properties of this scheme is more efficient, and it is more applicable to meet the needs of people through test at last.", "paper_title": "Research on the Authentication of Radio Frequency Identification based on the Hash function", "paper_id": "WOS:000369375600020"}
