When analysing a language with pregroup grammars, we are thus led to replace the free pregroup by a free compact strict monoidal category. Since a strict monoidal category is a 2-category with one 0-cell, we investigate the free compact 2-category generated by a given category, and describe its 2-cells as labelled transition systems. In particular, we obtain a decision procedure for the equality of 2-cells in the free compact 2-category.", "paper_title": "Free compact 2-categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000247037800009"}
