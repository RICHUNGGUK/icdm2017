In this paper, we have proposed the enhanced grid security and privacy (EGSP) system architecture including EGSP system model, identity protection system, onion routing system, reputation system, and security technology. We also present a network simulation of the model and analyze its scalability.", "paper_title": "Model and simulation on enhanced grid security and privacy system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100075"}
