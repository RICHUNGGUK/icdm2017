While the developed algorithms often outperform their CPU counterparts, it is not beneficial to keep processing devices idle while overutilizing others. Therefore, an approach is needed that efficiently distributes a workload on available (co-)processors while providing accurate performance estimates for the query optimizer. In this paper, we contribute heuristics that optimize query processing for response time and throughput simultaneously via inter-device parallelism. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new approach achieves speedups up to 1.85 compared to state-of-the-art approaches while preserving accurate performance estimations. In a further series of experiments, we evaluate our approach on two new use cases: joining and sorting. Furthermore, we use a simulation to assess the performance of our approach for systems with multiple co-processors and derive some general rules that impact performance in those systems.
