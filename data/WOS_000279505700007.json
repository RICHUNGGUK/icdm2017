The existing single-phase 8- and 6-switch 5-level current source inverters (CSIs) can be derived from this generalized MCSI topology. In the proposed topology, each intermediate DC-link current level can be balanced automatically without adding any external circuits; thus, a true multilevel structure is provided. Moreover, owing to the dual relationship, many research results relating to the operation, modulation, and control strategies of MVSIs can be applied directly to the MCSIs. Some simulation results are presented to verify the proposed MCSI topology.", "paper_title": "Generalized multilevel current source inverter topology with self-balancing current", "paper_id": "WOS:000279505700007"}
