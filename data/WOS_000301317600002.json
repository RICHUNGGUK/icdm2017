The major areas of computer application are identified in several stages of ship/floating structure design and analysis with the principal emphasis on the methodologies, the modeling, and the integration of the design and analysis process. The discussion addresses some of the key challenges in computer applications for ship and floating structure design and analysis, and reports on the emerging trends in the research, design and industrial application.
