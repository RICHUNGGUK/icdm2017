A simple bounding surface plasticity model was developed to capture the bonding effects induced by lignosulfonate. One of the appealing aspects of the model is that it can incorporate the mechanical behaviour of the bonded soil during shearing, including the brittle and ductile failure modes. Validity of the model was verified by experimental results of lignosulfonate-treated soils under different stress path conditions. The mechanical behaviour of chemically treated soil was adequately captured by the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
