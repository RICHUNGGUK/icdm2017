We show that query processing in such pdl-programs can be reduced to computing all answer sets of dl-programs and solving linear optimization problems, and to computing the well founded model of dl-programs, respectively. Moreover, we show that the answer set semantics of pdl-programs is a refinement of the well-founded semantics of pdl-programs. Furthermore, we also present an algorithm for query processing in the special case of stratified pdl-programs, which is based on a reduction to computing the canonical model of stratified dl-programs.
