The results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases used for the web-based version are updated on a regular basis. riboPicker categorizes rRNA-like sequences and provides graphical visualizations and tabular outputs of ribosomal coverage, alignment results and taxonomic classifications. Availability and implementation: This open-source application was implemented in Perl and can be used as stand-alone version or accessed online through a user-friendly web interface. The source code, user help and additional information is available at http://ribopicker.sourceforge.net/.", "paper_title": "Identification and removal of ribosomal RNA sequences from metatranscriptomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000300043200024"}
