When considering multiple components, energy optimal frequencies depend on task set characteristics such as the number of CPU and memory access cycles. In this work, we propose a realistic energy model considering multiple components with individually adjustable frequencies such as CPUs, system bus and memory, and related task set characteristics. The model is validated on a real platform and shows less than 2% relative error compared to measured values. Based on the proposed energy model, we present an optimal static frequency assignment scheme for multiple DVS components to schedule a set of periodic real-time tasks. We simulate the energy gain of the proposed scheme compared to other DVS schemes for various task and system configurations, showing up to a 20% energy reduction. We also experimentally verify energy savings of the proposed scheme on a real hardware platform.", "paper_title": "System-wide energy optimization for multiple DVS components and real-time tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293950900005"}
