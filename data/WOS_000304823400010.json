For effective performance of MOEA/D, neighborhood size (NS) parameter has to be tuned. In this letter, an ensemble of different NSs with online self-adaptation is proposed (ENS-MOEA/D) to overcome this shortcoming. Our experimental results on the CEC 2009 competition test instances show that an ensemble of different NSs with online self-adaptation yields superior performance over implementations with only one fixed NS.", "paper_title": "Decomposition-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm with an Ensemble of Neighborhood Sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304823400010"}
