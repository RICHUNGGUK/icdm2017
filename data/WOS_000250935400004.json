Nonetheless, their reasonable combination is yet to be studied, and integrating the existing solutions either fails or works with a complexity that can be significantly improved. In this paper we prove the equivalence of EXACT learning attribute-efficiently with and without corrupt oracles. For each of the possible scenarios we describe a generic scheme that enables learning in these cases using modifications of the standard learning algorithms. We also generalize and improve previous non-attribute-efficient algorithms for teaming with corrupt oracles. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
