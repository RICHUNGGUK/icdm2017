Zayernouri and G. E. Karniadakis (2014) [10] proposed a new spectral method for fractional differential equations and observed an exponential rate of convergence. In this paper, we will prove a convergence rate of their spectral method and thus, provide an explanation for their observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
