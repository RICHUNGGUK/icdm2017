Given two sequences X, Y and a constrained pattern P of lengths m, n, and rho, respectively, the generalized constrained longest common subsequence (GC-LCS) problems are to find a longest common subsequence of X and Y including (or excluding) P as a subsequence (or substring). We propose new dynamic programming algorithms for solving the GC-LCS problems in O(mn rho) time. We also consider the case where the number of constrained patterns is arbitrary.", "paper_title": "On the generalized constrained longest common subsequence problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000289145600007"}
