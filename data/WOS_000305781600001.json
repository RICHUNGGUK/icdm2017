The problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty. We describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem, seen as a Markov Decision Problem, building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles. Our solution exploits and adapts several existing techniques: planning for deterministic mixed discrete-continuous problems and Monte Carlo sampling for policy learning. The paper describes the development of planning techniques to allow solution of the non-linear continuous dynamic models capturing the battery behaviours. This approach depends on carefully handled discretisation of the temporal dimension. The construction of policies is performed using a classification approach and this idea offers opportunities for wider exploitation in other problems. The approach and its generality are described in the paper. Application of the approach leads to construction of policies that, in simulation, significantly outperform those that are currently in use and the best published solutions to the battery management problem. We achieve solutions that achieve more than 99% efficiency in simulation compared with the theoretical limit and do so with far fewer battery switches than existing policies. Behaviour of physical batteries does not exactly match the simulated models for many reasons, so to confirm that our theoretical results can lead to real measured improvements in performance we also conduct and report experiments using a physical test system. These results demonstrate that we can obtain 5%-15% improvement in lifetimes in the case of a two battery system.", "paper_title": "Plan-based Policies for Efficient Multiple Battery Load Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000305781600001"}
