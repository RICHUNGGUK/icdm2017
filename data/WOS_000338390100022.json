A taxonomy is used to aggregate data items into higher-level concepts and to discover frequent recurrences among data items at different granularity levels. However, since traditional high-level itemsets may also represent the knowledge covered by their lower-level frequent descendant itemsets, the expressiveness of high-level itemsets can be rather limited. To overcome this issue, this article proposes two novel itemset types, called Expressive Generalized Itemset (EGI) and Maximal Expressive Generalized Itemset (Max-EGI), in which the frequency of occurrence of a high-level itemset is evaluated only on the portion of data not yet covered by any of its frequent descendants. Specifically, EGI s represent, at a high level of abstraction, the knowledge associated with sets of infrequent itemsets, while Max-EGIs compactly represent all the infrequent descendants of a generalized itemset. Furthermore, we also propose an algorithm to discover Max-EGIs at the top of the traditionally mined itemsets. Experiments, performed on both real and synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
