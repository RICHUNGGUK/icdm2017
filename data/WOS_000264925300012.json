Employing the method of change of measure together with the Bayes' rule for conditional expectations, solution expressions for the value of common contracts are obtained. A demonstration of how to apply our proposed stochastic modelling approach to value survival and death benefits is provided. Using the Human Mortality Database and UK interest rates, we illustrate that the dependence between interest rate and mortality dynamics has considerable impact in the value of even a simple survival benefit.
