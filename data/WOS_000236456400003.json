We survey recent research on quantum algorithms and quantum complexity theory for two basic numerical problems - high dimensional integration and approximation. Having matching upper and lower complexity bounds for the quantum setting, we are in a position to compare them with those for the classical deterministic and randomized setting, previously obtained in information-based complexity theory. This enables us to assess the possible speedups quantum computation could provide over classical deterministic or randomized algorithms for these numerical problems.", "paper_title": "Numerical analysis on a quantum computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400003"}
