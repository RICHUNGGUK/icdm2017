Consensus-based protocols can provide light-weight and efficient solutions for CRAHNs and CRSNs but the theoretical ground needs to be investigated for spectrum sharing fairness. In this paper, we investigate the convergence condition when applying a consensus-based protocol to spectrum sharing while ensuring spectrum sharing fairness. Based on the local observation and local control scheme using spectrum-related information, an individual cognitive node can effectively perform the spectrum sharing. Then we propose a consensus-based protocol for spectrum sharing. Supported with computer simulation results, we show the effectiveness of using the proposed consensus-based protocol to solve the spectrum sharing problems in CRAHNs and CRSNs.", "paper_title": "A Consensus-Based Protocol for Spectrum Sharing Fairness in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310624600001"}
