In order to achieve performance improvements, the degrees of freedom of the problem may be reduced by using the main global deformations alone. However, this can lead to a reduction in quality and realism due to the lack of local behaviors. To solve this problem, we present a new method to add local deformations to modal analysis simulations. We perceptually evaluate our method with a set of experiments, thereby deriving guidelines for when and how local deformations can best be used.
