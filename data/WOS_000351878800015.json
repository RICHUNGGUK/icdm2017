Conference-key agreement protocols provide secure group communications with lower computational cost. Providing key agreements and updates of dynamic groups in an efficient manner is a significant challenge for conference-key agreement protocols. Auxiliary key agreement operations are needed to solve the challenge. In this paper, we propose an improved conference-key agreement protocol, called Dynamic Conference-Key Agreement Protocol, that consists of Initial Conference-Key Agreement Protocol and Auxiliary Conference-Key Agreement operations. Dynamic Conference-Key Agreement Protocol has operations to handle dynamic groups. The proposed protocol has better fault correction and provides the same security level with the existing ones.
