After briefly reviewing the main concepts and procedures required to obtain the GBT system of non-linear equilibrium equations, the paper describes the steps involved in the numerical implementation (incremental-iterative strategy) of a non-linear beam finite element that incorporates the influence of the non-standard support conditions. Finally, the application and capabilities of the proposed GBT-based beam finite element are illustrated by means of the presentation and discussion of numerical results concerning the post-buckling behaviour of lipped I-section columns and lipped channel columns and beams with and without localised displacement restraints. For validation purposes, most GBT-based results are compared with values yielded by shell finite element analyses carried out in the commercial code ANSYS. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
