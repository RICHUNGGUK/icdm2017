However, information of TFs and their targets in mammalian is far from sufficient. Here, we developed an integrated TF platform (ITFP), which included abundant TFs and their targets of mammalian. In current release, ITFP includes 4105 putative TFs and 69496 potential TF-target pairs for human, 3134 putative TFs and 37040 potential TF-target pairs for mouse, and 1114 putative TFs and 18055 potential TF-target pairs for rat. In short, ITFP will serve as an important resource for the research community of transcription and provide strong support for regulatory network study.", "paper_title": "ITFP: an integrated platform of mammalian transcription factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000259973500030"}
