With the rapid development of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network technology, traditional scheduling and load balancing techniques are facing new challenges because P2P-based systems require more dynamic mechanisms for task scheduling and load balancing among heterogeneous network computing nodes. In this paper, we propose a scheme for dynamic scheduling and load balancing in a P2P-based environment. Our scheme aims at Service-Oriented P2P-based distributed systems, however, it can be applied to traditional distributed architecture straightforwardly. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our scheme using simulation experiments in a cluster-based distributed computing environment. Indeed, our results show that our scheme can achieve significant system performance gain compared to commonly used random and round robin scheduling algorithms in P2P-based systems. Meanwhile, we use a real-time distributed simulation to evaluate our algorithm, which can provide more trustful results in terms of performance evaluation. Indeed, the ease of using a distributed real-time simulation, to measure the real-time performance of the algorithm can promote more flexible and efficient methods for the development of load balancing algorithms. This is especially the case for the hard-to-predict P2P-based distributed systems.
