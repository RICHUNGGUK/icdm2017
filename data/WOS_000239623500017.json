They are extension of Hu's improved discernibility matrix and function such that the reducts and the cores of decision tables could be calculated by parts of them. The method of new discernibility matrix and function may be applied to the cases of large amount of data and incremental data.", "paper_title": "A new discernibility matrix and function", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500017"}
