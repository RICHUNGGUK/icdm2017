However, due to the dynamic and unreliable communication nature of MANETs, previously determined paths can easily become disconnected. Although dynamic routing can be used to circumvent this problem, determining a new route each time a packet needs to be sent involves a lot of overhead. An alternative form of dynamic routing involves maintaining valid routes in routing tables, which can be dynamically updated whenever network changes are detected. This paper proposes a new routing algorithm, referred to as pseudo-distance routing (PDR), that supports efficient routing table maintenance and dynamic routing based on such routing tables.", "paper_title": "A pseudo-distance routing (PDR) algorithm for mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500019"}
