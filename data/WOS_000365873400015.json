More precisely, if the distance between the target vector and the lattice is no larger than c for arbitrary large but finite constant c > 0, we give randomized and deterministic polynomial time algorithms to find a closest vector, while previous reductions were only known for . Moreover, if the distance between the target vector and the lattice is larger than some quantity with respect to lambda (n) (L), using SIVP gamma oracle and Babai's nearest plane algorithm, we can solve in deterministic polynomial time. Specially, if the approximate factor gamma I mu (1, 2) in the SIVP gamma oracle, we obtain a better reduction factor for CVP.", "paper_title": "Solving Closest Vector Instances Using an Approximate Shortest Independent Vectors Oracle", "paper_id": "WOS:000365873400015"}
