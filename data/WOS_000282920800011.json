We find non-local but non-signaling probabilities satisfying Hardy's argument for two two-level and three two-level systems. Maximum probability of success of Hardy's argument is obtained for three two-level systems in quantum theory as well as in a more generalized theory. Interestingly, the maximum in the generalized non-local theory for both the two two-level systems and three two-level systems turns out to be the same.", "paper_title": "HARDY'S NON-LOCALITY AND GENERALIZED NON-LOCAL THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000282920800011"}
