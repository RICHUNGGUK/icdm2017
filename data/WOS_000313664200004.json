These applications typically operate in distributed computing environments, collecting and collating information from multiple computers that host databases or traditional computer applications. The increase in internet traffic is a clear reflection of the increase in demand for various web-based applications. Managers often find it essential to have the capability to predict performance of these systems in order to maintain service levels, as measured by response time. We present a generic discrete event simulation tool for modelling web-based application systems. Modelling information flow for decision making in such systems requires constructs not typically available in simulation software. We have developed several constructs that can be used in constructing models for various kinds of web-based applications. An example system is modelled using the tool, the impact of different variables (eg transaction volume) on the system performance is analysed and some preliminary insights are presented.
