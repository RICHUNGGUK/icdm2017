However, accurate LQP is difficult because of the dynamic nature of wireless environments. A recent study found that fluctuations in intermediate quality links often show dynamics on a sub-second granularity, making the task even more challenging. In order to leverage the intermediate links, as well as fine-tune upper-layer protocols, we propose to use nonparametric modeling in nonlinear time series analysis that predicts short-term link quality online. Unlike existing studies, we do not define any new experimental or hypothetical models, or train models using a set of training data. Functional-coefficient autoregression is employed to predict the link dynamics at high time resolutions. We apply our approach and a local linear regression-based LQP (a typical parametric modeling approach) to both NS-2 simulation and empirical packet traces. The results indicate that the proposed method has much higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than the local linear regression-based LQP under dynamic network conditions.", "paper_title": "Short-term link quality prediction using nonparametric time series analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000358135700008"}
