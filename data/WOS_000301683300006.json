These two methods are investigated to extract the coherent and incoherent parts of a forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent field. The Lattice Boltzmann method with resolutions of 128(3) and 256(3) is used to simulate the turbulent fields, and the Q-identification method is applied to extract the elongated vortical structures. Most of the previous efforts apply filtering techniques to the velocity or vorticity fields; however, this paper applies the two filtering methods to the Q-field. 3D curvelet filtering is applied using a nonlinear thresholding technique. The 3D total variation method is applied using the split Bregman regularization method. The results indicate that the two filtering methods identify the coherent and incoherent parts smoothly. The results of the two filtering methods tend to identify coherent vortices and remove incoherent noise without any change in the physical structure of the turbulent fields. The results are compared with previous efforts using wavelet and Fourier decompositions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
