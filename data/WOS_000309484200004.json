One strategy to deal with positivity and unit trace constraints is to parameterize the matrix to be reconstructed in order to ensure that it is physical. In this case, the negative log-likelihood function in terms of the parameters, may have several local minima. In various papers in the field, a source of errors in this process has been associated to the possibility that most of these local minima are not global, so that optimization methods could be trapped in the wrong minimum, leading to a wrong density matrix. Here we show that, for convex negative log-likelihood functions, all local minima of the unconstrained parameterized problem are global, thus any minimizer leads to the maximum likelihood estimation for the density matrix. We also discuss some practical sources of errors.", "paper_title": "LOCAL SOLUTIONS OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION IN QUANTUM STATE TOMOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000309484200004"}
