Design/methodology/approach - Different ac/dc power converter topologies are comparatively studied, each with an accordingly designed PMSG, so as to investigate the influence of the armature winding inductance as well as the relationship between the PMSG and power converter topologies. Findings - Pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier is preferable for the said application due to its good performance and controllability. Moreover, by employing the PWM rectifier, relatively large inductance of the PMSG is considered for both short-circuit current reduction and field regulation. Originality/value - Field-regulating control is realized with a space vector PWM (SVPWM) rectifier, which can weaken the PMSG magnetic field during high-speed operation, while even properly enhance the field at low speed, ensuring a small change of the PMSG output voltage and a stable dc voltage.", "paper_title": "Machine design and control strategy for wide-speed-range PMSG systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349641700008"}
