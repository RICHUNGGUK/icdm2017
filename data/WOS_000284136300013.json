However, it computes and uses many polynomials that turn out to be redundant. Eliminating these redundant polynomials is a non-trivial task, because they correspond to signatures required for reduction. This paper revisits the theory underlying F5 and describes F5C, a new variant that prunes redundant polynomials, then re-computes signatures to preserve correctness. This strategy successfully reduces both overhead and execution time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
