We characterize parameterized LMI-based conditions the feasibility of which guarantee that the switched delay system is delay-dependent asymptotically stable with an L(2)-gain smaller than a prescribed constant level. Following this procedure, these conditions do not require overbounding or ill-posed inequalities. Switched state and static output feedback schemes are designed such that the corresponding switched closed-loop system is delay-dependent asymptotically stability with an L(2)-gain smaller titan a prescribed constant level. A representative example is worked out in detail to illustrate the theoretical developments.", "paper_title": "A PARAMETERIZED DELAY-DEPENDENT CONTROL OF SWITCHED DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEMS WITH TIME-DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300038"}
