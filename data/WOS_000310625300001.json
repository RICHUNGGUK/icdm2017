In this paper, we propose a regional self-organizing energy-saving management mechanism through pilot power adjustment in cellular networks. The mechanism analyzes autonomic processes for saving energy firstly. Then, it proposes regional BS TP (Trigonal-Pair) compensation method to determine BS modes for saving energy. Next, it adopts intelligent coverage compensation algorithm to adjust pilot power of compensated BSs, so as to avoid coverage hole and ensure enough capacity. Integrated evaluation model is still proposed in the mechanism to validate efficiency of proposed algorithms. Simulations show that about 17% of regional energy consumption can be saved. In comparison to other ES methods, our ES mechanism can obtain better energy-saving outcomes and keep service quality and coverage above acceptable levels.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Energy-Saving Management Mechanism Based on Pilot Power Adjustment in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310625300001"}
