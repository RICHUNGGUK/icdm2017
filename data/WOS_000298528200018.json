Based on the theory of mixed monotone operator, a testable algebraic criteria for ascertaining global exponential convergence is derived. Furthermore, the rate of exponential convergence and bound of the networks are also estimated. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.
