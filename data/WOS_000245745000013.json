The human body components are studied separately and are shown to have unequal discrimination power. Several approaches are presented for the combination of the results obtained from different body components into a common distance metric for the evaluation of similarity between gait sequences. A method is also proposed for the determination of the weighting of the various body components based on their contribution to recognition performance. Using the best performing of the proposed methods, improved recognition performance is achieved. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
