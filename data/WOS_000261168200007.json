Reo is an exogenous coordination language for compositional construction of the coordination subsystem. Constraint automaton has been defined as the operational semantics of Reo. The main goal of this paper is to prepare a model checking method for verifying linear time temporal properties of component-based systems whose coordinating subsystems are modeled by Reo and components are modeled by labeled transition systems. For this purpose, we introduce modified definitions of constraint automata and their composition operators by which, every labeled transition system can be translated into a constraint automaton. We show that failure-based equivalences CFFD and NDFD are congruences with respect to the compositional operators of constraint automata. Also we present a method for compositional model checking of component-based system using these equivalences for reducing the sizes of constraint automata models.", "paper_title": "MODEL CHECKING OF COMPONENT BASED SOFTWARE USING COMPOSITIONAL REDUCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261168200007"}
