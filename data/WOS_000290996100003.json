We also work out a number of dimensions that allow to characterize the type of ontology localization performed and to predict the layers that will be affected. Overall our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the task of localizing an ontology.", "paper_title": "A note on ontology localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000290996100003"}
