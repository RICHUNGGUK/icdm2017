It is shown that the Cohen-Grossberg neural network is globally exponentially stable, if the absolute value of the input vector exceeds a criterion. As special cases, the Hopfield neural network and the cellular neural network are examined in detail. In addition, it is shown that criteria herein, if partially satisfied, can still be used in combination with existing stability conditions. Simulation results are also discussed in two illustrative examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
