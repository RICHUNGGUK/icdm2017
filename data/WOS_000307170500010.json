The data structure has an expected query time that is within a constant factor of optimal. More specifically, an algorithm is presented that preprocesses a connected planar subdivision G of size n and a query distribution D to produce a point location data structure for G. The expected number of point-line comparisons performed by this data structure, when the queries are distributed according to D, is (H) over tilde + O((H) over tilde (1/2) + 1) where (H) over tilde = (H) over tilde (G, D) is a lower bound on the expected number of point-line comparisons performed by any linear decision tree for point location in G under the query distribution D. The preprocessing algorithm runs in O(n log n) time and produces a data structure of size O(n). These results are obtained by creating a Steiner triangulation of G that has near-minimum entropy.", "paper_title": "Entropy, Triangulation, and Point Location in Planar Subdivisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000307170500010"}
