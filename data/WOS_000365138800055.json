Then, we have proposed two aggregation operators: hesitant fuzzy linguistic geometric Bonferroni mean (HFLGBM) operator and hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (HFLWGBM) operator. Then, we have utilized HFLWGBM operator to tackle the multiple attribute decision making problems using hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. In the end, a practical example for risk assessment of mass unexpected incident in city is proposed to testify the method in this paper.", "paper_title": "Risk assessment method for mass unexpected incident in city with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800055"}
