The most common use of the PFMEA involves manufacturing processes as they are required to be closely examined against any unnatural deviation in the state of the process for producing products with consistent quality. In a typical FMEA, for each failure modes, three risk factors; severity (S), occurrence (O), and detectability (D) are evaluated and their multiplication derives the risk priority number (RPN). However there are many shortcomings of this classical crisp RPN calculation. This study introduces a fuzzy hybrid approach that allows experts to use linguistic variables for determining S, O, and D for PFMEA by applying fuzzy 'technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution' (TOPSIS) and fuzzy 'analytical hierarchy process' (AHP). An application to a spindle manufacturing process expresses the relevance of the fuzzy hybrid model in PFMEA.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Hybrid Approach for Fuzzy Process FMEA: An Application to a Spindle Manufacturing Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000307642700001"}
