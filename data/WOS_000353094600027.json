In the backstepping design, all unknown functions at intermediate steps are passed down such that only a single neural network is needed to approximate a lumped uncertainty at the last step. The closed-loop system achieves practical asymptotic stability in the sense that all involved signals are bounded and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. The contribution of this study is that the complexity growing problem of the traditional ABNNC design is substantially eliminated for a general class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems, where the constraints of control parameters that guarantee closed-loop stability is clearly demonstrated. An illustrative example has verified effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
