However, during procedures where transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance is used, substantial gland deformation can occur due to TRUS probe pressure. In this paper, the ability of a statistical shape/motion model, trained using finite element simulations, to predict and compensate for this source of motion is investigated. Three-dimensional ultrasound images acquired on five patient prostates, before and after TRUS-probe-induced deformation, were registered using a nonrigid, surface-based method, and the accuracy of different deformation models compared. Registration using a statistical motion model was found to outperform alternative elastic deformation methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, and required substantially fewer target surface points to achieve a successful registration. The mean final target registration error (based on anatomical landmarks) using this method was 1.8 mm. We conclude that a statistical model of prostate deformation provides an accurate, rapid and robust means of predicting prostate deformation from sparse surface data, and is therefore well-suited to a number of interventional applications where there is a need for deformation compensation.", "paper_title": "Modelling Prostate Motion for Data Fusion During Image-Guided Interventions", "paper_id": "WOS:000296455500002"}
