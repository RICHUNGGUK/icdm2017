This paper treats applications in which data updates are dependent on satisfaction of integrity constraints over multiple objects. Network partitions, caused by occasional link failures, overload or attacks create problems in keeping both consistency and availability in such networks. We propose a means of achieving higher availability by providing partition-awareness in middleware. The general approach has been illustrated by implementing a number of CORBA extensions that trade consistency for availability during network partitions. This paper contains a thorough experimental evaluation that presents the gains and costs of our approach. The experiments clearly illustrate the benefit of our protocols in terms of significantly higher availability and the number of performed operations.
