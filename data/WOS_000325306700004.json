We model the corporate bond price through a reduced-form approach and solve the dynamics of its price. The optimal investment process will be worked out first with a general risk-averse utility function, and then an optimal strategy with CARA utility will be presented using martingale methods. The optimal investment strategy is analyzed numerically for the CARA utility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
