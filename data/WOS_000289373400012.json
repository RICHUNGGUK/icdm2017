Experimental investigations and detailed simulations are conducted to understand its behavior and to optimize for broadband operation. Good agreement between the measurement and simulation has been achieved. The designed conical DRH antenna introduces a low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), which is lower than 2.3 for the frequency range of 6-18 GHz and simultaneously achieves slant polarization as well as stable far-field radiation characteristics in the entire operating bandwidth. The common impedance exponential tapering is used at the flare section of the horn. Moreover, a new cavity back with a conical structure is used to improve the VSWR. The simulated and measured results for VSWR, far field E-plane and H-plane radiation patterns, and gain of the designed antenna are presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
