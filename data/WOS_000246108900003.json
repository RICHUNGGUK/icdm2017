An exponential asymptote is proven for general service times in two special cases: when the traffic load is sufficiently high and when the request length is sufficiently small. Furthermore, using the branching process technique we derive exact asymptotics of exponential type for the sojourn time in the M/M/1 queue. We obtain an equation for the asymptotic decay rate and an exact expression for the asymptotic constant. The decay rate is studied in detail and is compared to other service disciplines. Finally, using numerical methods, we investigate the accuracy of the exponential asymptote.", "paper_title": "Tail behavior of conditional sojourn times in Processor-Sharing queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000246108900003"}
