Design/methodology/approach - The time integration algorithm discussed in this work corresponds to a spectral decomposition technique implemented in the time domain. As in the case of the modal decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of the resulting integration scheme depends on the possibility of uncoupling the equations of motion. This is achieved by solving an eigenvalue problem in the time domain that only depends on the approximation basis being implemented. Complete sets of orthogonal Legendre polynomials are used to define the time approximation basis required by the model. Findings - A classical example with known analytical solution is presented to validate the model, in linear and non-linear analysis. The efficiency of the numerical technique is assessed. Comparisons are made with the classical Newmark method applied to the solution of both linear and non-linear dynamics. The mixed time integration technique presents some interesting features making very attractive its application to the analysis of non-linear dynamic systems. It corresponds in essence to a modal decomposition technique implemented in the time domain. As in the case of the modal decomposition in space, the numerical efficiency of the resulting integration scheme depends on the possibility of uncoupling the equations of motion. Originality/value - One of the main advantages of this technique is the possibility of considering relatively large time step increments which enhances the computational efficiency of the numerical procedure. Due to its characteristics, this method is well suited to parallel processing, one of the features that have to be conveniently explored in the near future.", "paper_title": "On a mixed time integration procedure for non-linear structural dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000354646300007"}
