DFT optimized the intermediates and transient states using the GAMESS program package, but the structures, total energy, and thermodynamic properties were calculated by semi-empirical methods using ZINDO/1 at room temperature. The results show a sensitivity enhancement in resistance and capacitance when CO2 and H2O are converted to CH3OH and other products. TiN-nanotubes use photo-catalytic reactivity for the reduction of CO2 and H2O to form CH3OH or CH4 at 298 K. The endohedral location of interaction of these reactants in TiN-nanotubes with Cu-nanoparticles was investigated. Calculations show that these processes were endothermic, thus the reactions need solar or other energies in the presence of visible light to progress favorably.", "paper_title": "Using of TiN-nanotubes and Cu-nanoparticles for conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458400023"}
