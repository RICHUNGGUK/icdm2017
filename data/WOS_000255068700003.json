The system is of the same type as the well-known \"adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system\" (ANFIS) method. However, different restrictions are applied to the system that considerably reduce the complexity of the inference mechanism. Hence, efficient implementations can be developed. Some experiments are presented which demonstrate the good performance of the proposed system despite its restrictions. Finally, an efficient digital hardware implementation is presented for a two-input single-output neuro-fuzzy system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
