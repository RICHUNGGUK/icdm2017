Alves-Pinto, E.A. Lopez-Poveda, Detection of high-frequency spectral notches its a function of level, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 118 (2005) 2485-2469.]. The simulations suggest that the discrimination task in question relies on comparing the timing of auditory nerve spikes, hence that high-frequency sounds are represented in the auditory nerve by a time code. They further suggest that the improvement in spectral discrimination at high intensities is associated with inherent inner hair cell nonlinearities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
