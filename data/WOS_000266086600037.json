The system inputs are signals from sensors, which are used to recognize correct behavior (action sequences) by Inductive Learning, using Data Mining techniques. The inference engine is a reasoning device that is implemented by means of Regular Grammars. It permits LIS to control user's behavior. As Output, the system produces and sends alarms when a user action sequence is wrong, indicating the erroneous actions, forgotten future, and so on. To test Our system, the Tagged World is supposed to be at a house, where we have used RFID technology to control the objects inside it. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
