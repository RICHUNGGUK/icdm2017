This theory may provide a decision making tool which improves the generation of detectors or even define new data monitoring in order to detect an extreme variation of the system behavior, which means anomalies occurrences. Through these algorithms, tests are performed to detect faults of a DC motor. Upon detection of faults, a participatory clustering algorithm is used to classify these faults and tested to obtain the best set of parameters to achieve the most accurate clustering for these tests in the application being discussed in the article.
