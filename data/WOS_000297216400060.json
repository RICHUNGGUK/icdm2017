Given examples of sensibly furnished indoor scenes, our system extracts, in advance, hierarchical and spatial relationships for various furniture objects, encoding them into priors associated with ergonomic factors, such as visibility and accessibility, which are assembled into a cost function whose optimization yields realistic furniture arrangements. To deal with the prohibitively large search space, the cost function is optimized by simulated annealing using a Metropolis-Hastings state search step. We demonstrate that our system can synthesize multiple realistic furniture arrangements and, through a perceptual study, investigate whether there is a significant difference in the perceived functionality of the automatically synthesized results relative to furniture arrangements produced by human designers.", "paper_title": "Make it Home: Automatic Optimization of Furniture Arrangement", "paper_id": "WOS:000297216400060"}
