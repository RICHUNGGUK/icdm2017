DSNP is a protocol to negotiate the Service Level Specification (SLS) at the IP layer. It can be used for service negotiation from host to network, network to host, and network to network. Dynamic negotiation not only provides flexibility to the users, but also lets service providers better utilize their network resources. DSNP can be used in both wireline and wireless networks. It is, however, particularly useful in a mobile environment on account of its light-weight. The usefulness of DSNP is demonstrated on a DiffServ-based wireless testbed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
