Polya's Theorem says that if a homogeneous polynomial p is an element of R[X] is positive on the standard n-simplex Delta(n), then for sufficiently large N all the coefficients of (X(1) + ... + X(n))(N) p are positive. We give a complete characterization of forms, possibly with zeros on Delta(n), for which there exists N so that all coefficients of (X(1) + ... + X(n))(N) p have only nonnegative coefficients, along with a bound on the N needed.
