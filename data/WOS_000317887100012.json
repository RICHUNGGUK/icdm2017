Two different notions of implication are addressed: one where a dependency is implied by the given set of dependencies plus the underlying schema, and one where a dependency is implied by the given set of dependencies alone. We establish axiomatizations for both notions of implication, and reveal deep relationships between them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
