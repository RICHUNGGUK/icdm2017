By a spatial transform, the advection-diffusion equation in the unbounded domain R(n) is converted to one on the bounded domain [-1, 1](n) and the Laplace transform is applied to eliminate time dependency. the consequent boundary value problem is solved by collocation on Chebyshev points. To face the well-known computational challenge represented by the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, Talbot's method is applied, consisting of numerically integrating the Bromwich integral on a special contour by means of trapezoidal or midpoint rules. Numerical experiment illustrate that TSTM has exponential rate in time and space.
