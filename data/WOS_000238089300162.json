We first use the simple method to find the neighboring area which influences the shape of the vacant area. Then we construct the bi-cubic Bezier spline surface to interpolate given points in the influencing area. Re-sampling points on the bi-cubic Bezier spline surface, we can use triangle meshes to repair vacant areas. The advantage of this method is that the repaired area can smoothly be patched with other parts of archeological relics and it can keep the real shape of vacant areas.", "paper_title": "Digital repair research on archeological relics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300162"}
