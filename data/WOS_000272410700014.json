The purpose of this paper is to extend prior cross-country research to the interfirm IT capabilities and relationship-level. Design/methodology/approach - A two-country comparative study is conducted: the USA, a developed country; and Thailand, a developing country. The measurement constructs for the interfirm IT capabilities and performance are derived from the existing literature. Data are collected from IT managers who oversee interfirm relationships as follows: 68 from the US firms; 107 from Thai firms. Several statistical tools are used to test the developed hypotheses, including correlation, regression, and t-test analysis. Findings - The important results of the paper indicate the following: IT technical capabilities are positively associated with interfirm performance across two countries. However, IT personnel IT capabilities had a positive relationship with interfirm performance only in Thai firms. Also, Thai firms realize higher innovation performance as a result of IT adoption than the US firms. Research limitations/implications - This is an exploratory study as it is based on data from only two countries. Thus, a new causal theory about interfirm relationship-level performance is not sought. The future research needs include data collection from more countries and longitudinal analyses of trends based on advances in IT capabilities in different countries. Originality/value - In today's networked global economy, many organizations have value chains that involve interfirm relationships. This paper is the first attempt to explore productivity gains associated with IT adoption, measured at interfirm relationship-level, based on cross-country comparative analysis.", "paper_title": "IT capabilities, interfirm performance, and the state of economic development", "paper_id": "WOS:000272410700014"}
