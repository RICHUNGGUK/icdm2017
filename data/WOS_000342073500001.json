The main idea centers on recasting the preconditioning problem so that existing AMG solvers for nodal lower order finite elements can be leveraged. This is accomplished by a transformation operator which maps the solution from a Lagrange basis representation to a Legendre basis representation. While this mapping function must be user supplied, we demonstrate how easily it can be constructed for somepopular finite element representations includingquadrilateral/hexahedral and triangular/tetrahedral DG formulations. Furthermore, we show that the mapping does not depend on the Jacobian transformation between reference and physical space and so it can be constructed with very limited mesh information. Parallel performance studies demonstrate the versatility of this approach.", "paper_title": "Algebraic multigrid techniques for discontinuous Galerkin methods with varying polynomial order", "paper_id": "WOS:000342073500001"}
