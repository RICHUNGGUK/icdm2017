This paper proposes using second order snapshot-log relations as a mechanism for extending the use of single-directional asynchronous replication to multi-directional. The proposed mechanism is fully based on DBMS core tools and existing DBMS snapshot replication support, thus allowing a natural extension for systems that already support asynchronous snapshot replication. We have implemented and tested the proposed mechanism, showing results and terms of correctness.", "paper_title": "Second order snapshot-log relations: Supporting multi-directional database replication using asynchronous snapshot replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400020"}
