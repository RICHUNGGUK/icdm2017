The proposed approach includes two latent Markov chains and one observable process. One of the latent Markov chains is called macro-state process which is used to describe the large-scale trends of Web workload. The remaining latent Markov chain is called sub-state process which is used to describe the small-scale fluctuations that are happening within the duration of a given macro-state. An efficient parameter re-estimation algorithm and a workload simulation algorithm are derived for the proposed discrete model. Experiments based on a real workload of a large-scale campus network are implemented to validate the proposed model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
