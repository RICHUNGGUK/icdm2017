Determining the location of a black hole in a ring network has been studied when each node is equipped with a white board. Recently,the Black Hole Search problem was solved in a less demanding and less expensive token model with co-located agents. Whether the problem can be solved with scattered agents in a token model remains an open problem. In this paper,we show not only that a black hole can be located in a ring using tokens with scattered agents, but also that the problem is solvable even if the ring is un-oriented. More precisely, first we prove that the black hole search problem can be solved using only three scattered agents. We then show that, with k (k >= 4) scattered agents,the black hole can be located in O (kn + n log n) moves. Moreover, when k (k >= 4) is a constant number,the move cost can be reduced to O(n log n), which is optimal. These results hold even if both agents and nodes are anonymous.", "paper_title": "USING SCATTERED MOBILE AGENTS TO LOCATE A BLACK HOLE IN AN UN-ORIENTED RING WITH TOKENS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262289900006"}
