This model extends and augments existing finite-state techniques, which are presently not optimized for describing this kind of phenomena. We first define the model and discuss its mathematical and computational properties. Then, we provide an extended regular language whose expressions denote FSRAs. Finally, we exemplify the utility of the model by providing several examples of complex morphological and phonological phenomena, which are elegantly implemented with FSRAs.", "paper_title": "Finite-state registered automata for non-concatenative morphology", "paper_id": "WOS:000237977900004"}
