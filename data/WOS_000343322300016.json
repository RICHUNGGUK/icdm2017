Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of the previous studies, this research focusses on four promising methods: transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC), slice sampling, slice-Metropolis-Hasting (M-H), and TMCMC-slice algorithm. The slice-M-H is the improved slice sampling algorithm, and the TMCMC-slice is the improved TMCMC algorithm. The performances of the parameters samples generated by these four algorithms are evaluated using two examples: one is the numerical example of a cantilever plate; another is the plate experiment simulating one part of the mechanical structure. Findings - Both the numerical example and experiment show that, identification accuracy of slice-M-H is higher than that of slice sampling; and the identification accuracy of TMCMC-slice is higher than that of TMCMC. In general, the identification accuracy of the methods based on slice (slice sampling and slice-M-H) is higher than that of the methods based on TMCMC (TMCMC and TMCMC-slice). Originality/value - The stochastic simulation methods evaluated in this paper are mainly two categories of representative methods: one introduces the intermediate probability density functions, and another one is the auxiliary variable approach. This paper provides important references about the stochastic simulation methods to solve the ill-conditioned computation issue, which is commonly encountered in SHM.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of the stochastic simulation methods applied in structural health monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000343322300016"}
