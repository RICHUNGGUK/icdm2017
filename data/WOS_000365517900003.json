Previous studies using invasive recording electrodes showed that VNS induces laryngeal motor-evoked potentials (LMEPs) through the co-activation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and subsequent contractions of the laryngeal muscles. The present study investigates the feasibility of recording LMEPs in chronically VNS-implanted rats, using a minimally-invasive technique, to assess effective current delivery to the nerve and to determine optimal VNS output currents for vagal fiber activation. Three weeks after VNS electrode implantation, signals were recorded using an electromyography (EMG) electrode in the proximity of the laryngeal muscles and a reference electrode on the skull. The VNS output current was gradually ramped up from 0.1 to 1.0mA in 0.1mA steps. In 13/27 rats, typical LMEPs were recorded at low VNS output currents (median 0.3mA, IQR 0.2-0.3mA). In 11/27 rats, significantly higher output currents were required to evoke electrophysiological responses (median 0.7mA, IQR 0.5-0.7mA, p < 0.001). The latencies of these responses deviated significantly from LMEPs (p < 0.05). In 3/27 rats, no electrophysiological responses to simulation were recorded. Minimally invasive LMEP recordings are feasible to assess effective current delivery to the vagus nerve. Furthermore, our results suggest that low output currents are sufficient to activate vagal fibers.", "paper_title": "A Preclinical Study of Laryngeal Motor-Evoked Potentials as a Marker Vagus Nerve Activation", "paper_id": "WOS:000365517900003"}
