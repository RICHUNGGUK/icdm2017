A novel concept that can make use of more relaxed variables by employing the new type of augmented matrices with Kronecker product operation is proposed. The proposed method can handle multitude of Kronecker product operation in Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and introduce more arbitrary matrices to reduce the conservatism. Since the expression based on linear matrix inequality is used, the synchronisation criteria can be easily checked in practice. Numerical simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Chaotic synchronisation for coupled neural networks based on T-S fuzzy theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200010"}
