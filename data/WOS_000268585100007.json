The aim of the present work is to analyze the consequences of repetitive extreme hip motion on the labrum cartilage. Our hypothesis is that extreme movements can induce excessive labral deformations and lead to early arthritis. To verify this hypothesis, an optical motion capture system is used to estimate the kinematics of patient-specific hip joint, while soft tissue artifacts are reduced with an effective correction method. Subsequently, a physical simulation system is used during motion to compute accurate labral deformations and to assess the global pressure of the labrum, as well as any local pressure excess that may be physiologically damageable. Results show that peak contact pressures occur at extreme hip flexion/abduction and that the pressure distribution corresponds with radiologically observed damage zones in the labrum.", "paper_title": "Motion study of the hip joint in extreme postures", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585100007"}
