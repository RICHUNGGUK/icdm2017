Employing multiple channels is shown to be an effective approach to overcoming the problem of capacity degradation in multihop wireless networks. However, existing routing schemes that are designed for singlechannel multihop wireless networks may lead to inefficient routing paths in multichannel WMNs. To full exploit the capacity gain due to multiple channels, one must consider the availability of multiple channels and distribute traffic load among channels as well as among nodes in routing algorithms. In this article we focus on the routing problem in multichannel WMNs. We highlight the challenges in designing routing algorithms for multichannel WMNs and examine existing routing metries that are designed for multichannel WMNs, along with a simulation-based performance study. We also address some open research issues related to routing in multichannel WMNs.", "paper_title": "On routing in multichannel wireless mesh networks: Chollenges and solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252577200004"}
