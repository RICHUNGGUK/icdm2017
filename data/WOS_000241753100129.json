The properties of discriminate analysis in Otsu's method are to analyze the separability among the gray levels in the image. The ACO-Otsu algorithm, a non-parametric and unsupervised method, is the first-known application of ACO to automatic threshold selection for image segmentation. The experimental results show that the ACO-Otsu efficiently speed up the Otsu's method to a great extent at multi-level thresholding, and that such method can provide better effectiveness at population size of 20 for all given image types at multi-level thresholding in this study.", "paper_title": "Application of a hybrid ant colony optimization for the multilevel thresholding in image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100129"}
