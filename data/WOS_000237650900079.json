The combined diversity effect between path diversity of the distributed antennas and frequency diversity of the multi-carrier can be achieved with the proposed system. The proposed system transmits different data using several sub-carriers which are correlated, while, transmitting the same data using several sub-carriers which are de-correlated. It can achieve combined path and frequency diversity gain in a frequency selective fading channel. It provides high data rate services by transmitting the different data using each correlated carrier, and supports good quality by transmitting the same date system with frequency diversity gain is applicable to multimedia service. Thus, the proposed system is sufficiently flexible enough to very support a variety of video, image, voice and data services at a high level of quality.", "paper_title": "Distribution antenna diversity system according to adaptive correlation method for OFDM-DS/CDMA in a frequency selective fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900079"}
