A video is encoded into multiple independent substreams to avoid error propagation and is assigned forward error correction (FEC) codes and source bits using Lagrange optimization. Our method separates video coding and packetization into different tiers which can be easily incorporated into any coding structure that generates a set of independent compressed bit-streams. To demonstrate the performance, we use the 2-state Markov model to describe the burst loss channel and Reed-Solomon codes as forward error correction codes. Simulation results show that the proposed channel incorporated rate-distortion optimization approach have better performance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
