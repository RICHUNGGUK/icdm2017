The explanation is that MI registration works because it aligns certain image partitions. This notion of aligning partitions is new, and is shown to be related to Schur- and quasi-convexity. The partition-alignment theory of this paper goes beyond explaining mutual-information. It suggests other objective functions for registering images. Some of these newer objective functions are not entropy-based. Simulations with noisy images show that the newer objective functions work well for registration, lending support to the theory. The theory proposed in this paper opens a number of directions for further research in image registration. These directions are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Why Does Mutual-Information Work for Image Registration? A Deterministic Explanation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354377100013"}
