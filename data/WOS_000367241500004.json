This makes designers use systems such as knowledge management systems to reach their goal. In this article, our aim is to investigate on improving the use of knowledge management systems by defining a framework for modelling knowledge transfer in such context. The proposed framework is partly based on reuse of existing models found in the literature and on a participant observation methodology. Then, we tested this framework through several case studies presented in this article. These investigations enable us to observe, define and model more finely the knowledge dynamics that occur between knowledge workers and knowledge management systems.", "paper_title": "Modelling knowledge transfer: A knowledge dynamics perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000367241500004"}
