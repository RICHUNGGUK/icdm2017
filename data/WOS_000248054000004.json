This algorithm is based on the novel notion of leader trees. A second algorithm proposed in this paper as an enhancement to our first algorithm and uses an arbitrary spanning tree as the leader tree and has a worst time complexity of 2.25n(2)-3n + 0.75. We also discuss the issue of dynamically selecting the leader tree and hybrid load balancing algorithms in general. Furthermore, we present a hybrid algorithm for load balancing on the star interconnection network which benefits from a diffusion load balancing preprocessing phase and shows a smaller mean time complexity than our two first algorithms.", "paper_title": "Perfect load balancing on the star interconnection network", "paper_id": "WOS:000248054000004"}
