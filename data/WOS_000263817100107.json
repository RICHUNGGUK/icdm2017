Most research discusses system models and modules in a computer integrated manufacture system (CIMS), but less likely to discuss the problem and settlement method to actually implement. This research focuses on the shop-floor integration system (SFIS) as a real time management system using neural network technology to do the system diagnosis against system operational errors. Furthermore, the approach will discuss and improve the system efficiency by analyzing the questionable information detected. A real case is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
