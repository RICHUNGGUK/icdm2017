This integration permits the creation of new kinds of support for collaborative learning processes. In this paper, we explore the potential of this synergy with DomoSim-TPC, a synchronous distributed collaborative environment for the teaching and learning of Domotics. The system supports an active, simulation-based and problem-based approach for learning house automation design. Using this learning environment, teachers propose and organize problem solving activities and the students carry out, in a collaborative way, the construction of artefacts (designs) using modelling and simulation tools.
