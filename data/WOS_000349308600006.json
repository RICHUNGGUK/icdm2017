To characterise local image structure information, the dense scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor is extracted for each pixel in the image. The proposed tracking method uses SCC model which adopts a new constrained strategy - weighted code, which is achieved by considering the sum of the weighted codes based on grey values of neighbouring pixels and distances between them. The proposed model is able to obtain robust code of corresponding pixels in the frames of complex scenes by taking spatial information into account, which enhances the stability of coding and makes the tracker more robust for object tracking. Twelve challenging sequences involving partial or full occlusion, large pose variation and drastic illumination change are chosen to test the proposed method. The experimental results show the proposed method performs excellent in comparison with other previously proposed trackers.", "paper_title": "Tracking with spatial constrained coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000349308600006"}
