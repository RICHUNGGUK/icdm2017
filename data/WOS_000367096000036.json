The reconfigurability of recent FPGAs with hard CPU cores allows us to realize a single-chip heterogeneous processor optimized for a given application. The major problem in designing such heterogeneous processors is data-transfer between CPU cores and accelerator cores. The total processing time with data-transfers is modeled considering the overlap of computation time and data-transfer time, and optimal design parameters are searched for.", "paper_title": "Data-Transfer-Aware Design of an FPGA-Based Heterogeneous Multicore Platform with Custom Accelerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000036"}
