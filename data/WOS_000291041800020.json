Sum of occupations of p (z) orbitals at atoms in the ring correlates well with the magnetism based aromaticity index NICS as well as with the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring. Changes of NICS depend strongly in a linear way on the number of NN bonds. Classification of azoles based on the number of pyridine-type nitrogen atoms vicinal to NH is supported by plotting the relative occupation of pi orbitals (pi(occ)) against the relative occupation of sigma orbitals (sigma(occ)) for all individual atoms in rings.", "paper_title": "Sigma- and pi- electron structure of aza-azoles", "paper_id": "WOS:000291041800020"}
