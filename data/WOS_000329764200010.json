The main innovation of this approach is that each instantiated event pattern is handled by a dedicated Erlang process, instead of a single or shared operating system thread. This in turn, reduces the latency in processing the event processing as it avoids the overheads associated with resource contention. We demonstrate how this approach can achieve linear event processing times under high event loads, using modest computing resources.
