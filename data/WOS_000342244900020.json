The model equation that GPELab solves is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The aim of this first part is to present the physical problems and the robust and accurate numerical schemes that are implemented for computing stationary solutions, to show a few computational examples and to explain how the basic GPELab functions work. Problems that can be solved include: Id, 2d and 3d situations, general potentials, large classes of local and nonlocal nonlinearities, multi-components problems, and fast rotating gases. The toolbox is developed in such a way that other physics applications that require the numerical solution of general Schrodinger-type equations can be considered.

Computer: PC, Mac. Operating system: Windows, Mac OS, Linux. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes RAM: 4000 Megabytes Classification: 2.7, 4.6, 7.7. Nature of problem: Computing stationary solutions for a class of systems (multi-components) of Gross-Pitaevskii equations in Id, 2d and 3d. This program is particularly well designed for the computation of ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates as well as dynamics. Solution method: We use the imaginary-time method with a Semi-Implicit Backward Euler scheme, a pseudo-spectral approximation and a Krylov subspace method. Running time: From a few minutes for simple problems to a week for more complex situations on a medium computer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
