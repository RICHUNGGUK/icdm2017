Its main application areas, like Video Surveillance and Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL), have been in great demand in recent years. This paper provides a review on HBA for AAL and ageing in place purposes focusing specially on vision techniques. First, a clearly defined taxonomy is presented in order to classify the reviewed works, which are consequently presented following a bottom-up abstraction and complexity order. At the motion level, pose and gaze estimation as well as basic human movement recognition are covered. Next, the mainly used action and activity recognition approaches are presented with examples of recent research works. Increasing the degree of semantics and the time interval involved in the HBA, finally the behaviour level is reached. Furthermore, useful tools and datasets are analysed in order to provide help for initiating projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
