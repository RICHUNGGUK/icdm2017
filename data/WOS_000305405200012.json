This method produces convergence curves which are very close to those of GMRES, but using fewer operations and storage. In this paper we present new analysis which explains why CMRH has this good convergence behavior. Numerical examples illustrate the new bounds.", "paper_title": "A new look at CMRH and its relation to GMRES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305405200012"}
