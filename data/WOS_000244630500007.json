However, the percentile method cannot be implemented in an automatic fashion, and automatic methods, like the starship method, can lead to prohibitive execution time with large sample sizes. A new estimation method is proposed that is automatic (it does not require the use of special tables or graphs), and it reduces the computational time. Based partly on the usual percentile method, this new method also requires choosing which quantile u to use when fitting a GLD to data. The choice for u is studied and it is found that the best choice depends on the final goal of the modeling process. The sampling distribution of the new estimator is studied and compared to the sampling distribution of estimators that have been proposed. Naturally, all estimators are biased and here it is found that the bias becomes negligible with sample sizes n >= 2 x 10(3). The .025 and .975 quantiles of the sampling distribution are investigated, and the difference between these quantiles is found to decrease proportionally to 1/root n.. The same results hold for the moment and percentile estimates. Finally, the influence of the sample size is studied when a normal distribution is modeled by a GLD. Both bounded and unbounded GLDs are used and the bounded GLD turns out to be the most accurate. Indeed it is shown that, up to n = 10(6), bounded GLD modeling cannot be rejected by usual goodness-of-fit tests. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
