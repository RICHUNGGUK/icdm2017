Unsteady flows with moving boundaries are considered using arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach. The scheme is unconditionally stable and does not require solution of large systems of linear equations. Moreover, the upgrade from explicit MacCormack scheme to implicit one is very simple and straightforward. Several computational results for 2D and 3D flows over profiles and wings are presented for the case of inviscid and viscous flows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
