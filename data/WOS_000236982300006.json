The literature reports on models representing interactive-TV (I-TV) programs - one of the main applications of the interactive video technology; the limitation of such models include: strict hierarchical relationships among media objects, low levels of granularity for metadata, programs and media objects descriptions cannot be separated, objects are not described beyond the frame level, lack of integration with context-aware computing. In this paper, we detail features of our MediaObject model for documents describing I-TV programs that aim to minimize those limitations. We discuss the model by means of an application that is part of our I-TV prototype and by an annotation tool that shows that the model can be applied to other domains.", "paper_title": "Context-aware support in structured documents for interactive-TV", "paper_id": "WOS:000236982300006"}
