We analyze the proposed design both analytically and experimentally, and we also evaluate its performance in the application of an attractor neural network. The EWMA in the proposed design has a constant relative truncation error, which is important for avoiding round-off errors in applications with slowly decaying processes, e.g. connectionist networks. We conclude that the proposed design offers greatly improved memory and computational efficiency compared to a naive implementation of the EWMA's difference equation, and that it is well suited for implementation in digital hardware.
