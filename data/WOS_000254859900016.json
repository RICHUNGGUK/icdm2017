However, such retrieval is data-intensive. High-resolution, wide-range, and long-duration observations produce several terabytes of data each day. Processing such massive volumes of data into scientific aerosol products involves addressing several computational problems. Processing Level 1B data for Level 2 aerosol products for a single day requires 13 Gbytes total to achieve full coverage of China's main land surface.", "paper_title": "Quantitative retrieval of geophysical parameters using satellite data", "paper_id": "WOS:000254859900016"}
