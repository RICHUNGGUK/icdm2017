However, ethical sales practices in electronic commerce (EC) have seldom been addressed. This study analyzes the role of consumer perceptions of ethical sales behavior in developing better relationships between EC websites and consumers. This study creates an analytical model, in which the outcomes of perceived ethical sales behavior include trust, satisfaction, and word-of-mouth (WOM). Research hypotheses derived from the model are tested using structural equation modeling on responses from 548 online shoppers. Analytical results indicate that perceived ethical sales behavior not only directly impacts trust, satisfaction, and WOM, respectively, but also indirectly influences satisfaction via trust, and WOM via both trust and satisfaction. Based on the findings, managerial implications are proposed for EC websites and future research directions suggested.", "paper_title": "ELUCIDATING THE ETHICAL SALES BEHAVIOR IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000296942800009"}
