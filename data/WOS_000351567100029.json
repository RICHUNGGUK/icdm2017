Recently, programmable accelerators have attracted more attention as an enabling solution for post-silicon engineering change. However, programmable accelerators suffers from 5 similar to 10X less energy efficiency than fixed-function accelerators mainly due to their extensive use of memories. This paper proposes a highly energy-efficient accelerator which enables post-silicon engineering change by a control patching mechanism. Then, we propose a patch compilation method from a given pair of an original design and a modified design. We also propose a design method to add redundant wires in advance to decrease the necessary amount of patch memory for post-silicon engineering change. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed accelerators offer high energy efficiency competitive to fixed-function accelerators and can achieve about 5X higher efficiency than the existing programmable accelerators. We also show the trade-off between redundant wires and the necessary amount of patch memory.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Patchable Accelerator and Its Design Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100029"}
