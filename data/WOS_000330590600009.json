The paper starts by highlighting the needs for the vehicular structure forming process with respect to the main production line requirements through using Quality Function Deployment QFD matrix. Additionally, the potentials of fold forming for sheet metal parts in achieving the major production needs will then be benchmarked against other forming techniques through a decision making tool namely; the Analytical Hierarchy Process AHP. The study investigates the application of flat pattern tools for sheet metal products derived from analysis for thin or zero thickness sheets (i.e. paper origami). The analysis sets an approach to generate all possible configurations of flat patterns that result in a specific 3-D structure profile. Secondly, a set of optimality selection metrics are developed and applied to these configurations to help determine the most optimized flat pattern. These optimality measures are a metric based on compactness, a metric for nesting efficiency to describe the strip layout planning, and two measures to assess the manufacturing aspect i.e. bending operation in terms of number and orientation of bend lines.", "paper_title": "Design considerations of flat patterns analysis techniques when applied for folding 3-D sheet metal geometries", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590600009"}
