In this paper, a density modification framework that enhances density map based discriminability of feature values in a feature space is proposed in order to aid feature space based segmentation in images. The framework embeds a position-dependent property associated with each sample in the feature space of an image into the corresponding density map and hence modifies it. The property association and embedding operations in the framework is implemented using a fuzzy set theory based system devised with cues from beam theory of solid mechanics and the appropriateness of this approach is established. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results of segmentation in images are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed density modification framework and the usefulness of feature space based segmentation via density modification.
