It is demonstrated that the first scheme, which is widely used, may lead to spurious oscillations arising from computational modes. In fact, the shortest resolvable waves of wave length 2 Delta x are invisible to this method. The second method, although more expensive, is free of computational modes and it presents a more accurate approximation of viscous terms. The dispersion relation of the second method is closer to the analytical case and it has a smaller truncation error, which is due to the fact that it uses a more localized control volume. Numerical experiments are also presented that support the study.
