In autonomic and dynamic fashions, it formulates, composes, monitors and manages the services' components. To publish the existence and functionalities of these services, a Peer-to-Peer Overlay Network is constructed and denoted by Rendezvous Overlay Network (RvON). In addition, RvON allows end-users to discover the service's advertisement efficiently. Thus, this paper proposes an autonomic K-interleaving scheme that organizes RvON into RvON-Clusters. Each RvOn-Cluster is constructed over K physical hops and there is no two rendezvous nodes stored the same advertisement. As results, users accessing from different areas are able to efficiently discover service's advertisement within a constant K physical hops.", "paper_title": "Autonomic K-interleaving construction scheme for P2P overlay networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800015"}
