The approach has low computational complexity, is primarily designed for hit expansion from biological screening data, and accurately predicts both active and inactive compounds. Its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as support vector machines or Bayesian classification. Matrix-based activity prediction of virtual compounds further extends the spectrum of computational methods for compound design.", "paper_title": "Hit Expansion from Screening Data Based upon Conditional Probabilities of Activity Derived from SAR Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000350475300007"}
