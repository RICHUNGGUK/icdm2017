Although application specific tracers have been forthcoming, techniques that automatically adapt across applications have been less explored. We approach this problem by learning a prior model on topological dynamics that encourages segmentation transitions across frames that are most likely for a given application. Further, we augment a generic tracing technique with a locality sensitive prior derived from dense optic flow fields for deformation guidance. The proposed approach comprises two stages where the generic tracer initially yields multiple segmentation transitions when its parameters are perturbed, and the learnt topology prior subsequently propagates high scoring segmentations. Because the learnt topology model wraps around a generic tracer and adapts it by setting its free parameters, the need for careful parameter tuning is completely obviated. Through extensive experimental validation in surveillance, biological and medical image datasets, we verify the applicability of the proposed model while demonstrating good tracing performance under severe clutter.", "paper_title": "Robust Segmentation Based Tracing Using an Adaptive Wrapper for Inducing Priors", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300031"}
