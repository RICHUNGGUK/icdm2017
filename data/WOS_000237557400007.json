To some extent, a few approaches answer these issues by computing an affine photometric model or by achieving a photometric normalization. Through a study based on specular reflection models, we explain explicitly the assumptions on which these techniques are based. Then we propose a tracker that compensates for specular highlights and lighting variations more efficiently when small windows of interest are considered. Experimental results on image sequences prove the robustness and the accuracy of this technique in comparison with the existing trackers. Moreover, the computation time of the tracking is not significantly increased.", "paper_title": "Feature points tracking: Robustness to specular highlights and lighting changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400007"}
