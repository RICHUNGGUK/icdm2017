To understand how the product rule delays the phase transition, in this paper, we will concentrate our efforts on the influence of product rule in the transition from Erdos-Renyi (ER) percolation to Achlioptas explosive percolation. In our model, only a fraction of the adding edges will obey the product rule. With the probability p, the edge is selected under the Achlioptas's product rule; with 1 - p the edge is added between two randomly chosen nodes, that is, the ER rule. When the product rule plays a dominant role in the evolution, p > 0: 5, the percolation transition delays more abruptly and instantaneously. The location of the critical points is independent of the network size and satisfies t(c) = (t(c)(AP) - t(c)(ER))p + t(c)(ER), where t(c)(ER) and t(c)(AP) are the critical points of ER percolation and Achlioptas one. We present the largest gap Delta s(max) and the critical region Delta as a function of p and N. The giant component s in terms of the edge density t above t(c) is also analyzed. We find that all the critical values have a linear relationship against p.", "paper_title": "THE TRANSITION FROM ERDOS-RENYI PERCOLATION TO EXPLOSIVE PERCOLATION UNDER THE PARTIAL PRODUCT RULE", "paper_id": "WOS:000312457100004"}
