The fibrous medium was modeled as a periodic array of circular cylinders, in a hexagonal arrangement, using the boundary element method. The area and volume average methods were applied to relate the pore scale to the representative elementary Volume scale. The permeability of the modeled fibrous medium was calculated from the Darcy's law with the volume-averaged Darcy velocity. The slip coefficient, interfacial velocity, effective viscosity and shear jump coefficients at the interface were obtained with the averaged velocities at various permeabilities or Darcy numbers.
