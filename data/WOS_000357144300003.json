An innovative vehicle-bridge interaction model is proposed, in which the vehicles modeled as a multibody system interact with the updated bridge model by means of a contact, considering road surface roughness. An extensive study is performed to explore the influence of different factors on the dynamic vibrations of Wild bridge. The bridge vibrations are not only governed by the fundamental mode, but also are dominated by other torsional modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
