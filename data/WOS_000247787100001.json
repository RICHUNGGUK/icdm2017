The amplitude-dependent damping ratios of the super tall building were obtained from the measurements. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure was developed in this study to generate fluctuating along-wind and across-wind forces acting on this building. The wind-induced responses of Di Wang Tower were numerically evaluated in time domain on the basis of the generated fluctuating wind forces and the established finite element model of the building. The predicted dynamic responses of the building using the actual amplitude-dependent damping characteristics were compared to those computed with constant damping parameters assumed by the structural designers to evaluate the adequacy of current design practices and to investigate the effect of amplitude-dependent damping on the wind-induced responses. Finally, the effect of time constant on the wind-induced responses of Di Wang Tower was studied by comparing the time domain computational results with those from conventional spectral analysis method. Some of the research findings resulted from this combined experimental and numerical study are expected to be of interest and practical use to professionals and researchers involved in the design and analysis of super tall buildings.
