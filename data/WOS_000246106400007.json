Different from conventional \"hard\" message authentications that are designed to detect even the slightest changes in messages, AMACs are designed to tolerate a small amount of noise in messages for applications where slight noise is acceptable, such as in multimedia communications. Binary AMACs, I however, have several limitations. First, they do not naturally deal with messages having N-ary alphabets (N > 2). AMACs are distance-preserving codes; i.e., the distance between two authentication tags reflects the distance between two messages. Binary representation of N-ary alphabets, however, may destroy the original distance information between N-ary messages. Second, binary AMACs lack a means to adjust authentication sensitivity. Different applications may require different sensitivities against noise. AMACs for N-ary alphabets are designed as a cryptographic primitive to overcome the limitations of binary AMACs. N-ary AMACs not only directly process messages-having N-ary alphabets but also provide sensitivity control on the authentication of binary and of N-ary messages. The generalized N-ary AMAC algorithm and its probabilistic model are developed. A statistical analysis characterizing the behavior of N-ary AMACs is provided along with the simulations illustrating their properties. Security analysis under chosen message attack is also developed.", "paper_title": "Approximate message authentication codes for N-ary alphabets", "paper_id": "WOS:000246106400007"}
