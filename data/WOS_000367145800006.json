The real-time distribution of input delays is modeled as a continuous-dependent and nonidentically distributed (d.n.d.) process. By introducing multiple indicator functions, the NCS is represented as a hybrid system with multiple input delay subsystems. An improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii method is proposed and it additionally exploits the real-time distribution of input delays by means of estimating the cross-product integral terms of the infinitesimal of the Lyapunov functional using a new bounding technique. Delay-distribution-dependent sufficient conditions are derived for the deterministic exponential stability and stabilizability of the NCS, which leads to tighter bounds of input delays than existing results. The resulting controller design method is formulated as an iterative linear optimization algorithm subject to linear matrix inequality constraints. Finally, numerical examples are presented to substantiate the effectiveness and advantage of the results.", "paper_title": "A Delay-Distribution Approach to Stabilization of Networked Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367145800006"}
