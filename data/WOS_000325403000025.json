Furthermore, to ensure secure real-time power system operations, the system operator must schedule sufficient resources to meet energy demand and operating reserve requirements simultaneously. The proposed problem is a complex nonlinear nonsmooth and nonconvex multiobjective optimization problem whose complexity is increased when considering the above constraints. To this end, this paper utilizes a newly developed meta-heuristic bat inspired algorithm to achieve the set of nondominated (Pareto-optimal) solutions. This algorithm is equipped with a novel self-adaptive learning to increase the population diversity and amend the convergence criteria. The initial population of the proposed framework is generated by a chaos-based strategy. In addition, a tournament crowded selection approach is implemented to choose the population such that the Pareto-optimal front is distributed uniformly, while the extreme points of the tradeoff surface are achieved simultaneously. Numerical results evaluate the performances of the framework for real-size test systems.", "paper_title": "Reserve Constrained Dynamic Environmental/Economic Dispatch: A New Multiobjective Self-Adaptive Learning Bat Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000025"}
