Barcelo et al. identified a class of shallow queries for which the problem is efficiently solvable with node ids on trees while it is coNP-complete without them. We show that their result is essentially tight. In other words, we provide a slightly extended class of queries where node ids help no more. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
