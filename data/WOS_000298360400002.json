The Erlang phase method and recurrent recalculation for conditional Markov processes are used. Formulas for the a posteriori distribution of the transition time are obtained for the respective first moments and sampling interval. The procedures are easy-to-implement computationally. The influence of process parameters on the procedure parameters is analyzed. An illustrative example is given.", "paper_title": "Sampling and reconstruction of piecewise constant stochastic processes with Erlang stay time in states", "paper_id": "WOS:000298360400002"}
