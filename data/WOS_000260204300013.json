Previous studies avoid the difficulty by restricting the replenishment policy to the cases where the order cycle of each item is a multiple of the cycle of the most frequently ordered item. This simplifies the computation but may entail sub-optimality of a solution. To cope with this, we devise an unbiased estimator of the exact cost which is computable in time polynomial of the problem input size and l/epsilon, where F is a pre-specified relative error of estimation. We then develop a genetic algorithm based on this new cost evaluation, report the experimental results in comparison to the \"RAND\" [Kaspi M, Rosenblatt MJ.
