One example is a CAPTCHA challenge, where a human should have a significantly higher chance of answering a single challenge (e.g., uncovering a distorted letter) than an attacker; another example is an argument system without perfect completeness. A natural approach to boost the gap between legitimate users and attackers is to issue many challenges and accept if the response is correct for more than a threshold fraction, for the threshold chosen between alpha and beta. We give the first proof that parallel repetition with thresholds improves the security of such protocols. We do this with a very general result about an attacker's ability to solve a large fraction of many independent instances of a hard problem, showing a Chernoff-like convergence of the fraction solved incorrectly to the probability of failure for a single instance.", "paper_title": "Chernoff-Type Direct Product Theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264962600003"}
