Sequential indicator simulation (SIS) remains a reasonable approach when there are no clear genetic shapes that could be put into object-based modeling. Constraining SIS to soft secondary data coming from geological interpretation or geophysical measurements is important. There are a number of techniques including indicator kriging (IK) with a local mean, collocated cokriging, Bayesian updating, permanence of ratios, block kriging and block cokriging. BlockSIS implements all of these and more (nine all together). The images may also be cleaned using maximum a -posteriori selection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
