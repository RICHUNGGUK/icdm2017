The 0, 1 sequence is mapped into two different random sequences to realize the robust watermarking process. The gray relational analysis method, the easy blocking method and the hierarchical embedding method are used here. Good performance both in robustness and in fragile in the experiments shows the efficiency of our proposed method. Future research orientations are mentioned in the conclusion.", "paper_title": "Dual watermarking algorithm based on the Fractional Fourier Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000356168600013"}
