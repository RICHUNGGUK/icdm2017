Compared with the well-understood least square regression, the study of SVMR is not satisfactory, especially the quantitative estimates of the convergence of this algorithm. This paper provides an error analysis for SVMR, and introduces some recently developed methods for analysis of classification algorithms such as the projection operator and the iteration technique. The main result is an explicit learning rate for the SVMR algorithm under some assumptions.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Support Vector Machines Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000264479700006"}
