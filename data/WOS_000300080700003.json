A discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain is used to represent the stochastic behavior of actuator faults. In terms of a stochastic fuzzy Lyapunov functional, a sufficient condition is proposed to ensure that the resultant closed-loop system is exponentially stable in the meansquare sense with an H infinity performance index. Based on the derived condition, the reliable H infinity control problem is solved, and an explicit expression of the desired controller is also given. The case of no failure in the actuator is also considered. A numerical example is given to demonstrate that our results are effective and less conservative.", "paper_title": "Reliable H-infinity Control for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Infinite-Distributed Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000300080700003"}
