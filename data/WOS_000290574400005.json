The TS-based representation procedure used in the proposed GA approach can generate feasible sequences in PCSPs. By applying the proposed GA approach, the sequence determination problems with precedence constraints can be easily solved. Experimental results show that the proposed GA approach is a good alternative in locating optimal sequence for various types of PCSPs.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm approach for precedence-constrained sequencing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290574400005"}
