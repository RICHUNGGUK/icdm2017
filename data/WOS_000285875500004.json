Due to heterogeneous complexity requirements, these graphs contain both dynamic and static dataflow actors. In previous work, we presented a generalized clustering approach for these heterogeneous dataflow graphs in the presence of unbounded buffers. This clustering approach allows the application of static scheduling methodologies for static parts of an application during embedded software generation for multiprocessor systems. It systematically exploits the predictability and efficiency of the static dataflow model to obtain latency and throughput improvements. In this article, we present a generalization of this clustering technique to dataflow graphs with bounded buffers, therefore enabling synthesis for embedded systems without dynamic memory allocation. Furthermore, a case study is given to demonstrate the performance benefits of the approach.", "paper_title": "Analysis of SystemC Actor Networks for Efficient Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875500004"}
