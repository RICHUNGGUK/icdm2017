A detailed theoretical background on the Inclusion Principle and the design of overlapping controllers is provided. Overlapping and multi-overlapping LQR controllers are designed for a simplified five-story building model. Numerical simulations are conducted to asses the performance of the proposed semi-decentralized controllers with positive results.", "paper_title": "Semi-decentralized Strategies in Structural Vibration Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000298101500002"}
