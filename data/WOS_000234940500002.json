Performance of the new estimator is measured by comparing MSE with the sample quantile. The new estimator performs better than the sample quantiles in almost every case. However, the gain is only about 5%, in terms of decreased MSE. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "On quantile estimation by bootstrap", "paper_id": "WOS:000234940500002"}
