To above problems, we propose another way to support feature selection procedure, constructing proper FSAs to each given dataset. Here is discussed constructive meta-level feature selection that re-constructs proper FSAs with a method repository every given datasets, de-composing representative FSAs into methods. After implementing the constructive meta-level feature selection system, we show how constructive meta-level feature selection goes well with 32 UCI common data sets, comparing with typical FSAs on their accuracies. As the result, our system shows the highest performance on accuracies and the availability to construct a proper FSA to each given data set automatically.", "paper_title": "Constructive meta-level feature selection method based on method repositories", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600011"}
