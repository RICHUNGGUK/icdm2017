Singular points are first extracted from enhanced fingerprint direction images with a resolution of 2 x 2 pixels by the modified SEA algorithm. Based on the number of singular points, fingerprints are categorized into types of \"arch\", \"whorl\", and \"solitary\". Solitary fingerprints are properly rotated and then further processed to generate direction patterns that lead to establishment of individual direction template. Direction constraints are formed and derived from pattern descriptors by their structural layout. Decision rules are then established and pattern templates are classified into three more types: \"right loop\", \"left loop\", and \"tented arch\". NIST-4 database was used for an experimental test, and our classification accuracy was 91.62% with 1.55% rejection on the five-class system (94.38% on the four-class system), which is the best result on the five-class system to-date. An additional experiment on NIST-14 database reports 89.15% accuracy with 3.07% rejection.", "paper_title": "A directional approach to fingerprint classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000254293000008"}
