Dual V-th assignment, which was an effective method to reduce leakage power in the past, is also effective in today's technologies with certain modi. cations. In this paper, based on our statistical timing analysis (SSTA) framework, we presented a dual V-th assignment method which can effectively reduce the leakage power even in the presence of large V-th variation. Besides, taking the correlation between gates into account, we propose a novel statistical DAG pruning method to speed up the dual V-th assignment algorithm. Experimental results show that statistical dual V-th assignment can reduce on average 95% and 40% more leakage current compared with the conventional static method, without affecting the performance constraints under 180 nm and 90 nm technology nodes. Also our statistical DAG pruning method can reduce 30% gates in the circuit on average and save up to 50% of the total runtime in the 90 nm technology node.", "paper_title": "LEAKAGE POWER REDUCTION THROUGH DUAL V-th ASSIGNMENT CONSIDERING THRESHOLD VOLTAGE VARIATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270957200005"}
