Therefore, a novel visual secret sharing scheme for multiple secret images is proposed in this paper. In the proposed encryption Process, a stacking relationship graph of secret pixels and share blocks is generated to indicate the encryption functions, and a set of visual patterns is defined to produce two share images according to this graph. Based on the stacking properties of these patterns, the secret images can be obtained from the two share images at aliquot stacking angles. The proposed scheme makes the number of secret images not restricted and further extends it to be general. As a result, the proposed scheme enhances visual secret sharing schemes' ability for multiple secrets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
