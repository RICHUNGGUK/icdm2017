On the basis of the byte-oriented model and the differential analysis principle, we propose a differential fault attack on the ARIA algorithm. Mathematical analysis and simulating experiment show that our attack can recover its 128-bit secret key by introducing 45 faulty ciphertexts. Simultaneously, we also present a fault detection technique for protecting ARIA against this proposed analysis. We believe that our results in this study will also be beneficial to the analysis and protection of the same type of other iterated block ciphers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
