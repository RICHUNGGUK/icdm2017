Using this feed line, the effective radiation is improved; the higher order harmonics are completely suppressed, the size of antenna is about 10% reduced and also the front-to-back ratio parameter is greatly improved. In comparison to a conventional microstrip patch antenna without the CDMS, the radiated power of the CDMS patch antenna at harmonic frequencies even up to the 4th harmonic has been drastically decreased.
