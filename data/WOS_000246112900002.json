(Principles of Programming Languages, ACM, New York, pp. 250-259, 1989) at the beginning of the 1990s, its term universe was explained as the metric completion of a metric on finite terms. The motivation for this connection to topology was that it allowed to import other well-studied notions from metric spaces, in particular the notion of convergence as a replacement for normalisation. This paper generalises the approach by parameterising it with a term metric, and applying the process of metric completion not only to terms but also to operations on and relations between terms. The resulting meta-theory is studied, leading to a revised notion of infinitary rewrite system. For these systems a method is devised to prove their convergence.", "paper_title": "Infinitary rewriting: meta-theory and convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000246112900002"}
