We show that stable logic semantics does not satisfy the natural analogue of the compactness theorem. However, we show that there are a variety of conditions which will ensure that a program satisfies the analogue of the compactness theorem.", "paper_title": "Compactness properties for stable semantics of logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000252979700013"}
