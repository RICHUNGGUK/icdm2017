As business processes become increasingly automated through process aware information systems, the quality of process design becomes crucial. Although verification of process models has gained much attention, their validation, relating to the reachability of the process goal, has hardly been addressed. The paper investigates the need for model validation both theoretically and empirically. The authors present a theoretical analysis, showing that process model verification and validation are complementary in nature, and an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of validity criteria in validating a process model. The theoretical analysis, which relates to different aspects of process model quality, shows that process model verification and validation are complementary in nature. The empirical findings corroborate the effectiveness of validity criteria and indicate that a systematic criteria-supported validity analysis improves the identification of validity problems in process models.", "paper_title": "Complementing Business Process Verification by Validity Analysis: A Theoretical and Empirical Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000295799000001"}
