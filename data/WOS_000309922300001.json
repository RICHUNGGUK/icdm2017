To exploit the classifiers' potential as individual ones sufficiently and enable them to work cooperatively for the best classification results, they need to be considered as a whole and be dynamically managed according to the changing recognition occasions. In this paper, we present the conception of distributed Multiple Classifiers Management (MCM) and a self-adaptive recursive MCM model based on Mixture-of-Experts (ME). A control subsystem is consisted in the model, which allows the classification progress to be controlled by the systems' priori information when necessary. The model adjusts its parameters dynamically according to the current recognition state and gives the recognition results by combining the current individual classifiers' results with the previous combination result under priori information's control. An algorithm based on one step error correction is presented to acquire the model's parameters dynamically. It takes the previous times' ensemble classification results as true and corrects the current weights of the classifiers. At last, an experiment on the recognition of space objects is simulated. The experiment results show that the MCM model in this paper is effective for complex recognition system containing heterogeneous classifiers on improving the recognition rate and robustness.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS IN COMPLEX RECOGNITION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300001"}
