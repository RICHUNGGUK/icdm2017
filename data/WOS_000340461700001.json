The cost of an exploration algorit hm is the number of edge traversals by the agent. Nodes of the grid are unlabeled and ports at each node v have distinct numbers in {0, ... d - 1}, where d 2,3,4 is the degree of v. Port numbering is local, i.e., there is no relation between port numbers at different nodes. 1AThen visiting a node the agent sees its degree. It also sees the port number by which it enters a node and can choose the port number by which it leaves a visited node. We are interested in deterministic exploration algorithms working at low cost. We consider the scenario in which the agent is equipped with a stationary token d at its at nodE. The agent sees the token wheneN,er it visits this node. We give an exploration algorithm working at cost 0(k(2)) for 2 x k grids, and at cost m(m(2)k), for m x k grids, when 2 < m <= k.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT GRID EXPLORATION WITH A STATIONARY TOKEN", "paper_id": "WOS:000340461700001"}
