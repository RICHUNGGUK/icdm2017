The idea is to build flexible probability models for the marginal posterior densities of the wavelet coefficients. In this note, we derive exact expressions for two popular models for the marginal posterior density. We also illustrate the superior performance of these models over the standard models for wavelet coefficients.", "paper_title": "Popular wavelet models", "paper_id": "WOS:000251284800008"}
