It provides a very general formulation that includes as special cases a wide range of aggregation operators and aggregates the input arguments taking the form of intervals rather than exact numbers. We further generalize the UGOWA operator to obtain the uncertain generalized hybrid averaging operator, the quasi uncertain ordered weighted averaging operator and the uncertain generalized Choquet integral aggregation operator. In the meanwhile, a new approach to determining the UGOWA weights is proposed based on the relative deviation measure. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach to group decision making with UGOWA operator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
