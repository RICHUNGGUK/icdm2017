Asymptotic stability of RungeKutta and Rosenbrock methods applied to the solution of the resulting index-2 differential algebraic equations system is analyzed. A critical comparison of Rosenbrock, semi-implicit, and fully implicit RungeKutta methods is performed in terms of order of convergence and stability. Numerical examples, considering a discontinuous Galerkin formulation with piecewise solenoidal approximation, demonstrate the applicability of the approaches and compare their performance with classical methods for incompressible flows.
