However, it is very difficult to determine the exact relationship between the parameters of PCNN model. Focusing on the famous difficult problem of PCNN, how to determine the optimum parameters automatically, this paper proposes the definition of water valley area, establishes a modified PCNN, and puts forward an adaptive PCNN parameters determination algorithm based on water valley area. Extensive experimental results on image processing demonstrate its validity and robustness.", "paper_title": "Adaptive parameters determination method of pulse coupled neural network based on water valley area", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100079"}
