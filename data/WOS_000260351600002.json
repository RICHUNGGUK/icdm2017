Its central ingredient is the computation of topological sensitivity maps. Whereas, for finite element solvers. implementations of such sensitivity maps have been accomplished ill file past. this study focuses Oil providing this functionality within a professional finite volume computational fluid dynamics solver. On the basis of a Continuous adjoint formulation, we derive the adjoint equations and the boundary conditions for typical Cost functions of ducted flows and present first results for two- and three-dimensional geometries. Emphasis is placed oil the versatility of our approach with respect to changes in the objective function. We further demonstrate that surface sensitivity maps can also be computed With file implemented and establish their connection with the implemented topological sensitivities.
