This method uses the knowledge of G(f) with its action on the roots of f over a p-adic number field, and it reduces the computation of K-f to solving systems of linear equations modulo some powers of p and Hensel liftings. We provide a careful treatment on reducing computational difficulty. We examine the ability/practicality of the method by experiments on a real computer and study its complexity.", "paper_title": "A modular method for computing the splitting field of a polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700010"}
