The proposed method hierarchically incorporates a genetic-algorithm-based feature selection to automatically select more efficient feature subset to discriminate among ultrasonic images of liver tissue in three states: normal liver, cirrhosis, and hepatoma. Multiple feature spaces are adopted in this paper, including the spatial gray-level dependence matrices (SGLDMs), multiresolution fractal feature vector and multiresolution energy feature vector. Features extracted from different feature spaces may contain complementary information. The feature subsets of different feature spaces are fused and the genetic-algorithm-based feature selection is applied onto the fused feature space to facilitate the two-stage feature fusion. The classification accuracy of the fused feature subset is up to 96.62%. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable to select discriminative features among multiple feature vectors to achieve the early detection of hepatoma and cirrhosis based on ultrasonic liver imaging.
