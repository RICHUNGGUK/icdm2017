Three families of such systems composed of only continuous-time subsystems, only discrete-time subsystems and mixed continuous- and discrete-time subsystems are considered, respectively. It is demonstrated that a CLCLF can always be constructed for the underlying system whenever its subsystems are continuous-time, discrete-time or the mixed type. The case when the number of subsystems is two is first considered, then the obtained result is extended to the general case. Three numerical examples are given to verify the validity of the developed results.", "paper_title": "A common linear copositive Lyapunov function for switched positive linear systems with commutable subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900002"}
