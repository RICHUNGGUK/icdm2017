Building nano structures with self assembly is both efficient and inexpensive. Soloveichik and Winfree (SIAM J Comput 36(6):1544-1569, 2007) formalized a two dimensional (2D) tile assembly model based on Wang's tiling technique. Algorithms with an optimal tile complexity of (Theta (log(N)/log(log(N)) were proposed earlier to uniquely self assemble an N x N square (with a temperature of alpha = 2) on this model. However efficient constructions to assemble arbitrary shapes are not known and have remained open. In this paper we present self assembling algorithms to assemble a triangle of base 2N - 1 (units) and height N with a tile complexity of Theta (log (N)). We also describe how this framework can be used to construct other shapes such as rhombus, hexagon etc.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for self assembling non-rectangular nano structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800034"}
