The authors have attempted to explain the characteristics of the shape representation of the mime effect using a neural network model that consists of four types of cells-encoding (E), normalizing (N), energetic (EN), and geometric (G) cells. E cells represent both the positions and orientations of inducing stimuli and the mime-effect shape, and N cells regulate the activity of E cells. The interactions of E cells generate dynamics whose mode indicates the stability of illusory perception; a stable dynamics mode indicates a stable perception, whereas a chaotic dynamics mode indicates an unstable perception. EN cells compute the Liapunov energetic exponent (LEE) from an energy function of the system of E cells. The stable and chaotic dynamics modes are identified by strictly negative and strictly positive values of LEE, respectively. In case of stability, G cells perform a particular surface interpolation for completing the mime effect shape. The authors confirm the model behaviour by means of computer-simulated experiments. The relation between the model behaviour and the shape representation in the human brain is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
