We developed a novel atom-pair descriptor (LORD_FP) that represents the ligand-as well as the receptor environment-of a chemical transformation and built a predictive model based on 17 602 3D-MMPs. We demonstrate that the created model is able to extrapolate the knowledge of a chemical transformation and the associated effect on ligand affinity to any similar system. VAMMPIRE-LORD was implemented as a web server that guides the user step-by-step through the optimization process of a defined lead compound.", "paper_title": "VAMMPIRE-LORD: A Web Server for Straightforward Lead Optimization Using Matched Molecular Pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000349943100001"}
