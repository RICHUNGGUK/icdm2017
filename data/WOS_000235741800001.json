We construct two adjunctions: Phi(L)-{Psi(L) between the category of (sic)(L)-uniform spaces and the category of L-uniform spaces and phi(L)-{psi(L) between the category of L-uniform spaces and the category of uniforrn, spaces (with L a complete lattice with an order-reversing involution in both cases), which with L = (0, 1) and L =(sic) = [0, 1], respectively, reduce to the adjunction from the category of (sic)-uniform spaces to the category of uniform spaces investigated by Katsaras. If L is any complete lattice (not necessarily with an order-reversing involution), then so is the L-unit interval (sic)(L), and we have another adjunction, viz. phi:((L))-\\psi:((L)) from the category of (sic)(L)-uniform spaces to the category of uniform spaces. We show that the following two factorizations hold: phi:((L)) = Phi(L) circle phi(L) and psi((sic)(L)) = psi(L) circle psi(L). When L is a meet-continuous lattice with an order-reversing involution, there is also a natural link between Phi(L)-\\Psi(L) and the existing adjunction Omega(L)-\\I-L from the category of (sic)(L)-topological spaces to the one of L-topological spaces, via the forgetful functors. An essential tool in this paper is the theory of Galois connections. It is emphasized that no kind of distributivity is assumed on the lattice L in this paper. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
