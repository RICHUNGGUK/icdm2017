However, most research has explored the process of knowledge transfer from the micro-level perspective, and less attention has been paid to the macro-level dynamic behavior patterns of network-based organization and the micro-macro links in the process of knowledge transfer. In this paper, a virtual experiment (VE) is utilized to explore the interdependence of knowledge transfer and dynamic behavior patterns of network-based organizations on the basis of rules systems. Our model shows that the speed of knowledge transfer and power influence of individuals play dominant roles in the process of knowledge transfer. The larger the network organization and the greater number of the neighbor nodes an organization have, the higher the proportion of nodes that will change their knowledge state.
