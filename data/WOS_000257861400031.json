Frequency-hopping sequences are needed in FH-CDMA systems. In this correspondence, three algebraic constructions of sets of optimal frequency-hopping sequences are presented. The parameters of these sets of frequency-hopping sequences are new and flexible.", "paper_title": "Sets of optimal frequency-hopping sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400031"}
