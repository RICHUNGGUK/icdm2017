Secure comparing two sets is an important problem in secure multiparty computation. The research on privately determining whether two sets are equal has not been investigated. This study solves the problem by mapping these sets into natural numbers and then comparing corresponding numbers. We propose two secure multiparty computation protocols for comparing two sets. It is proved by well-accepted simulation paradigm that these solutions are private in semi-honest model. These solutions have important significance in constructing other secure multiparty computation protocols.", "paper_title": "Comparing two sets without disclosing them", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200004"}
