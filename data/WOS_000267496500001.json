In this paper we focus on the impact of local recovery concern on the decomposition of the software system. For achieving local recovery, the system needs to be decomposed into separate units that can be recovered in isolation. However, it appears that this required decomposition for recovery is usually not aligned with the decomposition based on functional concerns. Moreover, introducing local recovery to a software system, while preserving the existing decomposition, is not trivial and requires substantial development and maintenance effort. To reduce this effort we propose a framework that supports the decomposition and implementation of software architecture for local recovery. The framework provides reusable abstractions for defining recoverable units and the necessary coordination and communication protocols for recovery. We discuss our experiences in the application and evaluation of the framework for introducing local recovery to the open-source media player called MPlayer.
