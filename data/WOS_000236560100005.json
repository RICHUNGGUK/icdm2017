The control law is developed at the dynamic level and can deal with model uncertainties. The proposed control law ensures the desired trajectory tracking of the configuration state of the closed-loop system. A global asymptotic stability result is obtained in the Lyapunov sense. A detailed example is presented to illustrate the proposed method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
