When bounded spatial regions are involved, such issues can be avoided if arbitrarily small sets of points are not definable in the mathematical setting. epsilon-semantics were introduced in this spirit. In this paper we investigate the use of epsilon-semantics deeper, in the context of reachability analysis of hybrid automata. In particular, we focus on two epsilon-semantics and reason about their computability. We then try our approach on biological model analysis to give evidence about the effectiveness of the methodology. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
