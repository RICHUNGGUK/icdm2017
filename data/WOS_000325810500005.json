Currently the area is undergoing widespread development. Furthermore, recent disasters have highlighted the importance of disaster management, in order to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable people and save lives. In this context, the problem of designing plans for the distribution of humanitarian aid according to the preferences of the decision maker is crucial. In this paper, a lexicographical dynamic flow model to solve this problem is presented, extending a previously introduced static flow model. The new model is validated in a realistic case study and a computational study is performed to compare both models, showing how they can be coordinated to improve their overall performance.", "paper_title": "A lexicographical dynamic flow model for relief operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500005"}
