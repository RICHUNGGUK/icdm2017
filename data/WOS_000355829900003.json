And it can be concluded whether the proposed four-node membrane element model has practical value in engineering application or not. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the equilibrium principle of element nodal internal forces and bending moments, the paper puts forward a four-node membrane element model with bending modification. A case study on the rollover of a typical bus body section is carried out by using the one-step algorithm for bus rollover collision to verify the effectiveness of the proposed element model. Findings - For the simulation of bus rollover collision, the computational accuracy can be guaranteed, meanwhile, the calculated amount is much smaller than the shell element, and computational efficiency is improved significantly. Originality/value - The proposed four-node membrane element model is used for the simulation of bus rollover collision for the first time. It holds the advantage of high computational efficiency of membrane element, and the computational accuracy is improved as well. In conclusion, it has some practical value in engineering application.", "paper_title": "A four-node membrane element model with bending modification for one-step algorithm for bus rollover impact", "paper_id": "WOS:000355829900003"}
