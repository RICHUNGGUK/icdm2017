The novel approach to the accounting for the propagation path length dispersion in the small scattering angle approximation limit is proposed. The new type of the approximate solution for the medium with the high anisotropy of the scattering is formulated. The results of the numerical simulations of the proposed transient solution are presented. The application of the new solution to the polarized radiation problems is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
