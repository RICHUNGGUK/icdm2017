It shows that the capacity of FTN is higher than the orthogonal pulse linear modulation capacity for all pulse shapes except the sine. FTN signals can in fact achieve the ultimate capacity for the signal power spectral density (PSD). The paper lower- and upper-bounds the FTN capacity under the constraint of finite input alphabet. It is often higher than the capacity for comparable orthogonal pulse systems; sometimes it is superior to all forms of orthogonal signaling with the same PSD.", "paper_title": "Constrained Capacities for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500022"}
