Firstly, mimicking the behaviors of some creatures group, multiple evolutionary strategies BPSO (MBPSO) is introduced which takes different evolutionary strategies for various particles according to their performances. Then, on the basis of MBPSO, a new strategy is discussed to improve the performance of the MBPSO (M2BPSO) which adopts the concept of the mutation operator aiming to overcome the premature convergence and slow convergent speed during the later stages of the optimization. The proposed two algorithms are tested on seven benchmark functions and their results are compared with those obtained by other methods. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Binary particle swarm optimization with multiple evolutionary strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800007"}
