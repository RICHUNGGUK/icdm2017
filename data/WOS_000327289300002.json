In this paper, we extend the capabilities of existing theorem proving based reliability analysis by formalizing several important statistical properties of continuous random variables like the second moment and the variance. We also formalize commonly used concepts about the reliability theory such as survival, hazard, cumulative hazard and fractile functions. With these extensions, it is now possible to formally reason about important measures of reliability (the probabilities of failure, the failure risks and the mean-time-to failure) associated with the life of a system that operates in an uncertain and harsh environment and is usually continuous in nature. We illustrate the modeling and verification process with the help of examples involving the reliability analysis of essential electronic and electrical system components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
