However, SC requires the use of computing eigenvectors, making it time consuming. To overcome this limitation, Lin and Cohen proposed the power iteration clustering (PIC) technique (Lin and Cohen in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 655-662, 2010), which is a simple and fast version of SC. Instead of finding the eigenvectors, PIC finds only one pseudo-eigenvector, which is a linear combination of the eigenvectors in linear time. However, in certain critical situations, using only one pseudo-eigenvector is not enough for clustering because of the inter-class collision problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the deflation technique to compute multiple orthogonal pseudo-eigenvectors (orthogonality is used to avoid redundancy). Our method is more accurate than PIC but has the same computational complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the improvement of our approach.", "paper_title": "Deflation-based power iteration clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000323278500010"}
