Comparing with traditional knowledge query way. the knowledge recommender systems Supply LIS a more proactive way that could deliver the proper knowledge to the proper people at the proper time. The recommendation mechanism is based on semantic matching on context information from both users' side and knowledge's side. Recommendation rules are also maintained in the recommendation engine, which is the core module in the system. By adjusting the rules, the configuration of the knowledge recommender system could be adapted to different users. This paper presents the system design as well as some key technologies analysis, and also discusses the advantages and preconditions for implementing the proposed system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
