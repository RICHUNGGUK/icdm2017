The method relies on the use of space time properties of moving edges. Asynchronous event-based neuromorphic retinas are composed of autonomous pixels, each of them asynchronously generating \"spiking\" events that encode relative changes in pixels' illumination at high temporal resolutions. Corner events are defined as the spatiotemporal locations where the aperture problem can be solved using the intersection of several geometric constraints in events' spatiotemporal spaces. A regularization process provides the required constraints, i.e. the motion attributes of the edges with respect to their spatiotemporal locations using local geometric properties of visual events. Experimental results are presented on several real scenes showing the stability and robustness of the detection and matching. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
