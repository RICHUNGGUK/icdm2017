They have recently been proposed as a grammatical method for capturing the structure of object-oriented programs, thus serving as an alternative to the use of meta-models like UML class diagrams in model-driven software design. In this paper, we study the properties of contextual grammars. Even though these grammars are not context-free, one can show that they inherit several of the nice properties of hyperedge replacement grammars. In particular, they possess useful normal forms and their membership problem is in NP.", "paper_title": "Contextual hyperedge replacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000359813500002"}
