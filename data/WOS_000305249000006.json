Compared with the kernel-based SIG (SIG-Kernel) algorithm, the GGD-based SIG (SIG-GGD) algorithm does not involve kernel width selection. If the error is zero-mean, the SIG-GGD algorithm will become the least mean p-power (LMP) algorithm with adaptive order and variable step-size. Due to its well matched density estimation and automatic switching capability, the proposed algorithm is favorably in line with existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC INFORMATION GRADIENT ALGORITHM WITH GENERALIZED GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249000006"}
