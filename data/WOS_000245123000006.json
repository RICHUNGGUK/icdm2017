Despite this importance, quantitative methods for evaluating the quality of a representation are virtually nonexistent. This is a major shortcoming. However, there is another approach. Instead of evaluating the quality of the final representation, the representation process itself can be evaluated. This paper views the modeling process as a communication channel. In a good communication channel, sufficient error prevention, error detection, and error correction mechanisms exist to ensure that the output message matches the input message. A good modeling process will also have mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and correcting errors at each step from observation to elicitation to analysis to final representation. This paper describes a theoretically-based set of best practices for ensuring that each step of the process is performed correctly, followed by a proof of concept experiment demonstrating the utility of the method for producing a representation that closely reflects the real world.", "paper_title": "Ensuring the quality of conceptual representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123000006"}
