Indeed, it is expected that this type of motors can be used more frequently. In this paper, a special type of these motors, the surface mounted PM motor, is considered. After introducing the mathematical model of the machine, a non-linear control approach according to Lyapunov control theory has been presented. According to this control strategy, all the states of the main system will track the states of the desired system, which are determined by our specifications. Due to the fact that all the states are not accessible in real plant, a nonlinear observer is designed to obtain motors states. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "TORQUE RIPPLE MINIMIZATION BY TRACKING NON-LINEAR CONTROL OF PM SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400003"}
