These atomic descriptors encode the properties of the fragments separating an atom from the closest end of a branch or the molecule. The end of a branch and the end of a molecule, as well as the selection of the fragments, are made by an algorithm that uses only the distance matrix of the molecule. The novel descriptors are applied to a small set of biotransformation rules and are shown to be able to reduce the number of unconfirmed positives by up to 58?%.", "paper_title": "Enrichment of True Positives from Structural Alerts Through the Use of Novel Atomic Fragment Based Descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000314064100008"}
