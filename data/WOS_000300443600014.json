The Parikh matrix of a word which has been recently introduced, is an extension of the notion of Parikh vector and gives more numerical information about the word in terms of certain subwords. Intensive investigation on various theoretical properties of Parikh matrices has taken place. This paper deals with the problem of finding properties of words so that their Parikh matrices commute.", "paper_title": "PRODUCT OF PARIKH MATRICES AND COMMUTATIVITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000300443600014"}
