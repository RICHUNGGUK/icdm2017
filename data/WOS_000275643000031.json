By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing an improved inequality, some delay-dependent passivity criteria are obtained in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) format. The main contribution of this paper is that a tighter upper bound of the differential of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is obtained by an improved approximation method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
