Particularly, this paper proposes a vector algebra based algorithm by exploring redundant nodes as an extra dimension for coverage compensation. This algorithm consists of two parts. One is to find the locations of potential redundant nodes for coverage compensation; and the other is to opportunistically select the best redundant nodes by jointly considering the hole boundaries and the remaining energy of nodes. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm minimizes the energy consumption when repairing the holes for full coverage. Furthermore, compared with other algorithms, the proposed one exhibits better performance in terms of moving distance and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "A Vector Algebraic Algorithm for Coverage Compensation in Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328063500001"}
