Here, we describe a reflective tutoring system for a virtual human simulation of negotiation. The tutor helps students review their exercise, elicits where and how they could have done better, and uses explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to allow students the chance to ask questions about the virtual human's behavior.", "paper_title": "Reflective tutoring for immersive simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100083"}
