Tools are needed to handle next-generation sequencing data and to cope with the computational complexity of large-scale studies. Here, we present Treephyler, a tool for fast taxonomic profiling of metagenomes. Treephyler was evaluated on real metagenome to assess its performance in comparison to previous approaches for taxonomic profiling. Results indicate that Treephyler is in terms of speed and accuracy prepared for next-generation sequencing techniques and large-scale analysis.", "paper_title": "Treephyler: fast taxonomic profiling of metagenomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000276045800016"}
