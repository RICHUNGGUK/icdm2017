For a camera model with four intrinsic parameters and visible lens distortion, the principal point and distortion coefficients are firstly determined through analysis of the distortion in an image. The distortion is then removed. Finally, the other intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are obtained through direct linear transform followed by bundle adjustment. Theoretically, the method makes it possible to analyze the calibration result at the level of a single frame. Practically, such a method provides a easy way to calibrate a camera used in industrial vision system on line and used in desktop vision system. Experimental results of both simulated data and real images validate the method.", "paper_title": "Camera calibration from a single frame of planar pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100053"}
