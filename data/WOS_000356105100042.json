First, a set of 3D facial features is recovered from 2D features extracted from the image. The features are recovered by solving equations derived from a regularized scaled orthogonal projection. The regularization is achieved by a global shape constraint exploiting a prior reference 3D facial shape. Second, we warp a high-resolution reference 3D face, using both recovered 3D features and local shape constraint at each model points. Last, realistic 3D face is obtained through texture synthesis. Compared with existing approach, the proposed feature recovery method has higher accuracy, and it is robust to facial pose variation appeared on the given image. Moreover, the model warping method based on local shape constraints can warp a high-resolution reference 3D face using few 3D features more reasonably and accurately. The proposed approach generates realistic 3D face with impressive visual effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
