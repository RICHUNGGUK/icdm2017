Nevertheless, it is difficult for a researcher to find suitable collaborators from all researchers around the world. In this paper, we have used bibliographic DBLP data to extract information of a researcher and to discover the relationship between the co-authors and between authors and conferences. We evaluated some of the similarity measures and developed an innovative random walk model to find potential co-authors for a given researcher. These measures were then used to design a best model to recommend co-authors. We have also applied an HITS algorithm and proposed a ranking algorithm to rank researchers and conferences with the intent of recommending authors or conferences.", "paper_title": "Similarity-based Complex Publication Network Analytics for Recommending Potential Collaborations", "paper_id": "WOS:000358988900008"}
