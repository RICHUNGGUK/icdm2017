Large-scale deployment of 802.1 1-based technologies will play an integral part in the construction of such ubiquitous wireless mobile systems. A challenging task in the development of such networks is efficient provisioning of QoS-enablecr services for mobile users. In this context, we propose a scheme that constantly monitors the overall network performance to perform admission control and traffic conditioning at the 802.1 1-based access points and mobile terminals. The focus is on service-level fairness, where different flows from the same traffic class can still receive the some QoS level even if they have different bit rates. Furthermore, given the mobiliof users, the success of any resource allocation and admission control model depends on the continuity of QoS guorantees across different WLANs. This article proposes a dynamic service level agreement negotiation protocol that allows mobile terminals to perform handoffs between different WLANs while maintaining the agreed level of service. End users also can change their service levels in response to changes in network conditions.", "paper_title": "Toward efficient service-level GoS provisioning in large-scale 802.11-based networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249615400008"}
