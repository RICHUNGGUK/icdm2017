This article describes a design model for an educational system based on the teaching methods applied in the Spanish classrooms, which takes into account new advances in technology, while preserving the current teaching methods in the classroom to ensure a quality teaching and learning process. This development has been achieved by combining technological components such as Cloud Computing, Web Services and Distributed User Interfaces. The proposed system is based on a systematic approach where different phases are implemented, containing workflows and stages.", "paper_title": "Interactive Design System for Schools using Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000322595200007"}
