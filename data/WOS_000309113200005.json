Symmetric and asymmetric TCAM cells are two widely used cells for implementing a TCAM array. This paper presents several comparison fault models of TCAMs with asymmetric cells based on electrical defects. Some new comparison faults which do not exist in a TCAM with symmetric cells are found. One march-like test algorithm TAC-H is also proposed to cover the defined comparison faults. The TAC-H consists of 8N Write operations and (3N + 2B) Compare operations for an N x B-bit TCAM with Hit output only. We also propose two march-like diagnosis algorithms to identify the defined comparison faults of TCAMs with asymmetric cells. The first diagnosis algorithm DAC-H requires 5N Write operations, 3N Erase operations, and (5N + 2B) Compare operations to distinguish 100 percent comparison faults for a TCAM with Hit output only. The second diagnosis algorithm DAC-P requires 3N Write operations, 1N Erase operations, and (5N + 2B) Compare operations to distinguish 100 percent comparison faults for a TCAM with Hit and priority address encoder outputs.", "paper_title": "Testing and Diagnosing Comparison Faults of TCAMs with Asymmetric Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000309113200005"}
