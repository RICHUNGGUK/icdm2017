The existence and stability conditions of quasi global-sliding mode are proposed. The design method for the discrete global SM controller is studied and applied to Buck converter with global-sliding mode control. Computer simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "STUDY OF DISCRETE GLOBAL-SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR SWITCHING DC-DC CONVERTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000296629700013"}
