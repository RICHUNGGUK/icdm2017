Then, a content-based video classifier is developed by combining the active relevance feedback technique and SVM for detecting the cartoon videos. The experimental results on the vast real video clips illustrate that compared with the classifier based on SVM and that based on traditional relevance feedback technique and SVM, the proposed classifier has a higher advantage of cartoon video detection.", "paper_title": "A cartoon video detection method based on active relevance feedback and SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000063"}
