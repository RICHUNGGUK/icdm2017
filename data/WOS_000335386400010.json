In order to utilize spectrum resources completely, many spectrum handoff techniques based on game theory have been proposed, but most studies only concern that users how to achieve better payoffs, without much attention to the diverse needs of users. In this paper, we propose a new channel-switching model based on game theory, using a prioritized approach to meet the diverse needs of users in two different modes (CQ and PS). At the same time, this paper proposes some acceleration techniques to reach the Nash equilibrium more efficiently. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes depending on priority using real channel availability measurements, and conclude that the channel quality function (CQ) mode provide better service for priority user but the plan-sorting (PS) mode can be more suitable in multiple priority users exist scene.", "paper_title": "Priority-based Differentiated Service in Spectrum Mobility Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386400010"}
