This is the first Bio-IBE scheme that achieves constant size ciphertext. This is also a scheme that is secure against the adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2). Details are presented along with a discussion of Shamir's threshold secret sharing and fuzzy extraction of biometrics, which is based on error correction codes. We also define a security model and prove that the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The comparison shows that the proposed scheme has better efficiency and stronger security compared with the available Bio-IBE schemes.", "paper_title": "CCA2 secure biometric identity based encryption with constant-size ciphertext", "paper_id": "WOS:000296253000004"}
