Advantages and disadvantages of the technology are discussed and act as a guideline for improving localization accuracy. Tests concerning TOA are performed by means of the location engine of Nanotron. Adapting this engine leads to improved localization results. It is shown that TOA measurements are susceptible to reflections and dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "Time of Arrival Based on Chirp Pulses as a means to Perform Localization in IEEE 802.15.4a Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280312600011"}
