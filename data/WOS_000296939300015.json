We classified all subjects of the social economic system into several sectors, and described the components of the currency flows for every sectors. We established a gridiron type table that can simulate the real interdepartmental currency flows of the economic system, and gave out several quantitative equilibrium relations in the input-output table. After we separated the deposits and loans respectively from the currency inflows and outflows of commercial banks, we obtained two mathematical models that are consistent with the Leontief input-output model. On the assumption that the ratios of currency inflows are fixed, we deduced the horizontal input-output equations, and on the assumption that the ratios of currency outflows are fixed, we deduced the vertical input-output equations. We introduced the concepts of direct inflow coefficient, complete inflow coefficient, direct outflow coefficient and complete outflow coefficient. By means of the complete inflow coefficient matrix and the complete outflow coefficient matrix, it is easy to study the quantitative relations between the gross currency flows of sectors and commercial banks' deposit and loan scale.", "paper_title": "MULTI-SECTOR CURRENCY FLOWS BASED ON THE INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, PART 1: THEORY AND TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300015"}
