The previous algorithm for the problem (V.H. Nguyen and T.T Nguyen in Int. J. Math. Oper. Res. 4(3):294-301, 2012) which is not combinatorial, is based on the Held-Karp relaxation and heuristic methods such as the Frieze et al.'s heuristic (Frieze et al. in Networks 12:23-39, 1982) or the recent Asadpour et al.'s heuristic for the ATSP (Asadpour et al. in 21st ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, 2010). Depending on which of the two heuristics is used, it gives respectively 1+aOElog(n)aOE parts per thousand and as an approximation ratio. Our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of aOElog(n)aOE parts per thousand which is weaker than but represents the first combinatorial approximation algorithm for the Asymmetric Prize-Collecting TSP.", "paper_title": "A primal-dual approximation algorithm for the Asymmetric Prize-Collecting TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000315564700007"}
