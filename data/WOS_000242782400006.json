The application of grid technology in collaborative design is presented. Concept of collaborative design grid (CDG) is put forward for product design and simulation, and its corresponding architecture is set up based on grid middleware. Task management and resource management in the grid environment are discussed. Grid services are realized based on globus toolkit 3.0. Grid portal of the CDG based on web is developed, and advanced graphical interfaces are provided for potential users. A prototype test bed is established via a case study of a sightseeing lift. It validates the resource sharing and cooperative work through customizing design and parameterized analysis in the CDG. Finally, the performance of the CDG test bed is analyzed and concluded.
