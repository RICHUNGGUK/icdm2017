Empirical results show that the combined model can improve the forecasting performance significantly in contrast with its counterparts in terms of the error evaluation measurements. However, as far as turning points and profit criterions are concerned, the ANN model is best as well as at capturing a significant number of turning points. The results are conflicting when implementing dissimilar forecasting criteria (the quantitative and the turning points measurements) to evaluate the performance of three models. The ANN model is overall the best model, and can be used as an alternative method to model Chinese future food grain price. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
