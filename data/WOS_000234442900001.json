This makes a difficulty ill mathematical analysis for the hydrodynamic effect because fluid velocity at the liquid-solid interfaces is not known a priori. If the gap has a convergent-divergent wedge, a free boundary pressure condition, i.e. Reynolds pressure boundary condition, is usually Used in the Outlet Zone ill numerical Solution. This paper, based oil finite element method and parametric quadratic programming technique, gives a numerical Solution technique for it Coupled boundary non-linearity of wall slip and free boundary pressure condition. It is found that the numerical error decreases with the number of elements ill a negative power law having all index larger than 2. Our method does not need all iterative process and call simultaneously gives rise to fluid film pressure distribution, wall slip velocity and Surface shear stress. Wall slip always decreases the hydrodynamic pressure. Large wall slip even causes a null hydrodynamic pressure a pure sliding solid gap.
