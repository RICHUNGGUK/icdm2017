In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying private information with the consideration of human factors in data publishing for binary sensitive attributes. We first propose five axioms to capture the properties of private information in data publishing. In particular, the fifth axiom considers human factors in the view of social psychology. We believe that a function that quantifies private information has to satisfy all these five axioms. Therefore, we propose an expected gain model, which allows users to tune a weighting factor to reflect the importance of human factors in their applications. The proposed model has been analyzed and compared with some existing models, such as information gain. Moreover, experiments have been performed on real applications to study the practicality of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "QUANTIFYING PRIVATE INFORMATION WITH HUMAN FACTORS IN DATA PUBLISHING FOR BINARY SENSITIVE ATTRIBUTES", "paper_id": "WOS:000284614900006"}
