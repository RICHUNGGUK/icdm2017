The Chinese full-text database CNKI is used for data collection. Results suggest that the DII can be considered as an independent indicator, but that it also has predictive value for other indicators, such as a journal's h-index. In case a journal cannot yet have an impact factor-because its citation history within the database is too short-the DII can be used for a preliminary evaluation. The article provides results related to the CNKI database as a whole and additionally, some detailed information about agricultural and forestry journals.", "paper_title": "The journal download immediacy index (DII): experiences using a Chinese full-text database", "paper_id": "WOS:000275124700009"}
