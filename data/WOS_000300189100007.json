The SAS system can demonstrate the outcomes of collective intelligence that are mediated by various multi-modal interactions. Current SAS prototype is capable of polymorphous functional changes for dynamically adjustable electronic wallpaper, location/distance-aware video conferencing, personalized information browser, and automatic responses to various unintended events. Future applications would harness machine learning and machine vision techniques and will explore the advantages of having computational ecology of its digital modular units constituting smart wall system for multi-modal and multi-functional interactions.", "paper_title": "Modularized multimedia framework for multi-modal and multi-functional interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189100007"}
