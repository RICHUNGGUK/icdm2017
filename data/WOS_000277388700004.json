Nursing practice is under pressure of the changes, which often lead to dysfunctional workflow. The purposes for this literature review were (1) to identify what has been examined about disruptions of nursing care workflow in using Clinical information systems and (2) to obtain a lesson for future research to investigate disruptions of nursing care workflow in using Clinical information systems. In reviewed studies, nursing workflow disruptions have limitedly been reported. Nursing care workflow has not been investigated sufficiently; thus, what happened to nursing care workflow by using a Clinical information system has not been fully known. Nurses have a need for the use of a Clinical information system in aspects of nursing perspective in patient care. Unless the use of Clinical information systems provides effective workflow of nursing care, it will result in confusion in nursing practice as well as poor quality of patient care. It is essential to capture disruptions and/or effectiveness in nursing care workflow from the perspectives of nurses. The required research approach to clinical settings is to identify all facets of adverse consequences triggered from the use of a Clinical information system by following the context of nursing care workflow.", "paper_title": "Capturing Nursing Care Workflow Disruptions Comparison Between Nursing and Physician Workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000277388700004"}
