Because some of these wavelengths may be released or occupied at any time, the global state database is always out of date and need update by some update policy. A suitable link-state update policy is critical, since a high-frequency update policy imposes heavy burden on the network, while a low-frequency update would increase the inaccurate of the global link-state database. In this paper, we propose a link-state update policy, named the EA-HD policy, which considers two index of a link, one is the Hamming distance between the local link-state database and the global link-state database, and the other is the used ratio of its wavelengths. The proposed update policy gets a trade-off between the accurate of link-state information and its update cost. Simulation results prove that our scheme achieves a good performance in traffic blocking probability while maintaining moderate volume of update traffic.", "paper_title": "EA-HD: a novel link state update mechanism for ASON", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400002"}
