Nevertheless, most of the reported descriptors are still face accuracy and computational challenges. Fourier descriptors are considered to be promising descriptors as they are based on a sound theoretical foundation and also have the advantages of computational efficiency and attractive invariance properties. This paper proposes a new curvature-based Fourier descriptor (CBFD) for shape retrieval. The proposed descriptor takes an unconventional view of the curvature-scale-space representation of a shape contour as it treats it as a 2-D binary image (hence referred to as curvature-scale image, or CSI). The invariant descriptor is derived from the 2-D Fourier transform of the curvature-scale image. This method allows the descriptor to capture the detailed dynamics of the shape curvature and enhance the efficiency of the shape-matching process. Experiments using the widely known MPEG-7 databases in conjunction with a created noisy database have been conducted in order to compare the performance of the proposed descriptor with six commonly used shape-retrieval descriptors: curvature-scale-space descriptor (CSSD), angular radial transform descriptors (ARTD), Zernike moment descriptors (ZMD), radial Tchebichef moment descriptors (RTMD), generic Fourier descriptor (GFD), and the 1-D Fourier descriptor (1-FD). The performance of the proposed descriptor has surpassed that of many of these notable descriptors. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
