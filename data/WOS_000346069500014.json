In the proposed method, MRMR is employed as a feature selection tool for dimensionality reduction in order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ELM classifier. The impact of the type of activation functions, the number of hidden neurons and the size of the feature subsets on the performance of ELM have been investigated in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been rigorously evaluated against the ES disease dataset, a benchmark dataset, from UCI machine learning database in terms of classification accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method has achieved the best classification accuracy of 98.89% and an average accuracy of 98.55% via 10-fold cross-validation technique. The proposed method might serve as a new candidate of powerful methods for diagnosing ES diseases.", "paper_title": "A fast approach for detection of erythemato-squamous diseases based on extreme learning machine with maximum relevance minimum redundancy feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069500014"}
