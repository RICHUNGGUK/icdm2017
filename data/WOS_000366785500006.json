Embedding multiple virtual networks (VNs) in a shared substrate deals with efficient mapping of virtual resources in the physical infrastructure and is referred to as the Virtual Network Embedding problem (VNE-problem). Although there is recently a number of research work in the area of network virtualization based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, virtual network embedding in SDN remains challenging from both theoretical and practical points of view. This article focuses on virtual network embedding strategies and related issues for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (laaS) paradigms under the constraint of fixed virtual node locations. Special considerations are given to the problems related to resource allocation and link sharing of multi-layer virtual networks on top of the physical substrate. Firstly, a heuristic virtual network embedding algorithm is proposed that can improve the mapping acceptance ratio and resource efficiency in the laaS context. Secondly, REsource reSERvation in generalized Virtual NETworks (ReServNet), a Software-Defined Networking platform designed for embedding multi-level virtual networks in physical infrastructures is developed. By defining new softwarized logical functions, ReServNet allows network administrators to create and manage multiple virtual networks on top of the physical network and allocate bandwidth resources to them accordingly. Moreover, the ReServNet framework allows for designing, prototyping, benchmarking and evaluating the performance of different network embedding algorithms easily in real SDN virtualization environments. Different issues related to virtual network embedding on SDN-based physical substrate are also analyzed and discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
