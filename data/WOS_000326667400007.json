This study intends to explore capabilities and potentials of this newly developed method in the realm of structural optimization. A novel algorithm is developed that employs basic principles of this method for structural optimization problems specifically. Performance of the proposed algorithm is measured using one benchmark as well as three practical truss structures that are sized for minimum weight subject to stress, stability and displacement constraints according to American Institute of Steel Construction-Allowable Stress Design (AISC-ASD) specification. The numerical results demonstrate efficiency of the proposed algorithm in practical structural optimization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
