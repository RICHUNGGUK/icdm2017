The molecular structures were optimized using Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional (B3LYP). The electronic excitation spectra in the range of 400-700 nm were calculated using the ADC(2) and the linear-response time-dependent DFT methods. The calculated spectra are compared to those measured in ethanol solution. The calculated excitation energies agree well with those deduced from the experimental spectra. The excitation energies for the Q(x) band calculated at the B3LYP and ADC(2) level are 0.20-0.25 eV larger than the experimental values. The excitation energies for the Q(y) band calculated at the B3LYP level are 0.10-0.20 eV smaller than the ADC(2) ones and are thus in good agreement with experiment. The calculated excitation energies corresponding to the B-x and B-y bands are 0.10-0.30 eV larger than the experimental values. The excitation energies of the B-x and B-y bands calculated at the B3LYP level are in somewhat better agreement with experiment than the ADC(2) ones. The calculated and measured band strengths largely agree.", "paper_title": "Computational and experimental studies of the electronic excitation spectra of EDTA and DTPA substituted tetraphenylporphyrins and their Lu complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200003"}
