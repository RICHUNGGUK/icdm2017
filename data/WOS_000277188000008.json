OPTEAM. was developed to capture key aspects of the design process through a set of design-related ontologies and to serve as an application platform for facilitating the engineering design process The design. analysis, and optimization of a classical I-beam problem are presented as a test-bed case study to illustrate the capabilities of these ontologies in OPTEAM A second, more extensive test-bed example based on an industry-supplied medical device design problem is also introduced. Results indicate that well-defined, networked relationships within an ontological knowledge base can ultimately lead to a refined design process. with guidance provided by the identification of infeasible solutions and the introduction of \"best-case\" alternatives These case studies also show how the application of first-order logic to engineering design improves the knowledge acquisition. knowledge management, and knowledge validation processes", "paper_title": "Improved knowledge management through first-order logic in engineering design ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000277188000008"}
