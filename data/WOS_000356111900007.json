While there exist many algorithms for assembly of sequenced genomic material, they often experience difficulties in constructing complete genomic sequences. Instead, they produce long genomic subsequences (scaffolds), which then become a subject to scaffold assembly aimed at reconstruction of their order along genome chromosomes. The balance between reliability and cost for scaffold assembly is not there just yet, which inspires one to seek for new approaches to address this problem. We present a new method for scaffold assembly based on the analysis of gene orders and genome rearrangements in multiple related genomes (some or even all of which may be fragmented). Evaluation of the proposed method on artificially fragmented mammalian genomes demonstrates its high reliability. We also apply our method for incomplete anophelinae genomes, which expose high fragmentation, and further validate the assembly results with referenced-based scaffolding. While the two methods demonstrate consistent results, the proposed method is able to identify more assembly points than the reference-based scaffolding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
