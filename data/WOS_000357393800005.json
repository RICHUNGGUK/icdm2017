The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of institutional factors in top management team's (TMT's) decision to adopt cloud computing services. Design/methodology/approach - A model is developed and tested with data from an Australian survey using the partial least squares modeling technique. Findings - The results suggest that mimetic and coercive pressures influence TMT's beliefs in the benefits of cloud computing. The results also show that TMT's beliefs drive TMT's participation, which in turn affects the intention to increase the adoption of cloud computing solutions. Research limitations/implications - Future studies could incorporate the influences of local actors who might also press for innovation. Practical implications - Given the influence of institutional forces and the plethora of cloud-based solutions on the market, it is recommended that TMTs exercise a high degree of caution when deciding for the types of applications to be outsourced as organizational requirements in terms of performance and security will differ. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the growing empirical literature on cloud computing adoption and offers the institutional framework as an alternative lens with which to interpret cloud-based information technology outsourcing.", "paper_title": "The role of institutional pressures and top management support in the intention to adopt cloud computing solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000357393800005"}
