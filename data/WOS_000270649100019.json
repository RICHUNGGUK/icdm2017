In this paper, we present a variant of the SOM algorithm called the SOM-based optimization (SOMO) algorithm. The development of the SOMO algorithm was motivated by exploring the possibility of applying the SOM algorithm in continuous optimization problems. Through the self-organizing process, good solutions to an optimization problem can be simultaneously explored and exploited by the SOMO algorithm. In our opinion, the SOMO algorithm not only can be regarded as a biologically inspired computational model but also may be regarded as a new approach to a model of social influence and social learning. Several simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.", "paper_title": "A variant of the SOM algorithm and its interpretation in the viewpoint of social influence and learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649100019"}
