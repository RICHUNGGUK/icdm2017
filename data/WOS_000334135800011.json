With the rapid development of IoT, large amounts of IoT services are provided by various IoT middleware solutions. So, discovery and selecting the adequate services becomes a time-consuming and challenging task. This paper proposes a novel similarity-measurement for computing the similarity between services and introduces a new personalized recommendation approach for real-world service based on collaborative filtering. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed recommendation approach, large-scale of experiments are conducted, which involves the QoS-records of 339 users and 5825 real web-services. The experiments results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other compared approaches in terms of accuracy and stability.", "paper_title": "A Feedback-corrected Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Real-world Service Recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334135800011"}
