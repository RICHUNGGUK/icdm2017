The a posteriori error estimation criterion is based on the assessment of the goodness-of-fit of the least squares regression used to perform the variables profile reconstruction and it is capable of detecting both large-scale and small-scale flow phenomena. The criterion allowed to capture in detail the large-scale flow structure and also the sequence of creeping flow small sharp corner's [ 1] eddies, up to the fourth corner vortex in addition to the primary cavity vortex. The smallest corner vortex detected is O(10(-16))smaller in velocity magnitude compared with the cavity primary recirculation flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
