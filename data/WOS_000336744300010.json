In this paper, we present a computational approach for finding RNA tertiary motifs in genomic sequences. Specifically, we predict genomic coordinate locations for coaxial helical stackings in 3-way RNA junctions. These predictions are provided by our tertiary motif search package, named CSminer, which utilizes two versatile methodologies: random forests and covariance models. A coaxial helical stacking tertiary motif occurs in a 3-way RNA junction where two separate helical elements form a pseudocontiguous helix and provide thermodynamic stability to the RNA molecule as a whole. Our CSminer tool first uses a genome-wide search method based on covariance models to find a genomic region that may potentially contain a coaxial helical stacking tertiary motif. CSminer then uses a random forests classifier to predict whether the genomic region indeed contains the tertiary motif. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Genome-Wide Prediction of Coaxial Helical Stacking Using Random Forests and Covariance Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000336744300010"}
