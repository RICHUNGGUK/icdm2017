This paper presents a robust feedforward compensation scheme with AC booster. An ac amplifier is added in parallel with the main path to compensate the high-frequency gain reduction, which improves gain-bandwidth (GBW) product and slew rate significantly. This approach takes the multistage error amplifier (EA) as an element in the compensation circuit instead of using passive elements used in traditional proportional-plus-integral-and-derivative (PID) compensation circuits. The positive phase shift of left-half-phase (LHP) zeros caused by the feedforward path and ac boosting path in the multistage EA is used to cancel the negative phase shift by the resonant poles of the power stage of buck DC-DC converter in order to compensate the DC-DC converters. A graphical loop-gain method is used to design the feedback compensation and analyze the closed-loop performances of the converter for the complexion arising from the presence of multiple poles of EA before crossover frequency in high frequency converters. The high gain, wide bandwidth, and high slew rate are achieved by the absence of traditional pole-splitting effect and the added ac booster. In addition, the design guidelines for this feedback compensation network realized by robust feedforward with AC booster compensation (RFACBC) scheme and multistage EA are established. When the proposed compensation networks were employed in 100 MHz buck DC-DC converter implemented in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process, the simulation results validate the feasibility and functionality of the RFACBC scheme and design guidelines. The closed-loop dc gain achieves over 60 dB with over 20 MHz GBW and 61A degrees phase margin under wide range loads. Furthermore, the settling time is improved due to the advanced frequency compensation.", "paper_title": "Robust feedforward compensation scheme with AC booster for high frequency low voltage buck DC-DC converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000300357600013"}
