The criteria, to constrain the DNA sequence design, include different combinatorial constraints proposed by different researchers. However, the unique and all-purpose constraint (or constraints) has not been found yet. In this paper, we firstly obtain some DNA sequences sets from our algorithm. Then, we employ the minimum free energy (MFE, for short) to evaluate the different combinatorial constraints, because the MFE criterion is the minimum value among free energies of all the possible structures and the effective approach to control the generation of unexpected secondary structure of DNA sequences may cause error. Comparisons of the results suggests that the Cl combinatorial constraint could be the best combinatorial constraints and the CC (or WW) constraint be the most important single constraint for designing DNA sequence sets.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Different Combinatorial Constraints in DNA Computing Based on Minimum Free Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000289039800002"}
