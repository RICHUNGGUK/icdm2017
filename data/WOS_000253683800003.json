The analysis shows that if the system-level optimum point at one iteration is outside the feasible region of the original optimization problem, at the next iteration, the system-level optimization problem may be infeasible due to the system-level consistency equality constraints. One way to solve the problem of the infeasibility is to relax the system-level consistency equality constraints using inequality constraints. However it is a delicate job to determine a rational relaxed tolerance because feasibility and consistency have conflicting requirements for the tolerance, that is, the more relaxed the better for feasibility while the stricter the better for consistency. Based on the geometric analysis, a method of variable relaxed tolerance is put forward to solve this problem. In this method, an adaptive adjustment of the tolerance is made at each iteration according to the quantified inconsistency between two subsystems. In the last section, the capabilities and limitations of the proposed method are illustrated by three examples.", "paper_title": "Geometric analysis of collaborative optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000253683800003"}
