Kernel parameter setting in the SVM training process, along with the feature selection, significantly affects classification accuracy. The objective of this study is to obtain the better parameter values while also finding a subset of features that does not degrade the SVM classification accuracy. This study develops a simulated annealing (SA) approach for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM, termed SA-SVM. To measure the proposed SA-SVM approach, several datasets in UCI machine learning repository are adopted to calculate the classification accuracy rate. The proposed approach was compared with grid search which is a conventional method of performing parameter setting, and various other methods. Experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy rates of the proposed approach exceed those of grid search and other approaches. The SA-SVM is thus useful for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
