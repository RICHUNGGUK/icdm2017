Their deployment within Web-based application frameworks featuring frequent context updates and distributed evaluation requires flexible, interoperable context representation. In this paper we present C-SBVR, an XML-based representation of contexts as rule sets in line with SBVR( Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) specifications, and show how this format is suitable for being efficiently handled in a pipeline for context information processing on Java-based rule evaluation engines.", "paper_title": "An efficient language pipeline for flexible rule-based context representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332200004"}
