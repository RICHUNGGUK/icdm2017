Hybrid extended finite automata can choose from a finite set of such operations. In this paper, five word operations are taken into consideration which always yield letter-equivalent results, namely reversal and shift operations. The computational power of those machines is investigated, locating the corresponding families of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy. Furthermore, different types of hybrid extended finite automata, defined by the set of operations they are allowed to apply, are compared with each other, demonstrating that there exist dependencies and independencies between the input manipulating operations.", "paper_title": "Hybrid extended finite automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316500007"}
