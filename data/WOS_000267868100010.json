The shape of surface roughness is simulated to be square, sinusoidal, triangular, and fractal. Numerical computations compared with theoretical and experimental studies show that the roughness geometry is an important factor besides the relative roughness in the study of the effects of surface roughness. The fractal boundary presents a higher influence on the velocity field and the resistance coefficient than other regular boundaries at the same Knudsen number and relative roughness. In addition, the effects of rare faction, compressibility, and roughness are strongly coupled, and the roughness effect should not be ignored in studying rarefaction and compressibility of the microchannel as the relative roughness increases.", "paper_title": "ROUGHNESS EFFECT OF DIFFERENT GEOMETRIES ON MICRO GAS FLOWS BY LATTICE BOLTZMANN SIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000267868100010"}
