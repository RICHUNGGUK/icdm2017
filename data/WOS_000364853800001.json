CCRank is based on cooperative coevolution ( CC), a divide-and-conquer framework that has demonstrated high promise in function optimization for problems with large search space and complex structures. Moreover, CC naturally allows parallelization of sub-solutions to the decomposed sub-problems, which can substantially boost learning efficiency. With CCRank, we investigate parallel CC in the context of learning to rank. We implement CCRank with three EA-based learning to rank algorithms for demonstration. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms show the performance gains of CCRank in efficiency and accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Cooperative Coevolution Framework for Parallel Learning to Rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853800001"}
