Recording reliability of each technology was assessed by calculating the corruption rate (the relative amount of unusable data collected) for data collected over a 6 h time frame. in a subsequent trial, recording reliability was assessed for the telemetry system during two consecutive data collection days, including a period of transport. Calculations were made for the total percentage of corrupt data and the percentage of corrupt 5 min intervals. The remote, continuous technology performed comparably for total percent of corrupt data and demonstrated a reduced percentage of corrupt 5 min intervals, compared with both directly connected technologies. It also performed similarly over two consecutive days of monitoring, and did not differ for monitoring within a stall or a trailer. Based on the results of this analysis, it is recommended to account for expected data loss in transmission of remote monitoring by instrumenting additional animals and sampling with greater frequency.
