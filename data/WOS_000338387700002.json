However, until now no environment offers routines for the provable correct multiprecision and radix-independent evaluation of these special functions. We point out how we make good use of series and limit-periodic continued fraction representations in a package that is being developed at the University of Antwerp. Our scalable precision technique is mainly based on the use of sharpened a priori truncation and round-off error upper bounds for real arguments. The implementation is validated in the sense that it returns a sharp interval enclosure for the requested function evaluation, at the same cost as the evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
