The CBSC is used to compensate for technology scaling and to reduce the power consumption of a 2.8 MS/s 10-bit cyclic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A multi-level preset voltage tracks the input voltage in order to improve the conversion rate without consuming additional power. Additionally, a comparator, current sources, and a feedback capacitor are shared to reduce the power and area of this cyclic ADC. Near the Nyquist-rate, a prototype implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology has a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio of 53.69 dB and a spurious-free dynamic-range of 62.36 dB, while consuming 0.73 mW of power.", "paper_title": "A comparator-based cyclic analog-to-digital converter with multi-level input tracking boosted preset voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200018"}
