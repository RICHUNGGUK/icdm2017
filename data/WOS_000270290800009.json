Despite some frictions during the 1980s and 1990s, the interplay between informatics and BISE is becoming much more constructive and has proven extremely fruitful. Important examples for this co-evolution include data management and conceptual modeling, internet-based information and transaction systems, and the emergence of computational business sciences. The increasing integration of virtual and real world in the \"Internet of Things\" offers new scientific and organizational challenges for the cooperation between BISE and informatics, which can only be formulated and solved jointly.", "paper_title": "Perspectives of the Interplay Between Business and Information Systems Engineering and Computer Science", "paper_id": "WOS:000270290800009"}
