Comput. Phys. 1985; 61:261-268; Comput. Phys. Commun. 1991; 66:219-232; Comput. Phys. Commun. 1991; 66: 23j-242: J. Comput. Phys. 2001; 169:556-593) based on adaptive Soroban grids (J. Comput. Phys. 2004; 194:57-77). In this approach, the CIP combined unified procedure (CCUP) technique (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 1991; 60:2105-2108), which is based on the CIP method, is combined with the adaptive Soroban and technique. One of the superior features of the approach is that even though the grid system is unstructured, it still has a simple data structure that renders remarkable computational efficiency. Another superior feature is that despite the unstructured and collocated nature of the grid, high-order accuracy and computational robustness are maintained. In addition, because the Soroban grid technique does not have any elements or cells connecting the grid points, the approach does not involve mesh distortion limitations. While the details of the approach and several numerical examples were reported in (Comput. Mech. 2006: published online), our objective in this paper is to provide an easy-to-follow description of the key aspects of the approach.
