The present study is an extension of previous research [Li et al., Surface embedding narrow volume reconstruction from unorganized points, Comput. Vis. Image Underst. 121 (2014) 100-107]. In the previous work, we modified the original Allen-Cahn equation by multiplying a control function to restrict the evolution within a narrow band around the given surface data set. The key idea of the present work is to perform the computations only on a narrow band around the given surface data set. In this way, we can significantly reduce the storage memory and CPU time. The proposed numerical method, based on operator splitting techniques, can employ a large time step size and exhibits unconditional stability. We perform a number of numerical experiments in order to demonstrate the efficiency of this method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
