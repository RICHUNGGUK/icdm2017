For instance, dynamic games can be used for simulating interactions between agents in an argumentation process. In this paper, we establish a new link between these domains in a static framework: we show how an argumentation framework can be translated into a CP-Boolean game and how this translation can be used for computing extensions of argumentation semantics. We give formal algorithms to do so.", "paper_title": "ARGUMENTATION AND CP-BOOLEAN GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000281194500008"}
