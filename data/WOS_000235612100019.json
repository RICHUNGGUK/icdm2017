Poinsot, S.K. Lele, Boundary conditions for direct simulation of compressible viscous flows, J. Comput. Phys. 101 (1992) 104-129] are frequently employed. This formulation is analyzed analytically and it is found that the linear relaxation term proposed by Rudy and Strikwerda [D.H. Rudy, J.C. Strikwerda.. A nonreflecting outflow boundary condition for subsonic Navier-Stokes calculations, J. Comput. Phys. 36 (1) (1980) 55-70] to suppress slow \"drift\" of flow variables results in a non-zero reflection coefficient for acoustic waves. Indeed, although the NSCBC formulation of boundary conditions is often called \"non-reflecting\".. the magnitude of the reflection coefficient approaches unity for low frequencies. A modification of the NSCBC boundary conditions and in particular the linear relaxation term is proposed, which should appear fully non-reflecting to plane acoustic waves with normal incidence on the boundaries for all frequencies. The new formulation is implemented and successfully validated in large eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
