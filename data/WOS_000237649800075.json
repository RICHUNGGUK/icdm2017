In this market environment, reducing the product development lead time with high quality is one of the most important key success factors to accomplish both product design and technology leadership. Product manufacturability evaluation activities in earlier design stage can contribute to the reduction of redundant and repetitive works, specifically, the number of design changes during mass production phase. To facilitate the manufacturability evaluation activities, interdepartmental collaboration processes and channels for sharing design knowledge need to be established. In this paper, we suggest a collaboration process for manufacturability evaluation using checklist devised for ubiquitous devices. Also, we have implemented a web-based collaborative DFM (Design for Manufacturability) system to share both design knowledge and evaluation results in real-time.", "paper_title": "Process-oriented DFM system for ubiquitous devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800075"}
