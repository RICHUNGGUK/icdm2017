This VD has been conceived as a building block of a software defined radio (SDR) mobile transceiver, reconfigurable on request and capable to provide agility in choosing between different standards. UNITS and GPRS Viterbi decoding is achieved by choosing different coding rates and constraint lengths, and the possibility to switch, at run time, between them guarantees a high degree of programmability. The architecture has been tested and verified with a Xilinx XC2V2000 FPGA for providing a generalized co-simulation/co-design testbed. The results show that this decoder can sustain an uncoded data rate of about 2 M bps, with an area occupancy of 46%, due to the efficient resources reuse. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
