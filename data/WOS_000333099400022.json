We get convergence rates for the prediction and estimation error and we show the ability of this estimator to recover good sparse approximation of the true model. Then, we extend this procedure to the case of an elastic net penalty. At last, we apply these results to the so-called Poisson regression model (the output is modeled as a Poisson process whose intensity relies on a linear combination of the covariables). The group lasso method enables to select few groups of meaningful variables among the set of inputs.", "paper_title": "Oracle Inequalities for a Group Lasso Procedure Applied to Generalized Linear Models in High Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000333099400022"}
