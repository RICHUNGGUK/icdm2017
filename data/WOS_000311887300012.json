The model allows a more realistic impeller induced flow image to be combined with the Monod bioreaction kinetics reported previously. The time-course of gluconic acid production by Aspergillus niger strain is simulated at kinetic conditions proposed in the literature. The simulation is based on (1) a stepwise solution strategy resolving first the fluid flow field, further imposing oxygen mass transfer and bioreaction with subsequent analysis of flow interactions, and (2) a segregated solution of the model replacing the multiple iterations per grid cell with single iterations. The numerical results are compared with experimental data for the bioreaction dynamics and show satisfactory agreement. The model is used for assessment of the viscosity effect upon the bioreactor performance. A 10-fold viscosity rise results in 2-fold decrease of K(L)a and 25% decrease of the specific gluconic acid production rate. The model allows better understanding of the mechanism of the important bioprocess.
