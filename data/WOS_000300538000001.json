This protocol can be experimentally realized with existing technology, drawing from time- and polarization-encoded systems. The protocol is error tolerant and has a maximum raw bit rate of two raw bits per detection, which when combined with state detection efficiency yields a qubit rate of up to one per transmission under ideal assumptions, or up to twice the raw bit rate of two-dimensional protocols such as the well-known BB84 protocol.", "paper_title": "PRACTICAL FOUR-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION WITHOUT ENTANGLEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000001"}
