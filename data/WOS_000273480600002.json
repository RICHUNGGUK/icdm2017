By definition, AHNEPs are deterministic. We prove that the classical complexity class NP equals the family of languages decided by AHNEPs in polynomial time. A language is in P if and only if it is decided by an AHNEP in polynomial time and space. We also show that PSPACE equals the family of languages decided by AHNEPs in polynomial length.", "paper_title": "A New Characterization of NP, P, and PSPACE with Accepting Hybrid Networks of Evolutionary Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480600002"}
