To reduce the workload, a user-friendly interface that is designed to collect multiangle facial prototypes in a fast and tractable manner was proposed. A user-friendly interface called dynamic cursor is designed to guide users in the operation of orientation-enforced video acquisition. A new problem, which is called the orientationenforced face-detection problem, is defined and solved for multiangle facial-prototype collection. The method proposed in this correspondence can help in building a fast and user-friendly face-registration module for face-related applications.", "paper_title": "On automatic collection of multiangle face prototypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438600021"}
