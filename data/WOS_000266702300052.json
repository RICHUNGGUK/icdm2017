Due to its low computation load and fast processing speed, BSE has become one of the promising methods in signal processing and analysis. This paper addresses BSE problem when a desired source signal has temporal structures. Based on the generalized autocorrelations of the desired signal and the non-Gaussianity of its innovations, we develop an objective function. Maximizing this objective function, we present a BSE algorithm and further give its stability analysis in this paper. Simulations on image data and electrocardiogram (ECG) data indicate its better performance and the better property of tolerance to the estimation error of the time delay.
