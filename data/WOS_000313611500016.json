In particular, we propose a timed specification language, which allows to model temporal features typically involved in the implementation of security protocols. We introduce a stronger version of the Dolev-Yao intruder, by allowing it to generate new timestamps which can affect the execution of a protocol sensitive to their temporal validity. We prove that this temporal extension together with the increased power of the intruder model do not affect the complexity of the protocol insecurity problem, which remains NP-complete as in the untimed case.
