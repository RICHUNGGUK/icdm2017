Furthermore, the movement of the probe coil is taken into account. Design/methodology/approach - The nonconforming mesh technique is used to handle the displacement of the probe coil. Thus, the whole problem is divided into two parts; moving part (probe coil) and fixed part (specimen with crack), and then each part meshes independently. A computer code is built under Matlab program to generate 3D nonconforming mesh, to calculate magnetic and electric potentials and to evaluate the impedance change of the coil due to the presence of the crack. Findings - The JSAEM No. 6 problem is used to test the proposed method. The calculated values of the impedance change of the probe coil due to the presence of crack, shows the efficiency of the developed software. A small difference is obtained between calculated values and measured values. Originality/value - The paper introduces the FVM in solving EC NDT problems where the probe displacement is taken into account.", "paper_title": "3D movement simulation technique in FVM method application to eddy current non destructive testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000264126000008"}
