The use of such techniques within adaptive, unstructured grid solvers is relatively recent. The combination of body-fitted functionality for some portion of the domain, together with embedded mesh or immersed body functionality for another portion of the domain offers great advantages, which are increasingly being exploited. The present paper reviews the methodology from an implementational perspective.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Embedded/Immersed unstructured grid techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000248906900003"}
