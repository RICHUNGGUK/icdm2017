In this paper, we proposed a scheme that applied the emotion classification technique for emotion recognition. The emotion classification model is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs have become an increasingly popular tool for machine learning tasks involving classification, regression or novelty detection. The Emotion Recognition System will be recognise emotion from the sentence that was inputted from the keyboard. The training set and testing set were constructed to verify the effect of this model. Experiments showed that this method could achieve better results in practice. The result showed that this method has potential in the emotion recognition field.", "paper_title": "Recognition of emotion with SVMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300087"}
