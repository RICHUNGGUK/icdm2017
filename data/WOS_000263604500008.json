Overlay networks such as peer to peer networks or virtual private networks can be regarded as a subgraph of G(Uspt). We investigate properties of G(Uspt) in different underlying topologies with regular i.i.d. link weights. In particular, we show that the overlay G(Uspt) in an Erdbs-Renyi random graph G(p) (N) is a connected G(Pc) (N) where p(c) similar to log N/N is the critical link density, an observation with potential for ad-hoc networks. Shortest paths and, thus also the overlay G(Uspt), can be controlled by link weights. By tuning the power exponent alpha of polynomial link weights in different underlying graphs, the phase transitions in the structure of G(Uspt) are shown by simulations to follow a same universal curve F-T (alpha) = Pr[G(Uspt) is a tree]. The existence of a controllable phase transition in networks may allow network operators to steer and balance flows in their network. The structure of G(Uspt) in terms of the extreme value index alpha is further examined together with its spectrum, the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix of G(Uspt).", "paper_title": "The Observable Part of a Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604500008"}
