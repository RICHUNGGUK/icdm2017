The logical centralization of network intelligence presents exciting challenges and opportunities to enhance security in such networks, including new ways to prevent, detect, and react to threats, as well as innovative security services and applications that are built upon SDN capabilities. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive survey of recent works that apply SDN to security, and identify promising future directions that can be addressed by such research.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Securing Networks Using Software Defined Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000360794600023"}
