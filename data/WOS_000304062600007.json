Security mechanisms on mobile devices are currently limited, so users need more expressive ways to ensure that downloaded mobile applications do not act maliciously. Policy-specification languages were created for this purpose; they allow the enforcement of user-defined policies on third-party applications. We have implemented LoPSiL, a location-based policy-specification language for mobile devices. This article describes LoPSiL's design and implementation, several example policies, and experiments that demonstrate LoPSiL's viability for enforcing policies on mobile devices.
