The main barrier faced was the time required to enter notes, which was addressed with data-rich templates tailored to rounding workflow, simplified login and other measures. After a 2-year transition, nearly all physician notes for hospitalized patients are now entered electronically, approximately 1500 physician notes per day. Remaining challenges include time for note entry, and the perception that notes may be more difficult to understand and to find within the EMR. In general, the transition from paper to electronic notes has been regarded as valuable to patient care and hospital operations.", "paper_title": "Transition from paper to electronic inpatient physician notes", "paper_id": "WOS:000273173800019"}
