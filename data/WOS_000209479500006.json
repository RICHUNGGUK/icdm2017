Here surveyed is Tarski's work on the decision procedure for algebra and geometry, the method of elimination of quantifiers, the semantics of formal languages, model-theoretic preservation theorems, and algebraic logic; various connections of each with computer science are taken up.", "paper_title": "TARSKI'S INFLUENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000209479500006"}
