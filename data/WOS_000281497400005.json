The design framework of the H(infinity) controller is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which integrates active rear wheel steering control, longitudinal force compensation and active yaw moment control. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the integrated chassis control system, a closed-loop driver vehicle system is used. The effectiveness of the integrated controller on handling performance improvement is tested by a vehicle without driver model under a crosswind disturbance. At the same time, both the handling and lane keeping improving performance of the closed-loop driver vehicle system is evaluated by tracking an S shape winding road. The simulation results reveal that the integrated chassis controller not only achieves preferable handling performance and stability, but also improves the vehicle lane keep ability significantly, and can alleviate the working load of the driver.
