Design/methodology/approach - The relative stability and certainty of the organizational structure are being replaced by uncertainty and complexity. Organizational learning and its reform are becoming all the more important to gain organizational competitive advantage. This paper designs the system analysis method to discuss the complexity of organizational environment, the relationship between organizational complexity and organizational structure reform, and also the coupling effect of the complexity of external environment and that of the organization. Findings - It is found that organizational learning, the ways of strategic reform, and the focal point must remain consistent under the complicated environment. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is how to construct the mathematical models describing complicated characteristics of the environment. Practical implications - The paper contains very useful advice for human resource managers. Originality/value - The paper focuses on the selection of learning patterns and strategic management of different organizational learning and the reform of organizational structure.", "paper_title": "Organizational learning and the complexity of strategic human resource management", "paper_id": "WOS:000312434000017"}
