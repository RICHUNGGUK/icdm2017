Collision detection performance can become dramatically slow, if geometric models of rigid bodies have intricate inaccessible regions close to their boundaries, particularly when bodies are in close proximity. As a result, frame rates of rigid body simulations reduce significantly in the states in which bodies come into close proximity. Thus, removing inaccessible regions from models can significantly improve rigid body simulation performance without influencing the simulation accuracy because inaccessible regions do not come in contact during collisions. This paper presents an automated pair-wise contact preserving model simplification approach based upon detection and removing of inaccessible regions of a given model with respect to another colliding model. We introduce a pose independent data-structure called part section signature to perform accessibility queries on 3D models based on a conservative approximation scheme. The developed approximation scheme is conservative and does not oversimplify but may undersimplify models, which ensures that the contact points determined using simplified and unsimplified models are exactly identical. Also, we present a greedy algorithm to reduce the number of simplified models that are needed to be stored for satisfying memory constraints in case of a simulation scene with more than two models. This paper presents test results of the developed simplification algorithm on a variety of part models. We also report results of collision detection performance tests in rigid body simulations using simplified models, which are generated using developed algorithms, and their comparison with the identical performance tests on respective unsimplified models.
