By analyzing the defects of other existing methods, and exploiting the local dependency of wavelet coefficients, an efficient statistical model is proposed. Improved variance estimation of the local wavelet coefficients can be obtained using the new model. Then we apply an approximate minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation procedure to restore the wavelet image coefficients. The modeling process is computational cost saving, and the denoising experiments show the algorithm outperforms other approaches in peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT STATISTICAL MODELING OF WAVELET COEFFICIENTS FOR IMAGE DENOISING", "paper_id": "WOS:000270696800007"}
