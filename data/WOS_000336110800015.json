Anthocyanins, the red pigments of berry skins that define the colour of wines, are good indicators of the so-called phenolic maturity of grapes. We provided an easily accessible mean to convert anthocyanins units acquired by different analytical methods. It is available as a free internet-based tool accessible from all supports, computers, tablets and smartphones. The usefulness of this software tool was illustrated by simulation of the influence of berry mass and skin mass per area on the anthocyanin content of the must. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
