This is not always the case in real applications. This paper proposes two new fuzzy DEA models constructed from the perspective of fuzzy arithmetic to deal with fuzziness in input and output data in DEA. The new fuzzy DEA models are formulated as linear programming models and can be solved to determine fuzzy efficiencies of a group of decision-making units (DMUs). An analytical fuzzy ranking approach is developed to compare and rank the fuzzy efficiencies of the DMUs. The proposed fuzzy DEA models and ranking approach are applied to evaluate the performances of eight manufacturing enterprises in China. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
