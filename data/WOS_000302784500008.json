To help address this, we created WindowScape, a zooming window manager that uses implicit grouping to help users sort windows according to task. WindowScape was intended to provide a more flexible and intuitive grouping model than prior systems. We report on the design process leading up to the system, and alternative designs we explored. We describe a series of formative evaluations that resulted in significant modifications to our initial prototype, as well as a deployment study of the final version, where users lived with WindowScape on a day-to-day basis. Our results from this study reveal how users react to novel aspects of our system, including its particular uses of miniaturization and its approach to grouping. We also discuss the impact of a task-oriented approach to window management on other aspects of user behavior, and the implications of this for future system design.", "paper_title": "WindowScape: Lessons Learned from a Task-Centric Window Manager", "paper_id": "WOS:000302784500008"}
