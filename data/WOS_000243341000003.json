Furthermore, the notion Omega(U)vertical bar X vertical bar = Sigma(p:U (p) down arrow is an element of X)2(-vertical bar p vertical bar) is studied for various sets X and universal machines U. A universal machine U is constructed such that for all x, Omega(u)vertical bar{x}vertical bar = 2(1 - H (x)). For such a universal machine there exists a co-r.e. set X such that Omega(U)vertical bar X vertical bar is neither left-r.e. nor Martin-Lof random. Furthermore, one of the open problems of Miller and Nies is answered completely by showing that there is a sequence U-n of universal machines such that the truth-table degrees of the Omega(Un) form an antichain. Finally, it is shown that the members of hyperimmune-free Turing degree of a given Pi(0)(1)-class are not low for Omega unless this class contains a recursive set. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
