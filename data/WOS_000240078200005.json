It is based on the structural theory of Petri nets and integer linear programming. Techniques that are capable of checking implementability conditions, such as complete state coding, and deriving a gate netlist to implement the specified behavior are presented. These techniques can handle Petri net specifications consisting of several thousands of transitions and provide a significant speed-up compared with techniques that have previously been proposed.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of asynchronous controllers using integer linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000240078200005"}
