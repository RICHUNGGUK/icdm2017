Embedding a large amount of secret data in a JPEG-compressed image is a challenge since modifying the quantized DCT coefficients may cause serious image distortion. we propose two main strategies to deal with this problem: (1) we embed the secret values in the middle-frequency of the quantized DCT coefficients, and (2) we limit the number of nonzero values of the quantized DCT coefficients that participate in the embedding process. We also investigated the effect of modifying the standard quantization table. The experimental results show that the proposed method can embed twice as much secret data as the irreversible embedding method of Iwata et a]. under the same number of embedded sets. The results also demonstrate how three important factors: (1) the quantization table, (2) the number of selected nonzero quantized DCT coefficients, and (3) the number of selected sets, influence the image quality and embedding capacity.", "paper_title": "Reversible steganographic method with high payload for JPEG images", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100054"}
