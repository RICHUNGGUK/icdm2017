A major issue is comparability. Standards that address the combined problem of inaccurately predicted breakpoints and repeat-induced ambiguities are missing. This decisively lowers the quality of 'consensus' callsets and hampers the removal of duplicate entries in variant databases, which can have deleterious effects in downstream analyses. Results: We introduce a sound framework for comparison of deletions that captures both toolinduced inaccuracies and repeat-induced ambiguities. We present a maximum matching algorithm that outputs virtual duplicates among two sets of predictions/annotations. We demonstrate that our approach is clearly superior over ad hoc criteria, like overlap, and that it can reduce the redundancy among callsets substantially. We also identify large amounts of duplicate entries in the Database of Genomic Variants, which points out the immediate relevance of our approach.", "paper_title": "Repeat- and error-aware comparison of deletions", "paper_id": "WOS:000361757500004"}
