Different from existing models that map keypoints between images based on a linear transformation (e.g., affine, homography), our model exploits the topological arrangement of keypoints to address the non-linear spatial transformations that are extremely common in real life situations. In particular, we propose a novel technique to elastically verify the topological spatial consistency with the triangulated graph through a \"sketch-and-match\" scheme. The spatial topology configuration, emphasizing relative positioning rather than absolute coordinates, is first sketched by a triangulated graph, whose edges essentially capture the topological layout of the corresponding keypoints. Next, the spatial consistency is efficiently estimated as the number of common edges between the triangulated graphs. Compared to the existing methods, our technique is much more effective in modeling the complex spatial transformations of non-planar and non-rigid instances, while being compatible to instances with simple linear transformations. Moreover, our method is by nature more robust in spatial verification by considering the locations, rather than the local geometry of keypoints, which are sensitive to motions and viewpoint changes. We evaluate our method extensively on three years of TRECVID datasets, as well as our own dataset MQA, showing large improvement over other methods for the task of Instance Search.", "paper_title": "Topological Spatial Verification for Instance Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000010"}
