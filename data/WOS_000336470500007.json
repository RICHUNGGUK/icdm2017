Several metrics have been suggested in the literature for this purpose. When statistically analyzing fuzzy number-valued data, L-2 metrics become especially useful. This paper introduces a new family of generalized L-2 metrics which take into account key features of the involved fuzzy numbers, namely, a measure of central location and two measures associated with the shape of the fuzzy numbers are used. A crucial property related to these three measures is that necessary and sufficient conditions can be established for them to characterize fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, the family of generalized L-2 metrics depends on one parameter. A discussion is provided regarding the interpretation of this parameter which can guide selection of its value in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
