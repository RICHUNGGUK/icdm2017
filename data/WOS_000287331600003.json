Diagonally-linked mesh NoC that uses wormhole packet switching technique implements a high-performance NoC platform to meet both cost and power consumption requirements. The proposed architecture uses an adaptive quasi-minimal routing algorithm so that it can improve average latency and saturation traffic load owing to its flexibility and adaptiveness. Based on these features, a congestion-aware routing algorithm is proposed to balance traffic load so as to alleviate congestion caused by high throughput network activities. Simulation results show that saturation load is improved dramatically for various traffic patterns. Implementation results also show that employing diagonal links is a more area-efficient method for improving network performance than using large buffers. It is shown that congestion-aware router requires negligible cost overhead but provides better throughput. Finally, simulation results also reveal that power consumption in the proposed architecture outperforms traditional mesh networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
