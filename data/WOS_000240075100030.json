The integration of local and global optical flow methods exploits fourth order PDEs rather than second order for the purpose of the improvement of smoothness and accuracy of the estimated optical flow field. Furthermore, we describe the implementation of the method in detail. The experiments show that the employment of fourth order PDEs benefits the improvement of the two aspects of the resulting optical flow field.", "paper_title": "Optical flow computation with fourth order partial differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100030"}
