We show that modelling the present value of annuities with fuzzy random variables allows quantifying their expected price and risk resulting from the uncertainty sources considered. So, we firstly describe fuzzy random variables and define some associated measures: the mathematical expectation, the variance, distribution function and quantiles. Secondly, we show several ways to estimate the discount rates to price annuities. Subsequently, the present value of life annuities is modelled with fuzzy random variables. We finally show how an actuary can quantify the price and the risk of a portfolio of annuities when their present value is given by means of fuzzy random variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
