The key idea of this parameterized limiting technique is to limit the high order numerical flux with a first order flux which preserves the MPP or positivity-preserving (PP) property. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the flux limiting approach with high order finite volume method on unstructured meshes which are often needed for solving some important problems on irregular domains. Truncation error analysis based on one-dimensional nonuniform meshes is presented to justify that the proposed MPP schemes can maintain third order accuracy in space and time. We also demonstrate through smooth test problems that the proposed third order MPP/PP WENO schemes coupled with a third order Runge-Kutta (RK) method attain the desired order of accuracy. Several test problems containing strong shocks and complex domain geometries are also presented to assess the performance of the schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
