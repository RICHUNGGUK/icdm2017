However, receiver and transmitter channel state information (CSI) is generally required, especially for the downlink channel. In this paper, MU-MIMO downlink transmission systems with statistical CSI at the transmitter are studied for jointly correlated MIMO channels. Eigen-mode space division multiple access transmission is derived based on the maximization of the ergodic sum rate, and two eigen-mode power allocation algorithms are proposed using matrix permanent and convex optimization theory. The new algorithms can overcome the limitations of the existing multi-user downlink transmission algorithm in practical applications.", "paper_title": "Multi-user MIMO downlink eigen-mode transmission over jointly correlated MIMO channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000297023300012"}
