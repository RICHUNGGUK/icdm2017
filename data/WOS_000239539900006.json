The proposed network models provide good physical insight, help understanding of complicated electromagnetic phenomena and aid explanation of methods of analysis of electromagnetic systems. Design/methodology/approach - The models consist of magnetic and electric networks coupled via sources. The analogy between the finite element method and the loop and nodal formulations of electric circuits is emphasised. The models include networks containing branches associated with element edges (edge networks) or facets (facet networks). Findings - Methods of determining mmf sources of magnetic networks from loop and branch currents in electric circuits, as well as emf sources in electric networks on the basis of the rate of change of loop and branch fluxes in electric networks, have been carefully considered. The models are general and allow creation of networks of electromagnetic systems containing non-homogenous materials and multiply-connected conducting regions. Originality/value - The presented analogies between the finite element formulation and the equivalent network models not only facilitate understanding of the methods of field analysis but also help to formulate efficient computational algorithms.", "paper_title": "Magneto-electric network models in electromagnetism", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900006"}
