The main advantage of this approach is a theoretical guarantee of global optimality. First, three core problems in multiview geometry in traditional vision are formulated as second-order cone programming feasibility problems. The extension of L-infinity-norm approach for multiview geometry from traditional vision to omnidirectional vision is shown by three models, a mirror model, a sphere model and a cylinder model. Finally, the authors assess their potential for future deployment and present directions for future research.", "paper_title": "Multiview geometry in traditional vision and omnidirectional vision under the L-infinity-norm", "paper_id": "WOS:000299324300002"}
