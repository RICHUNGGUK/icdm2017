The governing equations for the flow problem are simplified using long wavelength and low Reynold's number approximations. The solutions of the simplified problem are calculated using (i) Homotopy analysis method and (ii) Shooting method. The comparison of both the solutions shows a very good agreement between the results. The graphical results for the velocity field and stresses are presented to show the physical behaviour of all the parameters appearing in the problem.", "paper_title": "Numerical and series solutions of the peristaltic motion of an Oldroyd 8-constant fluid in an endoscope", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434200007"}
