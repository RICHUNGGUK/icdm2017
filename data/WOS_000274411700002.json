Recently, a characterization of substitution invariant 3iet words was provided. We study the opposite question: what are the morphisms fixing a 3iet word? We reveal a narrow connection of such morphisms and morphisms fixing Sturmian words using the new notion of amicability.", "paper_title": "MORPHISMS FIXING WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCHANGE OF THREE INTERVALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274411700002"}
