This paper addresses the problem of control of MR suspension with time-delay when transient dynamics are presented. An adaptive Fuzzy-Neural Network Control (FNNC) scheme for the transient course is proposed using fuzzy logic control and artificial neural network methodologies. To attenuate the adverse effects of time-delay on control performance, a Time Delay Compensator (TDC) is established. Then, through a numerical example of a quarter car model and a real road test with a bump input, the comparison is made between passive suspension and semi-active suspension. The results show that the MR vehicle with FNNC strategy can depress the peak acceleration and shorten the setting time, and the effect of time-delay can be attenuated. The results of road test with the similarity of numerical study verify the feasibility of the control strategy.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fuzzy neural network control for transient dynamics of magneto-rheological suspension with time-delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000154"}
