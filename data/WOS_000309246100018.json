Users are partially sorted by priority, to form a hierarchical user-organization. The model is used not only to control the access requests but also to simplify and improve security efficiently. The application of polynomials to the key generation algorithm simplifies problems into linear joint equations, and so enhances performance. As such, several immediate predecessors are allowed to restore the unique polynomial for determining a shared immediate successor's key using individual key, respectively. That is, immediate predecessors can have common authority over the same immediate successors at minimum parameter storage cost.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION-PROTECTED SYSTEM WITH MULTIPLE PREDECESSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100018"}
