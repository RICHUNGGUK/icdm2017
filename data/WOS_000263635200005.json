However, such a tight guarantee may require building an infrastructure for efficient resolution of queries, and the cost of maintaining this infrastructure may be prohibitive. Here we show that it is possible to implement distance-sensitive querying in an efficient way by exploiting the geometry of the network. Our querying service Glance ensures that a \"query\" operation invoked within d distance of an event intercepts the event's \"advertise\" operation within d * s distance, where s is a \"stretch-factor\" tunable by the user.
