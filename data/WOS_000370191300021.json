Many researchers have proposed clustering algorithms based on mathematical models - methods we call model-based clustering. Clustering techniques are very useful for determining data structures, but model-based clustering is difficult to use for analyzing data correctly because we cannot select a suitable method unless we know the data structure at least partially. The new clustering algorithm we propose introduces soft computing techniques such as fuzzy reasoning in what we call linguistic-based clustering, whose features are not incident to the data structure. We verify the method's effectiveness through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On Hierarchical Linguistic-Based Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000370191300021"}
