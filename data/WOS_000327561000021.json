This paper first introduces a new manifold learning based subspace learning algorithm, discriminative locality alignment (DLA), to SHCCR. Afterward, we propose the kernel version of DLA, kernel discriminative locality alignment (KDLA), and carefully prove that learning KDLA is equal to conducting kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) followed by DLA. This theoretical investigation can be utilized to better understand KDLA, i.e., the subspace spanned by KDLA is essentially the subspace spanned by DLA on the principal components of KPCA. Experimental results demonstrate that DLA and KDLA are more effective than representative discriminative information extraction algorithms in terms of recognition accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
