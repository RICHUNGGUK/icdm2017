The key considerations for developing the methodology are the preservation of the positive definiteness of the conformation tensor via the log-conformation representation and additional diffusion, from second-order upwind scheme, to smooth the high-frequency modes. The combination of the log-conformation representation, finite element method, and an operator-splitting Lie's scheme, gives us a robust and easy-to-implement scheme. We have obtained convergent results when simulating time-dependent cavity flows.
