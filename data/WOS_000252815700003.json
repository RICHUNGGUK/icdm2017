The method is based on the linearization of the discretized nonlinear equations. The convective fluxes are discretized using an O (Delta x(H)(3)) MUSCL scheme with van Leer flux-vector-splitting. Unsteady perturbations of the turbulent stresses are linearized using a frozen-turbulence-Reynolds-number hypothesis, to approximate eddy-viscosity perturbations. The resulting linear system is solved using a pseudo-time-marching implicit ADI-AF (alternating-directions-implicit approximate-factorization) procedure with local pseudo-time-steps, corresponding to a matrix-successive-underrelaxation procedure. The stability issues associated with the pseudo-time-marching solution of the time-linearized Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. Comparison of computations with measurements and with time-nonlinear computations for 3-D shock-wave oscillation in a square duct, for various back-pressure fluctuation frequencies (180, 80, 20 and 10 Hz), assesses the shock-capturing capability of the time-linearized scheme.
