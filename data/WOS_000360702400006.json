A classical result in the study of tiling problems is a theorem of McMullen [Mathematika 27(1):113-121, 1980] that a convex polytope P that 1-tiles with a discrete multiset can, in fact, 1-tile with a lattice . A generalization of McMullen's theorem for k-tiling was conjectured by Gravin et al. [Combinatorica 32(6):629-649, 2012], which states that if P k-tiles with a discrete multiset , then P m-tiles with a lattice for some m. In this paper, we consider the case when P k-tiles with a discrete multiset such that every element of is contained in a quasi-periodic set (i.e., a finite union of translated lattices). This is motivated by the result of Gravin et al. [Discrete Comput Geom 50(4):1033-1050, 2013] and Kolountzakis [Discrete Comput Geom 23(4):537-553, 2000], showing that for , if a polytope P k-tiles with a discrete multiset , then P m-tiles with a quasi-periodic set for some m. Here we show for all values of d that if a polytope P k-tiles with a discrete multiset that is contained in a quasi-periodic set that satisfies a mild hypothesis, then P m-tiles with a lattice for some m. This strengthens the results of Gravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, and is a step in the direction of proving the conjecture of Gravin et al.
