In encrypted databases, encryption schemes revealing some information are often used in order to manipulate encrypted data efficiently. The proposed criterion is based on inference analysis for databases: We simulate attacker's inference on specified secret information with and without the revealed information from the encrypted database. When the two inference results are the same, then secrecy of the specified information is preserved against outsourcing the encrypted database. We also show that the proposed criterion is decidable under a practical setting.", "paper_title": "A Secrecy Criterion for Outsourcing Encrypted Databases Based on Inference Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000359001600006"}
