By using the algebraic property of fuzzy membership functions, a novel nonparallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) control scheme is proposed based on a new class of fuzzy Lyapunov functions. Thus, relaxed stabilization conditions for the underlying closed-loop fuzzy system are developed by applying a new slack variable technique. In particular, some existing fuzzy Lyapunov functions and non-PDC control schemes are special cases of the new Lyapunov function and fuzzy control scheme, respectively. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Control Synthesis of Discrete-Time T-S Fuzzy Systems Based on a Novel Non-PDC Control Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000314724900010"}
