This problem has important applications in e.g. spatial and temporal databases, and is dual to the important and well-studied orthogonal range searching problem. Surprisingly, despite the fact that the problem can be solved optimally in internal memory with linear space and O(log N+K) query time, we show that one cannot construct a linear sized external memory point enclosure data structure that can be used to answer a query in O(log (B) N+K/B) I/Os, where B is the disk block size. To obtain this bound, Omega(N/B (1-epsilon) ) disk blocks are needed for some constant epsilon > 0. With linear space, the best obtainable query bound is O(log (2) N+K/B) if a linear output term O(K/B) is desired. To show this we prove a general lower bound on the tradeoff between the size of the data structure and its query cost. We also develop a family of structures with matching space and query bounds.", "paper_title": "Optimal External Memory Planar Point Enclosure", "paper_id": "WOS:000265685600003"}
