Double bases representation of n is proposed to speed up scalar multiplication. Avanzi et al. presented a recoding algorithm for Koblitz curves which works in all cases with optimal constants [1]. However, their algorithm may be expensive to implement because it requires many divisions in []. In this paper, we show that divisions in [] can be replaced by divisions in . Our improved version of the algorithm runs in about 33% of the time of the Avanzi et al. algorithm on the Koblitz curve K-163, with larger improvements as the size of the curve increases.", "paper_title": "Speeding Up the Double-Base Recoding Algorithm of Scalar Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000269808600003"}
