Some novel delay-independent criteria are obtained by using contraction mapping theorem and comparison principle. The present results improve and extend those in many publications, and shows that under some delay-independent criteria, the CGNNs may admit a periodic solution, which is globally exponential stable via impulsive controller even if it is originally unstable or divergent. Two examples with numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Existence and exponential stability of periodic solution of delayed Cohen-Grossberg neural networks via impulsive control", "paper_id": "WOS:000358327400008"}
