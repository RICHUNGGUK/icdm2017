An arriving customer takes a primary space, if one is available. We define the traffic intensity rho to be lambda/mu where lambda is the customers' arrival rate and mu is the service rate of the processor. We study the joint probability distribution of the numbers of occupied primary and secondary spaces. For 0 <rho < 1, we obtain the exact solutions for m=1 and m=2. For arbitrary m we study the problem in the asymptotic limit rho a dagger 1 with m fixed. We also give the tail of the distribution for a fixed rho < 1 and any m.", "paper_title": "Storage allocation under processor sharing I: exact solutions and asymptotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000276665400001"}
