Using a modeless gestural interface, it lets users make dynamic illustrations by associating handwritten mathematics with free-form drawings and provides a set of tools for graphing and evaluating mathematical expressions and solving equations. In this paper, we present the results of an initial evaluation of the MathPad(2) prototype, examining the user interface's intuitiveness and the application's perceived usefulness. Our evaluations are based on both performance and questionnaire results including first attempt gesture performance, interface recall tests, and surveys of user interface satisfaction and perceived usefulness. The results of our evaluation suggest that, although some test subjects had difficulty with our mathematical expression recognizer, they found the interface, in general, intuitive and easy to remember. More importantly, these results suggest the prototype has the potential to assist beginning physics and mathematics students in problem solving and understanding scientific concepts.
