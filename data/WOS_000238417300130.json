ICENI has prototyped many novel ideas for providing an end to end Grid middleware. This has included: service-oriented architecture, component programming model, retaining and using meta-data collected throughout the life-cycle of an application, and scheduling algorithms which are aware of workflow and performance data. In this paper we describe the workflow pipeline and deployment process of ICENI II. This allows the user to specify their workflow at an abstract level which is fed through the pipeline in order to successfully deploy it over the Grid. The tool sets, which make up the stages of the ICENI II pipeline, are designed to be composable in an a-la-carte fashion. Thus allowing Grid developers to select only those components which are relevant for their work. When these tool sets are composed together they form the higher level services required to make the Grid useful to the end user.", "paper_title": "Workflow deployment in ICENI II", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300130"}
