In this paper, a spectral correlation based detection method for spectrum sensing is proposed to increase the spectrum efficiency in wireless sensor network. The signal of interests is modeled as a cyclostationary random process, therefore, the spectral correlation function could be used, and a squared coherence function is used as the decision criterion. Simulations are made based on the 4-FSK signal. The results verify that the proposed method outperforms the conventional energy detection.", "paper_title": "Spectrum sensing method for increasing the spectrum efficiency in wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100036"}
