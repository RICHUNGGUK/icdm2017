Particular types of routing protocols are known as bioinspired. This work presents a parallelization of AntOR-DNR, a bioinspired routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. This new protocol, called PantOR-MI, uses, as well as PAntOR, the thread programming based on shared memory. This new parallelization is applied in route discovery phases, route local repair process, and link failure notification. The simulation results indicate that PAntOR and PAntOR-MI improve performances of AntOR, whilst it is also noticed that PAntOR-MI is the most suitable for highly dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "Multiple Interface Parallel Approach of Bioinspired Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311155800001"}
