In this paper, we analyze the performance of SC-FDE over UWB communications with channel estimation error. The probability density functions of the frequency domain minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizer taps are derived in closed form. The error probabilities of single carrier block transmission with frequency domain MMSE equalization under imperfect channel estimation are presented and evaluated numerically. Compared with the simulation results, our semi-analytical analysis yields fairly accurate bit error rate performance, thus validating the use of the Gaussian approximation method in the performance analysis of the SC-FDE system with channel estimation error.", "paper_title": "Performance of SC-FDE system in UWB communications with imperfect channel estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252357900016"}
