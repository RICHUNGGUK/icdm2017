In this paper we investigate a brain-inspired spatial pooling algorithm that produces sparse distributed representations of spatial images by modelling the formation of proximal dendrites associated with neocortical minicolumns. In this approach, distributed representations are formed out of a competitive process of inter-column inhibition and subsequent learning. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed binary spatial pooling algorithm on a well-known benchmark of greyscale natural images. In the process, we augment the algorithm to handle greyscale images, and to produce better quality encodings of binary images. We also show that the augmented algorithm produces superior population and lifetime kurtosis measures in comparison to a number of well-known coding schemes and explain how the augmented coding scheme can be used to produce high-fidelity reconstructions of greyscale input.", "paper_title": "Spatial pooling for greyscale images", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204100004"}
