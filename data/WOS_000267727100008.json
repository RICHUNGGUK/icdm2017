This method could give many kinds of exact solutions including soliton solutions expressed by hyperbolic functions, periodic solutions expressed by trigonometric functions and rational solutions in a uniform way if solutions of these kinds exist. In this paper, we also give a generalization of the method to determine the degree of DDEs, and compared with the creativity work of D. Baldwin et al. [D. Baldwin, U. Goktas, W. Hereman, Comput.
