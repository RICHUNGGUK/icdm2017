The calculations indicate that the (eta(1)-allyl)(eta(3)-allyl) Pd(PH3) complex is responsible for the formation of ortho-dearomatized product. Moreover it is easy to produce the ortho-dearomatized product when reductive elimination starts from (eta(3)-allylnaphthalene)(eta(1)-allyl) Pd complex 7, while it is easy to form the para-dearomatized product when reductive elimination starts from (eta(3)-allylnaphthalene)(eta(1)-allyl) Pd complex 9. The Stille coupling products can't be produced due to high reaction energy barrier.", "paper_title": "DFT studies on the palladium-catalyzed dearomatization reaction between naphthalene allyl chloride and allyltributylstannane", "paper_id": "WOS:000362411800011"}
