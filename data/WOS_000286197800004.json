This paper presents the optimizations of a space-based reconfigurable sensor network under hard constraints by employing an efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). First, a system model is proposed for cluster-based space wireless sensor networks. Second, the statement of multi-objective optimization problems is mathematically formulated under hard constraints. Third, the MOEA is used to find multi-criteria solutions in the sense of Pareto optimality. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of applying the MOEA to the multi-objective evolutionary optimizations of a space-based reconfigurable sensor network under hard constraints.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective evolutionary optimizations of a space-based reconfigurable sensor network under hard constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000286197800004"}
