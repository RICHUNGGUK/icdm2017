Easy fabrication of 3D structures offers a comfortable way for the miniaturization of passive components, since their small dimensions are required in RF applications. A novel design of multilayer inductor is presented and its characteristics compared to the planar structure with same geometrical parameters. It is shown that 3D structure displays better behaviour in the frequency range of interest. Also, fabrication steps of the LTCC technological process are presented on the example of the projected inductor.", "paper_title": "Application of the LTCC Technology for the Fabrication of the RF 3D Inductor", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536600009"}
