In order to provide a unified metamodel and powerful framework for trajectory's services and queries, the proposed trajectory's data model has benefited from advantages of both conceptual and ontological space-time. However, it extends the basic data model of trajectory with new patterns as the space-time path to describe activities of the moving object and the composite region of interest. Additionally, the proposed system is distinguished by providing a framework for dealing with moving-object trajectory in an interoperable way, using heterogonous sensors that traditional data model incapable for this purpose. The proposed system architecture for the moving-object trajectory's data model is focused on service composability and data interoperability combining Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, Service-Oriented Architecture, and streaming technology, to allow applications built using the framework to be scalable and have better performance. The case study presented for tracking travelers at the airport means that passenger locations can be determined with a higher degree of accuracy and precision. Indeed, this system makes it easy to answer complex queries, such as seeing closely where passengers congregate, how much time they spend in stores and restaurants, and where there may be bottlenecks. It will also enable airport retailers to communicate with travelers directly.", "paper_title": "A System Architecture for Heterogeneous Moving-Object Trajectory Metamodel Using Generic Sensors: Tracking Airport Security Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000351075000029"}
