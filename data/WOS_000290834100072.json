Its core, proper discretization of weighted smoothness functional, is detailed, options of particular implementation are discussed and demonstrated on general convex polygonal cells in two dimensions. Possible applications of this algorithm are suggested, namely solution-sensitive mesh adaptation (respecting the variation of some variable) and prevention of unwanted smoothing effects on polar meshes.
