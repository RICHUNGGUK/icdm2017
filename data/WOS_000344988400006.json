However, one of the most challenging issues for a multihop cellular network is the need for proximate device discovery that enables the discovery of the network topology and the direct communications between proximate devices. This article first reviews the device discovery techniques used in most wireless ad hoc communication systems. We then address the unique issues of device discovery in a cellular network and potential solutions. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various discovery schemes. Finally, we present a discovery scheme in an LTE cellular network as a practical example to illustrate the design principles of device discovery under a unified cellular network-centric architecture.", "paper_title": "DEVICE DISCOVERY FOR MULTIHOP CELLULAR NETWORKS WITH ITS APPLICATION IN LTE", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988400006"}
