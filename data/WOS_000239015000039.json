Novelty detection is an essential property for developmental robots. A topology of a visual scan path of an input scene and an energy signature for the corresponding visual scan path are obtained and considered when deciding on a novelty occurrence in an input scene. The visual scan path is generated by a low-level top-down attention model in conjunction with a bottom-up saliency map model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
