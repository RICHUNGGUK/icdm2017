However, credible interaction issues between mobile users are still the hard problems in the past. In this paper, we focus on how to assign the crowdsourcing sensing tasks based on the credible interaction between users. First, a novel credible crowdsourcing assignment model is proposed based on social relationship cognition and community detection. Second, the service quality factor (SQF), link reliability factor (LRF), and region heat factor (RHF) are introduced to scientifically evaluate the user crowdsourcing preferences. Then, a crowdsourcing algorithm based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) theory is proposed. Finally, the simulation experiments prove the correctness, effectiveness, and robustness of our method.", "paper_title": "A Crowdsourcing Assignment Model Based on Mobile Crowd Sensing in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098700002"}
