We show that static power consumption is a significant fraction of the overall power consumption in an FPGA and that it does not change significantly even as the area required by an architecture increases, because of the dominance of interconnect in an FPGA. We show that the degree of DLP can be used in conjunction with frequency scaling to reduce the overall power consumption.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Data-Level Parallelism For Energy-Efficient Implementation of LDPC Decoders and DCT on an FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337900007"}
