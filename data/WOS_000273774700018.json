Some delay faults, including irredundant faults, may be undetectable under the conventional detection conditions. These faults may be detectable under the hazard-based detection conditions. The use of hazard-based detection conditions thus improves the delay fault coverage achievable for a circuit. We consider transition faults under standard scan for the study in this paper.", "paper_title": "Hazard-Based Detection Conditions for Improved Transition Fault Coverage of Scan-Based Tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000273774700018"}
