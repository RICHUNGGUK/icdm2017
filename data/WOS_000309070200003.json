However, a high degree of realism in the reconstruction of a CH site can be misleading insofar as it can be seen to imply a high degree of certainty about the displayed scenewhich is frequently not the case, especially when investigating the past. So far, little effort has gone into adapting and formulating a Predictive Rendering pipeline for CH research applications. In this paper, we first discuss the goals and the workflow of CH reconstructions in general, as well as those of traditional Predictive Rendering. Based on this, we then propose a research framework for CH research, which we refer to as Cultural Heritage Predictive Rendering (CHPR). This is an extension to Predictive Rendering that introduces a temporal component and addresses uncertainty that is important for the scenes historical interpretation. To demonstrate these concepts, two example case studies are detailed.", "paper_title": "Cultural Heritage Predictive Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000309070200003"}
