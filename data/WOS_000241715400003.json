During the last few years, the use of outsourcing has resulted in an increase in the volume of literature devoted to it. We decided therefore to analyse the literature with the aim of identifying the main topics, the methodologies most often applied and the authors and countries that have contributed most to the area of IS outsourcing. We also intended to offer suggestions on improving research in this field. The paper thus provides a review of articles about IS outsourcing published in the most prestigious journals of the IS area and journals of Management or Business. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
