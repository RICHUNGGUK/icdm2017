So far, concepts of stability and stability in mean for uncertain differential equations have been proposed. This paper aims at providing a concept of almost sure stability for uncertain differential equation. A sufficient condition is given for an uncertain differential equation being almost surely stable, and some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the sufficient condition.", "paper_title": "Almost sure stability for uncertain differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344778500006"}
