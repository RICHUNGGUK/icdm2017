A virtual environment allowing gymnasts to get introduced to viewing techniques safely is presented. The system is based on existing simulation models and visualisation software, and is implemented using client-server technology to allow reuse with new simulation models in the future.", "paper_title": "A virtual environment for learning to view during aerial movements", "paper_id": "WOS:000306745900003"}
