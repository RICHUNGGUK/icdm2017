Due to these disturbances, the operational strategies comprising objectives and constraints are regularly adjusted to reflect a change in the environment in order to achieve or maintain optimal process performance. The related operational objectives need not only be of an economical nature, but can also include flexibility, risk or ecological objectives. In this paper, a novel methodology is presented for the modeling and dynamic predictive scheduling of operational strategies for continuous processes. Optimal control actions are computed on a moving horizon employing discrete-continuous modeling and mixed-logic dynamic optimization as introduced by Oldenburg et al. (2003). The approach is successfully demonstrated considering the operation of a wastewater treatment plant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
