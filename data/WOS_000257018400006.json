Consider a faulty k-ary n-cube Q(n)(k) in which the number of node faults f(v) and the number of link faults f(e) are such that f(v) + f(e) <= 2n - 2. We prove that given any two healthy nodes s and e of Q(n)(k), there is a path from s to e of length at least k(n) - 2f(v) - 1 (respectively, k(n) - 2f(v) - 2) if the nodes s and e have different (respectively, the same) parities (the parity of a node in Q(n)(k) is the sum modulo 2 of the elements in the n-tuple over {0, 1,...,k - 1} representing the node). Our result is optimal in the sense that there are pairs of nodes and fault configurations for which these bounds cannot be improved, and it answers questions recently posed by Yang et al. [22] and by Fu [11]. Furthermore, we extend known results, obtained by Kim and Park [15], for the case when n = 2.", "paper_title": "Embedding long paths in k-ary n-cubes with faulty nodes and links", "paper_id": "WOS:000257018400006"}
