Swarm optimization is a new artificial intelligence field, which has been proved suitable to solve various combinatorial optimization problems. Compaxed with general optimization problems, energy minimization of early vision has its unique characteristics, such as higher dimensions, more complicate structure of solution space, and dynamic constrain conditions. In this paper, the vision energy functions are optimized by repeatedly minimizing a certain number of sub-problems according to divide-and-conquer principle, and each colony is allocated to optimize one sub-problem independently. Then an appropriate information exchange strategy between neighboring colonies, and an adaptive method for dynamic problem are applied to implement global optimization. As a typical example, stereo correspondence will be solved using the proposed swarm optimization model. Experiments show this method can achieve good results.", "paper_title": "Swarm optimization model for energy minimization problem of early vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100123"}
