In these protocols, fixed periodic neighbor discovery and schedule updating are used to connect and synchronize neighbors to provide successful data transmission; however, they cannot adapt to mobile speed variation and degrade the network performance dramatically. In this paper, we propose a mobile-supporting mechanism for MAC protocols, in which the decision to update the neighbors of a mobile node is made adaptively according to the mobile speed. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism efficiently avoids the disconnection of amobile node fromits neighbors and achieves a better performance as compared with fixed periodic neighbor discovery.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Mobility-Supporting MAC Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000354470900013"}
