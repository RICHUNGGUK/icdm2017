This self-reconfigurable adaptive FIR filter is responsible for providing the best solution for realization and autonomous adaptation of FIR filters, and processes the optimal digital signal processing algorithms, which are the low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filter algorithms with various frequencies, for noise removal operations. The proposed stand-alone self-reconfigurable system using Xilinx Virtex4 FPGA and Compact-Flash memory shows the improvement of configuration time and flexibility by using the dynamic partial reconfiguration techniques.", "paper_title": "A self-reconfigurable adaptive FIR filter system on partial reconfiguration platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020000005"}
