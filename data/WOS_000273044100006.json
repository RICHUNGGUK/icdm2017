The STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology allows the use of devices with different threshold voltages, namely: high threshold voltage (HVT), standard threshold voltage (SVT) and low threshold voltage (LVT). Three types of flip-flops of equal input load: 'fast', 'standard' and 'slow' are used. Timing parameters of the flip-flops are adjusted by manipulating the switching threshold of the clock port of the flip-flops. A fast/slow flip-flops has a shorter/longer T(DQ) delay, compared with a standard flip-flops for the same setup time (T(DCLK)). Distributing flip-flops according to their delay requirements would reduce the effect of the clock's skew on the outputs of sequentially adjacent flip-flops. Owing to the slow rise time of the sinusoidal clock signal used in energy recovery clock distribution networks compared to the conventional square-wave clock, the skew that can be compensated for in energy recovery clock distribution networks using this approach would be much higher than in square-wave clock distribution networks. This approach increases the skew bounds required by algorithms to balance the skew in the clock tree leading to reduced design complexity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results using STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology at a clock frequency of 500 MHz show that this approach is feasible and effective where a skew of up to 6.2% of the clock period can be compensated for in the example used. In addition, constructing clock trees using the skew slack provided in the proposed technique in a new modified differed merge embedding (DME) algorithm on five benchmarks have shown that the proposed technique enables an average reduction of 11.5% in total wire length and 53.2% reduction in the number of wire elongations. Balancing the skew in the clock tree using buffers was not considered here since inserting a buffer in the clock's path eliminates the energy recovery property. As an example of illustrating the proposed methodology, the authors have used the Elmore delay model with a selected energy recovery flip-flops to verify the practicality of the proposed scheme. Better results can be obtained by using different flip-flops. The method can generally be applied to energy recovery or square-wave clocking if different flip-flops of various speeds are used.", "paper_title": "Skew compensation in energy recovery clock distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273044100006"}
