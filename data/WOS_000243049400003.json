A novel algorithm is presented for the extraction of this kind of patterns from a melody music object. The proposed algorithm discovers all maximum-length repeating patterns using an \"aggressive\" accession during searching, by avoiding costly repetition frequency calculation and by examining as few as possible repeating patterns in order to reach the maximum-length repeating pattern(s). Detailed experimental results illustrate the significant performance gains due to the proposed algorithm, compared to an existing baseline algorithm.", "paper_title": "Finding maximum-length repeating patterns in music databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000243049400003"}
