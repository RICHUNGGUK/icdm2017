To overcome the definitional challenges inherent in privacy research, the dictionary was informed by an inclusive set of relevant theoretical perspectives. Using methods from corpus linguistics, we constructed and validated eight dictionary categories on empirical material from a wide range of privacy-sensitive contexts. It was shown that the dictionary categories are able to measure unique linguistic patterns within privacy discussions. At a time when privacy considerations are increasing and online resources provide ever-growing quantities of textual data, the privacy dictionary can play a significant role not only for research in the social sciences but also in technology design and policymaking.", "paper_title": "Privacy Dictionary: A New Resource for the Automated Content Analysis of Privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000296453900002"}
