The fluid inside a vertical cylindrical container of radius R and height 2H is water characterized by the kinematic viscosity nu and thermal diffusivity kappa. Initially, its density (temperature) varies linearly with height and is characterized by a constant buoyancy frequency N, which is proportional to the density gradient. The system undergoes an abrupt change in the rotation rate from its initial value Omega(i), when the fluid is in a solid-body rotation state, to the final value Omega(f). The aim of this contribution is to show the formation of columnar vortices in a high Rossby number spin-up flow.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional vortex visualization in stratified spin-up", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500002"}
