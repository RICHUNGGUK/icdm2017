We call it D2LP, short for Drag and Drop by Laser Pointer, where a specially designed laser pointer uPen is a handheld interactive device for users. By D2LP, large displays driven by different computers can be made as one seamless integrated uniform system. With a uPen in hand users can directly point and draw on the surface of displays, drag and drop digital objects among multiple displays continuously and smoothly. Report on evaluation experiments shows that D2LP can effectively support the freely interacting with multiple wall-sized displays and it is preferred over the conventional mouse-driven cursor based system for the application in smart spaces with rich information displays.", "paper_title": "Drag and Drop by Laser Pointer: Seamless interaction with multiple large displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600002"}
