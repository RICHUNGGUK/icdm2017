As a main application, we give fast algorithms for many operations involving triangular sets (over a finite field), such as modular multiplication, inversion, or change of order. For the first time, we are able to exhibit running times for these operations that are almost linear, without any overhead exponential in the number of variables. As a further application, we show that, from the complexity viewpoint, Charlap, Coley, and Robbins' approach to elliptic curve point counting can be competitive with the better known approach due to Elkies.", "paper_title": "Modular Composition Modulo Triangular Sets and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000323344700001"}
