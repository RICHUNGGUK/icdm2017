To guide anisotropic and dynamic mesh adaptation, a posteriori error estimators based on solving local problems arc: established. These error estimators are efficient to compute and effective to capture local phenomena, and they apply to all the four primal DG schemes, namely, symmetric interior penalty Galerkin, nonsymmetric interior penalty Galerkin, incomplete interior penalty Galerkin, and the Oden-Babuska-Baumann version of DG. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed error estimators.", "paper_title": "Local problem-based a posteriori error estimators for discontinuous Galerkin approximations of reactive transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000247531800001"}
