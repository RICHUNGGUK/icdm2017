However, the communication overhead caused by slow interconnections becomes a major performance bottleneck. In this paper, as a way to remove the bottleneck, we propose the 'kernel-split method' and the 'host-buffer method' which overlap computation and communication for the FDTD simulation on the CPU cluster. The host-buffer method in particular enables overlapping without any modifications to the update-kernels that are already in use. We also present theoretical formulas to predict the overlap threshold and the total throughput for each method. By using our overlap methods with 6 CPU nodes, we demonstrate that the total performance of 3D FDTD reaches 92% of a six-fold increase, which is the upper limit that would be reached if there were no communication overhead.
