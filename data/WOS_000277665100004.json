Both cause time and energy waste in query processing in sensor networks. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive holistic scheduler, AHS, to run on each node in a wireless sensor network. AHS schedules both the query evaluation and the wireless communication operations, and is able to adapt the schedule to the runtime dynamics of these operations on each node. We have implemented AHS and tested it on real motes as well as in simulation. Our results show that AHS improves the performance of query processing in various dynamic settings.
