This article is an in depth study on the interaction of code reordering (a long-known technique) and cache configuration (a relatively new technique). Experimental results show that code reordering coupled with cache configuration reveals additional energy savings as high as 10-15% for several benchmarks with reduced cache area as high as 48%. To exploit these additional benefits, we architect and evaluate several design exploration heuristics for combining these two methods.", "paper_title": "Combining Code Reordering and Cache Configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000313395700019"}
