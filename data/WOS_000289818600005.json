The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
