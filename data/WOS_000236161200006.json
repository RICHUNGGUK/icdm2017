This algorithm was proposed in 1987, one year after Fred Glover's article that launched tabu search. While more performing local search algorithms have now been proposed, Tabucol remains very popular and is often chosen as a subroutine in hybrid algorithms that combine a local search with a population based method. In order to explain this unfailing success, we make a thorough survey of local search techniques for graph coloring problems, and we point out the main differences between all these techniques.
