We give improved lower bounds for the size (the number of AND/OR/NOT) of negation-limited circuits computing Parity and for the size of negation-limited inverters. An inverter is a circuit with inputs x(1),..., x(n) and outputs (sic)x(1),..., (sic)x(n). We show that: (a) for n = 2(r) - 1, circuits computing Parity with r - 1 NOT gates have size at least 6n - log(2)(n + 1) - O(1), and (b) for n = 2(r) - 1, inverters with r NOT gates have size at least 8n - log(2)(n + 1) - O(1). We derive our bounds above by considering the minimum size of a circuit with at most r NOT gates that computes Parity for sorted inputs x(1) >= ... >= x(n). For an arbitrary r, we completely determine the minimum size. It is 2n - r - 2 for odd n and 2n - r - 1 for even n for inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(n+ 1)inverted left perpendicular - 1 <= r <= n/2, and it is left perpendicular3n/2right perpendicular - 1 for r >= n/2. We also determine the minimum size of an inverter for sorted inputs with at most r NOT gates. It is 4n - 3r for inverted right perpendicularlog(2)(n+ 1)inverted left perpendicular <= r <= n. In particular, the negation-limited inverter for sorted inputs due to Fischer, which is a core component in all the known constructions of negation-limited inverters, is shown to have the minimum possible size. Our fairly simple lower bound proofs use gate elimination arguments in a somewhat novel way.", "paper_title": "Negation-Limited Complexity of Parity and Inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000265439600007"}
