The converged signal, consisting of the 10 Gbit/s 16-QAM baseband optical signal and two optical local oscillators (OLOs), is generated by central station and can be decomposed in different patterns at remote base station. For the wired PON access, the identical frequency OLO is used to coherently demodulate the 16-QAM signal; while for the RoF-based wireless access, the 16-QAM signal and its parallel polarized OLO are abstracted as optical millimeter wave by a polarization beam splitter; the other OLO is used as the uplink optical carrier to carry wired or wireless uplink signal. Since the three tones come from the same source, they maintain high coherency even after transmitted over fiber link. The proposed hybrid wired/wireless full-duplex fiber link suffers little from fiber chromatic dispersion. These are verified by simulations for both wired and wireless access applications.", "paper_title": "Full-duplex hybrid PON/RoF link with the 10 Gbit/s 16-QAM signal for alternative wired and 60 GHz millimeter-wave wireless accesses", "paper_id": "WOS:000330384500003"}
