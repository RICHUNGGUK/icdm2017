Given a set of small molecules-for example, those known to bind a particular protein-computationally decomposing them into chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional properties, and may be useful for designing novel compounds with similar properties. Here we introduce molBLOCKS, a suite of programs for breaking down sets of small molecules into fragments according to a predefined set of chemical rules, clustering the resulting fragments, and uncovering statistically enriched fragments. Among other applications, our software should be a great aid in large-scale chemical analysis of ligands binding specific targets of interest.", "paper_title": "molBLOCKS: decomposing small molecule sets and uncovering enriched fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000339814300022"}
