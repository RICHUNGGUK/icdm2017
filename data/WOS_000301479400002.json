This paper proposes two consensus models with linguistic information to support the GDM consensus reaching process. Two different distance functions between linguistic preference relations are introduced to measure both individual consistency and group consensus. Based on these measures, the consensus reaching models are developed. The two models presented have the same concept that the expert whose preference is farthest from the group preference needs to update their opinion according to the group preference relation. In addition, the convergence of the models is proved. After achieving the predefined consensus level, each expert's consistency indexes are still acceptable under the condition that the initial preference relations are of satisfactory consistency. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the models and to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Consensus reaching models of linguistic preference relations based on distance functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000301479400002"}
