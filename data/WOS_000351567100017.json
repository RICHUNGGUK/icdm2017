The essential characteristics of an amplifier, such as gain, linearity, power consumption, noise, etc., are analyzed. In measurement, the proposed dynamic amplifier achieves a 13 dB gain with less than 1 dB drop over a differential output signal swing of 340 mV(pp) with a supply voltage of 0.5 V. The attained maximum operating frequency is 700 MHz. With a 0.7 V supply, the gain increases to 16 dB with a signal swing of 700 mV(pp). The prototype amplifier is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology with the low threshold voltage and the deep N-well options.", "paper_title": "An Ultra-Low-Voltage, Wide Signal Swing, and Clock-Scalable Dynamic Amplifier Using a Common-Mode Detection Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100017"}
