Each commodity flow is constrained to run through a single path along the network. The objective is to minimize the sum of capacity installation and routing costs. We present an exact algorithm and four new heuristics. The first heuristic generates an initial feasible solution, then it improves it until a necessary condition for optimality is satisfied. Two heuristics are partial enumeration methods and the last one iteratively applies a tabu search method to different initial feasible solutions. Computational results over a set of test problems from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the non-bifurcated network design problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265020500004"}
