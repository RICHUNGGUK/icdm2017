Sufficient conditions for the local and global asymptotic stabilization in probability are presented by means of Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities. As corollaries, some previous results are improved. For a class of nonlinear stochastic perturbed systems, the output feedback stabilization problem is also considered. One example is given to show the validity of our main results.", "paper_title": "FEEDBACK STABILIZATION FOR NONLINEAR AFFINE STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500019"}
