In the literature it is possible to find different types of data fusion and information fusion techniques in use today, but it is still a challenge to obtain systems that allow the automation or semiautomation of information processing and fusion. In this paper, we present a multiagent system that based on the organizational theory proposes a new model to automatically process and fuse information in heterogeneous distributed sensor networks. The proposed architecture is applied to a case study for indoor location where information is taken from different heterogeneous sensors.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Architecture for Information Fusion in Distributed Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000354298000001"}
