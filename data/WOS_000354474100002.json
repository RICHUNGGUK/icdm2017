Our decision procedures are parametric in the theories of indexes and elements and orthogonal with respect to known results. We show that transitive closures ('acceleration') of relation expressing certain array updates produce formulas inside our fragment; this observation will be used to identify a class of programs handling arrays having decidable reachability problem.", "paper_title": "Decision Procedures for Flat Array Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000354474100002"}
