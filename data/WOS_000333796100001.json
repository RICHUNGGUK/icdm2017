In this paper, a new and simple optimization algorithm is presented to solve weight optimization of truss structures with continuous variables. The Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) is an algorithm based on one-dimensional collisions between two bodies, where each agent solution is modeled as the body. After a collision of two moving bodies, having specified masses and velocities, these are separated and moved to new positions with new velocities. This process is repeated until a termination criterion is satisfied and the optimum CB is found. Comparison of the results of the CBO with those of some previous studies, demonstrate its capability in solving the present optimization problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
