An iterative receiver design for LDPC coded MIMO-OFDM system is proposed as the foundation for enhancing the wireless link performance can deliver the coverage, speed, throughput and reliability. However, in previous works, evaluations are basically assumed for a certain channel scenario and it is inefficient in incorporating different channel scenarios. The aim of this paper is to improve the system range for equivalent error rate, while not significantly increasing system complexity compared to conventional iterative receiver solution under realistic channel environment. We show that our proposed iteration adaptation at receiver can considerably adopt the system to realistic change environment, and reach very high reliability. Simulations of our optimization reveal superior error rate performance and lower computational cost vs. conventional LDPC coded MIMO OFDM system. Our simulation results also capture the effects of realistic vs. typical channel fading types (i.e., Rician vs. Rayleigh, respectively) and fading parameter models (average vs. random azimuth spread and K factor) on system performance and complexity.
