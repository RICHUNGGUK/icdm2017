Because individual identification is important in ubiquitous environment, RFID technology would be used frequently. RFID is a radio frequency identification technology to replace bar code. The reader transmits query (request of user information) and tag-provides user information. RFID has various advantages, such as high speed identification rates, mass memory storages. However, eavesdropping is possible as well as a problem that user information is exposed (Juels et al. in Conference on Computer and Communications Security-ACM CCS, pp. 103-111, 2003; Ohkubo et al. in RFID Privacy Workshop 2003; Weis et al. in International Conference on Security in Pervasive Computing, pp. 201-212, 2003; Weis et al. in Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems-CHES, pp. 454-469, 2002). Therefore, when off-line customer had visited bank for banking service, RNTS (RFID number ticket service) system provides both anonymity in customer identification and efficiency of banking service. In addition, RNTS system protects privacy of an off-line user visiting the bank and it is an efficient method offering service in order of arriving in the bank.", "paper_title": "Efficient RNTS system for privacy of banking off-line customer", "paper_id": "WOS:000286682500011"}
