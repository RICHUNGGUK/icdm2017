As WLAN traffic evolves to be more symmetric due to the emerging new applications such as VoWLAN, collaborative download, and peer-to-peer file sharing, opportunistic scheduling at the downlink becomes insufficient for optimized utilization of the single shared wireless channel. Furthermore, without proper scheduling on the uplink, the downlink throughput gain diminishes proportionally to the increasing number of clients transmitting on the uplink. However, opportunistic scheduling on the uplink of a WLAN is challenging because wireless channel condition is dynamic and asymmetric. Each transmitting client has to probe the access point to maintain the updated channel conditions at the access point. Moreover, the scheduling decisions must be coordinated at all clients for consistency. This paper presents JUDS, a joint uplink/downlink opportunistic scheduling for WLANs. Through synergistic integration of both the uplink and the downlink scheduling, JUDS maximizes channel diversity at significantly reduced scheduling overhead. It also enforces fair channel sharing between the downlink and uplink traffic. Through analysis and extensive QualNet simulations, we show that JUDS improves the overall throughput by up to 127% and achieves both fairness between uplink and downlink traffic.
