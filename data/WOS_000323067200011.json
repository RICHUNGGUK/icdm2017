Therefore, statistical methods and experts' experience are always integrated to estimate future security returns, which are hereinafter regarded as random fuzzy variables. Random fuzzy variable is a powerful tool to deal with the portfolio optimization problem including stochastic parameters with ambiguous expected returns. In this paper, we first define the semivariance of random fuzzy variable and prove its several properties. By considering the semivariance as a risk measure, we establish the mean-semivariance models for portfolio optimization problem with random fuzzy returns. We design a hybrid algorithm with random fuzzy simulation to solve the proposed models in general cases. Finally, we present a numerical example and compare the results to illustrate the mean-semivariance model and the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "MEAN-SEMIVARIANCE MODELS FOR PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH MIXED UNCERTAINTY OF FUZZINESS AND RANDOMNESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323067200011"}
