Because these images lack predetermined anchors and are dominated by noise, we use a pixel weighted image alignment together with a correction for nonlinear tissue deformations. We call this correction a poor man's diffeomorphic map since it ascertains the nonlinear regions of the image without resorting to a full integral equation method. To determine the quality of the image stabilization, we developed an ensemble sampling method that quantifies the coincidence between image pairs from randomly distributed image regions. We obtain global stabilization alignment through an iterative constrained simulated annealing optimization procedure. To show the accuracy of our algorithm with existing software, we measured the misalignment error rate in datasets taken from two different organs and compared the results to a similar and popular open-source solution. Present open-source stabilization software tools perform poorly because they do not treat the specific needs of the IV-2pM datasets with soft-tissue deformation, speckle noise, full 5D inter- and intra-stack motion error correction, and undefined anchors. In contrast, the results of our tests demonstrate that our method is more immune to noise and provides better performance for datasets' possessing nonlinear tissue deformations. As a practical application of our software, we show how our stabilization improves cell tracking, where the presence of background movement would degrade track information. We also provide a qualitative comparison of our software with other open-source libraries/applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
