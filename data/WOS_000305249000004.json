This paper proposed an energy-efficient fault tolerance task allocation scheme for multiprocessor SoCs in real-time energy harvesting systems. The proposed fault-tolerance scheme is based on the principle of the primiary/backup task scheduling, and can tolerate at most one single transient fault. Extensive simulated experiment shows that the proposed scheme can save up to 30% energy consumption and reduce the miss ratio to about 8% in the presence of faults.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE FAULT-TOLERANT TASK SCHEDULING FOR REAL-TIME ENERGY HARVESTING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249000004"}
