The mean value of basic reproductive number from the 2001-2002 to 2005-2006 influenza seasons is 1.2440, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.1170-1.3710. Our model predicts that the proportion of vaccination of susceptible is 20% and 60 million doses of vaccines should be prepared for each influenza season in the United States. The chi-square test of goodness of fit indicates that our model fits the data reasonably well.", "paper_title": "Partial Immunity and Vaccination for Influenza", "paper_id": "WOS:000285184700006"}
