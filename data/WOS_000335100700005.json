In this paper we analyze three different variants of TSP with profits that are NP-hard in general. We study their computational complexity on special structures of the underlying graph, both in the case with and without service times to the customers. We present polynomial algorithms for the polynomially solvable cases and fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for some NP-hard cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
