Such a scheme combines the minimum two-norm joint-velocity and infinity-norm joint-torque solutions via a weighting factor, which guarantees the final joint-velocity of the motion to be near zero (more acceptable for engineering application). In addition, the different-level scheme is reformulated as a general quadratic program (QP) and resolved at the joint-acceleration level. Computer-simulation results based on the PUMA560 robot manipulator further demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed different-level bi-criteria minimization scheme for robotic redundancy resolution.
