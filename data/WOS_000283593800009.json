Thus, many system-and algorithm-wise challenges remain to be addressed to have operational, battery-powered wireless smart-camera networks. We present a wireless embedded smart-camera system for cooperative object tracking and detection of composite events spanning multiple camera views. Each camera is a CITRIC mote consisting of a camera board and wireless mote. Lightweight and robust foreground detection and tracking algorithms are implemented on the camera boards. Cameras exchange small-sized data wire-lessly in a peer-to-peer manner. Instead of transferring or saving every frame or trajectory, events of interest are detected. Simpler events are combined in a time sequence to define semantically higher-level events. Event complexity can be increased by increasing the number of primitives and/or number of camera views they span. Examples of consistently tracking objects across different cameras, updating location of occluded/lost objects from other cameras, and detecting composite events spanning two or three camera views, are presented. All the processing is performed on camera boards. Operating current plots of smart cameras, obtained when performing different tasks, are also presented. Power consumption is analyzed based upon these measurements.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Object Tracking and Composite Event Detection With Wireless Embedded Smart Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000283593800009"}
