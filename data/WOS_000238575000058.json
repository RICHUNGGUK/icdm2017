Using this tool in a Metasearcher, the user may observe what other concepts are related to the searched concept, and what the connection forces are (fuzzy relations between concepts). This knowledge can be useful for making new queries with words conceptually related in a specific domain with the original ones.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional representation of conceptual fuzzy relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000058"}
