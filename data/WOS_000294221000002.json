The cut cells are automatically generated using Volume CAD (VCAD), a framework for storing geometric and material attribute data. Unlike earlier cut cell methods, this solver organizes the cutting patterns into only six categories and further subdivides the resulting pentagon into two quadrilaterals, such that mesh data can be stored by uniform data structure and the post-processing of flow data can be handled conveniently. A novel method is proposed to treat minuscule cut cells without the process of cell merging. A collocated finite volume method, which can be used even when multiple cell shapes and orthogonal and non-orthogonal grids exist in the decomposition, is employed to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations. A modified SIMPLE-based smoothing pressure correction scheme is applied in this cut cell method to suppress checkerboard pressure oscillations caused by collocated arrangement. The solver is first used to simulate a channel flow to demonstrate its calculation accuracy expressed with L-1 and L-infinity norm errors and then the method is utilized to solve three benchmark problems of flow and heat transfer within irregular domains to verify its feasibility, efficiency, accuracy and potential in engineering applications.
