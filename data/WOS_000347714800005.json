In the case refinement fails between two specifications, the target of this operator is to produce a specification APA that represents all witness PAs of this failure. Our contribution is an algorithm that permits to approximate the difference of two deterministic APAs with arbitrary precision. Our technique relies on new quantitative notions of distances between APAs used to assess convergence of the approximations, as well as on an in-depth inspection of the refinement relation for APAs. The procedure is effective and not more complex than refinement checking.", "paper_title": "REFINEMENT AND DIFFERENCE FOR PROBABILISTIC AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800005"}
