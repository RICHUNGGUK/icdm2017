Here we make a detailed experimental comparison with the similar method based on the fuzzy transforms F-up arrow and F-down arrow of f defined via a continuous triangular norm and its corresponding residuum, respectively. We consider some images of sizes 256x256 (pixels) extracted from the well-known database Corel Galery (Arizona Directory). By using the same compression rate in both methods, we have that the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) obtained with the discrete fuzzy transform (and its inverse) off is more higher than the PSNR determined with the operators F, and F, defined via the usual Lukasiewicz, product and minimum triangular norms. Moreover, we compare our results with the classical JPEG method for values of compression rate approximately equal to those used in the previous methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
