We model job deterioration as a function that is proportional to a linear function of time. It is assumed that the release time of a job is a positive strictly decreasing continuous function of the amount of consumed resource. We present polynomial solutions for the total resource consumption minimization problem under the constraint that the makespan does not exceed a given limit, and the makespan minimization problem under the constraint that the total resource consumption does not exceed a given limit, respectively.
