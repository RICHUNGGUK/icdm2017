These models are identified under closed-loop conditions and produce a joint representation that includes both the plant and controller models in state space form. The joint plant/controller model is identified using subspace model identification (SMI), which is followed by the separation of the plant model from the identified one. Compared to previous research, this work (i) proposes a new modelling framework for identifying closed-loop systems, (ii) introduces a generic structure to represent the controller and (iii) explains how that the new framework gives rise to a simplified determination of the plant models. In contrast, the use of the conventional modelling approach renders the separation of the plant model a difficult task. The benefits of using the new model method are demonstrated using a number of application studies.", "paper_title": "Identification of dynamic systems under closed-loop control", "paper_id": "WOS:000236076600005"}
