Modelling errors and additional uncertainties are taken into consideration. Controller designs for driving and steering motors are designed. A proportional-derivative-type driving motor controller and a sliding-mode steering controller combined with radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based estimators are proposed. The convergence properties of the RBFNN-based estimators are proven by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. The stability of the proposed control law is proven using Lyapunov stability analysis. The obstacle avoidance strategy utilising the sliding surface adjustment to an existing navigation method is presented. It is concluded that the driving velocity and steering-angle performances of the proposed control system are satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Sliding-mode and proportional-derivative-type motion control with radial basis function neural network based estimators for wheeled vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193600007"}
