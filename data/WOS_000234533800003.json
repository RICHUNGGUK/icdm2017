Specifically, we propose and devise a simple ring-based Ethernet PON (EPON) architecture that supports a truly shared LAN capability among end users as well as upstream access to the central office. Unlike a typical ring-based PON topology in which the optical line terminal (OLT) and the optical network units (ONUs) are interconnected via a long fiber ring, under the proposed architecture, ONUs are interconnected via a short distribution fiber ring in the local loop but share the standard trunk feeder fiber for long-reach connectivity to the central office (CO). The main characteristic of the proposed architecture is that it supports a fully distributed control plane among the ONUs for ONU-ONU communication as well as upstream access to the OLT. This architecture is well suited to an autonomous access environment such as a university campus or a private corporation where several buildings are closely dispersed within a 0.5-1 km diameter area.
