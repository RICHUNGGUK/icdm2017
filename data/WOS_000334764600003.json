Researchers have suggested that despite this change there remain forensic opportunities to recover InPrivate browsing records from the new browser. The prospect of recovering such evidence, together with its potential forensic significance, prompts questions including where and when such evidence can be recovered, and if it is possible to prove that a recovered artefact originated from InPrivate browsing. This paper reports the results of experiments which answer these questions, and also provides some explanation of the increasingly complex data structures used to record Internet activity from both the desktop and Windows 8 Applications. We conclude that there is a time window between the private browsing session and the next use of the browser in which browsing records may be carved from database log files, after which it is necessary to carve from other areas of disk. It proved possible to recover a substantial record of a user's InPrivate browsing, and to reliably associate such records with InPrivate browsing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
