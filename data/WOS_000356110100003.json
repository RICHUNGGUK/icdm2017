Although many studies currently focus on model driven development (MOD); those researches, to a large extent, study the PIM-level and PSM-level model, and few have dealt with CIM-level modelling for case in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete. Objective: This paper proposes a CIM-level modelling approach, which applies a stepwise refinement approach to modelling the CIM-level model starting from a high-level goal model to a lower-level business process model. A key advantage of our approach is the combination of the requirement model with the business model, which helps software engineers to define business models exactly for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete. Method: This paper, based on the model driven approach, proposes a set of models at the CIM-level and model transformations to connect these models. Accordingly, the formalisation approach of this paper involves formalising the goal model using the category theory and the scenario model and business process model using Petri nets Results: We have defined a set of metamodels and transformation rules making it possible to obtain automatically a scenario model from the goal model and a business process model from the scenario model. At the same time, we have defined a mapping rule to formalise these models. Our proposed CIM modelling approach and formalisation approach are implemented with an MDA tool, and it has been empirically validated by a travel agency case study. Conclusion: This study shows how a CIM modelling approach helps to build a complete and consistent model at the CIM level for cases in which the requirements are unclear or incomplete in advance.
