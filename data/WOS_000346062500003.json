One of key issues for alpha-n(t)-ary resolution dynamic automated reasoning is how to choose generalized literals in each resolution. In this paper, the definition of alpha-minimal resolution principle which determines how to choose generalized literals in LP(X) is introduced firstly, as well as its soundness and completeness being proved. alpha-minimal resolution principle is then further established in the corresponding lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X) along with its soundness theorem, lifting lemma and completeness theorem. These results lay the theoretical foundation for research of alpha-n(t)-ary resolution dynamic automated reasoning.", "paper_title": "alpha-Minimal Resolution Principle For A Lattice-Valued Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000346062500003"}
