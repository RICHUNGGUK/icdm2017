Typically, the verification and validation of this type of safety-critical system is performed by means of an on-site test, which leads to a low efficiency and high costs. A novel method for the verification and validation of a railway signalling system is proposed as an application of the enterprise information system (EIS) technique. In this application, the EIS and the simulation test platform are combined together, which enhances the coherence and consistency of the information exchange between the system development and the system verification, to improve the work efficiency. The simulation and auto-test technology used in the system verification also lowers the human and financial costs.", "paper_title": "Verification and validation in railway signalling engineering - an application of enterprise systems techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000335117600003"}
