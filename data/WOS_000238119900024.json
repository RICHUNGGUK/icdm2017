A partition of a positive integer n is a multiset of positive integers that add up to exactly n, and an integer partition of a multiset S of integers is defined as the multiset union of partitions of integers in S. Given a sequence of multisets S(1),(...),S(k) of integers, where k >= 2, we say that a multiset is a common integer partition if it is an integer partition of every multiset S(i), 1 <= i <= k. The MCIP problem is thus defined as to find a common integer partition of S(1),(...),S(k) with the minimum cardinality. It is easy to see that the MCIP problem is NP-hard since it generalizes the well-known Set Partition problem. We can in fact show that it is APX-hard. We will also present a 5/4-approximation algorithm for the MCIP problem when k = 2, and a 3k(k-1)/3k-2 approximation algorithm for k >= 3.", "paper_title": "On the minimum common integer partition problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900024"}
