Such schemes aren't effective for emerging critical healthcare applications - for example, in remote monitoring of patients with Alzheimer's disease, bulimia, or anorexia - because they require a more comprehensive, contextual, and fine-grained recognition of complex daily user activities. Here, a novel approach for in-home, fine-grained activity recognition uses multimodal wearable sensors on multiple body positions, along with lightly deployed Bluetooth beacons in the environment.", "paper_title": "Multimodal Wearable Sensing for Fine-Grained Activity Recognition in Healthcare", "paper_id": "WOS:000364338100005"}
