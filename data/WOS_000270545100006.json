We may assume that different MT systems make different errors due to using different models, generation strategies, or tweaks. An investigated technique, inherited from automatic speech recognition (ASR), is the so-called system combination that is based on combining the outputs of multiples MT systems. We combine the outputs of a phrase-and Ngram-based Statistical MT (SMT) systems using statistical criteria and additional rescoring features.", "paper_title": "PHRASE AND NGRAM-BASED STATISTICAL MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM COMBINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270545100006"}
