Team members constitute a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET), whose topology both influences and is influenced by the workflow. In this paper we propose an algebraic approach for modeling workflow progress as well as its modifications as required by topology transformations. The approach is based on Algebraic Higher-Order Nets and sees both workflows and topologies as tokens, allowing their concurrent modification.", "paper_title": "Applying algebraic approaches for modeling workflows and their transformations in mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209562700004"}
