This is essential in order to draw inferences across the levels of granularity which span medicine and biology, an example of which include the understanding of the roles of tumor markers in the development and progress of carcinoma. Such information integration is also important for the integration of genomics information with the information contained in the electronic patient records in such a way that real time conclusions can be drawn. In this paper, we describe a large multi-granular datasource built by using ontological principles and focusing on the case of colon carcinoma. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
