In our problem, we used the topological neighborhood local PSO algorithm to improve the performance, in addition, we used the damp boundary conditions to avoid the particles escaping out of the solve space. The simulated results are in good coincidence with design targets, and proved the capability and effectiveness of the algorithm. In addition, this algorithm is general and can be used for other similar synthesis problems of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs).", "paper_title": "Optimal designing of EDFA gain flattening long period fiber grating by intelligent particle swarm optimization algoritbm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300029"}
