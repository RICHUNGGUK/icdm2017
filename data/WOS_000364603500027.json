To understand its behaviour simulations based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are becoming widely used nowadays. The strength of this method lies in its ability to capture the discrete nature of particle assemblies in comparison with other methods that are based in continuum approaches. However, one of the challenges that still need to be tackled is the approximation of the shape of real particles in order to achieve more realistic simulations. In this paper, the shape of a grain of maize has been approached using the so-called multi-sphere method, and also as single-spherical particles with rolling friction. Furthermore, as it is already known that the use of different software codes can show differences, although good agreement in general, results from two DEM software codes were compared.
