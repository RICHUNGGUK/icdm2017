In such a situation, available computational resources should be allocated across the instances in order to optimize the overall classification efficacy and efficiency. We propose a novel anytime classification framework, Scheduling Anytime Averaged Probabilistic Estimators (SAAPE), which is capable of classifying a pool of instances, delivering accurate results whenever interrupted and optimizing the collective classification performance. Following the practice of our previous anytime classification system AAPE, SAAPE runs a sequence of very efficient Bayesian probabilistic classifiers to classify each single instance. Furthermore, SAAPE implements seven alternative scheduling schemes to decide which instance gets available computational resources next such that a new classifier can be applied to refine its classification. We formally present each scheduling scheme's definition, rationale and time complexity. We conduct large-scale experiments using 60 benchmark data sets and diversified statistical tests to evaluate SAAPE's performance on zero-one loss classification as well as on probability estimation. We analyze each scheduling scheme's advantages and disadvantages according to both theoretical understandings and empirical observations. Consequently we identify effective scheduling schemes that enable SAAPE to accomplish accurate anytime classification for a pool of instances.", "paper_title": "Anytime classification for a pool of instances", "paper_id": "WOS:000269423100003"}
