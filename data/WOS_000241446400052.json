However, we state that proper behavior of the utilized algorithms in decision/search space is necessary for obtaining good results if multimodal objective functions are concerned. Therefore, it makes sense to observe the development of Pareto sets as well. We do so on a simple, configurable problem, and detect interesting interactions between induced changes to the Pareto set and the ability of three optimization algorithms to keep track of Pareto fronts.", "paper_title": "Pareto set and EMOA behavior for simple multimodal multiobjective functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400052"}
