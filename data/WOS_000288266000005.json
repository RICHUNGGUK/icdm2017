We first review the dynamic continuum model for bi-directional pedestrian flows. This model is composed of a coupled system of a conservation law and an Eikonal equation. Then we present the first-order Lax-Friedrichs difference scheme with first-order Euler forward time discretization, the third-order WENO scheme with third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time discretization, and the fast sweeping method, and demonstrate how to apply them to the model under study. We present a comparison of the numerical results of the model from the first-order and high-order methods, and conclude that the high-order method is more efficient than the first-order one, and they both converge to the same solution of the physical model.", "paper_title": "High-Order Computational Scheme for a Dynamic Continuum Model for Bi-Directional Pedestrian Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000288266000005"}
