Most of high fidelity numerical schemes, in terms of low dissipative and low dispersive effects, lie on finite-difference (FD) approach. But for industrial applications, FD schemes are less robust compared to finite-volume (FV) ones. Thus the present study focuses on the development of a new compact FV scheme for two- and three-dimensional applications. The proposed schemes are formulated in the physical space and not in the computational space as it is the case in most of the known works. Therefore, they are more appropriate for general grids. They are based on compact interpolation to approximate interface-averaged field values using known cell-averaged values. For each interface, the interpolation coefficients are determined by matching Taylor series expansions around the interface center. Two types of schemes can be distinguished. The first one uses only the curvilinear abscissa along a mesh line to derive a sixth-order compact interpolation formulae while the second, more general, uses coordinates in a spatial three-dimensional frame well chosen. This latter is formally sixth-order accurate in a preferred direction almost orthogonal to the interface and at most fourth-order accurate in transversal directions. For non-linear problems, different approaches can be used to keep the high-order scheme. However, in the present paper, a MUSCL-like formulation was sufficient to address the presented test cases. All schemes have been modified to treat multiblock and periodic interfaces in such a way that high-order accuracy, stability, good spectral resolution, conservativeness and low computational costs are guaranteed. This is a first step to insure good scalability of the schemes although parallel performances issues are not addressed. As high frequency waves, badly resolved, could be amplified and then destabilize the scheme, compact filtering operators have been used. Numerous test cases as the linear convection of a Gaussian wave, the convection of a Lamb-Oseen vortex and the diffraction of an acoustic wave on a plane have been realized to validate the schemes. The most efficient schemes are shown to be at least fifth-order accurate on linear and non-linear convection problems. They are also less dissipative and less dispersive on non-uniform curvilinear grids than schemes using implicit interpolation with constant coefficients of the same order on uniform cartesian grids.
