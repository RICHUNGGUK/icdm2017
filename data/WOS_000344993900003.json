The decision system may vary with time, e.g., the variation of objects, attributes and attribute values. The reduction and approximations of the decision system may alter on Attribute Values' Coarsening and Refining (AVCR), a kind of variation of attribute values, which results in the alteration of decision rules simultaneously. This paper aims for dynamic maintenance of decision rules w:r:t: AVCR. The definition of minimal discernibility attribute set is proposed firstly, which aims to improve the efficiency of attribute reduction in RST. Then, principles of updating decision rules in case of AVCR are discussed. Furthermore, the rough set-based methods for updating decision rules in the inconsistent decision system are proposed. The complexity analysis and extensive experiments on UCI data sets have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "A Rough Set-Based Method for Updating Decision Rules on Attribute Values' Coarsening and Refining", "paper_id": "WOS:000344993900003"}
