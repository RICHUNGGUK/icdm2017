A minimal function is a function which generates a minimal clone. We consider the base set with k elements for a prime k as a finite field and treat functions as polynomials over GF(k). Starting from binary minimal functions overGF(3), we generalize some of them and obtain binary minimal functions expressed as polynomials over GF(k) for any prime k >= 3.", "paper_title": "Some polynomials generating minimal clones", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989800006"}
