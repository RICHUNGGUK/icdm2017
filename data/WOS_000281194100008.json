In a multi-route scenario, our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow and simulation results adopting vehicle number feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e. Travel Time Feedback Strategy (TTFS), Mean Velocity Feedback Strategy (MVFS) and Congestion Coefficient Feedback Strategy (CCFS). We also discuss the influence of expected arrival rate (V-p) at the entrance on the average flux of each route, and we find that the flux adopting VNFS is always the largest at each V-p value among these four feedback strategies.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF VEHICLE NUMBER FEEDBACK IN MULTI-ROUTE INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281194100008"}
