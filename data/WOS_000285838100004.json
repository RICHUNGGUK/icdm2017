The set of non-dominated points of X is called the Pareto envelope of T. H. Kuhn (1973) established that in Euclidean spaces, the Pareto envelopes and the convex hulls coincide. Chalmet et al. (1981) characterized the Pareto envelopes in the rectilinear plane (R-2, d(1)) and constructed them in O(n log n) time. In this note, we investigate the Pareto envelopes of point-sets in simple polygons P endowed with geodesic d(2)- or d(1)-metrics (i.e., Euclidean and Manhattan metrics). We show that Kuhn's characterization extends to Pareto envelopes in simple polygons with d(2)-metric, while that of Chalmet et al. extends to simple rectilinear polygons with d(1)-metric. These characterizations provide efficient algorithms for construction of these Pareto envelopes.", "paper_title": "PARETO ENVELOPES IN SIMPLE POLYGONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285838100004"}
