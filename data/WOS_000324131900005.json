The robot has two differential driving wheels with a suspension and an adhesion mechanism. The adhesion mechanism is composed of an impeller and two-layered suction seals. It is designed to provide sufficient adhesion force and be controlled so that the robot can move freely on various wall surfaces. The static and aerodynamic modeling of the adhesion mechanism is given and the analysis of the adhesion mechanism, air leakage, and inner flow are carried out to be useful for the design as well as the control. Finally, the performances of the robot are experimentally verified on several kinds of walls and its feasibility is validated.", "paper_title": "Development of Wall Climbing Robot System by Using Impeller Type Adhesion Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000324131900005"}
