This paper presents an adaptive fast bilateral filter (AFBF) to reduce the speckle noise. The presented filter is derived from a conventional bilateral filter and is adaptively adjusted by the detection of speckle statistics. The criterion of speckle region is defined from a similarity value obtained from local characteristic matching between the processing window and a reference speckle area. The presented filter can reduce the speckle noise and, at the same time, maintain the tissue structure. Ultrasound phantom testing and in vivo imaging show that the proposed method can improve the quality of an ultrasound image in terms of tissue SNR, CNR and FOM values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
