The lectures are complemented by a novel three-dimensional collaborative virtual environment for international student teamwork, and a web-based resource designed as a knowledge base and for community building. This paper summarizes the lessons learned from the first edition of the ShanghAI Lectures, which may guide future global teaching and learning projects of this kind.", "paper_title": "The ShanghAI Lectures: A Global Education Project on Artificial Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000314532200003"}
