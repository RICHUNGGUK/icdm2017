The role graph model was suggested as a reference model for the role-based access control. However, its privilege management is too strict to be applied to various applications. In this paper, therefore, we propose a flexible privilege management scheme based on the refinement of privileges in the role graph model, and show its effectiveness through several scenarios. We expect that this scheme will make the role graph model more powerful and applicable.", "paper_title": "A flexible privilege management scheme for role graph model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200119"}
