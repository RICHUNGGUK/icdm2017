This indicates that the power of higher arity operators is much stronger than what the previous O(n/ log k) bound by Doerr et al. [Benjamin Doerr, Daniel johannsen, Timo Kotzing, Per Kristian Lehre, Markus Wagner, Carola Winzen, Faster black-box algorithms through higher arity operators, in Proc. of the 11th ACM Workshop on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms, FOGA'11, ACM, 2011, pp. 163-172] suggests. The key to this result is an encoding strategy, which might be of independent interest. It shows that, using k-ary unbiased variation operators only, we may simulate an unrestricted memory of O(2(k)) bits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
