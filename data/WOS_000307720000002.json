In the cloud-based environment, data are distributed at Internet scale and the system needs to handle a huge number of user queries simultaneously without delay. How data are distributed among the servers has a crucial impact on the query load distribution and the system response time. In this paper, we propose a market-based control method, called MBA, to achieve query load balance via reasonable data distribution. In MBA, database nodes are treated as traders in a market, and certain market rules are used to intelligently decide data allocation and migration. We built a prototype system and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results show that the MBA method significantly improves system performance in terms of average query response time and fairness.", "paper_title": "MBA: A market-based approach to data allocation and dynamic migration for cloud database", "paper_id": "WOS:000307720000002"}
