As an application, we obtain dramatically improved runtime bounds for two variants of the VERTEX COVER problem. In the case of CONNECTED VERTEX COVER, we take the upper bound from O*(6k) to O*(2.7606(k)) without large hidden factors. For TREE COVER, we show a complexity of O*(3.2361(k)), improving over the previous bound of O*((2k)(k)). In the process, faster algorithms for solving subclasses of the Steiner tree problem on graphs are investigated.", "paper_title": "Enumerate and expand: Improved algorithms for connected Vertex Cover and Tree Cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000254777600008"}
