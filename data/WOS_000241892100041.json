In our method, de Bruijn graph is used to describe input sequences information. As a result, a consensus-finding problem can be transformed to a maximum weighted path problem of the graph. MWPAlign gets almost linear computation speed of multiple sequences alignment problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible, and for large,number of sequences with lower mutation rate 5.2%, MWPAlign generates better alignment and has a lower computation time a's compared to CLUSTALW, T-Coffee and HMMT.", "paper_title": "A maximum weighted path approach to multiple alignments for DNA sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100041"}
