These abstraction techniques are based on static analyses, which have to cope with the peculiarities of the binary code such as hardware dependencies, interrupts, recursion, and globally accessible memory locations. An interprocedural static analysis framework is presented that handles these peculiarities. Based on this framework, extensions of dead variable reduction and path reduction are detailed. A case study using several microcontroller programs is presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the described abstraction techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
