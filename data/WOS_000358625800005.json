For arbitrary commutative semirings, we prove that weighted monadic second order logics on trees is equivalent to the definability by formulas which start with one of the following operators: (i) a branching transitive closure or (ii) one existential second-order quantifier followed by one universal first-order quantifier; in both cases the operator is applied to step-formulas over (a) Boolean first-order logic enriched by modulo counting or (b) Boolean monadic-second order logic.
