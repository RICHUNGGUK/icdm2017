Recently, some MAC protocols for UWSNs have been suggested ill file literature. and most of them are based on random access with their capabilities to compensate propagation delay. However two issues should still be resolved in these protocols: (a) they need to make measurements to realize duty Cycle synchronization and (b) packet collisions exist, which not only reduce the throughput (thus increasing delays) but also waste energy. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol explicitly designed for UWSNs. which makes the best use of the propagation delay to resolve collision problem and reduce overhead of control-packet to save energy. The proposed MAC protocol call assure that the number of retransmissions is not more than one. To validate the analytical results, simulations have been conducted to show that the proposed MAC protocol call offer a low energy consumption while avoiding collisions in UWSNs.
