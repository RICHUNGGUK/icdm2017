Such contact records may be obtained through the bluetooth communication on mobile phones. We present an approach that solve the trace inference problem in reasonable time, and analyze some properties of the inference algorithm.", "paper_title": "Automatic Inference of Movements from Contact Histories", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800033"}
