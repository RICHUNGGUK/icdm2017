In long-term operations, the event activities usually show certain patterns that can be learned and exploited to optimize the network design. However, this has been underexplored in the literature. One work related to this is using Activity Transition Probability Graph (ATPG) for radio duty cycling [Tang et al. (2011) ActSee: Activity-Aware Radio Duty-Cycling for Sensor Networks in Smart Environments. Proc. IEEE INSS 2011, Penghu, Taiwan, June 12-15. IEEE Press]. In this paper, we present a novel Energy and Activity-aware Routing (EAR) protocol for sensor networks. As a case study, we have evaluated EAR with the data trace of real Smart Environments. In EAR an ATPG is learned and built from the event activity patterns. EAR is an online routing protocol, that chooses the next-hop relay node by utilizing: activity pattern information in the ATPG graph and a novel index of energy balance in the network. EAR extends the network lifetime by maintaining an energy balance across the nodes in the network, while meeting the application performance with desired throughput and low data delivery latency. We theoretically prove that: (i) the network throughput with EAR achieves a competitive ratio (i.e. the ratio of the performance of any offline algorithm that has knowledge of all past and future packet arrivals to the performance of our online algorithm) that is asymptotically optimal, and (ii) EAR achieves a lower bound in the network lifetime. Extensive experimental results from: (i) a 82 node Motelab sensor network testbed [Werner-Allen et al. (2005) MoteLab: A Wireless Sensor Network Testbed. Proc. ACM IPSN 2005, Los Angeles, CA, USA, April 25-27, pp. 483-488. IEEE Press, NJ, USA] and (ii) a varying size network (20-100) in sensor network simulator TOSSIM, validate that EAR outperforms the existing methods both in terms of network performance (network lifetime, network energy consumption) and application performance (low latency, desired throughput) for an energy-constrained sensor network.", "paper_title": "EAR: An Energy and Activity-Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000311905200006"}
