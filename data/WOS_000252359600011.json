The generalized logistic distribution (GLD) of Type II, which is indexed by one shape parameter, is introduced hereto extend the scope of this distribution in some asymmetrical studies. Several properties of this distribution in relation to other probability distributions are stated. Furthermore, the maximum-likelihood (ML) method and an approximate ML method are used to derive the point estimators of the parameters based on progressive Type II censoring. A wide range of sample sizes and progressive-censoring schemes are considered in a simulation study to see the performance of estimates of location and scale parameters of the Type II GLD. The coverages probability of the pivotal quantities (for location and scale parameters) based on asymptotic normality are shown to be unsatisfactory, especially when the effective sample size is small. To improve the coverage probabilities, we suggest the use of unconditional simulated percentage points for the construction of confidence intervals. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the methods of estimation discussed here.", "paper_title": "Inference for the Type II generalized logistic distribution under progressive Type II censoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000252359600011"}
