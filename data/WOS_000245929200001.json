Knuth and Bendix have proposed a procedure known as the KB procedure for generating a complete TRS. A TRS cannot, however, directly handle higher-order functions that are widely used in functional programming languages. In this paper, we propose a higher-order KB procedure that extends the KB procedure to the framework of a simply-typed term rewriting system (STRS) as an extended TRS that can handle higher-order functions. We discuss the application of this higher-order KB procedure to a certification technique called inductionless induction used in program verification, and its application to fusion transformation, a typical kind of program transformation.", "paper_title": "A higher-order Knuth-Bendix procedure and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929200001"}
