Specifically, IDC operators intend to minimize energy cost by scheduling workload and battery jointly, which can fully exploit the temporal diversity of electricity price. First, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem taking heterogeneous service delay guarantees and battery management into account. Then, we design an online operation algorithm to solve the problem based on Lyapunov optimization technique. Meanwhile, we analyze the feasibility and performance guarantee of the proposed algorithm. Finally, extensive simulation results based on real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Joint Workload and Battery Scheduling with Heterogeneous Service Delay Guarantees for Data Center Energy Cost Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000356138700013"}
