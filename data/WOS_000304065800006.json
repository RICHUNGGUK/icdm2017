Let P be a graph property, a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices is said to have an inductive neighborhood property with respect to P if there is an ordering of vertices v(1), ... , v(n) such that the property P holds on the induced subgraph G[N(v(i)) boolean AND V-i], where N(v(i)) is the neighborhood of v(i) and V-i = {v(i), ... , v(n)}. It turns out that if we take P as a graph with maximum independent set size no greater than k, then this definition gives a natural generalization of both chordal graphs and (k + 1)-claw-free graphs. We refer to such graphs as inductive k-independent graphs. We study properties of such families of graphs, and we show that several natural classes of graphs are inductive k-independent for small k. In particular, any intersection graph of translates of a convex object in a two dimensional plane is an inductive 3-independent graph; furthermore, any planar graph is an inductive 3-independent graph. For any fixed constant k, we develop simple, polynomial time approximation algorithms for inductive k-independent graphs with respect to several well-studied NP-complete problems. Our generalized formulation unifies and extends several previously known results.", "paper_title": "Elimination Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000304065800006"}
