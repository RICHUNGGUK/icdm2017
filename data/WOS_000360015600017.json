For achieving the above goals, we propose employment of the regenerating codes and symmetric-key encryption with a Blom based key management. Particularly note that the encoded blocks stored in the i-th node and originating from the j-th node are encrypted by symmetric key K (ij) . A common and desirable feature regarding the considered regenerating codes and Blom's key management scheme is that the both are based on employment of Vandermonde matrix, and accordingly yield a unified implementation framework. The security analysis and repairing probability simulation results verify the security and repairing capability of the proposed scheme. Moreover, preliminary consideration of the implementation complexity of the proposed scheme implies that the energy costs in the both cases, regarding the scenarios with and without the faults, are lower in comparison with related SIoT schemes and accordingly suitable for applications related to resources-constrained SIoT. Resource consumption evaluations show the feasibility of the proposed scheme for SIoT. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to realize the secure sensor distributed storage for SioT with repairing capability.", "paper_title": "Securing distributed storage for Social Internet of Things using regenerating code and Blom key agreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015600017"}
