This systematic look at existing privacy-preservation techniques highlights the vulnerabilities of users even in networks that completely anonymize identities. Through a taxonomy that categorizes techniques according to the degree of user identity exposure, the authors examine the ways that existing approaches compromise relation privacy and offer more secure alternatives.", "paper_title": "Preserving Relation Privacy in Online Social Network Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000289790600007"}
