Hence, it is desirable to cancel the effect of HS on lung sound records. In this paper, a novel HS cancellation method is presented. This method first localizes HS segments using multiresolution decomposition of the wavelet transform coefficients, then removes those segments from the original lung sound record and estimates the missing data via a 2D interpolation in the time-frequency (TF) domain. Finally, the signal is reconstructed into the time domain. To evaluate the efficiency of the TF filtering, the average power spectral density (PSD) of the original lung sound segments with and without HS over four frequency bands from 20 to 300 Hz were calculated and compared with the average PSD of the filtered signals. Statistical tests show that there is no significant difference between the average PSD of the HS-free original lung sounds and the TF-filtered signal for all frequency bands at both low and medium flow rates. It was found that the proposed method successfully removes HS from lung sound signals while preserving the original fundamental components of the lung sounds.", "paper_title": "Heart sound cancellation from lung sound recordings using time-frequency filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240031900007"}
