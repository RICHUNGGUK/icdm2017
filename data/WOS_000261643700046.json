The system consists of a constrained K-Means clustering algorithm and an image recognition neural network. For finding similarity between images we use a novel image similarity measure and introduce a new image cluster validity measure to determine the most probable number of clusters. Extensive testing on several image datasets indicates good performance of the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
