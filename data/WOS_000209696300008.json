Orthogonal relaying is considered and all relays that correctly decode the source message in the broadcasting phase participate in the relaying phase. First, the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the destination is derived. Then, considering error and outage as the performance metrics, we obtain exact closed-form expressions for the error and outage probabilities. Simple and general asymptotic expression for the error probability, which explicitly shows the coding and the diversity gains, is also derived and discussed.", "paper_title": "Impact of Imperfect Channel Estimation and Co-Channel Interference on Regenerative Cooperative Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300008"}
