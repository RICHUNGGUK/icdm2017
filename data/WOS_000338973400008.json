The convergence of the protocol FID is established for any computation under the unfair distributed scheduler. The protocol FID reaches a terminal (also legitimate) configuration in at most 4n + k rounds, where n is the network size; it requires (k +1)log(n +1) bits per node. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
