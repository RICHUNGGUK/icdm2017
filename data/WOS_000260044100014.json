Compared with the luminous efficiency of the conventional device with 0-periodic structure, that of the device with the 2-periodic structure has been sharply increased. Such an obvious improvement in the device performance was ascribed to the improvement of the hole-electron balance, due to the introduction of the MLP structure. Moreover, the roll-off characteristic of luminous efficiency and electroluminescence spectra were used to further confirm the conclusion. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
