They must be executed successfully to obtain the desired results. Unfortunately, faults may happen during its execution due to the dynamic networks or the information asymmetry between developers and users. Therefore, designing effective failure recovery mechanism to ensure the reliability of the composite model execution is essential. Progress has been made in the web service composition field to obtain limited failure recovery capabilities, but not fully applicable to composite models since model services are informational services in essence which do not change the world conditions. This paper proposes a unified framework, integrated with a process ontology and multiple recovery strategies that can provide valuable failure recovery recommendations intelligently. The recovery strategies have been greatly enhanced in providing greater failure recovery capability. Feasibility and efficiency of this framework have been illustrated and tested.", "paper_title": "Failure recovery in distributed model composition with intelligent assistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000354378300014"}
