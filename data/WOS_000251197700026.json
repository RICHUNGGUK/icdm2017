Specifically, it suggests how to construct RNA sequence/structure pools with user-specified properties and assists in analyzing resulting distributions. This utility follows our recently developed approach for engineering sequence pools that links RNA sequence space regions with corresponding structural distributions via a 'mixing matrix' approach combined with a graph theory analysis of RNA secondary-structure space; the mixing matrix specifies nucleotide transition rates, and graph theory links sequences to simple graphical objects representing RNA motifs. The companion RAGPOOLS web server ('Designer' component) provides optimized starting sequences, mixing matrices and associated weights in response to a user-specified target pool structure distribution. In addition, RAGPOOLS ('Analyzer' component) analyzes the motif distribution of pools generated from user-specified starting sequences and mixing matrices. Thus, RAGPOOLS serves as a guide to researchers who aim to synthesize RNA pools with desired properties and/ or experiment in silico with various designs by our approach.", "paper_title": "RAGPOOLS: RNA-As-Graph-Pools - a web server for assisting the design of structured RNA pools for in vitro selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000251197700026"}
