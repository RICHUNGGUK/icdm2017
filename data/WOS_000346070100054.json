A combined strategy of model predictive control (MPC) and least squares online parameter estimation for the control of the hypnotic depth, measured by the Bispectral Index (BIS), under uncertainty is presented, where the uncertainty originates from patient variability. The parameter with the highest sensitivity, C50 the effect site concentration at 50% drug effect, is estimated online. The performance of the closed loop control design is shown for induction and maintenance of volatile anesthesia. In the maintenance phase, the control strategy is evaluated for predefined disturbances that are commonly occurring during surgery. The presented approach shows an improved performance compared to the nominal MPC controller under uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
