In the proposed scheme, the pre-existing precoding matrix for SDMA unitary precoded (UPC) MIMO proposed by the authors is modified to construct nulls in the spatial spectrum corresponding to the direction angles of the victim FSS earth station (ES). Furthermore, a numerical formula to calculate the power of the interference signal received at the FSS ES when IMT-Advanced base stations (BS) are operated with the interference mitigation technique is presented. This formula can be derived in closed form and is simply implemented with the help of simulation, resulting in significantly reduced time to obtain the solution. Finally, the frequency sharing results are analyzed in the co-channel and adjacent channel with respect to minimum separation distance and direction of FSS earth station (DOE). Simulation results indicate that the proposed mitigation scheme is highly efficient in terms of reducing the separation distance as well as robust against DOE estimation errors.", "paper_title": "Interference mitigation technique for the sharing between IMT-Advanced and fixed satellite service", "paper_id": "WOS:000247918600008"}
