We prove a general upper bound on the threshold for this property under the assumption that the denser of the two graphs satisfies a certain balancedness condition. Our result partially confirms a conjecture by the first author and Kreuter, and together with earlier lower bound results establishes the exact order of magnitude of the threshold for the case in which G and H are complete graphs of arbitrary size. In our proof we present an alternative to the so-called deletion method, which was introduced by Rodl and Ruciski in their study of symmetric Ramsey properties of random graphs (i.e. the case G = H), and has been used in many proofs of similar results since then.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
