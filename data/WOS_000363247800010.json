The proposed DCPIG algorithm is compared with three DC algorithms in the literature using Iris, Wine, Glass and Vowel benchmark data sets. The experiment results show that the DCPIG algorithm can achieve higher stability and accuracy than the other algorithms. In addition, the DCPIG algorithm is also applied to a real-world problem considering the customer clustering for a cyber flower shop. Lastly, we recommend different products and services to customers based on the clustering results.", "paper_title": "Integration of Particle Swarm Optimization and Immune Genetic Algorithm-Based Dynamic Clustering for Customer Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000363247800010"}
