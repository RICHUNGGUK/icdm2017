In this paper, for the space discretization, we use an inf-sup stable finite element method and for the time discretization, Radau-IIA methods of higher order, which have the advantage that the pressure component has convergence order s in time, where s is the number of internal stages. The disadvantage of this approach is that we have a high computational amount of work, because large nonlinear systems of equations have to solved. In this paper, we use a transformation of the coefficient matrix and the simplified Newton method. This approach has the effect that our large nonlinear systems split into smaller ones, which can now also be solved in parallel. For the parallelization of the code we use the software component technology and the Component Template Library. Numerical examples show that high order in the pressure component can be achieved and that the proposed solution technique is very effective.
