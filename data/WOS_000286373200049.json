Accuracy boosting relies on fuzzy partition learning. The performance, in terms of classification accuracy, of the proposed approach was compared with traditional classifier schemes: C4.5, Naive Bayes, K*, Meta END, JRip, and Hyper Pipes. The result accuracy of these methods are significantly lower than accuracy of fuzzy rules obtained by method presented in this study (paired t-test, P < 0.05). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
