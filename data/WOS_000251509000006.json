As a first instance of the framework we consider bigraphs, which are emerging as a an interesting (meta-)model for spatial structures and distributed calculi. Since bigraphs are built orthogonally on two structures, a hierarchical place graph for locations and a link (hyper-)graph for connections, we obtain a logic that is a natural composition of other two instances of BiLog: a Place Graph Logic and a Link Graph Logic. We prove that these instances generalise the spatial logics for trees, for graphs and for tree contexts. We also explore the concepts of separation and sharing in these logics. We note that both the operator * of Separation Logic and the operator \\ of spatial logics do not completely separate the underlying structures. These two different forms of separation can be naturally derived as instances of BiLog by using the complete separation induced by the tensor product of monoidal categories along with some form of sharing.", "paper_title": "Static BiLog: a Unifying Language for spatial structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000251509000006"}
