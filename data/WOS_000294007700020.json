However, in practice, often it cannot be solved optimally due to complexity reasons. Thus motivated, we address the following two questions in this paper: 1) Can suboptimal utility maximization maintain queue stability? 2) Can underoptimization of utility objective function in fact benefit other network design objectives? We quantify the following intuition: A resource allocation that is suboptimal with respect to a utility maximization formulation maintains maximum flow-level stability when the utility gap is sufficiently small and information delay is bounded, and it can still provide a guaranteed size of stability region otherwise. Utility-suboptimal rate allocation can also enhance other network performance metrics, e. g., it may reduce link saturation. These results provide a theoretical support for turning attention from optimal but complex solutions of network optimization to those that are simple even though suboptimal.", "paper_title": "Stability and Benefits of Suboptimal Utility Maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000294007700020"}
