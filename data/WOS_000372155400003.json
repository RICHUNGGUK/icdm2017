In this paper we describe a practical slow intelligence system test bed where super-components can be specified to describe interactions among components. These super-components are automatically transformed into time controllers for components so they can be managed by the SIS test bed. We illustrate the application of this methodology to personal healthcare system design.", "paper_title": "A Slow Intelligence System Test Bed Enhanced with Super-Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000372155400003"}
