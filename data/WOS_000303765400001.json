Thus, the ability to deal with jamming attacks and maintain an acceptable level of service degradation in presence of the attacks is needed. To solve the problem, we propose a traffic rerouting scheme in wireless communication infrastructure for islanded microgrid. We determine disjoint multiple paths as candidates of a detour path and then select the detour path among the candidates in order to reduce the effect of jamming attack and distribute traffic flows on different detour paths. Through performance comparison, we show that our scheme outperforms a conventional scheme in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Traffic Rerouting Strategy against Jamming Attacks in WSNs for Microgrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000303765400001"}
