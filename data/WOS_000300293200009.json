The present study developed a full fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model that is able to cope with arbitrary coaptation between the leaflets of the aortic valve during the closing phase. Two simplifications were also evaluated for the simulation of the closing phase only. One employs an FSI model with a rigid root and the other uses a \"dry\" (without flow) model. Numerical tests were performed to verify the model. New metrics were defined to process the results in terms of leaflet coaptation area and contact pressure. The axial displacement of the leaflets, closure time and coaptation parameters were similar in the two FSI models, whereas the dry model, with imposed uniform load on the leaflets, produced larger coaptation area and contact pressure, larger axial displacement and faster closure time compared with the FSI model. The differences were up to 30% in the coaptation area, 55% in the contact pressure and 170% in the closure time. Consequently, an FSI model should be used to accurately resolve the kinematics of the aortic valve and leaflet coaptation details during the end-closing stage.", "paper_title": "A fluid-structure interaction model of the aortic valve with coaptation and compliant aortic root", "paper_id": "WOS:000300293200009"}
