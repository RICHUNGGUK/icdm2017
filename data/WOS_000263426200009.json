There is, however, an alternative way to describe waves in the vasculature based upon the method-of-characteristics solution of 1-D conservation laws. This method, wave intensity analysis (WIA), can be used to describe periodic waves but can also be used to describe the propagation of non-periodic waves that cannot be practically described in terms of sinusoidal wavetrains. As a means of demonstrating how WIA defines a wave, we used data gathered in a simple bench-top experiment where a single disturbance propagated along a single elastic tube and was reflected and re-reflected between a closed and a relatively open end. Results demonstrate that forward- and backward-travelling peaks of intensity usefully define wave interactions.", "paper_title": "Wave as defined by wave intensity analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000263426200009"}
