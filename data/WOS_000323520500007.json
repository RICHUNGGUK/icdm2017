Apparently, we should put these m subpixels as a rectangle such that the blocks can be arranged compactly with each other. However, if the aspect ratio is viewed as important information of the secret image, the distortion occurs at the case that m is not a square. An aspect ratio invariant VCS (ARIVCS) was accordingly proposed to address the arrangement of subpixels. However, the existing ARIVCSs relied on adding dummy subpixels to the shadow images. In addition, their method needs a mapping pattern that reduces the number of dummy subpixels, but how to design a mapping pattern is a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose an easy solution to construct ARIVCS by image filtering and resizing.", "paper_title": "Aspect ratio invariant visual cryptography by image filtering and resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500007"}
