As the data generation rates of sensors may vary, some sensors need to be visited more frequently than others. In this paper, a partitioning-based algorithm is presented that schedules the movements of MEs in a sensor network such that there is no data loss due to buffer overflow. Simulation results show that the proposed Partitioning-Based Scheduling (PBS) algorithm performs well in terms of reducing the minimum required ME speed to prevent data loss, providing high predictability in inter-visit durations, and minimizing the data loss rate for the cases when the ME is constrained to move slower than the minimum required ME speed.
