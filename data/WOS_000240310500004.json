Then, we present iterative algorithms for the IRE minimization, where we use the projection approximation. The proposed algorithm is referred to as COnstrained Projection Approximation (COPA) algorithm and its limiting case is called COPAL. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these algorithms successfully find exact principal eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix.", "paper_title": "Constrained projection approximation algorithms for principal component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240310500004"}
