These two features enhance model adaptation to the input data, improving compression efficiency, and enable greater throughputs as a multiplicity of bytes can be processed per cycle. A parsing mechanism adjusts the width of dictionary words to natural words while the length of the dictionary grows from an initial empty state to a maximum value defined as a run-time configuration parameter. The compressor/decompressor architecture was prototyped on an FPGA-based PCI board. An ASIC hard-macro was subsequently implemented and achieved a throughput of more than 1 gigabyte per second when clocking at 277 MHz on a high-performance, 0.13 mu m, eight-layer copper CMOS process.", "paper_title": "Gigabyte per second streaming lossless data compression hardware based on a configurable variable-geometry CAM dictionary", "paper_id": "WOS:000235397100006"}
