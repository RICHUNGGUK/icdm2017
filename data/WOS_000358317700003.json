First, the structure and a canonical form decomposition of any -constacyclic -linear code over are presented. By use of this decomposition, enumeration, construction, encoder and dual codes of these codes are investigated. Then self-orthogonal and self-dual negacyclic -linear codes over are studied, and a precisely expression for self-dual negacyclic -linear codes over is obtained.", "paper_title": "Constacyclic -linear codes over", "paper_id": "WOS:000358317700003"}
