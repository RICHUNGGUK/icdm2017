First, we elaborate a recurrent mixture density network for explicit modeling of the time conditional mixing coefficients, as well as the means and variances of its Gaussian mixture components. Second, we derive training equations with which all the network weights are inferred in the maximum likelihood framework. Crucially, we calculate temporal derivatives through time for dynamic estimation of the variance network parameters. Experimental results show that, when compared with a traditional linear heteroskedastic model, as well as with the nonlinear mixture density network trained with static derivatives, our dynamic recurrent network converges to more accurate results with better statistical characteristics and economic performance.
