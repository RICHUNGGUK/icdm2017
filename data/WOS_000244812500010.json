An alternative approach is an information broker system, drawing from departmental data sources. A 3-year study in health and social care has produced a first demonstrator which can search for specified information in heterogeneous distributed data stores, with source-specific permission can copy it, and then merge the search results into one integrated picture in a real-time process which is also captured in an audit system. The research project has addressed a number of issues during the study, including updating the concepts of role-based access, semantic interoperability, and harnessing web-based services bound at the time of need. A demonstrator now exists, and provides a platform for further application and development research. This paper summarises how this opens up a viable alternative approach for the next generation of health record systems, enabling record searching and integration as and when it is needed for specific patient-related purposes, whilst being independent of organisations, diagnostic approaches, or service delivery structures, and reducing the risks of data swamping.
