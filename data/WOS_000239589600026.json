This situation has created many new challenges. One of them is the need to study text and electronic documents in depth and in a reasonable time. Blind students cannot flip through the pages of a book, skim through the text or use a highlighter. In this paper, we propose a solution in the form of an experimental prototype and show how natural language processing techniques can profitably assist blind students in meeting their academic objectives. The techniques used include the automatic creation of indices, passage retrieval and the use of WordNet for query rewriting. The paper presents a technology application of a practically usable software. The system was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluation is very encouraging and supports further investigation.", "paper_title": "Using natural language processing to assist the visually handicapped in writing compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600026"}
