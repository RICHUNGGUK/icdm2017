But many schemes of that kind are under different attacks. Recently, Kumari et al. pointed that Chen et al.'s scheme and Li et al.'s scheme with the smart card were not secure. They proposed two improved schemes. Unfortunately, we find that the two schemes are not secure. The first scheme of Kumari et al. is under the de-synchronization attack and lacks strong forward security. The second has the weaknesses including no user anonymity and password leaking. Also, it cannot withstand the user-impersonation attack. We present a new scheme also based on the smart card overcoming common disadvantages and give a formal proof. We also use the tool ProVerif to verify the security of our scheme. Compared with some recent schemes, our scheme performs well, and it is fit for network applications.
