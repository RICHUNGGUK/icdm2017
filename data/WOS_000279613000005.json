Selecting proper wavelet details, the ECG signals are denoised and beat locations are detected. Beat locations are later used to locate the peaks of the individual waves present in each cardiac cycle. Onsets and offsets of the P and T waves are also detected. These are considered as ECG features which are later used for arrhythmia detection utilizing a novel fuzzy classifier. Fourteen types of arrhythmias and abnormalities can be detected implementing the proposed procedure. We have evaluated the algorithm on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Application of the wavelet filter with the scaling function which closely resembles the shape of the ECG signal has been shown to provide precise results in this study.", "paper_title": "A fast expert system for electrocardiogram arrhythmia detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000279613000005"}
