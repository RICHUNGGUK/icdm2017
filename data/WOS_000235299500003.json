This approach provides us with insights into the interplay between rules when inducing answer sets. We start with different characterizations of answer sets in terms of totally colored dependency graphs that differ ill graph-theoretical aspects. We then develop a series of operational characterizations of answer sets in terms of operators on partial colorings. In analogy to the notion of a derivation in proof theory, our operational characterizations are expressed as (non-deterministically formed) sequences of colorings, turning an uncolored graph into a totally colored one. In this way, we obtain an operational framework in which different combinations of operators result in different formal properties. Among others, we identify the basic strategy employed by the noMoRe system and justify its algorithmic approach. Furthermore, we distinguish operations corresponding to Fitting's operator as well as to well-founded semantics.", "paper_title": "Graphs and colorings for answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000235299500003"}
