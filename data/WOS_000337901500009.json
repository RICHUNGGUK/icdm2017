While much research has been conducted on various security issues of workflow systems, the workflow satisfiability problem, which asks whether a set of users together can complete a workflow, is recently identified as an important research problem that needs more investigation. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of the problem along two directions: one is by considering either one path or all paths of a workflow, and the other is by considering the possible patterns in a workflow. We have shown that the general workflow satisfiability analysis problem is intractable. This result motivates us to consider restrictions on workflow control-flow patterns and access control policies, and to identify tractable cases of practical interest.", "paper_title": "Satisfiability Analysis of Workflows with Control-Flow Patterns and Authorization Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000337901500009"}
