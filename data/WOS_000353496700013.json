This scheme enables the NCSs design to enjoy advantages of both time-triggered and event-triggered systems. The proposed scheme compares current measurement with last transmitted measurement. If difference between them is less than a prescribed percentage of the current measurements then no measurement is transmitted to controller and the controller always uses the last transmitted measurements to calculate feedback gains. Moreover, this technique is applied to controller output as well. The stability criteria for closed-loop system is formulated using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. The sufficient conditions for the controller are given in terms of solvability of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). These BMIs are converted into quasi-convex linear matrix inequalities that are solved using the cone complementarity linearisation algorithm. A simulation example is used to evaluate how effective the simple congestion control scheme is in reducing network bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity dynamic output feedback control of networked control systems with congestion control", "paper_id": "WOS:000353496700013"}
