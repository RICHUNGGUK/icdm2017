This modularity ensures the easy configuration of custom-made protocols that can be optimized depending on the problem in hand. CRDOCK employs a precomputed library of ligand conformations that are initially generated from one-dimensional SMILES strings. Testing CRDOCK on two widely used benchmarks, the ASTEX diverse set and the Directory of Useful Decoys, yielded a success rate of similar to 75% in pose prediction and an average AUC of 0.66. A typical ligand can be docked, on average, in just similar to 13 s. Extension to a representative group of pharmacologically relevant G protein-coupled receptors that have been recently cocrystallized with some selective ligands allowed us to demonstrate the utility of this tool and also highlight some current limitations. CRDOCK is now included within VSDMIP our integrated platform for drug discovery", "paper_title": "CRDOCK: An Ultrafast Multipurpose Protein-Ligand Docking Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000308254200038"}
