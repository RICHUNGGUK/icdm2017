The approach provides a systematic procedure for flight control design process with a set of design tools that enables control engineers to rapidly synthesize, analyze and validate a candidate controller design. A model-based environment integrated with control synthesis, off-line and real-time simulation is developed for flight control synthesis, analysis and testings. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated framework is demonstrated by applying the framework approach to a small UAV testbed. Software-in-the-loop, processor-in-the-loop and flight testings are conducted with the synthesized controller implemented. Closed-loop performance and robustness results obtained are presented.
