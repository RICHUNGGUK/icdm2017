The performance metric per class is the mean bandwidth allocated to connections in the class possibly scaled by appropriate factors. We first provide a bandwidth adaptation policy that maximizes a linear combination of class performance metrics; then, we use this result to characterize the region where the class performance metrics lie under any bandwidth adaptation policy. Based on the results above we use stochastic approximation techniques to provide a policy that optimizes a combination of concave rewards associated with class performance metrics. Finally, we propose a modification of the optimal policy to account for the case where connection holding times are unknown, and study its performance through simulations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
