To this end, a number of development methodologies with their respective characteristics are described: model-based methodologies, user-centred processes, usability engineering methodologies and accessibility engineering methodologies. Some of these methodologies are provided with specific supporting tools which facilitate the accomplishment of specified tasks. However, there are methodologies which are not supported by specific tools. Therefore, web developers must deal with diverse tools in order to perform the corresponding activities. In this context, the development of accessible web applications is even more difficult. This paper concludes that there is not currently a holistic development framework to be used throughout the whole development process. Our contribution relies on a set of tools that support the different phases of the process. Since these tools are developed upon a common methodological basis, a high rate of interoperability is obtained. This cohesion allows their integration in a comprehensive framework so that the development of accessible web applications is facilitated.", "paper_title": "Supporting the Development of Accessible Web Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754200007"}
