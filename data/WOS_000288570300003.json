Design/methodology/approach - In order to assess the level of interoperability in the system, two essential concepts of the system are identified and traced in every level of the three-layer information architecture. Federated repositories are studied for the level of accessibility that they can offer. Knowledge representation level, mediator level and the semantic portal are studied for expressiveness capabilities. Findings - EIAH information architecture is capable of establishing links among resources available in the information pools connected to the system by using EIAH metadata application profile (EMAP). Different modules in this architecture, which are localized for the Persian language, can work on similar environments for other languages, for example Arabic. Originality/value - EIAH is the first example of a digital encyclopedia for the history of Iranian architecture, which is basically different from other digital encyclopedias in the way that it offers information to users. EIAH is aimed at domain experts and provides them not with pre-written and quality articles but with a wide range of resources and documents relative to what they are seeking.", "paper_title": "EIAH data model Semantic interoperability among distributed digital repositories", "paper_id": "WOS:000288570300003"}
