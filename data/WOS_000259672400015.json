Science instruments onboard a modern deep-space spacecraft can acquire much more data that can be downloaded to Earth, given the limited communication bandwidth. Onboard data analysis offers a means of compressing the huge amounts of data collected and downloading only the most valuable subset of the collected data. In this paper, we describe algorithms for detecting dust devils and clouds onboard Mars rovers, and summarize the results. These algorithms achieve the accuracy required by planetary scientists, as well as the runtime, CPU, memory, and bandwidth constraints set by the engineering mission parameters. The detectors have been uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rovers, and currently are operational. These detectors are the first onboard science analysis processes on Mars.", "paper_title": "Automatic detection of dust devils and clouds on Mars", "paper_id": "WOS:000259672400015"}
