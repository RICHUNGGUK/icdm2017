First, we show that the convergence domain of the GY algorithm can be extended with the benefit of an improved convergence rate. Second, we provide a precise comparison of the convergence rates for both algorithms. This analysis shows that the GR form does not benefit from a better convergence rate in general. Moreover, the GY iterates often take advantage of a low cost implementation. In this case, the GY form is usually faster than the GR form from the CPU time viewpoint.", "paper_title": "On global and local convergence of half-quadratic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236807100008"}
