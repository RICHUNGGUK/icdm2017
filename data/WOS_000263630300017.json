To facilitate the ease of use, the simulator is developed in C++ language with a modular structure so that different users or planners can customize the modules according to their specifications. We further develop a mathematical model for the workforce capacity planning problem, where the uncertainty of the demand is handled by the safety stock concepts. We also suggest a number of practical planning alternatives and assignment rules based on information from IBM. These rules are implemented as modules in SimMan and tested numerically to provide managerial insights. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
