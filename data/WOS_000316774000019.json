Various degrees of conformational changes in the main and side chains occur when binding with other molecules, such as small ligands or proteins. The ligand-induced structural polymorphism of proteins is also referred to as \"induced-fit\", and it plays an important role in the recognition of a particular class of ligands as well as in signal transduction. We have developed new prediction models that discriminate conformationally fluctuant residues caused by ligand-binding. The training and test data sets were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The induced-fit residues were judged based on the Z values of the C alpha atom distances in each protein cluster. Moreover, we introduced various descriptors, such as the number of residues, accessible surface area (ASA), depth of the residue, and position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which were obtained from the 2D- or 3D-structural information for the protein. After the optimization of the parameters by 5-fold cross validation, the best prediction model was applied to some well-known induced-fit target proteins to verify its effectiveness. Especially in the validation for the DFG motif of a protein kinase family, we succeeded in the prediction of the DFG-out possibility from only the DFG-in conformation of each kinase structure.", "paper_title": "Prediction of Ligand-Induced Structural Polymorphism of Receptor Interaction Sites Using Machine Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000316774000019"}
