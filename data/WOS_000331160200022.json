Many researchers have addressed it in the framework of the AHP. The AHP has many advantages. However, the incomplete information resulted from the limited precision of human assessments reduces its effectiveness in many applications. In this paper, a new method is proposed for decision-making by incomplete information based on evidence distance with using of DS theory to extend the AHP. The main feature of the proposed method is the weight of criteria are assigned with the consistency and similarity of the opinions from experts or decision makers. The operation of preferences is defined in the framework of DS theory. The final decision is obtained with pignistic probability transformation. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the reasonability of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
