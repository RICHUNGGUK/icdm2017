Analysis of the structural parameters indicates that the nanotube is resistant against the external electric field strengths. Analysis of the electronic structure of the nanotube indicates that the applied parallel electric field strengths have a much stronger interaction with the nanotube with respect to the transverse electric field strengths and the nanotube is easier to modulate by the applied parallel electric field. Our results show that the properties of the nanotube can be controlled by the proper external electric field for use in nano-electronic circuits.", "paper_title": "Electric field effect on the zigzag (6,0) single-wall BC2N nanotube for use in nano-electronic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100008"}
