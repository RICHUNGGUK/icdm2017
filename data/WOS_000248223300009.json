The proposed family is based on the cognitive plausible cone-based model. We formally define the directional relations that can be expressed in each model of the family. Then, we use our formal framework to study two interesting problems: computing the inverse of a directional relation and composing two directional relations. For the composition operator, in particular, we concentrate on two commonly used definitions, namely, consistency-based and existential composition. Our formal framework allows us to prove that our solutions are correct. The presented solutions are handled in a uniform manner and apply to all of the models of the family.", "paper_title": "A family of directional relation models for extended objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000248223300009"}
