The essential numerical properties of the IRK2 time-integration scheme, viz., nodal amplification factor, phase speed and group velocity have been quantified and plotted at all the nodal points of the computational domain as functions of the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number) and wavenumber for various explicit and implicit spatial discretization schemes. Results show that IRK2 scheme produces neutral stability at all interior nodes for all CFL numbers. This has been shown that while using IRK2 scheme one has to use refined grid at high CFL numbers for dispersion relation preservation property. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
