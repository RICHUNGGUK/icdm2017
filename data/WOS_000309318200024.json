By studying the distribution of the eigenvalues of the corresponding transcendental characteristic equation of the linearization of this equation, we derive the critical values where Hopf-pitchfork bifurcation occurs. Then, by computing the normal forms for the system, the bifurcation diagrams are obtained. Furthermore, we find some interesting phenomena, such as the coexistence of two asymptotically stable states, two stable periodic orbits, and two attractive quasi-periodic motions, which are verified both theoretically and numerically.
