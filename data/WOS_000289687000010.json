In such formulation, the objective function is equal to work done by the given external forces minus work done by the reaction forces on prescribed non-zero displacement. When only one type of boundary condition is specified, it degenerates to the formulation of minimum structural compliance design (with external force) and maximum structural strain energy design (with prescribed non-zero displacement). However, regardless of boundary condition types, the sensitivity of such objective function with respect to artificial element density is always proportional to the negative of average strain energy density. We show that this formulation provides optimum design for both discrete and continuum structures.", "paper_title": "A general formulation of structural topology optimization for maximizing structural stiffness", "paper_id": "WOS:000289687000010"}
