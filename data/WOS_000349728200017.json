Video communication of these traffic cameras over real-world limited bandwidth networks can frequently suffer network congestion or unstable bandwidth, especially in regard to wireless systems. This often hinders the detection of moving vehicles in variable bit-rate video streams. This paper presents a novel approach for vehicle detection based on probabilistic neural networks through artificial neural networks, which can accurately detect moving vehicles not only in high bit-rate video streams but also in low bit-rate video streams. The overall results of detection accuracy analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has a substantially higher degree of both qualitative and quantitative efficacy than other state-of-the-art methods. For instance, the proposed method achieved Similarity and F-1 accuracy rates that were up to 61.75% and 69.38% higher than the other compared methods, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
