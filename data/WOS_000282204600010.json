In this paper, we provide the latest specification of NR-SACKs, and extend the investigation of throughput improvements that NR-SACKs can provide. Using ns-2 simulation, for various loss conditions and bandwidth-delay combinations, we show that the throughput observed with NR-SACKs is at least equal and sometimes better than the throughput observed with SACKs. We introduce \"region of gain\" which defines for a given bandwidth, delay, and send buffer size combination, what range of loss rates results in significant throughput improvement when NR-SACKs are used instead of SACKs. In both sap and CMT. NR-SACKs provide greater throughput improvement as the send buffer size decreases, and as end-to-end delay decreases. Provided that the bandwidth-delay product (BDP) >= send buffer size, additional bandwidth does not increase NR-SACKs' throughput improvements for either SCTP or CMT. For BDPs < send buffer size, the throughput improvement decreases as the BDP decreases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
