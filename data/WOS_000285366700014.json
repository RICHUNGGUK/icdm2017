Such a PLIS query is useful in applications such as business planning. We propose and tackle both monochromatic and bichromatic versions (i.e. M-PLIS and B-PLIS, respectively) of the PLIS query. In order to efficiently answer PLIS queries, we present three pruning methods, MINMAX, Regional, and Candidate pruning, which can effectively reduce the PLIS search space. The proposed pruning methods can be seamlessly integrated into efficient query procedures. Moreover, we also study important variants of PLIS query with uncertain query object (i.e. UQ-PLIS). Furthermore, we formulate and tackle the PLIS problem on uncertain moving objects (i.e. UMOD-PLIS). Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches under various settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
