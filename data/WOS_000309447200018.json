The main result is a characterization of acceptance conditions for which the emptiness problem for these automata is decidable. This result implies new decidability results for fragments of timed temporal logics. It is also shown that, unlike for MITL, the characterisation remains the same even if no punctual constraints are allowed.", "paper_title": "WEAK ALTERNATING TIMED AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000309447200018"}
