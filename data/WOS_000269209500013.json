The wavelength converters can be full range or circular-type limited range. We use the algorithmic methods devised for Markov chains of block-tridiagonal type in addition to fixed-point iterations to approximately solve this relatively complex system. In our approach, we also take into account the finite number of fiber interfaces using the Engset traffic model rather than the usual Poisson traffic modeling. The proposed analytical method provides an accurate approximation for full range systems for relatively large number of interfaces and for circular-type limited range wavelength conversion systems for which the tuning range is relatively narrow.", "paper_title": "Fixed point analysis of limited range share per node wavelength conversion in asynchronous optical packet switching systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000269209500013"}
