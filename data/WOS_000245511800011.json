Although many class comparisons concerned only a single phenotype, simultaneous assessment of the relationship between gene expression and multiple phenotypes would be warranted to better understand the underlying biological structure. Results: We develop a method to select genes related to multiple clinical phenotypes based on a set of multivariate linear regression models. For each gene, we perform model selection based on the doubly-adjusted R-square statistic and use the maximum of this statistic for gene selection. The method can substantially improve the power in gene selection, compared with a conventional method that uses a single model exclusively for gene selection. Application to a bladder cancer study to correlate pre-treatment gene expressions with pathological stage and grade is given. The methods would be useful for screening for genes related to multiple clinical phenotypes.", "paper_title": "Genomic characterization of multiple clinical phenotypes of cancer using multivariate linear regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000245511800011"}
