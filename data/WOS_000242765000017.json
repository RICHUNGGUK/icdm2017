The weight of a subtree T-1 of T is defined as the product of weights of vertices and edges of T-1. We obtain a linear-time algorithm to count the sum of weights of subtrees of T. As applications, we characterize the tree with the diameter at least d, which has the maximum number of subtrees, and we characterize the tree with the maximum degree at least Delta, which has the minimum number of subtrees.
