[5-7,9-11] presented a rational method to decide the number of clusters with fuzzy clustering. In other words, this is a problem to find the optimal level as to a partition tree. In this paper we would improve their methods by use of AIC (Akaike's information criterion) to show that the new statistical technique is able to find a statistically optimal level of fuzzy clustering. Furthermore we investigate advantage and disadvantage of the AIC method using some examples of fuzzy partition trees via a numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "FUZZY CLUSTERING LEVEL ANALYSIS VIA STATISTICAL SCHEME APPLYING AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000260104100009"}
