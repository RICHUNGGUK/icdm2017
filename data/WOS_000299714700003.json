But, when a system component fails, the system's objectives can no longer be achieved. For many years, numerous studies have proposed efficient fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) algorithms. This paper considers faults that lead to the complete failure of actuators. In this specific case, the system's physical structure changes, and the system model thus becomes incorrect. The potential that the system has to continue to achieve its objectives has to be re-evaluated from a qualitative point of view, before recalculating or modifying the control algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a self-updating system model to reflect the current system potential, a formulation of system objectives using temporal logic, and a verification method based on model checking to verify whether the objectives can still be achieved by the faulty system. The systems considered are discrete-continuous systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
