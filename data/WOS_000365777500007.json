As the energy consumption predictions for HPC show increasing numbers, it is important to make users aware of the energy spent for the execution of their applications. Drawing from our experience with exposing cost and performance in public clouds, in this paper we present a generic mechanism to compute fast and accurate estimates for the trade-offs between the performance (expressed as makespan) and the energy consumption of applications running on HPC clusters. We validate our approach by implementing it in a prototype, called E-BaTS and validating it with a wide variety of HPC bags-of-tasks. Our experiments show that E-BaTS produces conservative estimates with errors below 5%, while requiring at most 12% of the energy and time of an exhaustive search for providing configurations close to the optimal ones in terms of trade-offs between energy consumption and makespan.", "paper_title": "E-BaTS: Energy-Aware Scheduling for Bag-of-Task Applications in HPC Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000365777500007"}
