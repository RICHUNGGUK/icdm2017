The new formulation, called thin layer method, is able to absorb all kind of energies. It computes the associated mode shapes for both Rayleigh and Love surface waves in saturated soil. In this method, effect of pore water pressure generation is considered in three-dimensional condition. In the soil-structure interaction analysis the submerged condition affects significantly the characteristics of the waves generated by the dynamic excitations and increases the soil stiffness when loading rate is fast relative to the pore fluid diffusions rate. The present method can take into account the effects of pore fluid motions relative to the soil skeleton and thus the effects of submerged soil. Good results with compare to analytical solution in spite of zero distance between structure and boundary shows that this absorbing boundary can greatly suppress spuriously reflected waves and efficiently model the far field of the system with sufficient accuracy.
