Two Hamiltonian paths P1 = (u(1), u(2), ..., u(n)) and P-2 = (v(1), v(2),..., v(n)) of G are said to be independent if u(1) = v(1), u(n) = v(n), and u(i) not equal v(i) for all 1 < i < n. A set of Hamiltonian paths {P-1, P-2, ..., P-k} of G are mutually independent if any two different Hamiltonian paths in the set are independent. It is well-known that an n-dimensional hyper-cube Q(n) is bipartite with two partite sets of equal-size. Let F be the set of faulty edges of Q(n) such that vertical bar F vertical bar <= n - 2. In this paper, we show that Q(n) - F contains (n - vertical bar F vertical bar - 1)-mutually independent Hamiltonian paths between any two vertices from different partite sets, where n >= 2.", "paper_title": "Fault-free pairwise independent Hamiltonian paths on faulty hypercubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500031"}
