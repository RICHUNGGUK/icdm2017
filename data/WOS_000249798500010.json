DNA strands can be viewed as finite strings over the alphabet {A, G, C, T}, and are used in DNA computing to encode information. Due to the fact that A is Watson-Crick complementary to T and G to C, DNA single strands that are. Watson-Crick complementary can bind to each other or to themselves in either intended or unintended ways. One of the structures that is usually undesirable for biocomputation, since it makes the affected DNA string unavailable for future interactions, is the hairpin: If some subsequences of a DNA single string are Complementary to each other, the string will bind to itself forming a hairpin-like structure. This paper studies a mathematical formalization of a particular case of hairpins, the Watson-Crick bordered words. A Watson-Crick bordered word is a word with the property that it has a prefix that is Watson-Crick complementary to its suffix. More generally, we investigate the notion of theta-bordered words, where theta is a morphic or antimorphic involution. We show that the set of all theta-bordered words is regular, when theta is an antimorphic involution and the set of all theta-bordered words is context-sensitive when theta is a morphic involution. We study the properties of theta-bordered and theta-unbordered words and also the relation between theta-bordered and theta-unbordered words and certain type of involution codes.", "paper_title": "Involutively bordered words", "paper_id": "WOS:000249798500010"}
