However, the misuse of these techniques may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. Nevertheless, undesired side effects, e. g., nonsensitive rules falsely hidden and spurious rules falsely generated, may be produced in the rule hiding process. In this paper, we present a novel approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the transaction database to decrease the supports or confidences of sensitive rules without producing the side effects. Since the correlation among rules can make it impossible to achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose heuristic methods for increasing the number of hidden sensitive rules and reducing the number of modified entries. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, i.e., undesired side effects are avoided in the rule hiding process. The results also report that in most cases, all the sensitive rules are hidden without spurious rules falsely generated. Moreover, the good scalability of our approach in terms of database size and the influence of the correlation among rules on rule hiding are observed.", "paper_title": "Hiding sensitive association rules with limited side effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000242041400003"}
