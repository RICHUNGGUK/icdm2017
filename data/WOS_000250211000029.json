The sweep trajectory curves of the generic hand model are modified to interpolate a sequence of keyframes determined by target featnres. Details of the real hand can be transferred to the model by adjusting its sweep displacement map. Palm lines are also acquired from sketches drawn on the photograph. The bespoke model inherits the fully animatable structure of the generic model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our sweep-based approach using several examples of reconstructing animatable bespoke hand models.
