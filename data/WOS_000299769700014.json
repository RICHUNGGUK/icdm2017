The Al12X clusters can tightly bind to DNA bases and BPs to form stable complexes with negative binding Gibbs free energies at room temperature, and considerable charge transfers occur between the bases/BPs and the Al12X clusters. These strong interactions, which are also expected for larger Al nanoparticles, may have potentially adverse impacts on the structure and stability of DNA and thus cause its dysfunction.", "paper_title": "Interactions between Al12X (X = Al, C, N and P) nanoparticles and DNA nucleobases/base pairs: implications for nanotoxicity", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700014"}
