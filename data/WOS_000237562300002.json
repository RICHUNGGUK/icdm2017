We focus on the MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY problem, in which the bidirectional links established by the transmission ranges are required to form a connected graph. Implicit in previous work on transmission range assignment under asymmetric connectivity requirements is the proof that MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY is NP-hard and that the MST algorithm has a performance ratio of 2. In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) we show that the related MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC UNICAST problem can be solved efficiently by a shortest-path computation in an appropriately constructed auxiliary graph; (2) we give an exact branch and cut algorithm based on a new integer linear program formulation solving instances with up to 35-40 nodes in 1 hour; (3) we establish the similarity between MIN-POWER SYMMETRIC CONNECTIVITY and the classic STEINER TREE problem in graphs, and use this similarity to give a polynomial-time approximation scheme with performance ratio approaching 5/3 as well as a more practical approximation algorithm with approximation factor 11/6; and (4) we give the results of a comprehensive experimental study comparing new and previously proposed heuristics with the above exact and approximation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Power efficient range assignment for symmetric connectivity in static ad hoc wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237562300002"}
