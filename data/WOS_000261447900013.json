The twin-transistor design is the current state-of-the-art design to enhance the noise immunity in dynamic CMOS circuits. To achieve the high noise-tolerant capability, in this paper, we propose a new isolated noise-tolerant (INT) technique which is a mechanism to isolate noise tolerant circuits from noise interference. Simulation results show that the proposed 8-bit INT Manchester adder can achieve 1.66 x average noise threshold energy (ANTE) improvement. In addition, it can save 34% power delay product (PDP) in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments as compared with the 8-bit twin-transistor Manchester adder under TSMC 0.18-mu m process.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of Isolated Noise-Tolerant (INT) Technique in Dynamic CMOS Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000261447900013"}
