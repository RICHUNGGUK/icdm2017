Clusters are the most common solution for high performance computing at the present time. In this kind of systems, an important subject is the parallel I/O subsystem design. Parallel file systems (GPFS, PVFS, Lustre, etc) have been the solution used to obtain high performance I/O. Parallel file systems increase performance by distributing data file across several I/O nodes. However, cluster's size is increasing continuously, specially for compute nodes, becoming the I/O nodes in a possible bottleneck of the system. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that solves the problem pointed out before: new hierarchical I/O architecture based on parallel I/O proxies. Those I/O proxies execute on the compute nodes offering an intermediate parallel file system between the applications and the storage system of the cluster. That architecture reduces the load on the I/O nodes increasing the global performance. This paper shows the design of the proposed solution and a preliminary evaluation, using a cluster located in the Stuttgart HLRS center.", "paper_title": "A new I/O architecture for improving the performance in large scale clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900012"}
