The expression results from the continuous action of an interpreter through a gestural control interface. In this context, expressive features of voice are discussed. New real-time implementations of a spectral model of glottal flow (CALM) are described. These interactive modules are then used to identify and quantify voice quality dimensions. Experiments are conducted in order to develop a first framework for voice quality control. The representation of vocal tract and the control of several vocal tract movements are explained and a solution is proposed and integrated. Finally, some typical controllers are connected to the system and expressivity is evaluated.", "paper_title": "REALTIME AND ACCURATE MUSICAL CONTROL OF EXPRESSION IN SINGING SYNTHESIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536500004"}
