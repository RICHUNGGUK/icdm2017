The scheme is simple and flexible, and more accurate than the finite volume, flux-form semi-Lagrangian, Lax-Wendroff scheme, and the others presented in Chu and Fan [3]. Compared with the analytic solution, the scheme with the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinetics and Shuman smoothing produces less dispersion than that using the 4th-order advection without smoothing. The results also confirm the perturbation theory that predicts solitary waves of large amplitude containing a region of recirculating fluid trapped within the moving disturbance. The general patterns simulated from the initial zeroth-order solutions and the sum of the zeroth-and first-order solutions remain very similar, although the detail and propagation speed can be different.
