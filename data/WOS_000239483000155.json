The uncertain system is composed of unknown part and known part represented by a mathematical model. A fuzzy basis function network (FBFN) is trained offline to represent the model of unknown part. AFBFN is trained online to represent the unknown model included the unknown fault. The reference model is composed of the known mathematical model and FBFN. According to outputs of actual system, AFBFN and reference model, another AFBFN is adopted to complete the fault-tolerance process and obtain the feedback control input of the uncertain system, which makes the actual system to track output of the reference model. A simulation example of the multi-machine coupling power systems is given to validate the method. The result proved its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fuzzy basis function network based fault-tolerant stable control of multi-machine power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000155"}
