The codebook is firstly sorted using the unidirectional static distance-order technique to improve the correlation among the neighboring indices. The two-dimensional structure of image and the high correlation among the neighboring blocks are used to update the self-organized list L in the improved locally adaptive coding scheme (ILAS). Then a new embedding rule according to the complexity of the region at which the current block locates and the position of current block index in the list L is proposed to obtain a better embedding capacity. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has a better performance in terms of compression rate, embedding capacity and embedding rate compared with the related data hiding methods.
