Two mainstream paradigms to date, lexicon-based and distributional approaches, both exhibit pros and cons with regard to coverage, complexity, and quality. In this paper, we propose three novel methods-two rule-based methods and one machine learning approach-to identify synonyms from definition texts in a machine-readable dictionary. Extracted synonyms are evaluated in two extrinsic experiments and one intrinsic experiment. Evaluation results show that our pattern-based approach achieves best performance in one of the experiments and satisfactory results in the other, comparable to corpus-based state-of-the-art results.", "paper_title": "Exploring patterns in dictionary definitions for synonym extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000307467600003"}
