Standard RCC models are continuous ones where each region is infinitely divisible. This contrasts sharply with the predominant use of finite, discrete models in applications. In a recent paper, Li et al. (2004) initiate a study of countable models that can be constructed step by step from finite models. Of course, some basic problems are left unsolved, for example, how many non-isomorphic countable RCC models are there? This paper investigates these problems and obtains the following results: (i) the exotic RCC model described by Gotts (1996) is isomorphic to the minimal model given by Li and Ying (2004); (ii) there are continuum many non-isomorphic minimal RCC models, where a model is minimal if it can be isomorphically embedded in each RCC model.", "paper_title": "On minimal models of the Region Connection Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000242302000004"}
