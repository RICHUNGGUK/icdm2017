This is why AR is often used in assistive technologies for cognitively impaired people to evaluate their abilities to undertake activities of daily living. In a real-life scenario, multiple-resident AR has been considered as a very challenging problem, primarily due to the complexity of data association. In addition, most prior research has not considered the potential interpersonal interactions among residents to simplify complexity, especially in an environment monitored by ambient sensors. In this study, we propose two types of multiuser activity models, both of which are derived from an interaction-feature enhanced multiuser model learning framework. These two models consider interpersonal interactions and data association for multiuser AR using ambient sensors. We then compare their performance with the other two baseline models with or without consideration of data association and interpersonal interactions. The experimental results show that the derived models outperform other baseline classifiers. Therefore, the proposed approach can increase the opportunities for providing context-aware services for a multiresident smart home.", "paper_title": "Interaction-Feature Enhanced Multiuser Model Learning for a Home Environment Using Ambient Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000342345100003"}
