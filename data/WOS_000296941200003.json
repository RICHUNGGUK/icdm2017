An adaptive neural controller is designed by utilizing the approximation technique of neural network. The key feature in this work is to remove the requirement on the boundedness of unknown nonlinear functions that is usually encountered in the existing works. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is robustly stable. Finally, numerical simulation results are given. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
