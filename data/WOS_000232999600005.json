The \"gappy\" POD is an extension to this method that allows the consideration of incomplete data sets. In this paper, the gappy POD is extended to handle unsteady flow reconstruction problems, such as those encountered when limited flow measurement data is available. In addition, a systematic approach for effective sensor placement is formulated within the gappy framework using a condition number criterion. This criterion allows for accurate flow reconstruction results and yields sensor configurations that are robust to sensor noise. Two applications are considered. The first aims to reconstruct the unsteady flow field using a small number of surface pressure measurements for a subsonic airfoil undergoing plunging motion. The second considers estimation of POD modal content of a cylinder wake flow for active control purposes. In both cases, using the dominant POD basis vectors and a small number of sensor signals, the gappy approach is found to yield accurate flow reconstruction results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
