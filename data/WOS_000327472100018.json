We define a natural partial order on the set of codes, and show how to construct effectively a code better than a given sequence of codes, in a certain precise sense. As an application, we prove that the existence of a scale of codes (a well-ordered set of codes which contains a code better than any given code) is independent of ZFC.", "paper_title": "UNIVERSAL CODES OF THE NATURAL NUMBERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327472100018"}
