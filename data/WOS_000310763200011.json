Preallocation of sampling efforts of size two to each undetermined subnetwork on each stage makes it possible to estimate the variance of the proposed estimator and significantly enhances the effectiveness of variance reduction from stratification by deferring the termination of recursive stratification. Empirical results show that the proposed estimator achieves significant variance reduction, especially for highly reliable networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
