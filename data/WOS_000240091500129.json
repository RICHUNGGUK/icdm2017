We introduce hybrid learning methodology that integrates genetic algorithms (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to find optimal subsets of genes for tissue/cancer classification. This method was tested on two published microarray datasets: (1) NCI60 cancer cell lines and (2) the GCM dataset. Experimental results on classifying both datasets show that our GA/ANN method not only outperformed many reported prediction approaches, but also reduced the number of predictive genes needed in classification analysis.", "paper_title": "Multiclass microarray data classification using GA/ANN method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500129"}
