Deformation calculation is one of the major concerns during the design process. Using Winkler foundation model and with consideration of the interface resistance effect, a deformation control differential equation for the geocell reinforced mattress under the vertical symmetric loads is presented in this paper. The corresponding power-series semi analytic solutions for the displacements and the internal forces of geocell reinforcement are also presented. Furthermore, the influence factors such as loads, length and flexural rigidity of geocell reinforcement, coefficient of subgrade reaction and the interface resistance on the stress-deformation characteristic of geocell reinforcement are discussed. Finally, two examples are employed to verify the presented method. This study suggests that the effect of the interface resistance on the deformation of geocell reinforcement should be considered in engineering design.
