In recent years, some modern global optimization methods have been developed with success in treating various types of problems, but very few of these methods have been applied to geotechnical problems. In this paper, use of a modified particle swarm optimization method with a termination criterion is proposed. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be effective and efficient in solving complicated problems with a high level of confidence. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
