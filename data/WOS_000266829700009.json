When switched nonlinear systems have uniform normal form and the zero dynamics of uniform normal form is asymptotically stable under an arbitrary switching law, state feedbacks are designed and a common quadratic Lyapunov function of all the closed-loop subsystems is constructed to realize quadratic stabilizability of the class of switched nonlinear systems under an arbitrary switching law. The results of this paper are also applied to switched linear systems.", "paper_title": "Quadratic stabilization of switched nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000266829700009"}
