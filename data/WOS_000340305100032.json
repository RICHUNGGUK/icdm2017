In reality this is not always the case and failures can occur at any depth. This paper aims to study the effect of boundary conditions on landslides, using a series of seepage and stability analyses performed over a range of rainfall intensities, and for different failure mechanisms, by studying the failure time and depths corresponding to fully drained, partially drained, and impermeable boundaries. It is shown that these conditions can significantly affect the occurrence and depth of rainfall-induced landslides. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
