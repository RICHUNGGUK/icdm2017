In order to increase the understanding of human movement planning strategies, the movement problem is here seen as a boundary value problem for a mechanism with prescribed initial and final configurations. The time variations of a set of control actuator forces are supposed to fulfil some optimality criterion while creating this motion. The boundary value problem is discretized by temporal finite element interpolation, where the discrete variables are seen in an optimization context. The present work focusses on the introduction of the activation dynamics of the actuators, introducing a delay in the force production from the stimulation variables. The choice of interpolations of the variables is discussed in the light of the optimization setting. Examples show aspects of the results obtained for different assumptions. It is concluded that the formulation gives a good basis for further improvement of muscular force production models in an optimal movement setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
