Embedding a graph into a vector space solves this problem since graphs are turned into feature vectors and thus all the statistical learning machinery becomes available for graph input patterns. In this work we present a new way of embedding discrete attributed graphs into vector spaces using node and edge label frequencies. The methodology is experimentally tested on graph classification problems, using patterns of different nature, and it is shown to be competitive to state-of-the-art classification algorithms for graphs, while being computationally much more efficient.", "paper_title": "EMBEDDING OF GRAPHS WITH DISCRETE ATTRIBUTES VIA LABEL FREQUENCIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000320616700007"}
