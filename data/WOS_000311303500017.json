The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis.", "paper_title": "GREVE: Genomic Recurrent Event ViEwer to assist the identification of patterns across individual cancer samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000311303500017"}
