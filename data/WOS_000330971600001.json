MARC finite element program. Comparisons between the analytical and experimental results demonstrated that the developed finite element model can predict the earthquake behavior of the UPCCV with fair accuracy. The responses of the 1:10 scale UPCCV subjected to the 11 March 2011 Japan earthquakes recorded at the MYG003 station with the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 781 gal and at the MYG013 station with the PGA of 982 gal were predicted by the dynamic analysis. Finally, a static analysis was performed to seek the ultimate load carrying capacity for the 1:10 scale UPCCV.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear time history analysis of a pre-stressed concrete containment vessel model under Japan's March 11 earthquake", "paper_id": "WOS:000330971600001"}
