The existing algorithm for solving TILT is based on the alternating direction method. It suffers from high computational cost and is not theoretically guaranteed to converge to a correct solution to the inner loop. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to speed up solving TILT, with guaranteed convergence for the inner loop. Our method is based on the recently proposed linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty. To further reduce computation, warm starts are also introduced to initialize the variables better and cut the cost on singular value decomposition. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that this new algorithm works much more efficiently and robustly than the existing algorithm. It could be at least five times faster than the previous method.", "paper_title": "Linearized Alternating Direction Method with Adaptive Penalty and Warm Starts for Fast Solving Transform Invariant Low-Rank Textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000321523000001"}
