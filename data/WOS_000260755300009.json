For those nets, we investigate the problem of operability which we consider as fundamental as the successful notion of soundness for workflow nets, i.e.. Petri net models of business processes and workflows. While we could give algorithmic solutions to the operability problem for subclasses of open nets in earlier work, this article shows that the problem is in general undecidable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
