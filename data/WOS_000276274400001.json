Many approaches aimed at improving the scalability of directories have been proposed. However, they do not bring perfect scalability and usually reduce the directory memory overhead by compressing coherence information, which in turn results in extra unnecessary coherence messages and, therefore, wasted energy and some performance degradation. In this work, we present a distributed directory organization based on duplicate tags for tiled CMP architectures whose size is independent on the number of tiles of the system up to a certain number of tiles. We demonstrate that this number of tiles corresponds to the number of sets in the private caches. Additionally, we show that the area overhead of the proposed directory structure is 0.56% with respect to the on-chip data caches. Moreover, the proposed directory structure keeps the same information than a non-scalable full-map directory. Finally, we propose a mechanism that takes advantage of this directory organization to remove the network traffic caused by replacements. This mechanism reduces total traffic by 15% for a 16-core configuration compared to a traditional directory-based protocol. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
