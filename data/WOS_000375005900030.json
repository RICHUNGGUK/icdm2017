Using mindfulness guided-relaxation that incorporated positive emotions, controlled breathing and biofeedback monitors, 13 university staff recorded their sympathetic and parasympathetic activity over a four week period. They also supplied qualitative reflections of their experience. After one session of guided-relaxation and biofeedback there were significant increases in parasympathetic activity. For those people that continued practicing guided-relaxation by listening to a digital recording of the session, these gains continued to increase.", "paper_title": "A Pilot Study Using Mindfulness-Guided-Relaxation & Biofeedback To Alleviate Stress In A Group", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900030"}
