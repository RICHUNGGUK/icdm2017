Here, packing refers to the set of all pairs of atoms in the molecule. Among all methods developed to assess three-dimensional models, statistical potentials are subject both to praise for their power of discrimination, and to criticism for the weaknesses of their theoretical foundations. Classical derivations of pairwise potentials assume statistical independence of all pairs of atoms. This assumption, however, is not valid in general. We show that we can filter the list of all interactions in a protein to generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the structural information contained in proteins. The filter is based on a geometric method called alpha shapes that captures the packing in a conformation. Statistical scoring functions derived from such subsets perform as well as scoring functions derived from the set of all pairwise interactions.
