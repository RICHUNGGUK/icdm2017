Query Chem makes it possible to search the Web for information about chemical structures without knowing their common names or identifiers. Furthermore, a structure can be combined with textual query terms to further restrict searches. Query Chem's search results can retrieve many interesting structure-property relationships of biomolecules on the Web.", "paper_title": "Query Chem: a Google-powered Web search combining text and chemical structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238905700022"}
