Nevertheless, various novel media and applications have been developed due to the rapid growth of internet. In this paper, we select maze games as carrier media to conceal secret data. The original idea of embedding data in a maze is proposed by Niwayama et al. Their method has two disadvantages. One is the very small embedding capacity; the other is that the stego maze is not perfect. Here, we propose an improved algorithm for increasing the embedding capacity and preserving the \"perfect\" property. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
