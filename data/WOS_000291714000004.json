In this paper, we focus on a specific domain of CBIR that involves the development of a content-based facial image retrieval system based on the constrained independent component analysis (cICA). Originating from independent component analysis (ICA), cICA is a source separation technique that uses priori constraints to extract desired independent components ( ICs) from data. By providing query images as the constraints to the cICA, the ICs that share similar probabilistic features with the queries from the database can be extracted. Then, these extracted ICs are used to evaluate the rank of each image according to the query. In our approach, we demonstrate that, in addition to a single image-based query, a compound query with multiple query images can be used to search for images with compounding feature content. The experimental results of our CBIR system tested with different facial databases show that our system can improve retrieval performance by using a compound query. Furthermore, our system allows for online processing without the need to learn query images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
