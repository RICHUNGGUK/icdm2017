Since most of the energy is spent for radio communication, an effective approach for energy conservation is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes, while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. Assuming that node position information is unavailable, we present a topology control algorithm, termed OTC, for sensor networks. It uses two-hop neighborhood information to select a subset of nodes to be active among all nodes in the neighborhood. Each node in the network selects its own set of active neighbors from among its one-hop neighbors. This set is determined such that it covers all two-hop neighbors. OTC does not assume the network graph to be a Unit Disk Graph; OTC also works well on general weighted network graphs. OTC is evaluated against two well-known algorithms from the literature, namely, Span and GAF through realistic simulations using TOSSIM. In terms of operational lifetime, load balancing and Spanner property OTC shows promising results. Apart from being symmetric and connected, the resulting graph when employing OTC shows good spanner properties.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of a Topology Control Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281117700001"}
