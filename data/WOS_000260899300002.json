As more and more processes become automated, customers become increasingly interested in managing process execution. This paper presents a set of concepts and a methodology toward business process intelligence (BPI) using dynamic process performance evaluation, including measurement models based on activity-based management (ABM) and a dynamic enterprise process performance evaluation methodology. The proposed measurement models support the analysis of six process flows within a manufacturing enterprise including activity flow, information flow, resource flow, cost flow, cash flow, and profit flow, which are crucial for enterprise managers to control the process execution quality and detect problems and. areas for improvements. The proposed process performance evaluation methodology uses time, quality, service, cost, speed, efficiency, and importance as seven evaluation criteria. A prototype system supporting dynamic enterprise process modeling, analysis of six process flows, and process performance prediction has been implemented to validate the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "A Business Process Intelligence System for Enterprise Process Performance Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000260899300002"}
