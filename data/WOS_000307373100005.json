While various methods have been proposed to help assess the quality of a service (QoS) using monitored quality data, they do not handle multiple QoS attributes adequately, especially when the qualities of these attributes are monitored asynchronously. In this paper, we propose a method that takes both accuracy and confidence into account when assessing QoS over multiple attributes, and employs a kNN based technique to deal with asynchronous data. Our experiments show that the new method can give more effective QoS assessment over multiple attributes than the existing methods do.", "paper_title": "Improving QoS assessment over multiple attributes with asynchronous data", "paper_id": "WOS:000307373100005"}
