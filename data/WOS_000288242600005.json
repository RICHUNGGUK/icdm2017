More precisely, VEAs have problems when they need to share their specific knowledge. They suffer semantic loss situations, and they hardly use any semantic tools. This work proposes a new approach to solving these kinds of problems based on semantic technologies, allowing the seamless sharing of information and knowledge between VEAs involved in a PLC scenario. This approach is validated through a plant layout design application, where several VEA can cooperate and share their knowledge, accomplishing the design task.", "paper_title": "Preserving Virtual Engineering Knowledge Through the Product Life Cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000288242600005"}
