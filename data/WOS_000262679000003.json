In a discrete HMM, the vector quantization procedure and the generated codebook are associated with performance degradation. By using a selected clustering validity index, we show that the optimization of HMM codebook size can be selected without training HMM classifiers. Moreover, the proposed scheme yields multiple optimized HMM classifiers, and each individual HMM is based on a different codebook size. By using these to construct an ensemble of HMM classifiers, this scheme can compensate for the degradation of a discrete HMM.", "paper_title": "Ensemble of HMM classifiers based on the clustering validity index for a handwritten numeral recognizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000262679000003"}
