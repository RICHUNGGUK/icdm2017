In this paper, we tackle the acceleration of these simulations in triangular meshes by exploiting the combined power of several CUDA-enabled GPUs in a GPU cluster. For that purpose, an improvement of a path conservative Roe-type finite volume scheme which is specially suitable for GPU implementation is presented, and a distributed implementation of this scheme which uses CUDA and MPI to exploit the potential of a GPU cluster is developed. This implementation overlaps MPI communication with CPU-GPU memory transfers and CPU computation to increase efficiency. Several numerical experiments, performed on a cluster of modern CUDA-enabled GPUs, show the efficiency of the distributed solver. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
