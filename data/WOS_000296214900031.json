Using economic concepts of tatonnement and economic core, we show that cooperative multi-agent systems should be designed in games with dominant strategies that may lead to social dilemmas. Non-cooperative multi-agent systems, on the other hand, should be designed for games with no clear dominant strategies and high degree of problem complexity. Further, for noncooperative multi-agent systems, the number of learning agents should be carefully managed so that solutions in the economic core can be obtained. We provide experimental results for the design of cooperative and non-cooperative MAS from telecommunication and manufacturing industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
