However, it has evolved greatly from its original incarnation. Content distribution is becoming a central role in today's Internet, which makes it difficult for the conventional host-to-host communication to meet the ever-increasing demands. In this paper, we present a Service and Information Oriented Network Architecture (SIONA) to fully optimize resources wherever they are. We describe SIONA's key design elements and illustrate how SIONA facilitates service-aware communication, name-based content delivery and mobility support, while keeping the network scalable and efficient. We implement name-based sockets (NBS) as a new transport API for applications to use names instead of addresses. We develop a lightweight age-based cooperative caching scheme to improve content distribution. We build an example system to show the feasibility and ease of use of SIONA. We conduct experiments in real networks to evaluate SIONA's transportation performance and perform a trace-based simulation to evaluate our caching scheme. Results show the advantage of our approach.
