Silver was developed to study how independently-developed language extension specifications can be imported into a host language specification to define a new custom extended language. Thus it contains many features useful in modular language specification, such as forwarding, higher-order attributes, reference/remote attributes, and a simplified form of collection attributes. These are discussed in the context of the Oberon0 specification presented here. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
