In case of equality, the realization P of P is said to be of full rank. If there is a faithful realization P of P of dimension d = n + 1 or d = n ( as P is finite or not), then P is said to be of nearly full rank. In previous papers, all the at most four-dimensional regular polytopes and apeirotopes of nearly full rank have been classified. This paper classifies the regular polytopes and apeirotopes of nearly full rank in all higher dimensions.", "paper_title": "Regular Polytopes of Nearly Full Rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000295680100004"}
