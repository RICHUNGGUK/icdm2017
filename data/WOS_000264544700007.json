It efficiently couples fluid simulation using a Lagrangian approach, namely the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, and a physically-based erosion model adopted from an Eulerian approach. The eroded sediment is associated with the SPH particles and is advected both implicitly, due to the particle motion, and explicitly, through an additional velocity field, which accounts for the sediment transfer between the particles. We propose a new donor-acceptor scheme for the explicit advection in SPH. Boundary particles associated to the terrain are used to mediate sediment exchange between the SPH particles and the terrain itself. Our results show that this particle-based method is efficient for the erosion of dense, large, and sparse fluid. Our implementation provides interactive results for scenes with up to 25,000 particles.", "paper_title": "Hydraulic Erosion Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700007"}
