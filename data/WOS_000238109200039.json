Constructors are identified not only modulo beta, but also eta. We give a direct proof of completeness, without constructing a model or establishing a strong normalization theorem. Inductive and coinductive types are enriched with a notion of size and the subtyping calculus is extended to account for the arising inclusions between the sized types.", "paper_title": "Polarized subtyping for sized types", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200039"}
