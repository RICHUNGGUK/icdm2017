The flow is considered to be governed by Walter's liquid B fluid. The problem is solved by developing a suitable numerical method. The results are found to be in good agreement with those of earlier investigations reported in existing scientific literatures. The study reveals that a back flow occurs near the central line of the channel due to the stretching walls and further that this flow reversal can be stopped by applying a strong external magnetic field. The study also shows that with the increase in the strength of the magnetic field, the fluid velocity decreases but the temperature increases. Thus the study bears potential applications in the study of the haemodynamic flow of blood in the cardiovascular system when subjected to an external magnetic field. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
