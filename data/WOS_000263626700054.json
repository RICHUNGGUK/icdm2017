Proficiency testing by interlaboratory comparisons - Part 1: Development and operation of proficiency testing schemes] is called Proficiency Testing (PT). In this paper we propose the use of the generalized likelihood ratio test to compare the performance of the group of laboratories for specific tests relative to the assigned value and illustrate the procedure considering an actual data from the PT program in the area of volume. The proposed test extends the test criteria in use allowing to test for the consistency of the group of laboratories. Moreover, the class of elliptical distributions are considered for the obtained measurements. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
