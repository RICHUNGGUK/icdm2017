Under this technique, the number of simultaneously assigned codewords to each user is a function of the data rate of the service class, while quality-of-service differentiation is achieved using variable-weight codewords for each service class. The traffic behavior of the network is modeled using a multiservice loss model, and the probability density functions of the number of busy codes in the fiber link are obtained by the Kaufman-Roberts algorithm. In order to analyze the performance of the proposed multiservice multicode GMPLS optical network, several measures are derived and investigated, specifically, the bit-error rate, probability of degradation, blocking probability, and steady-state throughput. These performance measures are obtained for two different receiver structures, namely, correlation receivers with and without hard limiters. The performance of our optical GMPLS network, based on the multicode switching path, is compared with that of traditional optical GMPLS networks, based on the label switching path. The results show the superiority of the proposed technique when compared to traditional ones.", "paper_title": "Multirate Multiservice All-Optical Code Switched GMPLS Core Network Utilizing Multicode Variable-Weight Optical Code-Division Multiplexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341712000001"}
