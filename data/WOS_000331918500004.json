This paper reviews examples and critiques of autoethnographic research and supports the idea that autoethnographic approaches increase information professionals' awareness of their cultural assumptions and provide a framework for analysing such assumptions when developing programs and services (Michels 2010, 166). By showcasing an exemplary autoethnographic study (Michels 2010), this paper presents autoethnography as a useful methodology that acknowledges the researcher's subjectivity, accounts for the affective aspects of information experiences, and focuses on how personal stories can teach us about information behaviour.", "paper_title": "Representing Ourselves in Information Science Research: A Methodological Essay on Autoethnography", "paper_id": "WOS:000331918500004"}
