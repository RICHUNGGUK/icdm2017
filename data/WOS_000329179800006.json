This paper based on the Fisher's discriminant analysis using the fixed-size moving window evolving factor analysis to find characteristic spectra through analyzing the near infrared spectroscopy of Xihu Longjing Tea and Zhejiang Longjing Tea. The Fisher's discriminant analysis was used to reduce the data dimension combined with the principal component analysis. A discrimination model was set up for the identification of the Xihu Longjing Tea and Zhejiang Longjing Tea. The model's accuracy is 97.3%. The results proved that this model is feasible to identify the differences between the Xihu Longjing Tea and Zhejiang Longjing Tea. Unlike other methods, the tea does not need to be made into a powder. It also lays out a theoretical foundation for developing an identification instrument for Xihu Longjing Tea.", "paper_title": "AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE GROWING AREA OF LONGJING TEA BASED ON THE FISHER'S DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS WITH THE COMBINATION OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329179800006"}
