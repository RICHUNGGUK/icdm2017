In this paper, we extend this concept to finite chainrings. Properties of skew constacyclic codes generated by monic right divisors of x(n) - lambda, where lambda is a unit element, are exhibited. When lambda(2) = 1, the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of such codes are determined together with necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual. Specializing to codes over the ring F(p)m + uF(p)m, the structure of all skew constacyclic codes is completely determined. This allows us to express the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of skew cyclic and skew negacyclic codes in terms of the generators of the original codes. An illustration of all skew cyclic codes of length 2 over F-3+uF(3) and their Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes is also provided.", "paper_title": "SKEW CONSTACYCLIC CODES OVER FINITE CHAIN RINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299867600003"}
