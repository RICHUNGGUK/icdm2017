A promising application of SAGE gene expression data is classification of tumors. In this paper, we build three event models (the multivariate Bernoulli model, the multinomial model and the normalized multinomial model) for SAGE data classification. Both binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated. Experiments on two SAGE datasets show that the multivariate Bernoulli model performs well with small feature sizes, but the multinomial performs better at large feature sizes, while the normalized multinomial performs well with medium feature sizes. The multinomial achieves the highest overall accuracy.", "paper_title": "Event models for tumor classification with SAGE gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400104"}
