We propose a model that complies with a well established macroscopic behavior of striated muscles where force-length, force-velocity, and Mirsky-Parmley properties are taken into account. These properties are introduced at the microscopic scale and related to a tentative explanation of the phenomena. The method used integrates behavior ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, and allows the computation of the dynamics of the output force and stiffness controlled by EMG or stimulation parameters. The model can thus be used to simulate and carry out research to develop control strategies using electrical stimulation in the context of rehabilitation. Finally, through animal experiments, we estimated model parameters using a Sigma Point Kalman Filtering technique and dedicated experimental protocols in isometric conditions and demonstrated that the model can accurately simulate individual variations and thus take into account subject dependent behavior.", "paper_title": "Multiscale modeling of skeletal muscle properties and experimental validations in isometric conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739800002"}
