Design/methodology/approach - This study examined the overall characteristics of ICT product diffusion by tracking the actual patterns of US and Korean mobile market subscribers using the Bass diffusion model. Findings - This study found that innovation effects gain influences on ICT product diffusion after CMP, MSP and NGRP; imitators are becoming innovators by repeated rejuvenation experiences; and cultural differences have significant influences on imitators' ICT product adoption, but not on innovators. Originality/value - These findings imply that rejuvenation enabled by technology innovation is a key success strategy to dominate the ICT market where the number of innovators, who have strong desires for new generation products, is constantly growing.", "paper_title": "ICT product diffusion in US and Korean markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000352103300004"}
