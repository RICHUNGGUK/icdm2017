Our main contributions include (1) we propose new Latin square image encryption primitives including Latin Square Whitening, Latin Square S-box and Latin Square P-box; (2) we develop probabilistic image encryption by embedding random noise into the least significant bit-plane of images; and (3) we design a new loom-like 2D substitution-permutation network maintaining good confusion and diffusion properties with extra error tolerance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method has many desired properties of a secure cipher, shows robustness against different attack models, and outperforms state of the art suggested by many peer algorithms.
