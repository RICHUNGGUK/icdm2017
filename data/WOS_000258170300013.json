The notion of h-intra-hemiregularity of a hemiring, which is a generalization of the notion of intra-regularity of a ring, is provided. Some characterizations of h-hemiregular hemirings, h -intra-hemiregular hemirings and hemirings that are both h-hemiregular and h-intra-hemiregular are derived in terms of fuzzy left, fuzzy right h-ideals, fuzzy h-bi-ideals and fuzzy h-quasi-ideals.
