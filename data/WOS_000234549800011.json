The solver is developed as a Window application using Java programming. It can solve several types of heat transfer problems such as one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction through a plane wall, cylinder, or sphere, with temperature, heat flux, and convective boundary conditions (BCs), one-dimensional transient heat conduction through a plane wall, lumped system analysis, extended heat transfer surface, forced convection over a flat plate, and radiation.
