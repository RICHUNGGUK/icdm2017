At first, Radon Transformation (RT) is done to extract features from the time-sequential depth faces that are further improved by Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to generate more robust features and then, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to train and recognize different facial expressions successfully. Performance of the proposed facial expression recognition shows the superiority over conventional RGB camera-based approaches.", "paper_title": "A depth video-based facial expression recognition system using radon transform, generalized discriminant analysis, and hidden Markov model", "paper_id": "WOS:000354898800004"}
