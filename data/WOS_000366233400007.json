Existing approaches are based on the trade-off between increased resources and higher fault-tolerance. The Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) principle of Collaborative Control Theory has been applied in sensor networks effectively and appears as a promising original approach not based on the aforementioned trade-off and capable of producing networks with higher resilience. Inspired by the FTT principle, a Resilience by Teaming Framework (RBT) for supply networks is developed to address the design and operation of resilient supply networks. RBT is tested and validated through the application of its protocols to case studies in production and distribution networks. Evidence from case studies' results suggests that through FTT-based protocols and RBT it is possible to achieve higher fault tolerance with fewer resources than under traditional approaches.
