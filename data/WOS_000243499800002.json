However, due to the flood of publications, obtaining a comprehensive view even on a topic of limited scope, from a stack of publications is becoming an arduous task. Examples are presented from our recent experiences in the materials science field, where information is not shared among researchers studying different materials and different methods. To overcome the limitation, we propose a structured keywords method to reinforce the functionality of a future e-library.", "paper_title": "Filling the gap between researchers studying different materials and different methods: a proposal for structured keywords", "paper_id": "WOS:000243499800002"}
