At the beginning of this dissertation, we provide a briefly overview of the main approaches for obtaining the OWA weights with a predefined degree of orness. Along this line, we next make an important generalization of these approaches as a special case of the well-known and more general problem of calculation of the probability distribution in the presence of uncertainty. All these existed methods for dealing these kinds of problems are quite complex. In order to simplify the process of computation, we introduce Yager's entropy based on Minkowski metric. By analyzing its desirable properties and utilizing this measure of entropy, a linear programming ( LP) model for the problem of OWA weight calculation with a predefined degree of orness has been built and can be calculated much easier. Then, this result is further extended to the more realistic case of only having partial information on the range of OWA weights except a predefined degree of orness. In the end, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
