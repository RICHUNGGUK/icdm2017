In the proposed stability analysis, by exploiting a candidate LK functional and by imposing tighter bounding on the cross-terms using minimal number of slack matrix variables, a less conservative delay-dependent stability criterion is presented in linear matrix inequality framework. The effectiveness of the proposed stability criterion over some of the recently reported results is demonstrated through standard numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Robust stability criterion for Markovian jump systems with nonlinear perturbations and mode-dependent time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000302949300004"}
