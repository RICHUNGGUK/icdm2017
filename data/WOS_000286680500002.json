In this paper, we prove that such set of in-trees covering A can be found by using an algorithm for the weighted matroid intersection problem in time bounded by a polynomial in Sigma(d)(i=1) f(s(i)) and the size of D. Furthermore, for the case where D is acyclic, we present another characterization of the existence of in-trees covering A, and then we prove that in-trees covering A can be computed more efficiently than the general case by finding maximum matchings in a series of bipartite graphs.", "paper_title": "Covering directed graphs by in-trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000286680500002"}
