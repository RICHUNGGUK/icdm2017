Here, we drew on marketing and consumer behavior literature to formulate a conceptual framework that considered community-based, customization-based, desire-based, and constraint-based drivers of online customer retention. Furthermore, the potential interrelationships between these drivers were explored. We then empirically tested our hypotheses using data obtained from a large online retailing store in Taiwan. The results strongly supported most of the hypotheses. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings were discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
