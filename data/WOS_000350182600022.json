The state-of-the-art approaches for A-CDM, currently implemented in many airports in both Europe as well as the United States, are considered mature and well accepted. In many cases it usually focuses on the information sharing and only takes into account the preferences of Air Traffic Control (ATC) units and those of the airlines. This inherently leads to only satisfying the preferences of a limited number of stakeholders within the airport area. In this paper we extend current state-of-the-art approaches to include the preferences of the Airport Management in the A-CDM. The model that we propose is based on the Deferred Acceptance (DA) allocation mechanism from Game Theory and addresses the problem of slot allocation in the Compression step of the classic CDM algorithm currently used. Dealing with this market by using the DA-CDM model enables assigning flights to slots through a one-to-one relationship that respects the preferences of each allocation and is always guaranteed to provide a stable result.
