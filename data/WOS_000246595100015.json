In these systems, Mobile Support Stations (MSSs) play the role of providing reliable and uninterrupted communication and computing facilities to mobile hosts. The failure of a MSS can cause interruption of services provided by the mobile system. Two basic schemes for tolerating the failure of MSSs exist in the literature. The first scheme is based on the principle of checkpointing used in distributed systems. The second scheme is based on state information replication of mobile hosts in a number of secondary support stations. Depending on the replication scheme used, the second approach is further classified as a pessimistic or an optimistic technique. In this paper, we propose a hybrid scheme which combines the pessimistic and the optimistic replication schemes. In the proposed scheme, an attempt is made to strike a balance between the long delay caused by the pessimistic and the high memory requirements of the optimistic schemes. In order to find the best ratio between the number of pessimistic to the number of optimistic secondary stations in the proposed scheme, we used fuzzy logic. We also used simulation to compare the performance of the proposed scheme with those of the optimistic and the pessimistic schemes. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme performs better than either schemes in terms of delay and memory requirements. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
