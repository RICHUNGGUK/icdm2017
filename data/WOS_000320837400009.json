This paper presents a detailed analysis of three methods for achieving such goal. The proposed methods rely on different levels of language analysis: lexical, syntactic and semantic. Moreover, they are also analyzed for detecting relevance in texts. The results show that semantic-based methods are able to detect up to 90% of redundancy, compared to only the 19% of lexical-based ones. This is also reflected in the quality of the generated summaries, obtaining better summaries when employing syntactic- or semantic-based approaches to remove redundancy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
