Because of the inherent speckle interference in SAR system, a despeckling procedure is important for change detection. However, the residual speckle still exists in the filtered data and is unevenly distributed, which is not considered in the available change detectors. Besides that, the detection methods with despeckling procedure cannot be adjusted based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Specifically, the available PoISAR change detection methods are inefficient for the strong speckle interference cases due to the absence of the despeckling procedure. In order to overcome these drawbacks, an improved change detection framework for PoISAR data is proposed in this paper. The main innovations in the new framework include: (1) a despeckling procedure is added for PoISAR change detection, which makes the algorithm robust to strong noise; (2) a new equivalent number of looks (ENL) estimator is proposed for the PoISAR/SAR data filtered by non-local means filter; (3) the proposed method which detects the changes based on the filtered data can be adjusted with different CFARs. The experiments on both synthetic and real PoISAR datasets have demonstrated that the effectiveness of the proposed patch based PoISAR change detector (PPCD). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
