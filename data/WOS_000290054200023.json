Nonstationarity is treated as the switching force between different stationary systems, which is shown as a series of finite time detours of system dynamics from the vicinity of a nonlinear attractor. Recurrence patterns are used to partition the system trajectory into multiple near-stationary segments. Consequently, piecewise eigen analysis of ensembles in each near-stationary segment can capture both nonlinear stochastic dynamics and nonstationarity. The experimental studies using simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate significant prediction performance improvements in comparison with other alternative methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
