Participatory sensing technologies encourage people to be involved in environment monitoring through smart devices. Vehicle sensor networks (VSNs) are a novel solution for road event detection with advantages. In this paper, we consider runtime road event detection using VSNs to satisfy the application-specific requirements through collaboration among vehicles. A group road detection scheme (GRD) by using dynamic clustering in VSNs is presented to improve detection performance with low time complexity and message complexity. The simulations with testbed of 5 remote controllable vehicles show that GRD scheme provides effectiveness under different road scenarios.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Collaborative Detection for Opportunistic Vehicle Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336161500001"}
