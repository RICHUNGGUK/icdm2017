In this paper, we focus on the uplink multi-user detection (MUD) on the scheme that a uniform linear array (ULA) is applied to the base station of the MC-CDMA system. We first describe the equivalent spatial-temporal channel model of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) MC-CDMA systems. Based on this scheme, by utilizing the finite alphabet property of transmitted symbols, an multi-user detector is derived for the MC-CDMA system with the ULA over frequency-selective fading channels. Computer simulations illustrate that our algorithm is more robust against noise and can well mitigate multiple access interference (MAI) in multi-user scenarios. In particular, the proposed scheme has the potential of providing the anticipated MUD performance gains with a complexity that would be manageable for MC-CDMA systems.", "paper_title": "Blind multi-user detection for multi-carrier CDMA systems with uniform linear arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100030"}
