The adaptive stencil refinement algorithm has been proven to be able to continuously adapt the stencil resolution according to the gradient of flow parameter of interest [Ding H, Shu C. A stencil adaptive algorithm for finite difference solution of incompressible viscous flows. J Comput Phys 2006;214:397-420], which facilitates the saving of the computational efforts. On the other hand, the capability of the domain-free discretization technique in dealing with the curved boundary provides a great flexibility for the finite difference scheme on the Cartesian grid. Here, we show that their combination makes it possible to simulate the unsteady incompressible flow with curved boundary on a dynamically changed grid. The methods are validated by simulating steady and unsteady incompressible viscous flows over a stationary circular cylinder. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
