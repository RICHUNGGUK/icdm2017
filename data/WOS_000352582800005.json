We present an alternative method to process the Fluorescence Excitation-Emission Matrices (FEEM): first, a preprocessing is applied to eliminate the Raman and Rayleigh scattering peaks that clutter the FEEM. To improve its robustness versus possible improper settings, we suggest to associate the classical Zepp's method with a morphological image filtering technique. Then, in the second stage, the Canonical Polyadic (CP or Candecomp/Parafac) decomposition of a nonnegative three-way array has to be computed. In the fluorescence spectroscopy context, the constituent vectors of the loading matrices should be nonnegative (since standing for spectra and concentrations). Thus, we suggest a new nonnegative third order CP decomposition algorithm (NNCP) based on a nonlinear conjugate gradient optimization algorithm with regularization terms and periodic restarts. Computer simulations performed on real experimental data are provided to enlighten the effectiveness and robustness of the whole processing chain and to validate the approach.
