In this paper, we present a novel view to tackle this issue, which aims at modeling and mining of the capture intention of camcorder users. Based on the study of intention mechanism in psychology, a set of domain-specific capture intention concepts is defined. A comprehensive and extensible scheme consisting of video structure decomposition, intention-oriented feature analysis, as well as singular-value-decomposition-based intention segmentation and learning-based intention classification is proposed to mine the users' capture intention. Experiments were carried on home video sequences of 90 h in total, taken by 16 persons over the past 20 years. Both the user study and objective evaluations indicate that our proposed intention-based approach is an effective complement to existing home video content analysis schemes.", "paper_title": "Modeling and mining of users' capture intention for home videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500008"}
