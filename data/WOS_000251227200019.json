Although this measure is calculated in a probabilistic way, it may be applied to control of biological systems for providing a policy to experiments for pharmaceutical developments. Thus an application to gene regulatory control of luminescence in the marine bacterium modeled by the piecewise affine system is discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Controllability measure of piecewise affine systems and its applications to the luminescence bacterium", "paper_id": "WOS:000251227200019"}
