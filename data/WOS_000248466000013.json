In this paper, we propose an improved heuristic algorithm for the well-known optimization formulation based on versatile preemption policy, which can minimize the preemption cost with high accuracy and less computational intractability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms well-known algorithms recently proposed in the literature. Moreover, we present a new path selection scheme to minimize preemption. Due to preemption of those LSPs that share more links with the selected path, the proposed scheme obviously minimize rerouting in DS-TE environments. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
