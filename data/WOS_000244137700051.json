By constructing proper Lyapunov functionals and using some analytic techniques, several sufficient conditions are given to ensure the passivity of the integro-differential neural networks with time-varying delays. The passivity conditions are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily solved by using the effective interior-point algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
