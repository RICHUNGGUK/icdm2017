Effective test time reduction techniques for the proposed test scheme are also proposed. Simulation results show that the additional area cost for implementing the enhanced IEEE 1500 test wrapper is only about 0.58% for a 64 K-bit single-port RAM and only 0.57% for a 64 K-bit two-port RAM in 90-nm technology.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Self-Test Techniques for Small RAMs in SOCs Using Enhanced IEEE 1500 Test Wrappers", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500018"}
