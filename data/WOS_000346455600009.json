The compact flexure-based mechanism is directly driven by three piezoelectric actuators (PZTs) through decoupling mechanisms. The orthogonal configuration in the x and y directions can guarantee the decoupling translational motion in these axes. The rotational motion and translational displacement in the x direction can be decoupled by controlling the piezoelectric actuators in the x axis with the same displacement values in same and opposite motion directions, respectively. The static and dynamic models of the developed flexure-based mechanism have been developed based on the pseudo-rigid-body model methodology. The mechanical design optimization is conducted to improve the static and dynamic characteristics of the flexure-based mechanism. Finite Element Analyses (FEA) are also carried out to verify the established models and optimization results. A novel hybrid feedforward/feedback controller has been provided to eliminate/reduce the nonlinear hysteresis and external disturbance of the flexure-based mechanism. Experimental testing has been performed to examine the dynamic performance of the developed flexure-based mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
