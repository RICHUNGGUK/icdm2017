A caterpillar is a directed tree consisting of a single directed path (of spine arcs) and leaf vertices each of which is incident to the directed path by exactly one incoming arc (leaf arc). For a given terminal set K c. V, we study the problem of finding a caterpillar in D such that it contains all terminals in K and its total cost is minimized, where the cost of each arc in the caterpillar depends on whether it is used as a spine arc or a leaf arc. In this paper, we first show that the problem is NP-hard for any fixed constant number of terminals with vertical bar K vertical bar >= 3, while it is solvable in polynomial time for at most two terminals. We also give an inapproximability result for any fixed constant number of terminals with vertical bar K vertical bar >= 3. Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm to solve the problem for digraphs with bounded treewidth, where the treewidth for a digraph D is defined as the one for the underlying graph of D. Our algorithm runs in linear time even if vertical bar K vertical bar = O(vertical bar V vertical bar), and the hidden constant factor of the running time is just a single exponential of the treewidth.", "paper_title": "On the Minimum Caterpillar Problem in Digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300017"}
