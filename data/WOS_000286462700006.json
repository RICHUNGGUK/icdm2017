If A satisfies the Helly Property then M is a Helly circular-arc model. A (Helly) circular-arc graph is the intersection graph of a (Helly) circular-arc model. Circular-arc graphs and their subclasses have been the object of a great deal of attention in the literature. Linear-time recognition algorithms have been described both for the general class and for some of its subclasses. However, for Helly circular-arc graphs, the best recognition algorithm is that by Gavril, whose complexity is O(n(3)). In this article, we describe different characterizations for Helly circular-arc graphs, including a characterization by forbidden induced subgraphs for the class. The characterizations lead to a linear-time recognition algorithm for recognizing graphs of this class. The algorithm also produces certificates for a negative answer, by exhibiting a forbidden subgraph of it, within this same bound.", "paper_title": "Linear-Time Recognition of Helly Circular-Arc Models and Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286462700006"}
