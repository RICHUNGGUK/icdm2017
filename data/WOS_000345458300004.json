We then show how the traditional trace containment and equivalence relations, can be lifted to the lattice-valued setting, and we introduce two families of lattice-valued versions of the relations. Further, we explore some interesting properties of these relations. Finally, we provide logical characterizations of our relations by a natural extension of linear temporal logic.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Analysis of Lattice-valued Kripke Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000345458300004"}
