In particular, in the referenced Mixed Signal Letter (Abuelma'atti and Khalifa, Analog Integr Circuits Signal Process, 73:989-992, 2012), the authors assert that the modified Wien-bridge oscillator circuit under discussion, used previously in the aforementioned referenced articles, can behave as a sinusoidal oscillator only at relatively high frequencies when the operational amplifier can be considered non-ideal. In addition, at relatively low frequencies, when the operational amplifier can be considered ideal, the same circuit would behave as a relaxation oscillator with a square wave output rather than a sinusoidal output. However, this paper reveals that this assertion is not strictly correct, because in both cases (in low and high frequencies), the generated waveform at the circuit output is a sinusoidal signal, with the possibility of be cut out, depending on proper circuit dimensioning (according to the oscillation criterion) as well as the oscillation frequency and the properties of the amplifier (slew rate, and frequency response).", "paper_title": "On modified Wien-bridge oscillator and astable oscillator", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100017"}
