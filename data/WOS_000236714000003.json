The original image is assumed to have a discontinuity jump (edge) along the boundary of a compact convex set. The Radon transform of the image is observed with noise, and the problem is to estimate the edge. We develop an estimation procedure which is based on recovering the support function of the edge. It is shown that the proposed estimator is nearly optimal in order in a minimax sense. Numerical examples illustrate reasonable practical behavior of the estimation procedure.", "paper_title": "Recovering convex edges of an image from noisy tomographic data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000003"}
