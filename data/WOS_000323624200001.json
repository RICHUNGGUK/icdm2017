In this work, we propose an interactive tool, named VRFluid, that allows visual interpretation of the three-dimensional data generated by the simulation of the fluid flow the porous media. VRFluid comprises a virtual reality engine that provides stereo visualization of the three-dimensional data, and a simulation engine based on a dynamic percolation method to model the fluid flow. VRFluid is composed of two independent main threads, the percolation simulator and the rendering server, that can operate in parallel as a pipeline. We tested our tool on a region of a mature field database, supervised by geophysicists, and obtained images of the interior of the percolation data, providing important results for the interpretation and cluster formation process.", "paper_title": "Using virtual reality and percolation theory to visualize fluid flow in porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000323624200001"}
