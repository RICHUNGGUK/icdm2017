To improve flow quantification, color pixel density (CPD) can be plotted as a function of wall filter cutoff velocity to produce a wall-filter selection curve that can be used to estimate actual vascular volume fraction. A mathematical model based on receiver operating characteristic statistics is developed to study the behavior of wall-filter selection curves. The model is compared to experimental data acquired with a 30-MHz transducer and a custom-designed multiple-vessel flow phantom capable of mimicking a range of blood vessel sizes (200-300 mu m), blood flow velocities (1-10 mm/s), and blood vessel orientations. At high flow rates, wall-filter selection curves for multiple-vessel regions include a plateau whose CPD corresponds with the total vascular volume fraction. Conversely, the vascular volume fraction of a subset of vessels is obtained at low flow rates. Detection of the volume fraction of all vessels is ensured when a plateau is > 0.5 mm/s in length and begins at a wall filter cutoff < 2 mm/s.", "paper_title": "Objective Selection of High-Frequency Power Doppler Wall Filter Cutoff Velocity for Regions of Interest Containing Multiple Small Vessels", "paper_id": "WOS:000277336700003"}
