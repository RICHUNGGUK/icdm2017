We show how to construct collisions between palindromic bit strings of length 2n + 2 for Tillich and Zemor's construction. The approach also yields collisions for related proposals by Petit et al. from ICECS '08 and CT-RSA '09. It seems fair to consider our attack as practical: for parameters of interest, the colliding bit strings have a length of a few hundred bits and can be found on a standard PC within seconds.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of the Tillich-Z,mor Hash Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000286005400005"}
