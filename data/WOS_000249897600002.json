Our proposed robust recursive filters have superior performance over a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed multiuser detector algorithms initially use Kalman prediction form to estimated channel parameters, and unknown data symbol be predicted. Second, based on this predicted data symbol, the robust recursive filters (e.g., GMSPPF) is a refined estimation of joint multipaths and time delays. With these estimated multipaths and time delays, data symbol detection is carried out (Kalman correction form). Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform the conventional blind multiuser detector with the EKE Also we can see it provides a more viable means for tracking time-varying amplitudes and time delays in CDMA communication systems, compared to that of the EKF for near-far ratio of 20 dB. For this reason, it is believed that the proposed channel estimators can replace well-known filter such as the EKE", "paper_title": "Multiuser channel estimation using robust recursive filters for CDMA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000249897600002"}
