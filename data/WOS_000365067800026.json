Aiming at the dynamic environment of product processing in practice, we propose a dynamic double-row layout problem (DDRLP) where material flows change over time in different processing periods. A mixed-integer programming model is established for this problem. A methodology combining an improved simulated annealing (ISA) with mathematical programming (MP) is proposed to resolve it. Firstly, a mixed coding scheme is designed to represent both of sequence of facilities and their exact locations. Secondly, an improved simulated annealing algorithm is suggested to produce a solution to DDRLP. Finally, MP is used to improve this solution by determining the optimal exact location for each facility. Experiments show that this methodology is able to obtain the optimal solutions for small size problems and outperforms an exact approach (CPLEX) for problems of realistic size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
