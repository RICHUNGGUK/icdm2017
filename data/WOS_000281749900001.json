A natural way to deal with them is generating belief messages. Sensing objects continuously change with time, so are their beliefs. Therefore, dynamic models are required to monitor distributed states in the system. This paper presents a CTBN based intelligent system for modeling dynamics and processing uncertainties in sensor networks. Algorithms for message passing and parameter updating for adapting the model to the changing environment are provided. The effectiveness of the system is shown in experiments.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM BASED ON ADAPTIVE CTBN FOR UNCERTAINTY REASONING IN SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281749900001"}
