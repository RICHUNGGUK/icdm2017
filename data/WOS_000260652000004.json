Yager's traditional OWA operator focuses exclusively on the aggregation of crisp numbers. However, experts usually tend to express their opinions or preferences in a very natural way via linguistic terms. These linguistic terms can be modelled or expressed by (type-1) fuzzy sets. In this paper, we define a new type of OWA operator, the type-1 OWA operator that works as an uncertain OWA operator to aggregate type-1 fuzzy sets with type-1 fuzzy weights, which can be used to aggregate the linguistic opinions or preferences in human decision making with linguistic weights. The procedure for performing type-1 OWA operations is analysed. In order to identify the linguistic weights associated to the type-1 OWA operator, type-2 linguistic quantifiers are proposed. The problem of how to derive linguistic weights used in type-1 OWA aggregation given such type of quantifier is solved. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed concepts.
