They not only improve system efficiency, but also increase user satisfaction. Lower renege rate and less waiting time for users are the main goals for a scheduling algorithm. Among existing algorithms, On-Demand strategy does not perform well, while rate control channel allocation policies performs much better. Pure-Rate-Control (PRC) and Multiple-Service-Class (MSC) belong to the rate control algorithms. MSC performs well, but a drawback is that it uses the Hot Index, which is hard to decide and has significant effects on the performance. In order to solve this problem and to improve the overall system performance, two new algorithms, Modified MSC(MMSC) and Adaptive Algorithm (AA), are proposed in this paper. Both of them solved the problem of MSC very well and improved the overall performance. For example, the renege rate of AA is about 5.4% less than that of MMSC, and about 9.8% less than that of MSC.", "paper_title": "Adaptive channel allocation for large-scale streaming content delivery systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244314900002"}
