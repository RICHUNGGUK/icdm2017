This model is based on expectation disconfirmation theory and insights garnered from a recent qualitative investigation of student learning outcomes from ILI given at three business schools. The model was tested through a web survey administered to 372 students. The model represents psychological, behavioral, and benefit outcomes as second-order molecular constructs. Results from a partial least squares (PLS) analysis reveal that expectation disconfirmation influences perceived quality and student satisfaction. These in turn affect student psychological outcomes. Further, psychological outcomes influence student behaviors, which in turn affect benefit outcomes. Based on the study's findings, several recommendations are made.", "paper_title": "A Model of Student Learning Outcomes of Information Literacy Instruction in a Business School", "paper_id": "WOS:000302156300004"}
