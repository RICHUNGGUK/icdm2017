Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to select the optimal input layer neurons, and then predict exchange rates by the Back Propagation Network (BPN), which called PSOBPN model. The model is applied to forecast exchange rate NTD/USD. We hope to improve traditional neural network that utilized the try-and-error method to find out the better neurons of input layer efficiently. The results show that the PSOBPN achieves the best performance forecasting and is most closely matched with the actual exchange rate.", "paper_title": "PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION BASED ON BACK PROPAGATION NETWORK FORECASTING EXCHANGE RATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500016"}
