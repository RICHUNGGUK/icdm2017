Building on Hollerbach's (Biol Cybern 39:139-156, 1981) model, our Parsimonious Oscillatory Model of Handwriting (POMH) overcomes the latter's main shortcomings by making it possible to extract its parameters from the trace itself and by reinstating symmetry between the and coordinates. The benefit is a capacity to autonomously generate a smooth continuous trace that reproduces the dynamics of the handwriting movements through an extremely sparse model, whose efficiency matches that of other, more computationally expensive optimizing methods. Moreover, the model applies to 2D trajectories, irrespective of their shape, size, orientation and length. It is also independent of the endeffectors mobilized and of the writing direction.", "paper_title": "A parsimonious oscillatory model of handwriting", "paper_id": "WOS:000336799300006"}
