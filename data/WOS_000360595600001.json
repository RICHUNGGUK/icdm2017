However, most of the semi-supervised sparse feature selection methods are developed for single-view data and these methods cannot naturally deal with the multi-view data, though it has shown that leveraging information contained in multiple views can dramatically improve the feature selection performance. Recently, multi-view learning has obtained much research attention because it can reveal and leverage the correlated and complementary information between different views. So in this paper, we apply multi-view learning into semi-supervised sparse feature selection and propose a semi-supervised sparse feature selection method based on multi-view Laplacian regularization, namely, multi-view Laplacian sparse feature selection (MLSFS).(1) MLSFS utilizes multi-view Laplacian regularization to boost semi-supervised sparse feature selection performance. A simple iterative method is proposed to solve the objective function of MLSFS. We apply MLSFS algorithm into image annotation task and conduct experiments on two web image datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed MLSFS outperforms the state-of-art single-view sparse feature selection methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
