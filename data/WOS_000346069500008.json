Distributed protocols are constructed by using iterative learning control (ILC) algorithms, where information is exchanged only at the end of one iteration and learning is used to update the control inputs after each iteration. It is proved that under ILC-based protocols, the finite-time consensus can be achieved with an increasing number of iterations if the communication network of agents is guaranteed to have a spanning tree. Moreover, if the information of any desired terminal output is available to a portion (not necessarily all) of the agents, then the consensus output that all agents finally reach can be enabled to be the desired terminal output. It is also proved that for all ILC-based protocols, gain selections can be provided in terms of bound values, and consensus conditions can be developed associated with bound matrices. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Robust iterative learning protocols for finite-time consensus of multi-agent systems with interval uncertain topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069500008"}
