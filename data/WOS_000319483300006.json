The objective functions and constraints are established on the characteristics and mechanism of the problem. In contrast to previous studies, a similarity relation based on the fuzzy measure Pos is defined, based on which, the rough approximation method is adopted for addressing the feasible region featured by the constraints that contain fuzzy coefficients. In order to deal with the fuzzy coefficients in the objective functions, an expected value operator based on Me is employed. Then two rough approximation-based bi-level multi-objective strategy models are developed. To solve the complex and non-linear bi-level multi-objective models, a rough simulation, an interactive fuzzy programming technique and a hybrid genetic algorithm, in which the F-TODIM is embedded, is designed as a combined solution method. Finally, an application for a developer of Yuexiu real estate and its contractor is given as an illustration that demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of the optimization method.
