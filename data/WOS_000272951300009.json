The problem becomes more severe in heterogeneous networks with nonuniform and time-varying popular files. Existing DHT load balancing algorithms are mainly focused on the issues caused by node heterogeneity. To deal with skewed lookups, this paper presents an elastic routing table (ERT) mechanism for query load balancing, based on the observation that high-degree nodes tend to receive more traffic load. The mechanism allows each node to have a routing table of variable size corresponding to node capacities. The indegree and outdegree of the routing table can also be adjusted dynamically in response to the change of file popularity and network churn. Theoretical analysis proves that the routing table degree is bounded. The ERT mechanism facilitates locality-aware randomized query forwarding to further improve lookup efficiency. By relating query forwarding to a supermarket customer service model, we prove that a two-way randomized query forwarding policy should lead to an exponential improvement in query processing time over random walking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERT mechanism and its related query forwarding policy for congestion and query load balancing. In comparison with existing \"virtual-server\"-based load balancing algorithms and other routing table control approaches, the ERT-based congestion control protocol yields significant improvement in query lookup efficiency.", "paper_title": "Elastic Routing Table with Provable Performance for Congestion Control in DHT Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272951300009"}
