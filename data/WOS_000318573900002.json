Poor levels of conservation among homologs, however, make it difficult to compare RNA sequences, even when considering closely evolutionary related sequences. Results: We describe SARA-Coffee, a tertiary structure-based multiple RNA aligner, which has been validated using BRAliDARTS, a new benchmark framework designed for evaluating tertiary structure-based multiple RNA aligners. We provide two methods to measure the capacity of alignments to match corresponding secondary and tertiary structure features. On this benchmark, SARA-Coffee outperforms both regular aligners and those using secondary structure information. Furthermore, we show that on sequences in which <60% of the nucleotides form base pairs, primary sequence methods usually perform better than secondary-structure aware aligners.", "paper_title": "Using tertiary structure for the computation of highly accurate multiple RNA alignments with the SARA-Coffee package", "paper_id": "WOS:000318573900002"}
