Cloud providers would like to maximize their clients' satisfaction by renting precious physical memory to those clients who value it the most. But real-world cloud clients are selfish: they will only tell their providers the truth about how much they value memory when it is in their own best interest to do so. How can real-world cloud providers allocate memory efficiently to those (selfish) clients who value it the most? We present Ginseng, the first market-driven cloud system that allocates memory efficiently to selfish cloud clients. Ginseng incentivizes selfish clients to bid their true value for the memory they need when they need it. Ginseng continuously collects client bids, finds an efficient memory allocation, and re-allocates physical memory to the clients that value it the most. Ginseng achieves a 6.2 x -15.8 x improvement (83%-100% of the optimum) in aggregate client satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art approaches for cloud memory allocation.", "paper_title": "Ginseng: Market-Driven Memory Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344456400006"}
