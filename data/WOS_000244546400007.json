In this paper, we propose a 3-approximation algorithm for this problem under the assumption that edge cost is metric, r(u, v) is an element of {1, 2} for each u, v is an element of V, and d(v) >= 2 for each v is an element of V. This problem is a generalization of metric TSP. We also propose an approximation algorithm for the digraph version of the problem.", "paper_title": "Approximating a generalization of metric TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400007"}
