Without any location information, the path planning algorithm generates a big challenge. Many algorithms provided efficient paths based on tracking sensor nodes which forms a competitive method. However, most previous works have overlooked the distance cost of the path. In this paper, the problem is how to obtain a path with minimum distance cost and effectively organize the network to ensure the availability of this path. We first present a distributed algorithm to construct a path planning infrastructure by uniting the neighbors' information of each sensor node into an improved connected dominating set. Then, a path planning algorithm is proposed which could produce a path with its length at most c times the shortest Euclidean length from initial position to destination. We prove that the distributed algorithm has low time and message complexity and c is no more than a constant. Under different deployed environments, extensive simulations evaluate the effectiveness of our work. The results show that factor c is within the upper bound proved in this paper and our distributed algorithm achieves a smaller infrastructure size.", "paper_title": "A Path Planning Algorithm with a Guaranteed Distance Cost in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311736500001"}
