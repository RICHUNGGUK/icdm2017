However, the region of different values of equilibrium points of every cell in the CNN is not investigated. Therefore, in this paper, the regions of the number of different values of equilibrium points in cellular neural networks (CNNs) with thresholding activation function are obtained by the relationship between parameters of CNNs. The influence of the values of connection weights of CNNs on the number of equilibrium points for a cell is found. Some sufficient conditions are obtained by using the relationship among connection weights. Depending on these sufficient conditions, inputs and outputs of a CNN, the regions of the values of parameters can be obtained. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to support the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Analysis on equilibrium points of cellular neural networks with thresholding activation function", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100003"}
