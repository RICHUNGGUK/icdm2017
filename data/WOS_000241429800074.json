In this approach, the invariance of 3-D relative projective structure of a stationary scene over different views is exploited to eliminate outliers, mostly due to independently moving objects of a typical scene. The proposed approach is compared against a well-known RANSAC-based algorithm by the help of a test-bed. The results showed that the speed-up, gained by utilization of the proposed technique as a preprocessing step before RANSAC-based approach, decreases the execution time of the overall outlier rejection, significantly.", "paper_title": "Fast Outlier rejection by using parallax-based rigidity constraint for epipolar geometry estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800074"}
