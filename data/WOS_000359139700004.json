Moreover, some resources stay in an unusable state for extended time. To take into account these problems a cloud resource evaluation model is proposed, termed Entropy Optimization Evaluation and ant colony clustering Model (EOEACCM). The model releases long-term unavailable resources to save energy. First, by mean of the entropy increasing minimum principle, the proposed model can maximize the system utilization and balance profits of both cloud resource providers and users. As a consequence, it can shorten task completion time. Secondly, the model narrows the task scheduling size and achieves optimal scheduling by clustering. To make the model more suitable for the dynamics of cloud resources, the model design improves pheromone update policies by fixing total path length in each function cycle when clustering by the ant colony algorithm. Evaluation of results using EOEACCM demonstrate that it may be applicable for resource management strategies for migration and release, an application which can effectively save energy. The proposed model was evaluated by simulation. Experiment results showed the positive effect of user satisfaction from entropy optimization, as well as scheduling time from clustering. Moreover, when the scale of tasks was large, this clustering algorithm performed much better than others. The clustering model also demonstrated better adaptability when some cloud resources were joined or terminated.", "paper_title": "A Cloud Resource Evaluation Model Based on Entropy Optimization and Ant Colony Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700004"}
