However, it has a big problem: the radio coverage is very short; so many sensors are needed to cover wide areas and sensors are expensive. On the other hand, these technologies lack a high bandwidth. IEEE 802.11a/b/g technologies have higher coverage areas and higher bandwidth, but their energy consumption is significantly higher. This paper discusses the energy consumption analytically and gives the considerations that should be taken into account in developing a wireless local area sensor network. Then, we propose a new protocol based on group collaboration to be implemented in these types of networks in order to decrease the energy consumption and save the energy wasted by the whole system. Finally, the protocol proposed is simulated and compared with other protocols available in the Ns2 simulator in order to prove that our solution is better.", "paper_title": "Saving Energy in Wireless Local Area Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284954700009"}
