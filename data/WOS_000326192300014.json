The first method is Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Control (FMRLC) with a modified adaptation mechanism that tunes the fuzzy inverse model. The basic idea of this method is based on shifting the output membership functions in the fuzzy controller and in the fuzzy inverse model. The second approach is a 2 degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) control that is based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The T-S fuzzy model is obtained by identification of evolving fuzzy model and then used in the feed-forward and feedback parts of the controller. An error-model predictive-control approach is used for the design of the feedback loop. The controllers were compared on a non-linear second-order SISO system named the helio-crane. We compared the performance of the reference tracking in a simulation environment and on a real system. Both methods provided acceptable tracking performance during the simulation, but on the real system the 2 DOF FMPC gave better results than the FMRLC.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Control of a Helio-Crane", "paper_id": "WOS:000326192300014"}
