The adjoint model and the duality principle are used to pose a variational short-term control problem with the aim of determining optimal emission rates of the sources. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal control problem solution are Proved. A numerical scheme using a process of orthogonal projections is given for approximating the optimal solution. The computing efficiency of the scheme is shown. Numerical results obtained in the case of a single point source demonstrate the method's ability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
