MetiTree is a user-friendly, web application dedicated to organize, process, share, visualize and compare MSn data. It integrates several features to export and visualize complex MSn data, facilitating the exploration and interpretation of metabolomics experiments. A dedicated spectral tree viewer allows the simultaneous presentation of three related types of MSn data, namely, the spectral data, the fragmentation tree and the fragmentation reactions. MetiTree stores the data in an internal database to enable searching for similar fragmentation trees and matching against other MSn data. As such MetiTree contains much functionality that will make the difficult task of identifying unknown metabolites much easier.", "paper_title": "MetiTree: a web application to organize and process high-resolution multi-stage mass spectrometry metabolomics data", "paper_id": "WOS:000309881200029"}
