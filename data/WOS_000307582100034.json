The key insight behind our work is that we can use the technique of static information flow to amplify the result of a single test execution over the set of all inputs and interleavings that affect the property being verified. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of test amplification for verifying race-freedom and determinism over a large number of standard GPU kernels, by showing that the result of verifying a single dynamic execution can be amplified over the massive space of possible data inputs and thread interleavings.", "paper_title": "Verifying GPU Kernels by Test Amplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000307582100034"}
