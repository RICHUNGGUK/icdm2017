We take into account the diversity and large-scale aspects of the Web considering a large number of descriptors (24 color and 28 texture descriptors, including both traditional and recently proposed ones). The evaluation is made on two levels: a theoretical analysis in terms of algorithms complexities and an experimental comparison considering efficiency and effectiveness aspects. The experimental comparison contrasts the performances of the descriptors in small-scale datasets and in a large heterogeneous database containing more than 230 thousand images. Although there is a significant correlation between descriptors performances in the two settings, there are notable deviations, which must be taken into account when selecting the descriptors for large-scale tasks. An analysis of the correlation is provided for the best descriptors, which hints at the best opportunities of their use in combination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
