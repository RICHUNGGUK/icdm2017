This can cause a lack of repeatability in the analysis, particularly when the target signal is not man-made and has no known underlying basis functions (as in many biomedical signals). We propose a novel algorithm that measures frequency content in a signal without any basis function assumption. We then successfully validate it on a set of known test signals generated using a variety of functions and combinations thereof, as well as two collections of electrocardiograms, respectively evaluating the repeatability of the algorithm's measurements and their ability to predict sudden cardiac arrest.", "paper_title": "Time-Scale Analysis of Signals Without Basis Functions: Application to Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000372944400003"}
