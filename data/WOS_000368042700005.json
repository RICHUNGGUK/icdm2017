Two synchronization criteria are derived by using nonlinear feedback control and linear feedback control, respectively. A synchronization criterion for FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons is derived as the application of control method of this paper. Compared with some existing synchronization results for chaotic systems, the contribution of this paper is that feedback gains are only dependent on system parameters, rather than dependent on the norm bounds of state variables of uncontrolled and controlled HR neurons. The effectiveness of our results are demonstrated by two simulation examples.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONIZATION OF TWO COUPLED HINDMARSH-ROSE NEURONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000368042700005"}
