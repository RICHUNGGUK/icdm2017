SSBA adopts the training framework of BA, which makes SSBA adaptively generate categories to represent the distribution of both labeled and unlabeled training samples without any user's intervention. In addition, SSBA employs EM algorithm to adjust its parameters, which realizes the soft assignment of training samples to categories instead of the hard assignment such as winner takes all. Experimental results on benchmark and real world data sets indicate that the proposed SSBA achieves significantly improved performance compared with BA and EM-based semi-supervised learning method; SSBA is appropriate for semi-supervised classification tasks with large amount of unlabeled samples or with strict demands for classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised Bayesian ARTMAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000283087200005"}
