We introduce a novel initial alignment scheme that allows the user to identify \"landmark tunnels\" and/or a \"constrained silhouette\" in addition to the standard landmark vertices. To describe the evolution of non-landmark tunnels we automatically derive a continuous deformation from M to M' using a variational implicit approach. Overall, we achieve a cross parameterization scheme that is provably robust in the sense that it can map M to M' without constraints on their relative genus. We provide a number of examples to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our scheme between meshes of different genus and shape. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
