This study is motivated by imaging applications, where such boundary curves represent edges of images. The shearlet approach is able to characterize both locations and orientations of the edge points, including corner points and junctions, where the edge curves exhibit abrupt changes in tangent or curvature. Our results encompass and greatly extend previous results based on the shearlet and curvelet transforms which were limited to very special cases such as polygons and smooth boundary curves with nonvanishing curvature.", "paper_title": "Characterization and Analysis of Edges Using the Continuous Shearlet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101200008"}
