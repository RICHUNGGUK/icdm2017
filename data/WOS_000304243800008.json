RSNs use real-time video communication support (in addition to various sensor data communication) for mission-cooperation and remote-control of its multi-robots. In this article, the hybrid data-type clustering (HDC) and subnet-divided HDC (SHDC) algorithms are proposed to maximize the RSN lifetime and enable more efficient multi-robot mission-cooperation.", "paper_title": "Exploration Time Reduction and Sustainability Enhancement of Cooperative Clustered Multiple Robot Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304243800008"}
