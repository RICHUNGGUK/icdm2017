This problem is particularly acute for products that have a very short shelf-life and will be disposed of as waste should their shelf life expire. Chilled ready-meals are convenience foods with relatively short shelf-lives and volatile consumer demands; their manufacture is based on forecasted volumes and when demand has been over-predicted, considerable wastes are created. This is referred to as overproduction waste (OPW), which typically sees finished products disposed of through commercial waste channels as a result of lack of demand. The research reported in this paper has investigated the generation of a responsive demand management framework for the reduction of OPWs.", "paper_title": "A responsive demand management framework for the minimization of waste in convenience food manufacture", "paper_id": "WOS:000242761900001"}
