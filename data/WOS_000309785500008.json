Models with piecewise constant volatilities have been proposed recently as nonparametric alternatives. Following the latter approach, a procedure for online approximation of the current volatility is constructed by combining one-sided localized estimation of the variability with sequential testing for a change in it. A robust nonparametric framework is assumed since many financial time series show tails heavier than the Gaussian. A two-sample test for a change in variability is proposed, which works well even in case of skewed distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
