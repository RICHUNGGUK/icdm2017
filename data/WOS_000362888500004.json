Each agent is assumed to be governed by a second-order consensus control law corresponding to a directed and weighted graph. Two types of topology are considered. The first is concerned with directed trees, which represent the class of topology with minimum information exchange among all controllable topologies. A very simple necessary and sufficient condition regarding the weighting scheme is obtained for the controllability of double integrator multi-agent systems in this scenario. The second is concerned with a more general graph that can be reduced to a directed tree by contracting a cluster of nodes to a component. A similar necessary and sufficient condition is derived. Finally, several illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical analysis results.", "paper_title": "Controllability analysis of second-ordermulti-agent systemswith directed andweighted interconnection", "paper_id": "WOS:000362888500004"}
