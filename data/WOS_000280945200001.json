The algorithms given here work directly with the parametrization of the curve, and do not require to compute or use the implicit equation of the curve (in the case of planar curves) or of any projection (in the case of space curves). Moreover, these algorithms have been implemented in Maple; the examples considered and the timings obtained show good performance skills. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
