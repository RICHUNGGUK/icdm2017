By defining the capacity sets of such networks we carry out performance analysis in a dynamic setting, where the flows come and go and share the resources according to the balanced fairness principle. We derive flow throughput analytically for three special scenarios and devise an algorithm for general networks. At low loads, flow-optimized random access yields almost the same performance as optimal/deterministic scheduling. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
