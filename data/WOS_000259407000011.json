We are mainly concerned with rate-distortion optimized network How of a multiple description (MD) source from multiple servers to multiple sinks. We aim at maximizing a collective metric of the quality of source reconstruction at all sinks, by optimally routing the MD source streams from the server nodes to the sinks. This problem turns out to be very different from conventional maximum network flow. The objective function involves not only the flow volume but also the diversity of the flow contents (i.e., distinction of descriptions), hence, the term rainbow network flow (RNF). For a general network topology, a general fidelity function, and an arbitrary distribution of MDC descriptions on the servers, we prove the RNF problem to be Max-SNP-hard. However, the problem becomes tractable in many practical scenarios, such as when MDC is balanced with descriptions of the same length and importance, when all source nodes have the complete set of MDC descriptions, and when the network topology is a tree or has only one sink. Polynomial-time RNF algorithms are developed for these cases.", "paper_title": "Rainbow network flow of multiple description codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000259407000011"}
