A moment-based method that finds all of the eigenvalues that lie inside a given domain is used. In this method, a small matrix pencil that has only the desired eigenvalues is derived by solving large sparse systems of linear equations constructed from A and B. Since these equations can be solved independently, we solve them on remote servers in parallel. This approach is suitable for master-worker programming models. We have implemented and tested the proposed method in a grid environment using a grid RPC (remote procedure call) system called OmniRPC. The performance of the method on PC clusters that were used over a wide-area network was evaluated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
