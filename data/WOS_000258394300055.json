However, ZigBee's existing hierarchical routing algorithm has a disadvantage in that a node may communicate with a nearby node over several hops. In this letter we propose a Quasi-Hierarchical Routing (QHR) algorithm that can improve the ZigBee hierarchical routing method's inefficiency by using brief information on neighbors within radio range. The network simulation evaluates this QHR's performance by comparing it to other ZigBee routing schemes.", "paper_title": "Quasi-hierarchical routing algorithm for ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300055"}
