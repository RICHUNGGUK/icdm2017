The results of Experiment 2 (n=50) showed that participants with high non-verbal sensitivity experienced more positive valence and a greater level of arousal than participants with low non-verbal sensitivity. The biological sex of the participants became non-significant, after taking into consideration non-verbal sensitivity. The results of a mediation analysis showed that the emotional valence and arousal mediated the effects of non-verbal sensitivity on the enjoyment of the videogame. Implications with respect to a new understanding of gender preference for certain genres of videogames by identifying specific gender-related skills are discussed.", "paper_title": "Revisiting Gender Preference for a First-Person Shooter Videogame: Effects of Non-Verbal Sensitivity and Gender on Enjoyment", "paper_id": "WOS:000364776900009"}
