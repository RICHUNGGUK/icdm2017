The algorithm operates correctly under the distributed model and guarantees that two edges within distance 2 of each other receive distinct colors when the system stabilizes. It uses 2 Delta (Delta - 1) + 1 colors and stabilizes in 4n + (2 Delta (Delta - 1) + 2)m rounds, where n, m, respectively, denote the number of nodes and edges and Delta is the maximum degree of nodes in the graph.", "paper_title": "A Self-Stabilizing Distance-2 Edge Coloring Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000344649500004"}
