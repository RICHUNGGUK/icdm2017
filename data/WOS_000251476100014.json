Employing an active-contours segmentation model, 64 hip joint space (HJS) images (18 normal, 46 osteoarthritic) were obtained from the digitized radiographs of 32 unilateral and bilateral OA-patients. Shape features, generated from the HJS-images, and a hierarchical decision tree structure was used for the grading of OA. A shape features based regression model quantified the OA-severity. The system accomplished high accuracies in characterizing hips as \"Normal\" (100%), of \"mild/moderate\"-OA (93.8%) or \"severe\"-OA (96.7%). OA-severity values, as expressed by HJS-narrowing, correlated highly (r = 0.9, p < 0.001) with the values predicted by the regression model. The system may contribute to OA-patient management.
