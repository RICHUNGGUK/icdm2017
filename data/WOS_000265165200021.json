As new robotic applications are being identified, there is a greater need to be able to programme robots safely and quickly. This paper discusses the use of an augmented reality (AR) environment for facilitating intuitive robot programming, and presents a novel methodology for planning collision-free paths for an n-d.o.f. (degree-of-freedom) manipulator in a 3D AR environment. The methodology is interactive because the human is involved in defining the free space or collision-free volume (CFV), and selecting the start and goal configurations. The methodology uses a heuristic beam search algorithm to generate the paths. A number of possible scenarios are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
