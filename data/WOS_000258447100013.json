The purpose of this paper is to present how the software development process in large, virtual teams (LVTs) can be managed, so that they are in compliance with ISO 9001. Design/methodology/approach - The firm's actions are described in a case example format that illustrates how fit between theory and practice is achieved; and forms a precursor to the derivation of appropriate research arguments. Findings - The steps presented show the application of ISO 90003 guidelines to software development planning activities in LVTs, to meet the requirements of ISO 9000 certification. Research limitations/implications - The scope of this paper is limited to the application of Section 7.3 (Design and development) of ISO 90003:2004 to the software development process. The paper presents the discussion in a \"generalized\" fashion so that the steps described can be implemented by any software development company. Practical implications - The implications for managers in this study lie in the presentation of a set of steps to manage software development processes in LVTs, so that they are in compliance with ISO 9001. Originality/value - There is a dearth of studies on the application of process-based approaches in virtual organizations. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by examining how software development processes in virtual organizations (specifically, LVTs) may be formally managed, so that they are in compliance with ISO 9001.", "paper_title": "Using ISO 90003 for software \"design and development\" in large virtual teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000258447100013"}
