Following Levenshtein's idea, a new correlation lower bound for quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSSs) over the complex roots of unity is proposed in this paper. The derived lower bound is shown to be tighter than the Welch bound for QCSSs when the set size is greater than some value. The conditions for meeting the new bound with equality are also investigated.", "paper_title": "A Tighter Correlation Lower Bound for Quasi-Complementary Sequence Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600029"}
