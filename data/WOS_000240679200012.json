The Digital Signature Services standard eliminates the need to distribute user keys or signing devices across an organization. Instead, it facilitates the use of networked servers to create and verify signatures. The protocol's flexibility makes it suitable for applications from, simple time-stamping to advanced forms of signatures with full legal recognition.", "paper_title": "Oasis digital signing services - Digital signing without the headaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000240679200012"}
