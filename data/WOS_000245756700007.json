This approach is based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory for functional differential equations and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the use of a recent Leibniz-Newton model based transformation without including any additional dynamics. Three examples with numerical simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The first example considers the neural network with multiple time-varying delays, which may be seen as a particular case of the second example where it is subject to uncertainties and multiple time-varying delays. Finally, the third example analyzes the stability of the neural network with higher numbers of neurons subject to a single time-delay. The Hopf bifurcation theory is used to verify the stability of the system when the origin falls into instability in the bifurcation point. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
