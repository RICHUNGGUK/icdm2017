Image annotation is widely employed in domains such as web image classification, search, military, and biomedicine. Although the traditional Border/Interior pixel Classification (BIC) features are very efficient and compact when applied to image annotation to capture color, shape, and texture information, the color space histogram utilization rates are not balanced. The experiment results show that the Hilbert-scan method and the One-pass Partitioning Method (OPM) can effectively overcome the imbalance problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
