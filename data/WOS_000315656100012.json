A machine can process only one job at a time, whereas multiple machines can simultaneously process jobs in a batch. The evaluation of the performance is minimisation of maximum lateness. The problem is designated as . Three heuristics, based on simple scheduling rules, for each problem are proposed and their tight worst case bounds are found. Computational experiments are also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the heuristics.", "paper_title": "Scheduling on parallel machines to minimise maximum lateness for the customer order problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100012"}
