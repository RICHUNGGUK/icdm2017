In this article we propose an adaptive channel-superframe allocation (ACSA) scheme for such a system and evaluate its throughput and delay performance. The ACSA algorithm is designed to serve real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) flows separately in different channels instead of serving them in different times. We also propose to change the sliced superframe of IEEE 802.15.3 to an adaptive unsliced superframe in order to decrease the TCP round-trip time. We compared IEEE 802.15.3 MAC with ACSA MAC, which shows that the throughput and delay could be improved in ACSA MAC. We observed significant improvement in the throughput of NRT flows via the better distribution of bandwidth in ACSA MAC. The channel access delay is also improved by providing an unsliced superframe. In brief, the simulation results also support the analysis of the proposed adaptive channel-superframe allocation algorithm, which could generally improve the quality of service (QoS) in MMW systems.
