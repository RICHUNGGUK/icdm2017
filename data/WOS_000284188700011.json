Several DSTC schemes for the NDF with SAS (NDF-SAS) protocol are proposed and their average pairwise error probability for the error-free source-relay (SR) channel is also derived. The simulation results show that the NDF-SAS protocol achieves larger diversity order than the NDF protocol under the error-free and erroneous SR channels.", "paper_title": "Distributed Space-Time Coded Non-Orthogonal DF Protocols with Source Antenna Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000284188700011"}
