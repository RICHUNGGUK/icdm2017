It requires accurate and reliable hardware devices, or else communications may be unstable and unsure. In this paper, we focus on the high speed network hardware integrated circuit systems to obtain good electrical, mechanical and procedural characters. Very large scale integrations (VLSI) form the basis for the implementation of high-performance, low-power, and low-cost wireless computing and mobile application systems. In integrated circuit (IC) design flow, distributed electromagnetic effects at high frequencies become prominent and decisively impact overall IC performance. To solve this problem, this paper presents an electronic design automation tool capable of automatic capacitance extraction for IC interconnections. This tool integrates electromagnetic field based two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) interconnect capacitance extraction solvers. It can be used for VLSI parasitic capacitance parameters extraction. The system architecture, capacitance extraction process flow and some important data structures will be discussed. Some extraction experimental results will demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of our 2-D and 3-D solvers.", "paper_title": "A reliable quick parasitic capacitance extraction tool for the physical layer in communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209325200001"}
