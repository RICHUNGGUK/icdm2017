In this work we compare the two adversarial models previously considered in the literature, namely the full and selective-identity models. Remarkably, we show that the strongest security level with respect to selective-identity attacks (i.e. chosen-ciphertext security) fails to imply the weakest full-identity security level (i.e. one-wayness). In addition, an analogous result for the related primitive of tag-based encryption is presented.", "paper_title": "A separation between selective and full-identity security notions for identity-based encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300035"}
