A set of research projects are considering multimedia indexing, annotation, search and retrieval in the context of European funded research, but only the FP6 project RUSHES is focusing on automatic semantic annotation, indexing and retrieval of raw and un-edited audio-visual content. Even professional content creators and providers as well as home-users are dealing with this type of content and therefore novel technologies for semantic search and retrieval are required. In this paper, we present a summary of the most relevant achievements of the RUSHES `project, focusing on specific approaches for automatic annotation as well as the main features of the final RUSHES search engine.", "paper_title": "RUSHES-an annotation and retrieval engine for multimedia semantic units", "paper_id": "WOS:000276079400003"}
