It has been recently widely employed in data analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning applications. Isomap is one of the most promising manifold learning algorithms, which extends metric multi-dimensional scaling by using approximate geodesic distance. However, when Isomap is conducted on real-world applications, it may have some difficulties in dealing with noisy data. Although many applications represent a special sample by multiple feature vectors in different spaces, Isomap employs samples in unique observation space. In this paper, two extended versions of Isomap to multiple feature spaces problem, namely fusion of dissimilarities and fusion of geodesic distances, are presented. We have employed the advantages of several spaces and depicted the Euclidean distance on learned manifold that is more compatible to the semantic distance. To show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method, some experiments have been carried out on the application of shape analysis on MPEG7 CE Part B and Fish data sets.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised manifold learning based on multiple feature spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000334447600016"}
