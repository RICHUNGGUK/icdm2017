Modern processors provide techniques, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and CPU clock modulation (called throttling), to improve energy efficiency on-the-fly. Without careful application, however, DVFS and throttling may cause a significant performance loss due to system overhead. This paper proposes a novel runtime system that maximizes energy saving by selecting appropriate values for DVFS and throttling in parallel applications. Specifically, the system automatically predicts communication phases in parallel applications and applies frequency scaling considering both the CPU offload, provided by the network-interface card, and the architectural stalls during computation. Experiments, performed on NAS parallel benchmarks as well as on real-world applications in molecular dynamics and linear system solution, demonstrate that the proposed runtime system obtaining energy savings of as much as 14 % with a low performance loss of about 2 %.", "paper_title": "Automatic runtime frequency-scaling system for energy savings in parallel applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000335559500011"}
