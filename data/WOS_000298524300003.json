This study is aimed at gaining further insights into the daily support practices of e-tutors. Seventy-six e-tutors from 17 different European countries were invited to fill in an online questionnaire to evaluate collaborative activities, and to answer yes/no-questions regarding their intervention to support these collaborative activities. A cluster analysis identified two profiles of e-tutors according to the importance ascribed to collaborative activities, and to the number of times they intervened to foster such activities. The cluster validation revealed a difference between experienced and inexperienced European e-tutors in their support of online collaboration: e-tutors with experience considered specific cognitive activities to be more important for effective online collaboration, and they seemed to be more familiar in detecting and adequately intervening to avoid dysfunctional social phenomena. Thus, experience in supporting online collaboration seems to be a useful precondition for successfully intervening to stimulate necessary learning activities and to avoid dysfunctional collaborative activities.
