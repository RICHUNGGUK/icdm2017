Whenever a page is broadcast, it satisfies all outstanding requests for that page. The objective is to minimize average flow time of the requests. For any epsilon > 0, we give a (1 + epsilon)-speed O(1/epsilon(3))competitive online algorithm for broadcast scheduling. This improves over the recent breakthrough result of Im and Moseley [2010], where they obtained a (1 + epsilon)-speed O(1/epsilon(11))-competitive algorithm. Our algorithm and analysis are considerably simpler than Im and Moseley [2010]. More importantly, our techniques also extend to the general setting of nonuniform page sizes and dependent requests. This is the first scalable algorithm for broadcast scheduling with varying size pages and resolves the main open question from Im and Moseley [2010].", "paper_title": "Better Scalable Algorithms for Broadcast Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000345574600004"}
