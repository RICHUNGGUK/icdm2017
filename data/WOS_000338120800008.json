We have implemented the CCD algorithm with two different acceleration techniques which can handle rigid models, and have extended one of them to articulated models. The resulting algorithms take a few milliseconds for rigid models with tens of thousands of triangles, and a few milliseconds for articulated models with tens of links. We show that the performance of our algorithms is much faster than existing CCD algorithms for polygon-soup models and it is also comparable to competing CCD algorithms that are limited to manifold models.
