Pixels are ordered according to a scale of one of their features as brightness or color and the final image is obtained by comparing the measure of the feature with some thresholds. In this paper we present a family of cell-like P systems which solve the thresholding problem in linear time on the number of pixels.", "paper_title": "Thresholding 2D Images with Cell-like P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291700300003"}
