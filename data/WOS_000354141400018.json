Essentially, it is simply required to introduce a penalty like term in the momentum equation, with a variable penalty coefficient that culminates during the expulsion phase. Examples of applications are considered for the control of several turbulent wake flows, the backward facing step, the D-shaped body and the square back Ahmed body. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
