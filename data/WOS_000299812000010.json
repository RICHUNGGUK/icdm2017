The application of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in analog active filter circuit design and optimization is a promising area which is based on concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest. In this paper, the performances of genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony optimization, and particle swarm optimization, which are nature-inspired EA techniques, are evaluated for active filter design. Each algorithm is applied to two different filter structures and performances of them are also evaluated when filter design is realized with components selected from different manufactured series.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Evolutionary Algorithms for Optimal Filter Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000299812000010"}
