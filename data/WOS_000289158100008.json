First, a multiconstrained reduced-order FE observer (RFEO) is proposed to achieve FE for discrete-time T-S fuzzy models with actuator faults. Based on the RFEO, a new fault estimator is constructed. Then, using the information of online FE, a new approach for fault accommodation based on fuzzy-dynamic output feedback is designed to compensate for the effect of faults by stabilizing the closed-loop systems. Moreover, the RFEO and the dynamic output feedback fault-tolerant controller are designed separately, such that their design parameters can be calculated readily. Simulation results are presented to illustrate our contributions.", "paper_title": "Integrated Fault Estimation and Accommodation Design for Discrete-Time Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems With Actuator Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000289158100008"}
