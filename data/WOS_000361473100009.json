The positive semidefinite rank (psd rank) of M is the smallest integer k for which there exist positive semidefinite matrices of size such that . The psd rank has many appealing geometric interpretations, including semidefinite representations of polyhedra and information-theoretic applications. In this paper we develop and survey the main mathematical properties of psd rank, including its geometry, relationships with other rank notions, and computational and algorithmic aspects.", "paper_title": "Positive semidefinite rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100009"}
