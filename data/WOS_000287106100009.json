However, tensorface is not a preferable choice, because of the complexity of its multimode. In addition, a single mode space, except the person-space, could not be used for recognition directly. From the viewpoint of practical application, we propose a bimode model for face recognition and face representation. This new model can be treated as a simplified model representation of tensorface. However, their respective algorithms for training are completely different, due to their different definitions of subspaces. Thanks to its simpler model form, the proposed model requires less iteration times in the process of training and testing. Moreover bimode model can be further applied to an image reconstruction and image synthesis via an example image. Comprehensive experiments on three face image databases (PEAL, YaleB frontal and Weizmann) validate the effectiveness of the proposed new model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
