To solve the repeated marking problem, we propose in the nRVPPM that one packet is marked by routers only one time with the probability which is varying with the distance the packet has traveled. Besides, the nRVPPM makes the victim receives the packets marked by each router with the same probability. Based on the nRVPPM, we bring forward the CnRVPPM by employing the redundancy brought about by the similarity of IP addresses. Our simulation studies show that the proposed schemes offer high precision and efficiency, and can dramatically reduce the number of packets required for the traceback.", "paper_title": "Two novel packet marking schemes for IP traceback", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800044"}
