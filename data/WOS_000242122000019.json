Support vector machine provides a new pathway for clustering, however, it behaves bad in handling massive data. As an emergent theory, artificial immune system can effectively recognize antigens and produce the memory antibodies. This mechanism is constantly used to achieve representative or feature data from raw data. A combinational clustering method is proposed in this paper based on artificial immune system and support vector machine, Experimentation in functionality and performance is done in detail. Finally a more challenging application in elevator industry is conducted. The results strongly indicate that this combinational clustering in this paper is of feasibility and of practice.", "paper_title": "A combinational clustering method based on artificial immune system and support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000019"}
