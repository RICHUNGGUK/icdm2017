In this paper, we propose an integrated intelligent approach and framework for evaluation of assemblability and assembly sequence for electro-mechanical assemblies (EMAs). The approach integrates the STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data, officially ISO 10303)-based assembly model and XML schema with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process for assembly evaluation. The evaluation structure covers not only the geometric and physical characteristics of the assembly parts but also the assembly operation data necessary to assemble the parts. The realization of the integration system is implemented through a multi-agent framework. Through integration with the STEP-based product modeling agent system, CAD agent system and assembly planning agent system, the developed assembly evaluation agent system can effectively incorporate, exchange, and share concurrent engineering knowledge into the preliminary design process so as to provide users with suggestions for improving a design and also helping obtain better design ideas. The applications show that the proposed approach and system are feasible.", "paper_title": "Integration of the STEP-based assembly model and XML schema with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for muti-agent based assembly evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241113300001"}
