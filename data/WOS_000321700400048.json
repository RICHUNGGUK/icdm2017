Unlike previous authors' solutions this paper presents a multi-stage analysis system, which utilises cognitive analysis for description and recognition of pathological changes in coronary arteries structure. Such systems can be built for various types of data, but the main subject of this paper is a presentation of the cognitive system for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The main idea of such a system consists in gathering information from several stages of analysis, which allows a comprehensive assessment of the analysed image and formulation of the appropriate diagnosis. The proposed methods although they are mainly predestined for medical applications can also provide a base for other solutions, particularly for the acquisition and sophisticated semantic analysis of complex image patterns. Such techniques can be of great significance and find a number of uses in image recognition. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
