Most of the DTN routing protocols proposed in the literature to enable content sharing have been exploiting users' mobility patterns, in order to maximise the delivery probability, while minimising the overall network overhead (e.g., number of message replicas in the system, messages' path length). Common to all these protocols has been the assumption that devices are willing to participate in the content distribution network; however, because of battery constraints, participation cannot be taken for granted, especially if the very same subset of devices are continuously selected as content carriers, simply because of their mobility properties. Indeed, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art DTN routing protocols distribute load in a highly unfair manner, with detrimental effects on delivery once the assumption of unconditional participation is lifted. To overcome this limitation, we propose a load-balancing mechanism whereby nodes maintain local estimates of network workload, and use them to direct traffic towards the least loaded portion of the network. We implement the mechanism on top of a source-based DTN routing protocol, and demonstrate, by means of simulation using a variety of real mobility traces, that high delivery is now achieved without compromising fairness.
