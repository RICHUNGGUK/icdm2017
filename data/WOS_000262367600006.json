Assembling a complex system from components requires also a high degree of re-usability. The compatibility of the selected components may become a problem even at abstract design levels, due to possible different degrees of model determinacy, possible different execution models, etc. In this cases, an overall deterministic system behavior is difficult to achieve. The development of communication mechanisms between such components will have then to accommodate the differences, so that both correct processing and information exchange (data and control, appropriate choices and relative timing or sequencing) are achieved. For instance, human-machine interaction offers a good example of cooperation between deterministic models (machines) communicating with highly non-deterministic counterparts (the human models, if not restricted). We analyze here such communication mechanisms by \"confronting\" synchronized and un-synchronized models of execution, in the framework of action systems, a state based formalism. We \"force\" the two models to coexist within the same context and explore the possibilities of building trustworthy communication channels between them. We base our approach on a combined polling - interrupt scheme, which allows us to mitigate communication issues that may otherwise compromise the correct input-output system behavior. More robust system models are obtained by applying specific correctness rules of refinement. We illustrate our methods on an audio system example, implementable as either a software or a hardware device.", "paper_title": "Modeling Communication with Synchronized Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000262367600006"}
