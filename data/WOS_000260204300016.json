Firstly, to make DE suitable for solving scheduling problems, a largest-order-value (LOV) rule is presented to convert the continuous values of individuals in DE to job permutations. Secondly, after the DE-based exploration, an efficient local search, which is designed based on the landscape of MPFSSP with limited buffers, is applied to emphasize exploitation. Thus, not only does the HDE apply the parallel evolution mechanism of DE to perform effective exploration (global search) in the whole solution space, but it also adopts problem-dependent local search to perform thorough exploitation (local search) in the promising sub-regions. In addition, the concept of Pareto dominance is used to handle the updating of solutions in sense of multi-objective optimization. Moreover, the convergence property of HIDE is analyzed by using the theory of finite Markov chain. Finally, simulations and comparisons based on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed HIDE. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
