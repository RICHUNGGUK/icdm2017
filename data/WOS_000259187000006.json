The security requirements, such as authentication, confidentiality and integrity, always make computationally intensive processes and can easily become the bottleneck of the related applications. In this paper we implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (Miller in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 218, pp. 417-426, 1985; Koblitz in Math. Comput. 48:203-209, 1987) on an embedded multicore system, and explore the task scheduling methods in different levels. First, we propose an instruction scheduling method that utilizes all the cores to perform one modular operation in parallel. Second, we perform multiple modular operations with multiple cores in parallel. The performance of those two implementations is compared and a scheduling method combining these two types of parallelism is proposed. We discuss the details of our proposed method by using an FPGA implementation of ECC over a prime field.", "paper_title": "Elliptic curve cryptography on embedded multicore systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259187000006"}
