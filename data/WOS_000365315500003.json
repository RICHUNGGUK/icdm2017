Therefore, in order to achieve higher coding efficiency, the inter-view dependency must be taken into account for inter-view bit allocation. In this paper, the inter-view dependency is analyzed in detail, and a rate-distortion (RD) model for NRVs is derived by taking the distortion of RV into account. Based on the derived RD model, the inter-view bit allocation is represented as a mathematical problem with an analytic form, and is solved by a convex optimization (Lagrangian Multiplier) method. Experimental results demonstrate that the RD performance and the inter-view quality consistency of the proposed method is better than existing methods, while the complexity of the proposed method is comparable with the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Rate Distortion Optimized Inter-View Frame Level Bit Allocation Method for MV-HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000365315500003"}
