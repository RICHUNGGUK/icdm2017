We first show that the infimum achievable redundancy coincides with the asymptotic width W(X) of the entropy spectrum. Next, we consider the two sets C-(H) over bar(X) and C-W(X) and investigate relationships between them, where C-(H) over bar(X) and C-W(X) denote the sets of all the optimal FF codes with respect to the coding rate and the redundancy, respectively. We give two necessary and sufficient conditions corresponding to C-(H) over bar(X) subset of C-W(X) and C-W(X) subset of C-(H) over bar(X), respectively. We can also show the existence of an FF code that is optimal with respect to both the redundancy and the coding rate.", "paper_title": "Redundancy-Optimal FF Codes for a General Source and Its Relationships to the Rate-Optimal FF Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900003"}
