This algorithm provides a global optimization through a cross-layer optimization realized by decomposing the optimization problem in different sub-problems each of them corresponding to one among the grid layers such as application layer, collective layer and fabric layer. The QoS of an abstraction level is a utility function that assigns at every level a different value and that depends on the kind of task that is executed on the grid. The global QoS is given by processing of the utility function values of the three different levels, using the Lagrangian method. Multi-level QoS scheduling algorithm is evaluated in terms of system efficiency and their economic efficiency, respectively. Economic efficiency includes user utility, service provider's revenue and grid global utility. System efficiency includes execution success ratio and resource allocation ratio. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
