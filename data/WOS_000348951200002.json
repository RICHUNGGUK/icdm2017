By solving this problem in a game, one can synthesize a strategy that dictates the actions to be performed for ensuring that the target location is reached. In this work, we are interested in synthesizing \"robust\" strategies for ensuring reachability of a location in timed automata. By robust, we mean that it must still ensure reachability even when the delays are perturbed by the environment. We model this perturbed semantics as a game between the controller and its environment, and solve the parameterized robust reachability problem: we show that the existence of an upper bound on the perturbations under which there is a strategy reaching a target location is EXPTIME-complete. We also extend our algorithm, with the same complexity, to turn-based timed games, where the successor state is entirely determined by the environment in some locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
