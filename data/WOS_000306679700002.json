Traditional pixel based methods create difficulties to update the background model. They also bring out ghosts while a sudden change occurs in the background. Although edge based methods are robust to illumination variation and noise, existing edge-pixel based methods suffer from scattered moving edge pixels since they cannot utilize edge shape information. Moreover, traditional edge-segment based methods treat every edge segment equally creating edge mismatch due to non stationary background. This paper presents an edge-segment based statistical approach to modeling the background by using ordinary training images that may even contain moving objects. The proposed method relies on background edge segment matching; thus it does not leave any ghost behind. Moreover, the proposed method uses a statistical model for every background edge segment individually that makes the approach robust to handle camera movement as well as adapt to background motion (moving tree branches). Experiments with natural image sequences show that our method can detect moving edges efficiently under the above mentioned difficulties.", "paper_title": "STATISTICAL BINARY EDGE FREQUENCY ACCUMULATION MODEL FOR MOVING OBJECT DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700002"}
