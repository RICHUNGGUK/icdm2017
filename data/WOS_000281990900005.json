Typically, they involve iteratively improving the registration between each image and an evolving mean. A variety of methods have been proposed, which differ in their choice of objective function, representation of deformation field, and optimization methods. Given the complexity of the task, the final accuracy is significantly affected by the choices made for each component. Here, we present a groupwise registration algorithm which can take advantage of the statistics of both the image intensities and the range of shapes across the group to achieve accurate matching. By testing on large sets of images (in both 2D and 3D), we explore the effects of using different image representations and different statistical shape constraints. We demonstrate that careful choice of such representations can lead to significant improvements in overall performance.", "paper_title": "Computing Accurate Correspondences across Groups of Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000281990900005"}
