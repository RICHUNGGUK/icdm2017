This task is a much harder problem than classifying a single target, as sensors do not know how to assign captured observations to known targets. This article extends previous results scattered in the literature and unifies them in a single global framework with belief functions. Through two examples, it is shown that the full algorithm using belief functions improves results obtained with standard Bayesian classifiers and that it can be applied to a large variety of applications.
