Based on a collection of ISI- and non-ISI-indexed articles in the areas of business and computer science, three classification models are trained. A sensitivity analysis is applied to demonstrate the impact of words in different syntactical forms on the classification decision. The results demonstrate that the lexical domains of ISI and non-ISI articles are distinguishable by machine learning techniques. Our findings indicate that the support vector machine identifies ISI-indexed articles in both disciplines with higher precision than do the Naive Bayesian and K-Nearest Neighbors techniques.", "paper_title": "Identifying ISI-Indexed Articles by Their Lexical Usage: A Text Analysis Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350100500006"}
