Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important cardiac signal representing the sum total of millions of cardiac cell depolarization potentials. It contains important insights into the state of health and nature of the disease afflicting the heart. However, it is very difficult to perceive the subtle changes in ECG signals which indicate a particular type of cardiac abnormality. Hence, we have used the heart rate signals from the ECG for the diagnosis of cardiac health. In this work, we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of normal and Coronary Artery Disease conditions using heart rate signals. The heart rate signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (own. Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were applied on the set of DWT coefficients extracted from particular sub-bands in order to reduce the data dimension. The selected sets of features were fed into four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Our results showed that the ICA coupled with GMM classifier combination resulted in highest accuracy of 96.8%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.7% compared to other data reduction techniques (PCA and LDA) and classifiers. Overall, compared to previous techniques, our proposed strategy is more suitable for diagnosis of CAD with higher accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
