Recently some new constructions of optimal sets of FH sequences were presented. For the anti-jamming purpose, FH sequences are required to have a large linear span. The objective of this paper is to determine both the linear spans and the minimal polynomials of the FH sequences in these optimal sets. Furthermore, the linear spans of the transformed FH sequences by applying a power permutation are also investigated. If the power is chosen properly, the linear span could be very large compared to the length of the FH sequences.", "paper_title": "The linear span of the frequency hopping sequences in optimal sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000294297600007"}
