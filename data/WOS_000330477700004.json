All services share the same optical transmitter and receiver to reduce the network complexity. Error vector magnitude (EVM) values of 0.36%, 1.23%, and 0.25% can be achieved in the downlink for RFID, WiFi, and ZigBee signals, respectively. The corresponding EVM values in the uplink are 0.37%, 1.78%, and 0.29%, respectively. The scheme is verified over a 2 km RoF link where RFID, WiFi, and ZigBee master nodes can communicate normally with their slave nodes.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Transmission of Multiple Wireless Services Over Fiber With Reduced Network Complexities", "paper_id": "WOS:000330477700004"}
