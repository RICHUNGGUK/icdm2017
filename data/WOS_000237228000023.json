Although the algorithm has been originally developed for a project scheduling problem with financial objectives, we show that it can be extended to many other application areas and therefore, can serve as a sub-procedure for various optimization problems. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we present a hybrid recursive search procedure for the project scheduling problem with net present value maximization and compare it with state-of-the-art procedures by means of computational tests. Second, we show how the procedure can be adapted to two other application areas: project scheduling with work continuity minimization and the open pit mining problem. Last, we highlight some future research areas where this hybrid procedure might bring a promising contribution.", "paper_title": "An efficient hybrid search algorithm for various optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228000023"}
