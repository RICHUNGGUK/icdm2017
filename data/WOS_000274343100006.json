This makes improving adaptability to dynamic change an important topic in pervasive systems research. Currently, most of the efforts targeting improvements in adaptability focus on context-related issues, other variables being simply encoded in the program directly. This ignores the dynamic complexity of a pervasive system, resulting in poor system adaptability. In this paper, we propose a rule-based method in which the two types of change are separated from the program code. The changes are then stored and processed by means of corresponding rules. In our new method when a change occurs, the system needs only to modify the rules rather than the program code. This makes a pervasive system more robust in its adaptability to dynamic change. Experiments and examples are provided to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Rule-based Method for Improving Adaptability in Pervasive Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274343100006"}
