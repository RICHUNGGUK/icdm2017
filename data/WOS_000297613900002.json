There are many software-based traffic generators which can generate packets according to different stochastic distributions. However, they are not suitable for high-speed hardware test platforms. This paper describes FPGEN (Fast Packet GENerator), a programmable random traffic generator which is entirely implemented on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). FPGEN can generate variable packet sizes and traffic with Poisson and Markov-modulated on-off statistics at OC-48 rate per interface. Our work that is presented in this paper includes the theoretical design of FPGEN, the hardware design of the FPGA-based traffic generator board (printed circuit board design and construction) and the implementation of FPGEN on FPGA. Our experimental study demonstrates that FPGEN can achieve both the desired rate and statistical properties for the generated traffic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
