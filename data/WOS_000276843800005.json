The dialectical definition of warrant is expressed in terms of recursive defeat: an argument is warranted if each of its counter-arguments is itself defeated by a warranted counter-argument. However, few complexity results exist on checking whether an argument is warranted in the context of deductive models of argumentation, i.e. models where an argument is a deduction of a claim from a set of premises using some logic. We investigate the computational complexity of checking whether a claim is warranted in propositional argumentation under two natural definitions of warrant and show that it is PSPACE-complete in both cases.", "paper_title": "The Complexity of the Warranted Formula Problem in Propositional Argumentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000276843800005"}
