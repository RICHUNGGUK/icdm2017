We present a novel architecture technology that enables switch routing with FG elements for signals resulting from high voltage adapting FG elements. We present careful analysis and characterization of the FG structure, including programming ranges, electron tunneling paths, to show the indirect programming structure involving an nFET device can handle the signals. We present the experimental data (350-nm commercial CMOS process) for a single-transistor adaptive structure, for a compiled autozeroing amplifier, and for multiple adaptive FG circuits.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Floating-Gate Circuit Enabled Large-Scale FPAA", "paper_id": "WOS:000344483200007"}
