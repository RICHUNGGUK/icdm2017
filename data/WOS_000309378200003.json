Different from existing review analysis which makes more efforts on sentiment classification and opinion mining, our system mainly focuses on summarization, i.e., delivering the majority of information contained in the review documents by selecting the most representative review sentences for each extracted product feature. Comprehensive case studies and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, and the user study shows users' satisfaction. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
