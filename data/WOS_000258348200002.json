We discuss the increasing adoption of XML as a data exchange and storage medium and the challenges it poses in the area of frequent pattern mining. The main focus is on the elements of association mining, problems of tree enumeration, candidate generation and frequency counting.", "paper_title": "State of the art of data mini structured information", "paper_id": "WOS:000258348200002"}
