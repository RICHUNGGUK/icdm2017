A team of k agents is initially located at a distinguished vertex r of an undirected graph. We ask how many time steps are required to complete exploration, i.e., to make sure that every vertex has been visited by some agent. As our main result, we provide the first strategy which performs exploration of a graph with n vertices at a distance of at most D from r in time O( D), using a team of agents of polynomial size k = Dn(1+is an element of)< n(2+is an element of), for any is an element of > 0. Our strategy works in the local communication model, in which agents can only exchange information when located at a vertex, without knowledge of global parameters such as nor D. We also obtain almost- tight bounds on the asymptotic relation between exploration time and team size, for large k, in both the local and the global communication model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
