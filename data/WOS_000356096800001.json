Sensor nodes are usually designed to be small and inexpensive, so they have limited capabilities, such as limited computational power, memory and energy. This paper presents novel light-weight distributed anomaly detection and a foresight response strategy based on support vector data description (SVDD) for wireless sensor network. SVDD could sometimes generate such a loose decision boundary, when some noisy samples (outliers) exist in the training set. In addition, it requires the solution of a computationally intensive quadratic programming approach which is not applicable in WSNs. Hence, we modified the standard version of SVDD, and proposed the Linear Programming-based Fuzzy-Constraint SVDD (LP-FCSVDD) method to detect the outliers with more accuracy in acceptable time. Then we present a foresight response strategy to resist the intentional, unintentional and false anomalies. The overall experiments show prominence of our proposed method to achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic wireless sensor network datasets.", "paper_title": "Anomaly detection and foresight response strategy for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356096800001"}
