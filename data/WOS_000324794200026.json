Based on the knowledge of memristor and recurrent neural network, the model of the memristor-based recurrent networks is established. Several sufficient conditions are obtained, which ensure the existence of periodic solutions and global exponential stability of the memristor-based delayed recurrent networks. These results ensure global exponential stability of memristor-based network in the sense of Filippov solutions. And, it is convenient to estimate the exponential convergence rates of this network by the results. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Dynamic behaviors of memristor-based delayed recurrent networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200026"}
