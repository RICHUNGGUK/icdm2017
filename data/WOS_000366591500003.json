We have developed an interactive tabletop application equipped with RFID technology. This tabletop, called TangiSense, is based on a multi-agent system that allows users to associate information with behaviors to manipulate tangible objects. The application involves the recognition of basic colors. With the application, children are required to manipulate tangible objects. Their task involves recognizing objects that have \"lost\" their dominant color and placing these objects in appropriate colored areas. A tangible magician object automatically analyzes the filled zones and provides children and their teacher with virtual and vocal feedback. This application has been evaluated in a field study with children 3-5 years of age. The initial results are promising and show that such an application can support interaction and collaboration, and subsequently educational situations, among young children.", "paper_title": "RFID interactive tabletop application with tangible objects: exploratory study to observe young children' behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000366591500003"}
