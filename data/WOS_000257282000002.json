The primary displacement terms are expanded in thickness coordinate and an exact nature of electric potential is obtained in actuator and sensing layers. The electric potential function is evaluated by solving a second order ordinary differential equation satisfying electric boundary conditions along thickness direction of piezoelectric layer. A unidirectional composite plate attached with distributed actuator and sensor layers is analyzed under electrical and mechanical loading conditions and comparison of results with exact solution is presented. Results for non-piezoelectric plates are also compared with elasticity and other solutions of cylindrical bending. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
