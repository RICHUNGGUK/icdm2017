Since ADMs are expensive, it is desirable that if each node in WDM optical networks can use a minimum number of ADMs to achieve a near-ideal performance. In this article, first, the utilization statistics of ADMs are gathered by simulation. Then, ADMs are allocated based on the utilization statistics. In this respect, a simple sorting mechanism is used. The distinguished feature of the proposed approach is that it shows the way to allocate ADMs at the nodes of WDM optical networks with stochastic dynamic traffic. The experimental results ensure that the proposed approach can solve the problem of allocating ADMs in practical WDM optical networks considering stochastic dynamic traffic.", "paper_title": "Simulation-based SONET ADM optimization approach for dynamic traffic grooming in WDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256086300002"}
