The artificial viscosity acts as a numerical stabilization, as shock capturing, and as turbulence capturing for large eddy simulation of turbulent flow. The adaptive method resolves parts of the flow indicated by the a posteriori error estimates but leaves shocks and turbulence under-resolved in a large eddy simulation. The method is tested for examples in 2D and 3D and is validated against experimental data.
