In 2001, Mitomi and Miyaji proposed a general model of multi signatures, in which signed messages are flexible and the signing order is verifiable and flexible. Several schemes that satisfy these properties have been proposed, but to the best of our knowledge, their verifiable orders are limited to only sequential structures unlike some order-verifiable (but not message-flexible) multi signatures. We define a signing structure as a labeled tree, which can represent any natural signing order including series-parallel graphs, and formalize a general model of multisignatures that makes good use of our structure. We present a security model for such signatures, give the construction based on the general aggregate signature developed by Boneh et al., and provide a security proof in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "A general model of structured multisignatures with message flexibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300011"}
