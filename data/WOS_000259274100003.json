The purpose of the CostGlue project is to facilitate the exchange of simulation data in the field of telecommunications. We propose a common data interchange format and a data exchange model for raw simulation data, metadata and post-processing data. Based on this model, we additionally propose a framework, CostGlue, designed for packaging simulation output data into the common interchange format, launching post-processing plugins and exporting data into input formats for various third party tools. As a proof of concept we have implemented the framework as a software package and released it as free software.", "paper_title": "CostGlue: Simulation data exchange in telecommunications", "paper_id": "WOS:000259274100003"}
