(2) The server does not need to maintain a password table. (3) There is no need to involve a trusted third party. Although there were several variants of the YS-like schemes claimed to address the forgery attacks, this paper analyzes their security and shows that they still suffer from forgery attacks. Furthermore, a new scheme based on the concept of message authentication is proposed to foil the forgery attack.", "paper_title": "A secure YS-like user authentication scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000245308200002"}
