We first extract an initial curve, a graph composed of polylines, to model the different structures of the points. Then a least-squares optimization is used to improve the geometric approximation. The initial curve is extracted in three steps: anisotropic farthest point sampling with an adaptable sphere, graph construction followed by non-linear region identification, and edge refinement. Our algorithm produces faithful results for points sampled from non-simple curves without pre-segmenting them. Experiments on many simulated and real data demonstrate the efficiency of our method, and more faithful curves are reconstructed compared to other existing methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient reconstruction of non-simple curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000292309400001"}
