We use the finite mixture model (FMM) to fit the intensity histogram of the brain image sequence, where the cerebral vascular structure is modeled by a Gaussian distribution function and the other low intensity tissues are modeled by Gaussian and Rayleigh distribution functions. To estimate the parameters of the FMM, we propose an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which has a disturbing term in speeding updating the formula of PSO to ensure its convergence. We also use the ring shape topology of the particles neighborhood to improve the performance of the algorithm. Computational results on 34 test data show that the proposed method provides accurate segmentation, especially for those blood vessels of small sizes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
