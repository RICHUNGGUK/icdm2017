Gunrock couples high performance with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with less than 300 lines of code. We evaluate Gunrock on five graph primitives and show that Gunrock has at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.", "paper_title": "Gunrock: A High-Performance Graph Processing Library on the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000367254800032"}
