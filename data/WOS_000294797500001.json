However, it is limited by smaller hiding capacity. In this paper, a high payload scheme is proposed for a histogram shifting reversible data hiding which is based on multilevel modification of prediction errors. For any 8-bit grayscale image, only a small amount of side information had to be recorded for each embedding level. The side information is the key for retrieving the hidden data and restoring the original image. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed other reversible hiding methods in terms of embedding capacity and imperceptibility.", "paper_title": "MULTILEVEL REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING USING MODIFICATION OF PREDICTION ERRORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500001"}
