We present an algorithm designed to reveal \"hidden\" boundaries in gray level images, by computing gradients in higher order statistics of the data. We demonstrate it by applying it to the identification of possible \"hidden\" boundaries of glioblastomas as manifest themselves in three-dimensional (3-D) MRI scans, using a model driven approach. We also demonstrate the method using a nonmodel driven approach where we have no prior information about the location of possible boundaries. In this case, we use 3-D MRI data concerning schizophrenic patients and normal controls.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional nonlinear invisible boundary detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200014"}
