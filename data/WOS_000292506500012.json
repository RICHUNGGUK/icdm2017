By organizing the peers based on interconnection topologies, existing proposed schemas are purely based on the logical relationship without knowledge of the physical networks. In this paper, we propose a new structured DHT schema, which receives routing information not just from virtual neighbors in P2P overlay network, but also from nearby physical neighbors. The average degree of our model is 5, the diameter is logarithmic. The simulation shows that our model achieves shorter query path length, higher clustering, and better robustness than other overlay networks which have the same level of degree and diameter.", "paper_title": "Psu: a novel low-latency constant-degree overlay network", "paper_id": "WOS:000292506500012"}
