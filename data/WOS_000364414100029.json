In this paper, we give a construction of optimal (( s+ 1) x v, s+ 1, 1) two- dimensional optical orthogonal codes with both at most one-pulse per wavelength and at most one-pulse per time slot, where s vertical bar gcd(p(1) - 1, p(2) - 1,..., p(l) - 1). The method is much simpler than that in [1]. Optimal (m x v, k, 1) two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes are also constructed based on the Steiner system S [2, k, m].", "paper_title": "A Note on Two-Dimensional Optical Orthogonal Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414100029"}
