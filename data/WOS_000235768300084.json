After a, while, however, impostors' keystroke patterns become also available from failed login attempts. We propose to retrain the novelty detector with the impostor patterns to enhance the performance, In this paper the support vector data description (SVDD) and the one-class learning vector quantization (1-LVQ) are retrained with the impostor patterns. Experiments on 21 keystroke pattern datasets show that the performance improves after retraining and that the one-class learning vector quantization outperforms other widely used novelty detectors.", "paper_title": "Retraining a novelty detector with impostor patterns for keystroke dynamics-based authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300084"}
