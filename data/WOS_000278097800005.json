DVCFOAs are realized by enhancing the topology of the conventional CFOA in order to have available a second high-impedance input terminal and, simultaneously, establishing a voltage at low-impedance input terminal equal to the difference between the voltages at high-impedance input terminals. A third-order leapfrog filter is realized by employing CFOAs or DVCFOAs, and the most important performance factors of the corresponding configurations have been considered in order to investigate the benefits offered by each topology.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF FILTERS WITH ONLY GROUNDED PASSIVE ELEMENTS USING DIFFERENTIAL VOLTAGE CURRENT FEEDBACK OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278097800005"}
