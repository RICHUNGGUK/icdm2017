Coming into contact with global sharing of resources, mutual well-understood knowledge of intellectual property is worthy of attention. However, there is a lack of systematic information-modeling methodology for the issue; closely connected to this problem is that most of the intelligent legal systems are undesirable and ineffective for multinational semantic mapping of article information. We propose an ontology-guided approach that provides semantic primitive representation of legal information with intention perspective. The domain ontology we developed is used as a fundamental conceptual framework to maintain the consistency among diverse legal representation.", "paper_title": "An ontological approach to support legal information modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110300005"}
