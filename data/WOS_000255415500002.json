The latter pertain to a vast range of applications that necessitate an optimal sequence of decisions to be obtained. An underlying assumption is that a complete model of the environment is provided, whereby the dynamics are governed by a Markov decision process. Existing DIP implementations have traditionally focused on software-based mechanisms. Here, the authors present a method for exploiting the inherent parallelism associated with computing both the value function and optimal policy. This allows for the optimal policy to be obtained several orders of magnitude faster than traditional software implementations, establishing the viability of the approach for demanding, real-time applications. The well-known rental car management problem has been studied as a benchmark for which a field-programmable gate array-based implementation was designed. The results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the execution speed and the scalability properties.", "paper_title": "Hardware architecture for high-speed real-time dynamic programming applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000255415500002"}
