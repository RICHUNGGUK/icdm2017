Combining fingerprint verification and smart cards is one of a potential solution for strong remote user authentication. In this paper, we cryptanalyze an efficient fingerprint-based remote user authentication scheme introduced by Yoon and Yoo in 2005, and propose a new scheme improved with regard to security and efficiency. Actually, the Yoon-Yoo scheme is a security improvement on the previous Lin-Lai fingerprint-based verification scheme, while the Lin-Lai scheme is a precedent improvement on the Lee-Ryu-Yoo scheme. However, we have found that the most recent Yoon-Yoo scheme is still vulnerable to various types of impersonation attacks. Our new protocol is resistant to those attacks and more efficient than the previous schemes.", "paper_title": "An improved fingerprint-based remote user authentication scheme using smart cards", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100095"}
