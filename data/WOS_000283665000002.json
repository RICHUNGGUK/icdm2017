The core of the method is a set of manually curated highly reliable multiple sequence alignments of selenoprotein families, which are used as queries to scan genomic sequences. Results of the scan are processed through a number of steps, to produce highly accurate predictions of selenoprotein genes with little or no human intervention. Selenoprofiles is a valuable tool for bioinformatic characterization of eukaryotic selenoproteomes, and can complement genome annotation pipelines.", "paper_title": "Selenoprofiles: profile-based scanning of eukaryotic genome sequences for selenoprotein genes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000002"}
