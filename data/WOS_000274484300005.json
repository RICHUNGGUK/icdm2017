Several possible mechanisms for its origins have been proposed, including: no strand biases for mutation and selection, strand inversion and selection of stem-loop structures. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms to strand symmetry are not clear. In this article, we studied specifically the role of stem-loop potential of single-stranded DNA in strand symmetry. Results: We analyzed the complete genomes of 90 prokaryotes. We found that most oligonucleotides (pentanucleotides and higher) do not have a reverse complement in close proximity in the genomic sequences. Combined with further analysis, we conclude that the contribution of the widespread stem-loop potential of single-stranded genomic DNA to the formation and maintenance of strand symmetry would be very limited, at least for higher-order oligonucleotides. Therefore, other possible causes for strand symmetry must be taken into account to a deeper degree.", "paper_title": "Limited contribution of stem-loop potential to symmetry of single-stranded genomic DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000274484300005"}
