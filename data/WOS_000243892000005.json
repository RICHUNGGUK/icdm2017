A new adding method based on geometric growing criterion and the E-completeness of fuzzy rules is first used to generate the initial structure. Then a hybrid algorithm based on genetic algorithms, backpropagation, and recursive least squares estimation is used to adjust all parameters including the number of fuzzy rules. This has two steps: First, the linear parameter matrix is adjusted, and second, the centers and widths of all membership functions are modified. The GA is introduced to identify the least important neurons, i.e., the least important fuzzy rules. Simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Design for self-organizing fuzzy neural networks based on genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000243892000005"}
