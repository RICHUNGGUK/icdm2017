For multiple criteria decision problems, defining the criteria is an important element of the structuring process. To provide a decision maker with a general instrument for identifying relevant criteria, two methods representing different approaches were empirically evaluated. This evaluation showed that Kelly's repertory grid technique in particular has several useful features. Accordingly, the repertory grid technique was adapted to build a problem structuring front end for the aspiration-level interactive method proposed by Lotfi, Stewart, and Zionts.
