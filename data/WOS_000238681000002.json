Previous decentralized load balancing techniques in distributed systems base their decisions on periodic updates containing information about load or available capacity observed at the serving entities. We show that these techniques do not work well in the peer-to-peer context; either they do not address peer node heterogeneity, or they suffer from significant load oscillations which result in unutilized capacity. We propose a new decentralized algorithm, Max-Cap, based on the maximum inherent capacities of the replica nodes. We show that unlike previous algorithms, it is not tied to the timeliness or frequency of updates, and consequently requires significantly less update overhead. Yet, Max-Cap can handle the heterogeneity of a peer-to-peer environment without suffering from load oscillations.", "paper_title": "Practical load balancing for content requests in peer-to-peer networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238681000002"}
