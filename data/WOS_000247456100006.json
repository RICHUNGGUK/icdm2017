In this paper, we summarize emerging wireless broadband access technologies, ranging from WLANs to satellite communications. We explain the latest standards in the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 families in detail. The MAC layer mechanisms of IEEE 802.11e, 802.11n, and 802.11s standards are explained as well as the point-to-multipoint and Mesh modes of IEEE 802.16. The recent mobility amendment to the WiMAX family, IEEE 802.16e, is also described. Though the earliest versions of some of these technologies date back to 1996 (such as IEEE 802.11) and some are obsolete (such as HiperLAN), they have been included in this survey for the sake of completeness. Wireless technologies can be categorized based on their coverage areas. IEEE 802.11 and ETSI HiperLAN standards are considered for wireless access in local areas. IEEE 802.16 and 802.22, ETSI HiperACCESS and HiperMAN, WiBro, and HAP technologies can be used to provide service in metropolitan areas. Lastly, IEEE 802.20 and satellite systems provide service as wide area networks. Since the aim of this survey is to summarize wireless broadband technologies for data services, technologies such as Wireless USB are excluded. 3G and 4G systems have also been excluded since they are covered in detail in [C. Smith, D. Collins, 3G Wireless Networks, second ed., McGraw-Hill Osborne Media, 2006; S.G. Glisic, Advanced Wireless Networks: 4G Technologies, Wiley Publishing, 2005]. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
