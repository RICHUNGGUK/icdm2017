We consider an initial implicitly defined surface, which is represented as the zero set of a C(1) smooth scalar field with non-vanishing gradients. In order to represent sharp edges and vertices, this surface is augmented by adding new types of implicit representations, called edge descriptors and vertex descriptors. They are defined with the help of the distance field of edge curves. In our implementation, we use circular splines to describe these edge curves, since they support a fast and non-iterative closest point computation. After adding the edge and vertex descriptors to the initial scalar field, the zero set of the augmented function contains the sharp features. We apply the new representation to surface modeling by implicitly defined surfaces with sharp features and to object reconstruction. In the latter case we describe an algorithm for detecting the sharp curves and vertices of a shape which is given by an unorganized point cloud, which are then approximated by circular splines, in order to define the edge and vertex descriptors.
