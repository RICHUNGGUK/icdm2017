In addition, available investment capital sometimes cannot be accurately given either. Fuzzy variables can reflect vagueness of these parameters. In this paper, capital budgeting problem with fuzzy investment outlays, fuzzy annual net cash flows and fuzzy available investment capital is studied based on credibility measure. One new mean-variance model is proposed for optimal capital allocation. A fuzzy simulation-based genetic algorithm is provided for solving the proposed optimization problem. One numerical example and an experiment are also presented to show the optimization idea and the effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
