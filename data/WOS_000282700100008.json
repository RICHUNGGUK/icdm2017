A joint of L is a point incident to at least d lines of L, not all in a common hyperplane. Using a very simple algebraic proof technique, we show that the maximum possible number of joints of L is I similar to(n (d/(d-1))). For d=3, this is a considerable simplification of the original algebraic proof of Guth and Katz (Algebraic methods in discrete analogs of the Kakeya problem, 4 December 2008, arXiv:0812.1043), and of the follow-up simpler proof of Elekes et al.
