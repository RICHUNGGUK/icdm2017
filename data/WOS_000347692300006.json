The reduced feature size not only lowers the number of electrons stored at each floating-gate but also increases the cell-to-cell interference (CCI). As a result, the reliability of NAND flash memory has become an important issue that cannot be well solved by only advancing the process technology. In this paper, we present signal processing and error correction techniques that can overcome the reliability problem while minimizing the energy consumption. These techniques include efficient estimation of the threshold voltage distribution, CCI cancellation aware soft-information computation, and low-energy soft-decision error correction. We also include experimental results for the presented techniques.", "paper_title": "Low Energy Signal Processing Techniques for Reliability Improvement of High-Density NAND Flash Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692300006"}
