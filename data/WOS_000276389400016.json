We consider the problem of assigning short labels to the nodes of any n-node graph is such a way that given the labels of any two nodes u and v, one can decide whether u and v are k-vertex connected in G, that is, whether there exist k vertex disjoint paths connecting u and v. This article establishes an upper bound of k(2) log n on the number of bits used in a label. The best previous upper bound for the label size of such a labeling scheme is 2(k) log n.", "paper_title": "Labeling Schemes for Vertex Connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000276389400016"}
