This method models a process into a sequence of intervals and calculates the value of the maximum benefit as a result of optimum decisions during each interval. SE and CE processes are evaluated in terms of the parameters: simultaneity and intensity of interaction. The maximum expected payoff method shows under what conditions SE or CE is best, and the effect of incomplete information and resultant rework. Results are compared to actual NPD processes with good agreement.", "paper_title": "Determining the value of sequential and concurrent NPD processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000259619900003"}
