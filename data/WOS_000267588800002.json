The de facto standard, the random early detection (RED) AQM scheme, and most of its variants use average queue length as a congestion indicator to trigger packet dropping. This paper proposes a novel packet dropping scheme, called self-tuning proportional and integral RED (SPI-RED), as an extension of RED. SPI-RED is based on a self-tuning proportional and Integral feedback controller, which considers not only the average queue length at the current time point, but also the past queue lengths during a round-trip time to smooth the impact caused by short-lived traffic dynamics. Furthermore, we give theoretical analysis of the system stability and give guidelines for selection of feedback gains for the TCP/RED system to stabilize the average queue length at a desirable level. The proposed method can also be applied to the other variants of RED. Extensive simulations have been conducted with ns2. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed SPI-RED algorithm outperforms the existing AQM schemes in terms of drop probability and stability.
