An approach for computing the probability that a particular chemical graph is generated under this model is provided. The model is also used to provide theoretical bounds on the accuracy of a class of canonical labeling algorithms for a class of hydrocarbons.", "paper_title": "Random Models and Analyses for Chemical Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049200007"}
