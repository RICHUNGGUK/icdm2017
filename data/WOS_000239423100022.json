Based on user's original keystroke samples, artificial keystroke samples are produced by resampling techniques in both time and wavelets domains. KBS constructed from these original and artificial keystroke samples shows smaller error rates than KBS from original keystroke samples only. Our resampling techniques can reduce user's workload for keystroke pattern registration while maintaining practically allowable error rates of KBS.", "paper_title": "Reliable Keystroke Biometric System based on a small number of keystroke samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423100022"}
