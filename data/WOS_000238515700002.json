Since it is relatively difficult to compare the registration errors of different point matches, we project them onto a virtual image plane for more accurate comparison using the classical pin-hole perspective projection camera model. While the traditional ICP algorithm is more interested in the points in the second image close to the sphere centred at the transformed point, the novel algorithm is more interested in the points in the second image as collinear as possible to the transformed point. The novel algorithm then extracts useful information from both the registration error and projected error histograms for the elimination of false matches without any feature extraction, image segmentation or the requirement of motion estimation from outliers corrupted data and, thus, has an advantage of easy implementation. A comparative study based on real images captured under typical imaging conditions has shown that the novel algorithm produces good registration results. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
