The measurement integrated simulation has a deep relationship with \"data assimilation\" that has been developed in the field of earth science. In this paper, value of parameter which is one of uncertainty factors in simulation is investigated by using the ensemble Kalman filter that is an advanced technique of data assimilation. In this research, the values of parameters in the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are investigated. And, this paper shows that the values could be determined objectively or statistically by data assimilation techniques and not by subjective \"calibration\" as performed by the model proposers themselves.
