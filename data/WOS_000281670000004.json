We firstly translate the image to be enhanced from RGB space into HIS space, secondly keep its H component unchanged, and thirdly stretch its S component exponentially, and at last process its I component in the following manner: couple both the gray value and the spatial information into an inner activity item of corresponding neuron, integrate the human visual system into a dynamic component of corresponding neuron, and compare the inner activity item with dynamic component to obtain the enhanced image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our strategy.", "paper_title": "Color image enhancement based on HVS and PCNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000281670000004"}
