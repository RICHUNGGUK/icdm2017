The proposed work caters an application of wavelet network used in fuzzy systems for forecasting of dynamic systems. A wavelet network approximates the consequent part of each fuzzy rule. The wavelet network is a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer that uses a combination of Wavelet and Sigmoid Activation Function. A hybrid learning method composed of genetic algorithm and gradient descent is proposed to tune the learning parameters of the proposed Wavelet Neuro-Fuzzy model. Further, an analysis regarding the convergence and stability of gradient descent learning is presented for the proposed Wavelet Neuro-Fuzzy model. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed model and learning strategy, three different classes of benchmark problems have been considered.", "paper_title": "WAVELET NEURO-FUZZY MODEL WITH HYBRID LEARNING ALGORITHM OF GRADIENT DESCENT AND GENETIC ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000288802400010"}
