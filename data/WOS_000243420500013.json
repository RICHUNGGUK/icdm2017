Direct Curvature Scale Space (DCSS) is defined as the CSS that results from convolving the curvature of a planar curve with a Gaussian kernel directly. In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of DCSS in detecting corners on planar curves. The scale space behavior of isolated single and double corner models is investigated and a number of model properties are specified which enable us to transform a DCSS image into a tree organization and, so that corners can be detected in a multiscale sense. To overcome the sensitivity of DCSS to noise, a hybrid strategy to apply CSS and DCSS is suggested.", "paper_title": "Direct curvature scale space: Theory and corner detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000243420500013"}
