First, the control system of marine engine is described. Second, the design is formulated as a special optimization problem. With the explicit weighting values, the optimization procedure searches the optimal shape of the closed-loop system responses to the external disturbance and to the step input. An optimal-tuning controller is designed by minimizing the settling tinge and the overshoot. of the step disturbance response after the rising time and other corresponding criteria of the step input response are satisfied. Third, an optimization procedure based on the framework of membrane computing is investigated for solving the optimization problem. The optimization algorithm adopts the idea from standard membrane computing. Moreover, its objects and system structure are inspired by the structure of the DNA molecule. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and validity of the method. The controller is compared with other controllers according to the characteristics of the responses. The comparison result verifies that the new design method improves the specification of the controller.", "paper_title": "CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR A MARINE DIESEL ENGINE USING MEMBRANE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800008"}
