Even in its simplest fixed-backbone formulation, CPD encompasses a computationally difficult NP-hard problem that prevents the exact exploration of complex systems defining large sequence-conformation spaces. Results: We present here a CPD framework, based on cost function network (CFN) solving, a recent exact combinatorial optimization technique, to efficiently handle highly complex combinatorial spaces encountered in various protein design problems. We show that the CFN-based approach is able to solve optimality a variety of complex designs that could often not be solved using a usual CPD-dedicated tool or state-of-the-art exact operations research tools. Beyond the identification of the optimal solution, the global minimum-energy conformation, the CFN-based method is also able to quickly enumerate large ensembles of suboptimal solutions of interest to rationally build experimental enzyme mutant libraries.", "paper_title": "A new framework for computational protein design through cost function network optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000323344800008"}
