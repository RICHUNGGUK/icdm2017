They are closely related to partitioned difference families. In this paper, we present generic constructions of ZDB functions from functions with difference-balanced property. In particular, two classes of ZDB functions with new and flexible parameters are reported. Employing these new ZDB functions, we obtain at the same time optimal (1) constant-composition codes, (2) constant-weight codes, and (3) perfect difference systems of sets, all with new and flexible parameters.", "paper_title": "Some New Classes of Zero-Difference Balanced Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298989200011"}
