To achieve broad 10-dB bandwidth of more than 45% and 31% for the lower and upper operating bands, respectively, the techniques of shorting the open-end of the microstrip feed line to the driven monopole and loading a C-shaped parasitic element with dissimilar arm lengths into the opposite side of the IFA were introduced. Further experimental results also show that the proposed IFA have efficiencies of more than 60% throughout the bands of interest. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
