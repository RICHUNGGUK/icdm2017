The construction and description of basic-element models were first discussed in detail according to the fixed characteristics of the geometric appearances of and the spatial relationships between the components of high-speed railways. Then, spatial semantic constraint rules and scene mapping and instantiation methods were designed to accurately and rapidly integrate various basic-element models for automatically generating high-fidelity three-dimensional high-speed railway scenes. Finally, a prototype modelling system was developed to implement preliminary experiments. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this article is suitable for the automatic generation of virtual high-speed railway scenes by combining sophisticated basic-element models in a seamless manner. Modelling operations and professional knowledge are decoupled to reduce the complexity and difficulty of multidisciplinary collaborative modelling, which improves the modelling efficiency of virtual high-speed railway scenes.", "paper_title": "A procedural modelling method for virtual high-speed railway scenes based on model combination and spatial semantic constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000357018400009"}
