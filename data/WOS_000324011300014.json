The chromatogram baseline obtained by this method was true in all ranges of the retention time, including the ranges of chromatographic peaks. Besides, it could express the baseline-shift with the heteroscedastic noise, which was usually contained in the chromatographic peak and grew with the signal intensity of the peak. The metabonomics models of liver toxicity were built according to total ion chromatograms of urine samples from APAP, CCl4 and normal groups, whose baseline-shift was eliminated by this method. The result showed that baseline-shift would lead to a reduction of the evaluated toxicity and then may result in a wrong evaluation of drug toxicity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
