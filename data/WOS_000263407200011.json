Base-cloud and acceptance factor of trust are used to implement the reasoning mechanism of trust cloud, which can deal with the trust recommendation and synthesis of multiple trust paths, and implement the propagation of trust relationship. The simulation results show that the proposed model can lead to higher cooperation successful rate compared with the previous models.", "paper_title": "A Cloud-based Discrete Metric Trust Management Model in Open Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263407200011"}
