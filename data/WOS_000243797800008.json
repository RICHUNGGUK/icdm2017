Due to cost, time, or flexibility for designer courses and learners, e-learning has been adopted by corporations as an alternative training method. E-learning effectiveness evaluation is vital, and evaluation criteria are diverse. A large effort has been made regarding e-learning effectiveness evaluation; however, a generalized quantitative evaluation model, which considers both the interaffected relation between criteria and the fuzziness of subjective perception concurrently, is lacking. In this paper, the proposed new novel hybrid MCDM model addresses the independent relations of evaluation criteria with the aid of factor analysis and the dependent relations of evaluation criteria with the aid of DEM-ATEL. The AHP and the fuzzy integral methods are used for synthetic utility in accordance with subjective perception environment. Empirical experimental results show the proposed model is capable of producing effective evaluation of e-learning programs with adequate criteria that tit with respondent's perception patterns, especially when the evaluation criteria are numerous and intertwined.
