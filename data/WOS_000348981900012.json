The growth and propagation process of the SLGS wrinkling is elucidated by the developing atomic out-of-plane displacements of the key atoms. It reveals that the shape of SLGS and loading condition have a significant effect on the SLGS wrinkling deformation. The dependences of the wrinkling amplitude, wavelength, and out-of-plane displacements on the applied gradient shear displacements are obtained with MD simulations. The effects of aspect ratio, temperature, and loading grads on wrinkling in graphene are also studied.", "paper_title": "Study on wrinkling in graphene under gradient shear by molecular dynamics simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348981900012"}
