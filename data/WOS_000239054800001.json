It provides a simple characterization of the computation of this transformation and suggests an alternative algorithm for computing it. It also suggests an alternative transformation, the UT transform, with the same utility as the compact WY Transform which requires less computation and has similar stability properties. That alternative transformation was first published over a decade ago but has gone unnoticed by the community.", "paper_title": "Accumulating householder transformations, revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000239054800001"}
