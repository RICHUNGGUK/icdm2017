This thesis aims at solving the differences between node energy and task, which causes coverage holes and blind spots of Wireless Sensor Network, and proposes a coverage algorithm, based on key node scheduling, divides node subsets, and adjusts the states of individual nodes according to node energy and coverage rate. This algorithm ensures network connectivity while reducing coverage holes and redundancy. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce failure nodes, energy consumption, improve network coverage rate, and demonstrates network convergence and stability.", "paper_title": "A Coverage Algorithm based on Key Node Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000366998400012"}
