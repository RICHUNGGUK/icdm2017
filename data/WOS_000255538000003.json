However, in many realistic situations, a job will consume more time than it would have consumed if it had begun earlier. This phenomenon is known as deteriorating jobs. In the science literature, the deteriorating job scheduling problems are relatively unexplored in the flowshop settings. In this paper, we study a two-machine flowshop makespan scheduling problem in which job processing times vary as time passes, i.e. they are assumed as increasing functions of their starting times. First, an exact algorithm is established to solve most of the problems of up to 32 jobs in a reasonable amount of time. Then, three heuristic algorithms are provided to derive the near-optimal solutions. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithms. In addition, the impact of the deterioration rate is also investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
