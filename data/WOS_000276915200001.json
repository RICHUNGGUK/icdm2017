To address this problem, we have developed a special abstract 2D representation to depict all important topological features and geometrical parameters. Our approach involves reducing these structures based on symmetry and perceived building blocks to a compressed, graph representation that allows for quick structure analysis, classification, and comparison.", "paper_title": "Chemical Hieroglyphs: Abstract Depiction of Complex Void Space Topology of Nanoporous Materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000276915200001"}
