This paper provides a novel multiobjective approach for simulation-driven decision making that accounts for not only the conventional average system performance indices, but also (i) upper-tail, or extreme, values of these indices, and (ii) measures of their sensitivity to uncertainty in model parameters. The proposed approach is applied to a hospital emergency department service design case study wherein different design alternatives are compared using total time-in-system performance metric under multiple uncertain operating conditions.
