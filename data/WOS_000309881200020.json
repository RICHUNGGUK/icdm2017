Previously, we developed a multi-component high-precision enzyme function predictor, EFICAz(2) (enzyme function inference by a combined approach). Here, we present an updated improved version, EFICAz(2.5), that is trained on a significantly larger data set of enzyme sequences and PROSITE patterns. We also present the results of the application of EFICAz(2.5) to the enzyme reannotation of 396 genomes cataloged in the ENSEMBL database.", "paper_title": "EFICAz(2.5): application of a high-precision enzyme function predictor to 396 proteomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000309881200020"}
