It is composed of a doubly fed induction generator linked mechanically and electrically to a permanent magnet synchronous machine which may recover or supply the slip power and which feeds the DFIG with its magnetizing reactive power leading to classical capacitor removing. The model lies on a classical approach, based on a Park representation, and on an energetic macroscopic representation (EMR). In its first part, this paper develops the modelling principles and underlines the complementarity of both approaches. The control strategy is then depicted in the case of passive loads supplying. Finally, some simulation results are showed and commented. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
