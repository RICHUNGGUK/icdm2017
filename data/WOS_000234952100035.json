Compared with the previous method, there are two points revised in the proposed method. Firstly, we relax the endpoint constraint in the dynamic programming method, especially we allow the timing of the first phrase command to be earlier than the beginning point of the actual F-0 pattern. Secondly, the z-transform method is introduced to convert the equation of the F-0 model in order to simplify the calculation and save the computation time. An experiment with 100 sentences spoken by two males and two females selected from the speech database \"ATR 503 sentences\" has shown that the proposed method is effective as we expected.", "paper_title": "An automatic extraction method of F-0 generation model parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000234952100035"}
