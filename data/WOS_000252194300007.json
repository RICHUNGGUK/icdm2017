It is also shown that these principles are not violated if and only if the qubit states belong to the special ensemble obtained recently. We then extend the non-existence of the Hadamard operation to a multi- qubit system. In higher dimensions, the analog of the Hadamard gate is the quantum Fourier transform. We show that it is not possible to design this gate for an arbitrary qudit.", "paper_title": "On the non-existence of a universal Hadamard gate", "paper_id": "WOS:000252194300007"}
