It achieves a ratio of 10/7 and runs in O(n (1.5)) time, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph. The previously best approximation algorithm for this problem achieves a ratio of 2 and runs in O(n (2)) time.", "paper_title": "An Approximation Algorithm for the Minimum Co-Path Set Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000290267000012"}
