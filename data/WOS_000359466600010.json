After the improvement, the representation can attain an asymtotically optimal complexity found in our previous work. Although claimed as optimal by the authors, the average computation time of multi-scalar multiplication obtained by the representation is 563/1574n + o(n) approximate to 0.3577n + o(n). That number is larger than the optimal complexity 281/786n + o(n) approximate to 0.3575n + o(n) found in our previous work. To optimize the width-3 joint sparse form, we add more cases to the representation. After the addition, we can show that the complexity is updated to 281/786n + o(n) approximate to 0.3575n + o(n), which implies that the modified representation is asymptotically optimal. Compared to our optimal algorithm in the previous work, the modified width-3 joint sparse form uses less dynamic memory, but it consumes more static memory.", "paper_title": "Improving Width-3 Joint Sparse Form to Attain Asymptotically Optimal Complexity on Average Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600010"}
