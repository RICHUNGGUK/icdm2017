We propose a novel anycast based AODV routing protocol which is a simple and efficient routing protocol designed especially for MANET for P2P applications called AAPP (an Anycast based AODV routing protocol for Peer to Peer services in MANET). AAPP integrate DHT protocol operating in a logical namespace and MANET routing protocol operating in a physical namespace. The key idea of the integration is to bring the Chord protocol to the network layer of MANETs via a one-to-one mapping between the service keys of the mobile nodes providing services and their anycast groupIDs in the namespace. The object of our design is to construct a new type of anycast based AODV model for P2P services, especially for discovery service, information administration service, file sharing service, and communication security. It is assumed that the number of anycast groups is steady in a MANET, so we consider the instance that a node joins or leaves an anycast group. When a mobile node attains a service, such as a file and a particular data, it can share its resource to other nodes and becomes a mobile peer. Whenever a mobile node joins or leaves an anycast group, it originates a request packet and sends it to the network layer. The anycast groupID is updated correspondingly, and broadcasts the information about updating information. In this paper, we have designed an anycast based protocol for P2P application in mobile wireless ad hoc networks based on on-demand routing protocols AODV. We have tested the packets' delivery fraction, average end-to end delay of data packets, and normalized the routing protocol performance of anycast protocols by simulation with OPNET on different traffic models, node mobility models, and connection models. With our novel anycast protocol AAPP, the traffic load can be balanced thus, reducing the transmission delay and increase the route utilization which is better for P2P application. That all the members in one anycast group share one anycast address enables them to take the same priority in the routing searching process. Therefore, this approach can provide the transmission path with the shortest length. With scattering of the anycast server in the geographical area, the traffic load is obviously distributed in the network. All these properties can help to improve the performance of the network.", "paper_title": "AAPP: An Anycast Based AODV Routing Protocol for Peer to Peer Services in MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000265103800047"}
