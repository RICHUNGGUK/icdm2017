It is defined as the maximum over all Lipschitz functions f on V(G) of the variance of f(X) when X is uniformly distributed on V(G). We investigate the spread for certain models of sparse random graph, in particular for random regular graphs G(n,d), for Erdos-Renyi random graphs G(n,p) in the supercritical range p > 1/n, and for a `small world' model. For supercritical G(n,p), we show that if p = c/n with c > 1 fixed, then with high probability the spread of the giant component is bounded, and we prove corresponding statements for other models of random graphs, including a model with random edge lengths. We also give lower bounds on the spread for the barely supercritical case when p = (1 + o(1))/n. Further, we show that for d large, with high probability the spread of G(n, d) becomes arbitrarily close to that of the complete graph K-n.", "paper_title": "On the Spread of Random Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338350900001"}
