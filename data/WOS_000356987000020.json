To tackle the first problem, we propose a novel 3D Local Shape Context feature extracted from human body silhouette to characterise the local structure of body joints. To tackle the second problem, we incorporate a graphical model into regression forests to exploit structural constrains. Experiments demonstrate that our method can efficiently learn local body structures and localise joints. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method significantly improves the accuracy of pose estimation from depth images.
