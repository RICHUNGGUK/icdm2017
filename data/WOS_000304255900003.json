A method that builds a support vector machine classification model for such spectra relying on the known elemental composition of the Bacillus spores was developed. A wavelet transformation was incorporated in this method to allow for possible thresholding or standardization, then a linear model technique using the known elemental structure of the spores was incorporated for dimension reduction, and a support vector machine approach was employed for the final classification of the substance. The method was applied to real data produced from an LIBS device. Several methods used to test the predictive performance of the classification model revealed promising results. Published 2012.
