This algorithm, called Feasibility Pump, alternates between solving nonlinear programs and mixed integer linear programs. We also discuss how the algorithm can be iterated so as to improve the first solution it finds, as well as its integration within an outer approximation scheme. We report computational results.", "paper_title": "A Feasibility Pump for mixed integer nonlinear programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264103300006"}
