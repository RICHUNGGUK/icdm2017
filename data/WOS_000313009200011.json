In this paper, we express the fuzzy Laplace transform and then some of its well-known properties are investigated. In addition, an existence theorem is given for fuzzy-valued function which possess the fuzzy Laplace transform. Consequently, we investigate the solutions of FIVPs and the solutions in state-space description of fuzzy linear continuous-time systems under generalized H-differentiability as two new applications of fuzzy Laplace transforms. Finally, some examples are given to show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Applications of fuzzy Laplace transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000313009200011"}
