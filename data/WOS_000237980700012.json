The interactions among both activation (activated/inactive) labels and observed data of brain voxels are unified in a probabilistic framework based on the CRF, where the interaction strength can be adaptively adjusted in terms of the data similarity of neighboring sites. Compared to earlier detection methods, including statistical parametric mapping and Markov random field, the proposed method avoids the suppression of high frequency information and relaxes the strong assumption of conditional independence of observed data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively integrates contextual constraints within the detection process and robustly detects brain activities from fMRI data.", "paper_title": "Contextual Modeling of functional MR images with conditional random fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000237980700012"}
