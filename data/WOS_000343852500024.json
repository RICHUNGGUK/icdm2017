This study summarised and categorised the variables, parameterisations and applications of 83 models published since 1996. The choice of variables and processes used was found to be largely arbitrary. Models have been applied to a range of environments, however, there was no corresponding difference in approach or complexity. The major challenges and opportunities for the development of the models include: aligning conceptual models of organic matter transformations with measurable parameters; gathering accurate data for model input and validation, including datasets that capture a range of time-scales; coupling sediment models with ecological and spatially-resolved hydrodynamic models; and making the models more accessible for water quality and biogeochemical modelling studies by developing a consistent notation through community modelling initiatives.
