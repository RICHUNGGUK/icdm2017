It is made of peers that interact over an overlay network. Overlay networks are highly dynamic, as peers can join and leave at any time. Traditional process calculi, such as p-calculus, CCS and others, seem inadequate to capture these kinds of networks, their routing mechanisms, and to verify their properties. In order to model network architecture in a more explicit way, in [14,18,15] we have introduced the Network Conscious p-calculus (NCPi), an extension of the p-calculus with names representing network nodes and links. In [15] (a simpler version of) NCPi has been equipped with a coalgebraic operational models, along the lines of Fiore-Turi presheaf-based approach [6], and with an equivalent History Dependent Automaton [13], i.e., an (often) finite-state automaton suitable for verification. In this paper we first give a brief account of these results. Then, our contribution is the sketch of a NCPi representation of the p2p architecture Pastry. In particular, we give models of its overlay network and of a Distributed Hash Table built on top of it, and we give evidence of their correctness by proving convergence of routing mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Network-Conscious pi-calculus-A Model of Pastry", "paper_id": "WOS:000357615500002"}
