However, the application of synthetic aperture imaging radiometer (SAIR) is limited by its large number of antennas, receivers and correlators, which may increase noise and cause the image distortion. To solve those problems, this letter proposes a compressive regularization imaging algorithm, called CRIA, to reconstruct images accurately via combining the sparsity and the energy functional of target space. With randomly selected visibility samples, CRIA employs l(1) norm to reconstruct the target brightness temperature and l(2) norm to estimate the energy functional of it simultaneously. Comparisons with other algorithms show that CRIA provides higher quality target brightness temperature images at a lower data level.", "paper_title": "A Compressive Regularization Imaging Algorithm for Millimeter-Wave SAIR", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600021"}
