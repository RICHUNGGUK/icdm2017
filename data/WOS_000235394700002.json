This paper proposes an Attribute-Based Delegation Model (ABDM) with an extended delegation constraint consisting of both delegation attribute expression (DAE) and delegation prerequisite condition (CR). In ABDM, a delegatee must satisfy delegation constraint (especially DAE) when assigned to a delegation role. With delegation constraint, a delegator can restrict the delegatee candidates more strictly. ABDM relieves delegators and security administrators of security management work in delegation. In ABDM, a delegator is not allowed to temporarily delegate permissions to a person who does not satisfy the delegation constraint. To guarantee its flexibility and security, an extension of ABDM named ABDM(X) is proposed. In ABDM(X), a delegator can delegate some high level permissions to low level delegatee candidates temporarily, but not permanently.", "paper_title": "An attribute-based delegation model and its extension", "paper_id": "WOS:000235394700002"}
