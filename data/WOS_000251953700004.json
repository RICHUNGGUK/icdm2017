The CAD-based method presented in this work ensures that all prescribed rigid-body parameters used to synthesize the R-R dyad satisfy particular kinematic requirements of an R-R dyad. Through the application of this CAD method, five of the six general R-R dyad constraint equations are satisfied and therefore not essential for the synthesis of the R-R dyad. By reducing the number of dyad design constraints from six to one, the user can synthesize R-R links with adjustable moving pivots for multi-phase motion and path generation applications. The example included demonstrates the use of the CAD method in the synthesis of an RRSS path generator with adjustable moving pivots. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
