Preprint, 2006). Geometrically, these functions correspond with quasi-quadrics; objects introduced in De Clerck et al. (Australas J Combin 22:151-166, 2000). Hertel and Pott obtain a characterization of some binary quasi-quadrics in affine spaces by their intersection numbers with hyperplanes and spaces of codimension 2. We obtain a similar characterization for quadrics in projective spaces by intersection numbers with low-dimensional spaces. Ferri and Tallini (Rend Mat Appl 11(1): 15-21, 1991) characterized the non-singular quadric Q(4,q) by its intersection numbers with planes and solids. We prove a corollary of this theorem for Q(4,q) and then extend this corollary to all quadrics in PG(n,q),n >= 4. The only exceptions occur for q even, where we can have an oval or an ovoid as intersection with our point set in the non-singular part.", "paper_title": "A characterization of quadrics by intersection numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200014"}
