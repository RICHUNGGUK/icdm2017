For safety assessment, the overall collision probability is used to rank candidate trajectories by considering the probability of colliding with known objects as well as the estimated collision probability beyond the planning horizon. In addition, we introduce a safety assessment cost metric, the probabilistic collision cost, which considers the relative speeds and masses of multiple moving objects in which the robot may possibly collide with. The collision probabilities with other objects are estimated by probabilistic reasoning about their future motion trajectories as well as the ability of the robot to avoid them. The results are integrated into a navigation framework that generates and selects trajectories that strive to maximize safety while minimizing the time to reach a goal location. An example implementation of the proposed framework is applied to simulation scenarios, that explores some of the inherent computational trade-offs.", "paper_title": "Safety assessment of robot trajectories for navigation in uncertain and dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000302037300008"}
