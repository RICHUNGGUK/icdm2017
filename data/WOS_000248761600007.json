In this paper, a topological form for the synthesis of filters with high dynamic range is proposed. A biquad notch/all-pass filter is shown in conformity with the given topological form. It is shown that there is a trade-off between dynamic range and high input impedance property. The presented circuit is compared with other notch filters in the literature. It has less number of components, better high-frequency response and dynamic range compared to others. Since the circuit includes a minimum number of resistors, it can easily provide electronically tunable circuits through resistor/controlled current conveyor replacement. Simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results. Routh-Hurwitz stability analyses are also given.", "paper_title": "Enhanced dynamic range analog filter topologies with a notch/all-pass circuit example", "paper_id": "WOS:000248761600007"}
