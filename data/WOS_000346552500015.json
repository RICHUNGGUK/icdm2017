These systems require effective communication between the processor and memory blocks and therefore, interconnection networks are considered as the heart of the parallel processing and multi-processor systems. Multistage interconnection networks (MINs) are the main option for use in supercomputer environments that consist of thousands of processing elements. In this paper, a regular class of fault-tolerant MINs named Pars network along with its routing algorithm are presented. Analytical results demonstrate that the Pars network outperforms known regular networks, namely ABN, ASEN, EGN, and IEGN in terms of cost, fault-tolerance, terminal reliability, mean time to failure, and permutation capability.
