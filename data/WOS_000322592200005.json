Existing data flow approaches only model data with activities but not data with tools. In this paper, we present LeadFlow4LD, a learning design and workflow-based method to achieve such a computational representation of collaborative learning processes in an interoperable and standard way. The proposed method has been assessed through the specification and enactment of a variety of non-trivial collaborative learning situations. The experimental results indicate that the level of expressiveness of the proposal is adequate in order to represent the flow of tools invocations and data which was missing in other existing research approaches.", "paper_title": "LeadFlow4LD: A Method for the Computational Representation of the Learning Flow and Data Flow in Collaborative Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000322592200005"}
