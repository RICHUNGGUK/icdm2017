The increased relevance of the life cycle perspective in modern society calls for more sustainable approaches to design, engineer and construct everyday products and related services. To respond to such a need, designers and engineers may have access to new methods and tools that are able to integrate the life cycle perspective in a proper way. In such a context, simulation - in its wider meaning - could play a relevant role for engineering the life cycle of a product and analyzing the related service networks. Within this context, the paper conducts a state of the art review of existing solutions implementing LCS, in order to identify common characteristics and prioritize next steps to be done for a comprehensive implementation. To this end a reference architecture is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
