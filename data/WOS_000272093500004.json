The subword graphs of these words (especially their compacted versions) have a very special regular structure. In this paper we investigate this structure in more detail than in previous papers and show how several syntactical properties of Sturmian words follow from their graph properties. Consequently simple alternative graph-based proofs of several known facts are presented. The very special structure of subword graphs leads also to special easy algorithms computing some parameters of Sturmian words: the number of subwords, the critical factorization point, lexicographically maximal suffixes, occurrences of subwords of a fixed length, and right special factors. These algorithms work in linear time with respect to n, the size of the compressed representation of the standard word, though the words themselves can be of exponential size with respect to n. Some of the computed parameters can be also of exponential size, however we provide their linear size compressed representations. We introduce also a new concept related to standard words: Ostrowski automata.", "paper_title": "USEFULNESS OF DIRECTED ACYCLIC SUBWORD GRAPHS IN PROBLEMS RELATED TO STANDARD STURMIAN WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272093500004"}
