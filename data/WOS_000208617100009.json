Surveying craters requires counting a large amount of small subkilometer craters, which calls for highly efficient automatic crater detection. In this article, we present an integrated framework on autodetection of subkilometer craters with boosting and transfer learning. The framework contains three key components. First, we utilize mathematical morphology to efficiently identify crater candidates, the regions of an image that can potentially contain craters. Only those regions occupying relatively small portions of the original image are the subjects of further processing. Second, we extract and select image texture features, in combination with supervised boosting ensemble learning algorithms, to accurately classify crater candidates into craters and noncraters. Third, we integrate transfer learning into boosting, to enhance detection performance in the regions where surface morphology differs from what is characterized by the training set. Our framework is evaluated on a large test image of 37, 500 x 56, 250 m(2) on Mars, which exhibits a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by nonuniform surface morphology. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed crater detection framework can achieve an F1 score above 0.85, a significant improvement over the other crater detection algorithms.", "paper_title": "Subkilometer Crater Discovery with Boosting and Transfer Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000208617100009"}
