The configuration of the device was ITO/PVK:TPD/BAlq:TBPe:rubrene/Alq(3)/Mg:Ag. By adjusting the proportion of the dopants (TBPe and rubrene) in the light-emitting layer, white light with Commission Internationale de FEclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34,0.39) was obtained at an applied voltage of 8 V; the change of emission spectra was minimal when the voltage increased from 5 to 20 V. The device exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 0.68% and a brightness of 1020 cd/m(2) at 8 V, the brightness increasing to 5723 cd/m(2) at 17 V. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
