While standard learning techniques present the learner with individual samples, MIL alternatively presents the learner with sets of samples. Although sets are the primary elements used for analysis in MIL research in this area has focused on using standard analysis techniques. In the following, a random set framework for multiple instance learning (RSF-MIL) is proposed that can directly perform analysis on sets. The proposed method uses random sets and fuzzy measures to model the MIL problem, thus providing a more natural mathematical framework, a more general MIL solution, and a more versatile learning tool. Comparative experimental results using RSF-MIL are presented for benchmark data sets. RSF-MIL is further compared to the state-of-the-art in landmine detection using ground penetrating radar data.
