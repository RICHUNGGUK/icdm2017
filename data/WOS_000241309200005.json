Following this design concept in this paper three appropriate methods are presented for the determination of the optimal layout of material of clasto-plastic structures (beams, frames, trusses and plates) subjected to extreme loading. The investigation is extended also to the case when in the optimal design in addition to one of the extreme loads the normal (working) loads can be separately or simultaneously taken into consideration.
