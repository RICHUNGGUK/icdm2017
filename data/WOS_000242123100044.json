The model is introduced and explained, and navigation experiments are reported that verify the implemented visual-motor system. Experiments demonstrate that the system can be trained to solve navigation problems consisting in moving around a 3D object to reach a specific location based on the visual information only. The model is flexible, as it is composed of an adjustable number of modules. It is also interpretable, i.e. it is possible to estimate the influence of visual features on the motor action.", "paper_title": "Biologically-inspired visual-motor coordination model in a navigation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100044"}
