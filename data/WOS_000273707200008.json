However, implementing SMT for VLIWs requires complex structures, which is contrary to the VLIW philosophy of hardware simplicity. In this paper, we propose Cluster-level Simultaneous MultiThreading (CSMT) to allow some degree of SMT in clustered VLIW processors with low hardware cost and complexity. CSMT considers the set of operations that execute simultaneously in a given cluster as the assignment unit. To minimize cluster conflicts between threads, a very simple hardware-based cluster renaming mechanism is proposed. The hardware required to implement CSMT is cheap, realistic, and practical for a clustered VLIW processor. An analysis of the hardware required to implement CSMT shows that it is quite scalable, with up to eight threads easily supported at low hardware cost. The experimental results show that CSMT significantly improves performance when compared with other multithreading approaches suited for VLIW. For instance, with four threads, CSMT shows an average speedup of 110 percent over a single-thread VLIW architecture and 40 percent over Interleaved MultiThreading (IMT). In some cases, speedup can be as high as 225 percent over single-thread architecture and 84 percent over IMT.", "paper_title": "CSMT: Simultaneous Multithreading for Clustered VLIW Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000273707200008"}
