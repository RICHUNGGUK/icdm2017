The overall framework is the augmented forcing point method (AFM) (L. Yao and A.L. Fogelson, Simulations of chemical transport and reaction in a suspension of cells I: An augmented forcing point method for the stationary case, IJNMF (2012) 69, 1736-52.) for solving fluid-phase transport in a region outside of a collection of cells suspended in the fluid. We introduce a novel radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD) method to solve reaction-diffusion equations on the surface of each of a collection of 2D stationary platelets suspended in blood. Parametric RBFs are used to represent the geometry of the platelets and give accurate geometric information needed for the RBF-FD method. Symmetric Hermite-RBF interpolants are used for enforcing the boundary conditions on the fluid-phase chemical concentration, and their use removes a significant limitation of the original AFM. The efficacy of the new methods is shown through a series of numerical experiments; in particular, second-order convergence for the coupled problem is demonstrated.
