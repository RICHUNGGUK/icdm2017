These filters have very reduced insertion losses within their operating frequency band and their construction is considerably economic. On the other hand, metallic filters have significant drawbacks, especially when they are designed for satellite and other spatial applications, since their weight and size may very often be too high and due to the lack of atmosphere, the Multipactor effect limits considerably the power that the filters can handle. This problems can be reduced by using new topologies of H-plane waveguide filters loaded with dielectric resonators. Nevertheless the analysis and design of these filters is far more complex than the one of all metallic filters, due to their special topology. Efficient mathematical tools are required for this analysis and this paper presents a new hybrid mode matching method for the efficient analysis of rods in waveguided structures.
