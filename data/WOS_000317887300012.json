The former is the Bidirectional Link Quality Estimation, which allows nodes to easily and quickly compute the quality of a link between a pair of nodes. The latter, Hierarchical Range Sectoring, organizes sensors in different sectors based on their location within the network. Based on this organization, nodes from each sector are coordinated to transmit in specific periods of time to reduce the hidden terminal problem. To evaluate these two mechanisms, a protocol called HBCP (Hierarchical-Based Collection Protocol), that implements both mechanisms, has been implemented in TinyOS 2.1, and evaluated in a testbed using TelosB motes. The results show that the HBCP protocol is able to achieve a very high reliability, especially in large networks and in scenarios with bottlenecks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
