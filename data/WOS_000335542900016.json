Since the condition of product market changes frequently, the tasks of order management, product planning, and inventory management are complex and difficult. It is imperative for companies to develop new ways to manage the randomness and uncertainty in market demands. Based on the graphical evaluation and review technique, this paper provides a simple but integrated stochastic network mathematical model for supply chain ordering time distribution analysis. Then the ordering time analysis model is extended so that the analysis of inventory level distribution characteristics of supply chain members is allowed. Further, to investigate the effects of different end-customer demands on upstream orders and relative inventory levels, model-based sensitivity analysis algorithms for ordering fluctuations and inventory fluctuations are developed. A detailed numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed models to a multi-stage supply chain system, and the results of which shows the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed stochastic network models and algorithms in order and inventory management.
