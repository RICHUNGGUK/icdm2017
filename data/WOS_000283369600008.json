In parallel, for dimensioning and, above all, for control system design purposes, the need of models of reduced complexity has emerged; together with the need of tools capable of extracting, from the overall dynamic model, reduced models representing the dominant behaviour. This article reviews recent results in non-linear model order reduction method (NORM), originally developed with reference to computer-aided analysis and design of electronic circuits, and puts them in a control system design-oriented perspective, pointing out interesting future research directions.", "paper_title": "Model order reduction for object-oriented models: a control systems perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000283369600008"}
