We combined workflow model, workflow management system, job distribution, parameter scheduling, and service inteface in the middleware architecture. The workflow model consists of three layers. The agent-based middleware architecture consists of five agents and three types of communication protocols. Users can design a lightweight, flexible and effective middleware, which can be used to construct a workflow-based Grid portal.", "paper_title": "Agent-based middleware architecture for workflow in Grid portals", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300131"}
