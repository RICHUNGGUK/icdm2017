The key challenge in supporting personalization is the need for rich metadata, such as metadata about structural relationships, subject/concept relations between documents and cognitive metadata about documents (e. g. difficulty of a document). Manual annotation of large knowledge bases with such rich metadata is not scalable. As well as, automatic mining of cognitive metadata is challenging since it is very difficult to understand underlying intellectual knowledge about document automatically. On the other hand, the Web content is increasing becoming multilingual since growing amount of data generated on the Web is non-English. Current metadata extraction systems are generally based on English content and this requires to be revolutionized in order to adapt to the changing dynamics of the Web. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel automatic metadata extraction framework, which is based on a novel fuzzy based method for automatic cognitive metadata generation and uses different document parsing algorithms to extract rich metadata from multilingual enterprise content using the newly developed DocBook, Resource Type and Topic ontologies. Since the metadata generation process is based upon DocBook structured enterprise content, our framework is focused on enterprise documents and content which is loosely based on the DocBook type of formatting. DocBook is a common documentation formatting to formally produce corporate data and it is adopted by many enterprises. The proposed framework is illustrated and evaluated on English, German and French versions of the Symantec Norton 360 knowledge bases. The user study showed that the proposed fuzzy-based method generates reasonably accurate values with an average precision of 89.39% on the metadata values of document difficulty, document interactivity level and document interactivity type. The proposed fuzzy inference system achieves improved results compared to a rule-based reasoner for difficulty metadata extraction (similar to 11% enhancement). In addition, user perceived metadata quality scores (mean of 5.57 out of 6) found to be high and automated metadata analysis showed that the extracted metadata is high quality and can be suitable for personalized information retrieval.
