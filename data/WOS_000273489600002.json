In general, two paradigms have been taken for gene network intervention: (1) stationary external control is based on optimally altering the status of a control gene (or genes) over time to drive network dynamics; and (2) structural intervention involves an optimal one-time change of the network structure (wiring) to beneficially alter the long-run behaviour of the network. These intervention approaches have mainly been developed within the context of the probabilistic Boolean network model for gene regulation. This article reviews both types of intervention and applies them to reducing the metastatic competence of cells via intervention in a melanoma-related network.", "paper_title": "Stationary and structural control in gene regulatory networks: basic concepts", "paper_id": "WOS:000273489600002"}
