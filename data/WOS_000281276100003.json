In particular, the paper seeks to explore the potential to address user goals with indexing based on podcast metadata and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Design/methodology/approach - The paper conducted a user study to obtain an overview of podcast search behaviour and goals, using a multi-method approach of an online survey, a diary study, and contextual interviews. In a subsequent podcast retrieval experiment, the paper investigated the retrieval performance of the two choices of indexing features for search goals identified during the study. Findings - The paper found that study participants used a variety of search strategies, partially influenced by available tools and their perceptions of these tools. Furthermore the experimental results revealed that retrieval using ASR transcripts performed significantly better than metadata-based searching. However, a detailed result analysis suggested that the efficacy of the indexing methods was search-goal dependent. Research limitations/implications - The research constitutes a step towards a future framework for investigating user needs and addressing them in an experimental set-up. It was primarily qualitative and exploratory in nature. Practical implications - Podcast search engines require evidence about suitable indexing methods in order to make an informed decision concerning whether it is worth the resources to generate speech recognition transcripts. Originality/value - Systematic studies of podcast searching have not previously been reported. Investigations of this kind hold the potential to optimise podcast retrieval in the long term.", "paper_title": "Podcast search: user goals and retrieval technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000281276100003"}
