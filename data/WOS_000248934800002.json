An important feature of a virtual environment is its support for collaborative decision-making. A major difficulty with current approaches is that they cannot easily handle environments where decision makers are added or removed dynamically. In this article, a new approach to alter the number of decision makers dynamically is suggested. The amount of decision accuracy made by each decision maker, for a given subject, is determined subjectively considering the other decision makers' opinions. The effect of decisions made by each decision maker varies gradually considering its past decisions. Assuming each decision maker provides a fuzzy answer set in response to each decision problem, an operator for fusing of the decision makers' decision sets is suggested. The aim of the fusion is improvement of the decision quality. The fusing operator provides a fuzzy answer set that is a function of the accuracy possibility of each decision maker and its fuzzy answer set. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
