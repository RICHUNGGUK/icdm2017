This analysis can be a good base for strategy formulation, but it is not non-defect. It includes no means of analytically determining the importance of factors or assessing the fit between SWOTS factors and decision alternatives and is mainly based on the qualitative analysis. Many researchers develop different techniques to quantify the SWOT analysis, but these methods are not comprehensive. In this study, we develop a fuzzy method model for quantitative weighing of SWOT strategies. The decision maker's imprecise information is regarded by fuzzy numbers in this model. To consider dependency among factors and sub-factors, we use ANP technique in our research. We demonstrate our model with a case study example and compare results of our research with prior research.
