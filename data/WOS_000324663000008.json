Since the complexity of SDDLBP increases with the number of parts of the product, an efficient methodology based on artificial bee colony (ABC) is proposed to solve the SDDLBP. ABC is an optimization technique which is inspired by the behavior of honey bees. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested against six other algorithms. The results show that the proposed ABC algorithm performs well and is superior to the other six algorithms in terms of the objective values performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
