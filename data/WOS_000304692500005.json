More specifically, we deal with the problem of dynamic, intraquery load balancing in parallel database queries across heterogeneous nodes in a way that takes into account the inherent cost of adaptations and thus avoids both overreacting and deciding when to adapt in a completely heuristic manner. The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations. Our approach, apart from benefitting from and being characterized by a solid theoretical foundation, exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art heuristics in realistic situations, as verified by thorough evaluation.", "paper_title": "Efficient Load Balancing in Partitioned Queries Under Random Perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000304692500005"}
