The purpose of this study is to introduce novel features extracted from the kinetics of contrast agent uptake imaged by a short (100 s) view-sharing MRI protocol, and to investigate how these features measure up to commonly used features for regular DCE-MRI of the breast. Performance is measured with a computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system aimed at distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. A bi-temporal breast MRI protocol was used. This protocol produces five regular, high spatial-resolution T1-weighted acquisitions interleaved with a series of 20 ultrafast view-sharing acquisitions during contrast agent uptake. We measure and compare the performances of morphological and kinetic features derived from both the regular DCE-MRI sequence and the ultrafast view-sharing sequence with four different classifiers. The classification performance of kinetics derived from the short (100 s) ultrafast acquisition starting with contrast agent administration, is significantly higher than the performance of kinetics derived from a much lengthier (510 s), commonly used 3-D gradient echo acquisition. When combined with morphology information all classifiers show a higher performance for the ultrafast acquisition (two out of four results are significantly better).", "paper_title": "Automated Characterization of Breast Lesions Imaged With an Ultrafast DCE-MR Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000331298000002"}
