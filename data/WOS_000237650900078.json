AS-OFDMA might be an efficient system which is more robust against multi-path fading channel. Therefore, the performance of the proposed system is better than the conventional MC-CDMA. Moreover, AS-OFDMA solves the problem of inter code interference. In this paper, we introduce the proposed system and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system by the computer simulation. We also show the performance comparison between the proposed system and the conventional MC-CDMA technique.", "paper_title": "Clustered OFDMA in the multi-path fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900078"}
