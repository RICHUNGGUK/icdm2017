However, there are situations where several fingerprints overlap on top of each other. Such situations are frequently encountered when latent (partial) fingerprints are lifted from crime scenes or residue fingerprints are left on fingerprint sensors. Overlapped fingerprints constitute a serious challenge to existing fingerprint recognition algorithms, since these algorithms are designed under the assumption that fingerprints have been properly segmented. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to separate overlapped fingerprints into component or individual fingerprints. The basic idea is to first estimate the orientation field of the given image with overlapped fingerprints and then separate it into component orientation fields using a relaxation labeling technique. We also propose an algorithm to utilize fingerprint singularity information to further improve the separation performance. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm leads to good separation of overlapped fingerprints that leads to a significant improvement in the matching accuracy.", "paper_title": "Separating Overlapped Fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000290737100009"}
