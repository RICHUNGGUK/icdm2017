Proper Lyapunov functionals and some analytic techniques are employed to derive the sufficient conditions under which the networks proposed are uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded. The results are shown to improve the results derived in [1] (Arik, 2004). Some examples are given to illustrate the correctness of our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
