We establish connections between this number of changes and various notions of computability theoretic lowness, as well as the fundamental thesis that, among random sets, randomness is antithetical to computational power. We introduce a new randomness notion, called balanced randomness, which implies that for each computable approximation and each constant c, there are infinitely many n such that Z(s)(sic)(n) changes more than c2(n) times. We establish various connections with omega-c.e. tracing and omega-c.e. jump domination, a new lowness property. We also examine some relationships to randomness theoretic notions of highness, and give applications to the study of (weak) Demuth cuppability.", "paper_title": "Counting the changes of random Delta(0)(2) sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000359658400005"}
