The proposed distance can be decomposed into factors that help to distinguish between influence on the estimation of fixed effects and on the prediction of random effects. Joint and conditional influence are also considered. A first-order approximation is proposed for more efficient computation and a Monte Carlo simulation is considered to evaluate the efficacy of the proposal. An application to a dataset obtained from the literature is presented to show how such tools can be used in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
