The utility function is viewed as an overall objective of the system and can perform the optimal trade-off between the mean and the variance of performance index. The nonlinear utility function is first converted into an auxiliary parameters optimisation problem about the expectation and the variance. Then an optimal closed-loop feedback controller for the nonseparable mean-variance minimisation problem is designed by nonlinear mathematical programming. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the algorithm's effectiveness obtained in this article.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of LQG problem with an explicit trade-off between mean and variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000295464400004"}
