This binding process requires high signaling load. Thus, Hierarchical Mobile 1Pv6 (HMIPv6) has been proposed to accommodate frequent mobility of the MN and reduce the signaling load in the Internet. A Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) is a router located in a network visited by the MN. The MN uses the MAP as a local HA. The absence of any protections between MN and MAP may lead to malicious MNs impersonating other legitimate ones, impersonating a MAP. In this paper, we propose a mechanism of authenticating MAP and MN in HMIPv6. The performance analysis and the numerical results presented in this paper show that our proposal has almost same as the performance of the HMIPv6 without security in spite of security process load.", "paper_title": "Mechanism of authenticating a MAP in hierarchical MIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300057"}
