Compared with previous work, both quantization and time delay issues are considered. The controller used in this paper is in the form of proportional-derivative, and the output signals of master and slave systems are quantized before being transmitted. The stability criteria are presented to show that the controller can stabilize the master-slave system under quantization and variable time delay. Additionally, we propose a new quantized measurement, which can decrease the quantization error. Finally, simulations and detailed analysis are given to show the effectiveness of the main results.
