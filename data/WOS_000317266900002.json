The original Karp and Miller algorithm (K&M) unfolds the reachability graph of a Petri net and uses acceleration on branches to ensure termination. The MP algorithm improves the K&M algorithm by adding pruning between branches of the K&M tree. This idea was first introduced in the Minimal Coverability Tree algorithm (MCT), however it was recently shown to be incomplete. The MP algorithm can be viewed as the MCT algorithm with a slightly more aggressive pruning strategy which ensures completeness. Experimental results show that this algorithm is a strong improvement over the K&M algorithm as it dramatically reduces the exploration tree.", "paper_title": "Minimal Coverability Set for Petri Nets: Karp and Miller Algorithm with Pruning", "paper_id": "WOS:000317266900002"}
