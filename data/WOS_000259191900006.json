We propose a novel 2.5-D approach to real-time multiobject tracking in crowds, which is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem and is approximate through an assignment step and a location step. Observing that the occluding object is usually less affected by the occluded objects, sequential solutions for the assignment and the location are derived. A novel dominant color histogram (DCH) is proposed as an efficient object model. The DCH can be regarded as a generalized color histogram, where dominant colors are selected based on a given distance measure. Comparing with conventional color histograms, the DCH only requires a few color components (31 on average). Furthermore, our theoretical analysis and evaluation on real data have shown that DCHs are robust to illumination changes. Using the DCH, efficient implementations of sequential solutions for the assignment and location steps are proposed. The assignment step includes the estimation of the depth order for the objects in a dispersing group, one-by-one assignment, and feature exclusion from the group representation. The location step includes the depth-order estimation for the objects in a new group, the two-phase mean-shift location, and the exclusion of tracked objects from the new position in the group. Multiobject tracking results and evaluation from public data sets are presented. Experiments on image sequences captured from crowded public environments have shown good tracking results, where about 90% of the objects have been successfully tracked with the correct identification numbers by the proposed method. Our results and evaluation have indicated that the method is efficient and robust for tracking multiple objects (>= 3) in complex occlusion for real-world surveillance scenarios.", "paper_title": "An efficient sequential approach to tracking multiple objects through crowds for real-time intelligent CCTV systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191900006"}
