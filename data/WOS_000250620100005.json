In a 170million-transistor custom asic chip, these nocs provide system performance within 28 percent of ideal noncontended networks at a cost of 20 percent of the die area. Our experience shows that nocs are area-and complexity-efficient means of providing high-bandwidth, low-latency on-chip communication.", "paper_title": "On-chip interconnection networks of the trips chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000250620100005"}
