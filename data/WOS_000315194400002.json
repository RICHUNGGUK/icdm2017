In this paper, different feature extraction techniques have been utilized to represent medical X-ray images. They are categorized into two groups; (i) low-level image representation such as Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Canny Edge Operator, Local Binary Pattern(LBP), pixel value, and (ii) local patch-based image representation such as Bag of Words (BoW). These features have been exploited in different algorithms for automatic classification of medical X-ray images. We then analyzed the classification performance obtained with regard to the image representation techniques used. These experiments were evaluated on ImageCLEF 2007 database consists of 11000 medical X-ray images with 116 classes. Experimental results showed the classification performance obtained by exploiting LBP and BoW outperformed the other algorithms with respect to the image representation techniques used.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000315194400002"}
