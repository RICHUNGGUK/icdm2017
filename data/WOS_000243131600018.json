A set of principles have been derived from a sound theoretical base and applied to the development of worklets, an extensible repertoire of self-contained sub-processes aligned to each task, from which a dynamic runtime selection is made depending on the context of the particular work instance.", "paper_title": "Worklets: A service-oriented implementation of dynamic flexibility in workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600018"}
