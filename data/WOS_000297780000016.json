Previously, it evaluates several Redundancy Resolution Schemes at the joint-rate level for the configuration of the postprocessor, dealing not only with the additional joints but also with the redundancy due to the symmetry on the milling tool. The use of these redundancies is optimized by adjusting two performance criterion vectors related to both singularity avoidance and maintenance of a preferred reference posture, as secondary tasks to be done during the path tracking. In addition, two proper fuzzy inference engines actively adjust the weight of each joint in these tasks. The postprocessor is validated in a real prototyping of a Valencian Falla.
