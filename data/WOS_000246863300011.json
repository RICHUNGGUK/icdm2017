The proposed technique is based on using the idea of integrated congruence transform to construct a reduced-order system for the interconnect. The reduced-order system offers simple time-domain ordinary differential equations that can be embedded into conventional circuit simulators. The proposed algorithm provides a new approach to perform implicit moment matching on a system described by a mixed set of linear differential algebraic equations. This feature offers a high accuracy in the reduced system over a wide frequency range. The passivity of the reduced-order system is guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Analysis of frequency-dependent interconnects using integrated congruence transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000246863300011"}
