The algorithms under investigation are the shortest remaining processing time rule, the exponential rule, the modified largest weighted delay first rule, the maximum rate rule, and the proportionally fair rule. Decodability issues are taken care of by means of the frame-decodability aware technique and the burst transfer eligibility decision mechanism. The impacts of a number of factors including deadline and interference-plus-noise level are also examined. The investigations are carried out through extensive ns-2 simulations. Based on the numerical results, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm for MPEG streams that outperforms the above algorithms in terms of system throughput. The findings are useful for system designers.", "paper_title": "Performance of Channel-Aware Scheduling Algorithms for HDR-WPAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000272951300010"}
