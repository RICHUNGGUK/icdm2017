Specifically, the problem is, given a set P of n points in R(d), to preprocess them into a data structure that returns, for a query halfspace h, a number t so that (1- epsilon)vertical bar h boolean AND P vertical bar <= t <= (1+ epsilon)vertical bar h boolean AND P vertical bar. One of our data structures requires linear storage and O(n(1+delta)) preprocessing time, for any delta > 0, and answers a query in time O(epsilon(-gamma)n(1-1)/(left perpendicular d/2 right perpendicular) 2(b) (log)* (n)) for any gamma > 2/left perpendicular d/2 right perpendicular; the choice of gamma and delta affects b and the implied constants. Several variants and extensions are also discussed. As presented, the construction of the structure is mostly deterministic, except for one critical randomized step, and so are the query, storage, and preprocessing costs. The quality of approximation, for every query, is guaranteed with high probability. The construction can also be fully derandomized, at the expense of increasing preprocessing time.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATE HALFSPACE RANGE COUNTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900002"}
