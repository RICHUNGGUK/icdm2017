In particular, several inclusion relations, Hadamard products, coefficient estimates, distortion theorems and covering theorems are proven here for each of these function classes. Furthermore, some interesting distortion theorems for the Srivastava-Saigo-Owa fractional integral operator are obtained. Some of the results, presented in this paper, generalize and extend the corresponding results of earlier authors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
