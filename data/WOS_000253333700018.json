To evaluate model outputs, we used a modeling applications system integrative framework (MASIF) to simulate corn yields in the UGLR. We divided the region into two ecological zones (upper UGLR-1 and lower UGLR-2) and compared MAIZE and USDA\\National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) yield estimates in each zone. There was greater agreement between MAIZE and NASS yields at lower yield values. As NASS yields increased, MAIZE yields also increased, but to a greater extent than did NASS yields. We conducted a mean spatial analysis of maize yield from 1992 to 1996. We also conducted a spatial analysis of 1994, 1995 and 1996. There are both spatial and temporal differences when yields are mapped.
