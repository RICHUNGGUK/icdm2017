Data from online postings, reflections and interviews were analysed using the Miles and Huberman (1994) approach to inductive analysis. Findings showed that the students found the VLC useful for their collaboration and the exchanges on the platform positively impacted them in the cognitive, intellectual and interpersonal aspects. Recommendations for future practice and research are made. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
