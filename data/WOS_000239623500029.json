In this paper, it is showed that the collection of all the rough sets in an approximation space can be made into a distributive Brouwer-Zadeh lattice. The induced Brouwer-Zadeh lattice from an approximation space is called the rough Brouwer-Zadeh lattice. The rough top equation and rough bottom equation problem is studied in the framework of rough Brouwer-Zadeh lattices.", "paper_title": "Rough sets and Brouwer-Zadeh lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500029"}
