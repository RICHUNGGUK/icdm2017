In this problem, a set of intervals on the real line is presented to the algorithm, one at a time, and upon receiving each interval I the algorithm must assign I a color different from the colors of all previously presented intervals not intersecting I. The objective is to use as few colors as possible. It is known that the competitive ratio of the simple FIRST-FIT algorithm on the class of co-interval graphs is at most 2. We show that for the class of unit co-interval graphs, where all intervals have equal length, the 2-bound on the competitive ratio of FIRST-FIT is tight. On the other hand, we show that no deterministic online algorithm for coloring unit co-interval graphs can be better titan 3/2-competitive. We then study the effect of randomization on our problem and show a lower bound of 4/3 on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm for the unit co-interval coloring problem. We also prove that for the class of general co-interval graphs, no randomized algorithm has a competitive ratio better than 3/2.", "paper_title": "Online Coloring Co-Interval Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000269583600001"}
