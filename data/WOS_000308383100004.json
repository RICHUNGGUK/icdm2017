In this paper, motivated by the behavior and the spatial characteristics of the social and cognitive experience of each particle in the swarm, we develop a hybrid framework that combines the Particle Swarm Optimization and the Differential Evolution algorithm. Particle Swarm Optimization has the tendency to distribute the best personal positions of the swarm particles near to the vicinity of problem's optima. In an attempt to efficiently guide the evolution and enhance the convergence, we evolve the personal experience or memory of the particles with the Differential Evolution algorithm, without destroying the search capabilities of the algorithm. The proposed framework can be applied to any Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with minimal effort. To evaluate the performance and highlight the different aspects of the proposed framework, we initially incorporate six classic Differential Evolution mutation strategies in the canonical Particle Swarm Optimization, while afterwards we employ five state-of-the-art Particle Swarm Optimization variants and four popular Differential Evolution algorithms. Extensive experimental results on 25 high dimensional multimodal benchmark functions along with the corresponding statistical analysis, suggest that the hybrid variants are very promising and significantly improve the original algorithms in the majority of the studied cases.
