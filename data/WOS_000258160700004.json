Up to now, extensive research has been done on unicast traffic protection. Recently, due to the rapid growth of multicast applications, such as video-conferencing, high definition television (HDTV), distance learning, and multi-player on-line gaming, the problem of multicast traffic protection has started to draw more research interests. The preconfigured protection cycle (p-cycle) method proposed by Grover offers fast speed in restoration (because p-cycles are pre-cross-connected) and high efficiency in resource utilization (because p-cycles protect both on-cycle and straddling links). So far p-cycles based protection approaches have been intensively studied for unicast traffic protection, but have been rarely investigated for multicast traffic. We propose to apply p-cycles to dynamic protection provisioning of multicast traffic, and evaluate the blocking performance in comparison to other existing multicast protection schemes. We consider three different p-cycle based multicasting protection methods, namely dynamic p-cycle (DpC) design, p-cycle based protected working capacity envelope (PWCE) design, and hybrid DpC and PWCE design. We show that p-cycle-based multicast protection approaches offer much better blocking performance, as compared with other existing multicast protection schemes. The main reasons for the much better blocking performance are attributed to the facts that (i) the selection of p-cycles is independent of the routing of the multicast light trees, (ii) there are no path/segment disjoint constraints between the selected p-cycles and the multicast light trees to be protected, (iii) the selected p-cycles are the most efficient p-cycles.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of p-cycle based protection methods for provisioning of dynamic multicast sessions in mesh WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258160700004"}
