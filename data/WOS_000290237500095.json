However, such conditions are rare in actual production environments. Additionally, most studies of this problem have only considered suppliers offering the wholesaler a grace period. In practice, wholesalers often extend a fixed credit period to downstream customers as well. This study therefore proposes a production model for a lot-size inventory system with finite production rate and defective quality under the condition of two-level trade credit policy and the condition that defective items involve both imperfect quality and scrap items. Thus, optimal wholesaler replenishment decisions can be determined for defective items under two-level trade credit policy in the EPQ framework. Four theorems for determining the optimal cycle time and the results in this study can be deduced as a special case of earlier models. Finally, illustrative examples are provided to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
