In this paper, on the basis of record values and inter-record times from the two-parameter Pareto distribution, maximum-likelihood and Bayes estimators as well as credible regions are developed for the two parameters of the Pareto distribution. For illustrative purposes, a data set on annual wages of a sample of production-line workers in a large industrial firm is analysed using the proposed procedures.", "paper_title": "Bayesian analysis for the two-parameter Pareto distribution based on record values and times", "paper_id": "WOS:000299726700003"}
