This system enabled NIR spectra of raw milk to be obtained in an automatic milking system (milking robot system) over a wavelength range of 600-1050 nm. Calibration models for determining three major milk constituents (fat, protein and lactose), somatic cell count (SCC) and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) of unhomogenized milk were developed, and the precision and accuracy of the models were validated. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) and standard error of prediction (SEP) of the validation set for fat were 0.95 and 0.25%, respectively. The values Of r(2) and SEP for lactose were 0.83 and 0.26%, those for protein were 0.72 and 0.15%, those for SCC were 0.68 and 0.28 logSCC/mL, and those for MUN were 0.53 and 1.50mg/dL, respectively. These results indicate that the NIR spectroscopic system can be used to assess milk quality in real-time in an automatic milking system. The system can provide dairy farmers with information on milk quality and physiological condition of an individual cow and, therefore, give them feedback control for optimizing daily farm management. By using the system, dairy farmers will be able to produce high-quality milk and precision dairy farming will be realized. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
