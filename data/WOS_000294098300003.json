Two configurations are considered: one where the hot effluent stream from the fuel cell is used directly to provide heat to the endothermic reforming reaction, and another where the hot effluent streams are mixed and combusted in a catalytic burner before the energy integration. A comparative evaluation of the two configurations is presented in terms of their design, open-loop dynamics and their operation under linear multi-loop controllers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
