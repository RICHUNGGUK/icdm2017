Unfortunately state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches are computationally demanding. Effectively exploiting the computational power of modern multiprocessor systems can thus have a positive impact to Monte Carlo-based simulation of admixture modeling. A novel parallel approach is briefly described and promising results on its message passing interface (MPI)-based C++ implementation are reported.", "paper_title": "A novel parallel approach to the likelihood-based estimation of admixture in population genetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000266109500021"}
