This seemingly heterogeneous list is unified by the concept of geometrical transformation that leads to equivalent materials. The practical set-up is conveniently effected via the finite element method. Design/methodology/approach - The change of coordinates is completely encapsulated in the material properties. Findings - The most significant examples are the simple 2D treatment of helicoidal geometries and the design of arbitrarily shaped invisibility cloaks. Originality/value - The paper provides a unifying point of view, bridging several techniques in electromagnetism.", "paper_title": "Geometrical transformations and equivalent materials in computational electromagnetism", "paper_id": "WOS:000258420500012"}
