The digitized models with a random process using the turning bands method are simulated for the carbon-fiber powder. The digitized models of the carbon-fiber powder having 12,500-5,832,000 cubical particles with cell sizes in the range of 7-100 mu m. It is found that the numerical result of SECS obtained by using the diameter of a cylindrical carbon-fiber particle as the cubical cell size for simulations makes good agreement with the measurement data. It is also found that the SECS is directly proportional to the particle number at 35 GHz. It is also found that the maximum extinction occurs at a resonant particle size. Using curve fitting technique together with Newton's Iteration method, the resonant particle size may be expressed by delta(0) = 3408 x n(p)(-0.344) mu m, where n(p) is the number of particles.
