A fundamental problem concerning these classes is the Permanent and Determinant Problem: Given a field F of characteristic not equal 2, and an integer n, what is the minimum m such ;that the permanent of an n x n matrix X = (x(ij)) can be expressed as a determinant of an m x m matrix, where the entries of the determinant matrix are a. ne linear functions of x(ij)'s, and the equality is in F[X]. Mignon and Ressayre (2004) proved a quadratic lower bound m = Omega(n(2)) for fields of characteristic 0. We extend the Mignon-Ressayre quadratic lower bound to all fields of characteristic not equal 2.", "paper_title": "QUADRATIC LOWER BOUND FOR PERMANENT VS.
