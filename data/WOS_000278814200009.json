This paper describes two novel wireless/wired multipoint-to-multipoint multicast flow control schemes, which are based on the distributed self-tuning proportional integrative plus derivative (SPID) controller and distributed self-tuning proportional plus integrative (SPI) controller, respectively. The control parameters can be designed to ensure the stability of the control loop in terms of source rate. The distributed explicit rate SPID and SPI controllers are located at the wireless/wired multipoint-to-multipoint multicast source to regulate the transmission rate. We further analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm, and show how the control mechanism can be used to design a controller to support wireless/wired multipoint-to-multipoint multicast transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of system stability, fast response, low packet loss, and high scalability, and the results also show SPID scheme has better performance than SPI scheme, however, SPID scheme requires more computing time and CPU resource.", "paper_title": "Distributed Explicit Rate Schemes in Multi-Input-Multi-Output Network Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278814200009"}
