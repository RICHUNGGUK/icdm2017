We assume the lifetime data from the system are masked, and the masking probability is dependent. Noninformative prior, and conjugate prior are considered; and Gibbs sampling method is used to obtain the estimators of the unknown parameters, the reliability function, and the hazard function. A numeric example demonstrates how to apply the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Analysis of Pareto Reliability With Dependent Masked Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000272314800002"}
