The proposed method combines neural networks, lower-upper-middle (LUM) smoothers and adaptive switching operations to produce a high-quality enhanced image. Extensive experimentation reported in this paper indicates that the proposed method is sufficiently robust, achieves an excellent balance between noise suppression and signal-detail preservation, and outperforms some well-known filters both subjectively and objectively.", "paper_title": "Lum processor with neural decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000240665500008"}
