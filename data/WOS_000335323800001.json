One of the main challenges for mobile location estimation is the presence of the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. It results in erroneous measurements containing NLOS error due to the reflection and diffraction. The NLOS error could seriously reduce the localization accuracy. This paper presents a novel mobile localization method for distributed sensor network in NLOS propagation scenarios. The aim of the method is to mitigate the NLOS error and enhance the localization accuracy. The transition between the LOS and NLOS is described by two-state Markov model. The interacting multiple model frame is employed to estimate the position of unknown node. The probability data association algorithm is used to filter the estimated location. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional filter method in NLOS scenarios.", "paper_title": "A Novel Mobile Localization Method for Distributed Sensor Network with Non-Line-of-Sight Error Mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335323800001"}
