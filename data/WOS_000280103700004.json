To support the basic research leading to determination of the principles on which humans and animals accomplish agile sensing, a survey of bio-inspired visual attention in target detection is presented in this paper. We first discuss some relevant fundamental concepts and techniques. Then several up-to-date algorithms and implementations are introduced in either bottom-up or top-down mechanisms. This paper also gives a tutorial for the existing researches and provides future challenges.", "paper_title": "Bio-inspired visual attention in agile sensing for target detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000280103700004"}
