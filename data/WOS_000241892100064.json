The model can adapt to changes in object appearance over time. A mixture of three Gaussian distributions models the value of each pixel. An online Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to update the parameters of the Gaussians. The observation model in the particle filter is designed based on the adaptive appearance model. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can track objects well under illumination change, large pose variation, and partial or full occlusion.", "paper_title": "Robust object tracking algorithm in natural environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100064"}
