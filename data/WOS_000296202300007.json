Both \"complete\" and \"incomplete\" information systems are dealt with. The language of these logics contains modal operators, and constants corresponding to attributes and attribute values. Sound and complete deductive systems for these logics are presented, and the problem of decidability is addressed. Furthermore, notions of information and information update are defined, and dynamic extensions of the above logics are presented to accommodate these notions. A set of reduction axioms enables us to obtain a complete axiomatization of the dynamic logics.", "paper_title": "Logics for Information Systems and Their Dynamic Extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000296202300007"}
