The model includes a state-of-the-art description of cell electro-physiology. The main objective of this work is to develop a computational framework capable of predicting the effects of different stimulation trains and electrode configurations on the excitability and fatigue of skeletal muscle tissue. Utilizing a reduced but computationally amenable model, the effects of different electrode sizes and inter-electrode distances on the number of activated muscle fibers are investigated and qualitatively compared to existing literature. To analyze muscle fatigue, the sodium current, specifically the K+ ion concentrations within the t-tubule and the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is used to quantify membrane and metabolic fatigue. The simulations demonstrate that lower stimulation frequencies and biphasic pulse waveforms cause less fatigue than higher stimulation frequencies and monophasic pulses. A comparison between single and dual electrode configurations (with the same overall stimulation surface) is presented to locally investigate the differences in muscle fatigue. The dual electrode configuration causes the muscle tissue to fatigue quicker. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
