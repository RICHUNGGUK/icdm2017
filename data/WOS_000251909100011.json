In order to improve the controllability and the observability of the experimental design, a simple bus structure with a scan register followed by a hold. register is used to manage the set of interconnect lines. The strength of the open defects has been varied within a. realistic range of resistances ranging from a full (complete) open to a weak (low resistance) open by means of broken metal lines and transmission gates, respectively. Experiments performed with an automatic test equipment show the influence of coupling capacitances with adjacent lines on the electrical behavior of the defective line. Furthermore, experimental evidence of the history effect on the delay caused by resistive opens is investigated. Validation of the measured results by means of theoretical as well as simulation analysis is presented. Finally, some recommendations to generate Stuck-at, I-DDQ, and delay test are discussed in order to improve the detectability of such defects.", "paper_title": "Experimental characterization of CMOS interconnect open defects", "paper_id": "WOS:000251909100011"}
