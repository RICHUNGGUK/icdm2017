It is proved that in general it is undecidable whether a finite set of picture is a code. The subclass of prefix codes is introduced and it is proved that it is decidable whether a finite set of pictures is a prefix code. :Further a polynomial time decoding algorithm for finite prefix codes is given. Maximality and completeness of finite prefix codes are studied.", "paper_title": "PREFIX PICTURE CODES: A DECIDABLE CLASS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000350333300007"}
