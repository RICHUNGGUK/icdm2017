This paper proposes a halo exchange method for unstructured sparse matrix vector products within the algebraic multigrid method, and evaluate it on a supercomputer with mesh/torus networks. In our numerical tests with a Poisson problem, the proposed method accelerates the linear solver more than 14 times with 23040 cores.", "paper_title": "Axis Communication Method for Algebraic Multigrid Solver", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141300014"}
