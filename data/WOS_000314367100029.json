Quantifying this claim for computed tomography (CT) is nontrivial, because both full sampling in the discrete-to-discrete imaging model and the reduction in sampling admitted by sparsity-exploiting methods are ill-defined. The present article proposes definitions of full sampling by introducing four sufficient-sampling conditions (SSCs). The SSCs are based on the condition number of the system matrix of a linear imaging model and address invertibility and stability. In the example application of breast CT, the SSCs are used as reference points of full sampling for quantifying the undersampling admitted by reconstruction through TV-minimization. In numerical simulations, factors affecting admissible undersampling are studied. Differences between few-view and few-detector bin reconstruction as well as a relation between object sparsity and admitted undersampling are quantified.", "paper_title": "Quantifying Admissible Undersampling for Sparsity-Exploiting Iterative Image Reconstruction in X-Ray CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000314367100029"}
