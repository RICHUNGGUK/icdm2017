A duplex surface treatment on five steels has been developed involving nitrocarburizing and followed by chromium thermo-reactive deposition (TRD) techniques. The TRD process was performed in molten salt bath at 550, 625 and 700 A degrees C for 1-30 h. The process formed a thickness up to 9.5 mu m of chromium carbonitride coatings on a hardened diffusion zone. A model based on ANFIS for predicting the layer thickness of duplex coating of the specimens has been presented. To build the model, training and testing using experimental results from 84 specimens were conducted. The data used as inputs in ANFIS models are arranged in a format of twelve parameters that cover the chemical composition (C, Mn, Si, Cr, Mo, V, W), the pre-nitriding time, ferro-chromium particle size, ferro-chromium weight percent, salt bath temperature and coating time. According to these input parameters, in the Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system models, the layer thickness of duplex coating of each specimen was predicted. The training and testing results in ANFIS models have shown a strong potential for predicting the layer thickness of duplex coating.", "paper_title": "Application of ANFIS for modeling of layer thickness of chromium carbonitride coating", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400019"}
