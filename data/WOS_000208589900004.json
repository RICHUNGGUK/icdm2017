We provide an overview of the need for considering spatial dependence in comparative research, how this requires appropriate historical maps, and detail how the cshapes associated R package cshapes can contribute to these ends. We illustrate the use of the package for drawing maps, computing spatial variables for countries, and generating weights matrices for spatial statistics.", "paper_title": "Mapping and Measuring Country Shapes The cshapes Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000208589900004"}
