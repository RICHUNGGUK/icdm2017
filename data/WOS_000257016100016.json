In recent years, research in intrusion detection has evolved to become a multi-discipline task that involves areas such as data mining, decision analysis, agent-based systems or cost-benefit analysis among others. We propose a multiagent IDS that considers decision analysis techniques in order to configure itself optimally according to the conditions faced. This IDS also provides a quantitative measure of the value of the response decision it can autonomously take. Results regarding the well-known 1999 KDD dataset are shown. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
