The task is formulated as a problem of spline regression, in which the spline is derived in Sobolev space and has a form of a combination of linear and Green's functions. Besides its nonlinear representation capability, one advantage of this spline in usage is that, once it has been constructed, no parameters need to be tuned to data. We define this spline on the user specified foreground and background pixels, and solve its parameters (the combination coefficients of functions) from a group of linear equations. To speed up spline construction, K-means clustering algorithm is employed to cluster the user specified pixels. By taking the cluster centers as representatives, this spline can be easily constructed. The foreground object is finally cut out from its background via spline interpolation. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of the pixels to be segmented. Experiments on diverse natural images, with comparison to existing algorithms, illustrate the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "Interactive Natural Image Segmentation via Spline Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000267221900020"}
