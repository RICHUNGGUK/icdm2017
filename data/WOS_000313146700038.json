Packet dropouts in these two links are modeled as two independent Markov chains, whose transition probability matrices are sparse so that it is easy to obtain. Moreover, late arrivals are considered in the model as well. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of design problems of H-infinity output feedback controllers are presented and are dependent on the upper bounds of the number of consecutive packet dropouts. The validity of the proposed approaches are illustrated by a numerical example. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
