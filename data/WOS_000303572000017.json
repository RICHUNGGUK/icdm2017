The paper develops a constrained K-shortest paths algorithm within a dynamic restricted searching area in consideration of realistic road network spatial distribution features. Through the test with the microscopic transportation simulation tool VISSIM, the algorithm could not only decrease the searching scale but also efficiently balance the traffic flow in the net and avoid the phenomenon of Braess Paradox.", "paper_title": "Applicable Prevention Method of Braess Paradox in Urban Traffic Flow Guidance System", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000017"}
