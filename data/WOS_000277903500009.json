Mathematical analysis of the large volume genomic DNA sequence data is one of the challenges for bio-scientists. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel method for visualizing and analyzing DNA sequences, the applications on mutation analysis and similarity analysis are presented in detail based on DC-curve (Delta coding curve).", "paper_title": "A Novel Method for Visualizing and Analyzing DNA Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500009"}
