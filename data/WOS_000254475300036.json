This result implies that 2 x 2 lattice-based diagonal space-time block codes with Gaussian integer signal constellations and generating matrices of entries from quadratic algebraic extensions of Z[i] have already reached the optimal normalized diversity product.", "paper_title": "Optimal normalized diversity product of 2 x 2 lattice-based diagonal space-time codes from QAM signal constellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300036"}
