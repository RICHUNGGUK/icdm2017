Safety applications installed in vehicles aim to send a warning message to all reachable network vehicles as soon as possible. There are several broadcast methods for disseminating messages. We implement each broadcast method and compare methods. We evaluate the reliability and performance of our distance based priority broadcast method for VANETs environment on a highway simulation. This analysis allows us to study the impact of vehicle density and of multi hop forwarding. The proposed method can stably spread the messages in high density vehicular networks. Furthermore, we can con-firm only 1.8 %, the percentage of forwarded packets by the simulation results.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design on efficient message relay methods in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700014"}
