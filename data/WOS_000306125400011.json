Therefore, an effective mechanism should be proposed to resist such misbehavior and to stimulate the nodes willing to relay packets for other nodes toward their destinations. On the basis of the evolutionary reputation model proposed, this paper investigates the network performance, including message delivery ratio, average delivery delay, and average intermittent hops, under the influence of reputation degree and selfish degree. In addition, the reputation evolution process is described, which helps to understand the interaction among network nodes. Simulation results show that the opportunistic network adopting the model proposed can resist partially the node selfishness and maintain acceptable network performance.
