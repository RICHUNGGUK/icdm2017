A tracking controller is proposed such that it combines the inverse dynamics control technique and an adaptive robust PID control strategy to preserve robustness to both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. A SPR-Lypunov stability analysis demonstrates that tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and exponentially converge to a small ball containing the origin. The proposed inverse dynamics tracking controller is successfully applied to a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of an Inverse Dynamics Controller for Uncertain Nonholonomic Robotic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319773300005"}
