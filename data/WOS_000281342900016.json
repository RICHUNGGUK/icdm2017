In this letter, based on multi-dimensional perfect arrays (MD PAs), a method for constructing MD periodic CASs is presented, which is carried out by sampling MD PAs. It is particularly worth mentioning that the numbers and sizes of sub-arrays in the proposed MD periodic CASs can be freely changed within the range of possibilities. In particular, for arbitrarily given positive integers M and L, two-dimensional periodic polyphase CASs with the number M-2 and size L x L of sub-arrays can be produced by the proposed method. And analogously, pseudo-random MD periodic CASs can be given when pseudo-random MD arrays are sampled. Finally, the proposed method's validity is made sure by a given example.", "paper_title": "Construction of Multi-Dimensional Periodic Complementary Array Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900016"}
