In contrast, the quantitative approach for comparing these methodologies has rarely been used. Thus, it is difficult to assess the extent of suitability of these methodologies to, and the understanding and usage of the methodologies by, their intended users. In this paper, we adopted a quantitative approach for the comparison of two agent-oriented modeling methods, the Multiagent System Engineering (MaSE) and the Object-Process Methodology for Multi-Agent Systems (OPM/MAS). In particular, we examined the modeling language of each method as reflected in the design results. The results of the examination highlighted the differences between the two methods. Specifically, MaSE was found to be more adequate for understanding interactions and in specifying a new behavior. On the other hand, OPM/MAS was found helpful in understanding the entire system and in specifying interactions with the environment. These results clearly indicate the improvements required for each of the methods compared.", "paper_title": "A QUANTITATIVE-BASED COMPARISON OF MaSE AND OPM/MAS DESIGN RESULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263625300005"}
