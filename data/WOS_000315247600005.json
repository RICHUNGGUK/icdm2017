An apropos kinematic setting for different zones of the computational domain is introduced and an efficient coupling strategy is proposed. Heat generation via viscous dissipation as well as frictional heating is considered. The results of the simulation using the proposed model are compared with the experimental evidence. The effect of slip and stick condition on non-circular pin shapes is analyzed. Simulation of material stirring is also carried out via particle tracing, providing insight of the material flow pattern in the vicinity of the pin. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
