However, for asymmetric MIMO systems (where n(r) < n(t)), with the exception of a few LSTBC schemes, it is unknown whether general LSTBC schemes with NVD and a code rate of n(r) complex dimensions per channel use are DMT optimal. In this paper, an enhanced sufficient criterion for any STBC scheme to be DMT optimal is obtained, and using this criterion, it is established that any LSTBC scheme with NVD and a code rate of min {n(t), n(r)} complex dimensions per channel use is DMT optimal. This result settles the DMT optimality of several well-known, low-ML-decoding-complexity LSTBC schemes for certain asymmetric MIMO systems.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced DMT-Optimality Criterion for STBC Schemes for Asymmetric MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800048"}
