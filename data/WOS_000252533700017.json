We focus in particular on the impact of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) as well as inter-cell interference resulting from different frequency reuse schemes. Several performance measures, namely blocking rates, mean transfer time and the mean number of collisions between two OFDMA WiMAX cells, are then derived and quantified. We show that reuse partitioning results in a higher blocking rate at the appreciable gain in terms of lower mean transfer time for users close to the base station as well as a lower number of collisions which implies a higher throughput.
