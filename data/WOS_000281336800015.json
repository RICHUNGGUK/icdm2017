Increasingly bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications are the first to utilize all benefits that multihomed user terminals offer in a way of connection persistence, reliability and fault tolerance, seamless handovers between points of attachments (PoA) and bandwidth aggregation. Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) is, considering the advantages of integrated multihoming support, possible bandwidth aggregation and high reliability in addition to other attractive features like multistreaming, partial reliability and optional unordered delivery, a viable transport protocol for provisioning of demanding services in the converged IP-based multimedia environment with guaranteed operator-grade reliability and quality. But despite numerous advantages, the use of SCTP is still mainly limited to operators' services, while end-user terminals have still not yet adopted SCTP as a common transport protocol. As we point out in this article, this is mainly due to widely deployed network address translation (NAT) and firewall (FW) middleboxes and very common use of default routing at the end-user terminals, which results in issues at setting up and maintaining of a fully operational multihomed SCTP association. In this article we introduce two novel solutions that overcome these issues with the use of NAT/firewall NSIS signaling layer protocol (NATFW NSLP). First solution relies on dynamic address reconfiguration SCTP extension and the second one on SCTP endpoints' routing table synchronization. Interface between NATFW NSLP and SCTP has been designed and implemented in Linux environment, using Linux kernel SCTP (LKSCTP). Test results clearly show the benefits of our approach with a successful deployment of a resilient multihomed SCTP association in distributed NAT environment. Single point of failure is successfully avoided, even though default routing and asymmetrical multihoming is used. Additionally, our solution can realize an immediate failover if a fatal error occurs at a traversed middlebox, and offer disjoint network paths for possible bandwidth aggregation. These advanced features are of vital importance for dynamic end-to-end resource availability and satisfactory service quality for clients with heterogeneous access technologies.
