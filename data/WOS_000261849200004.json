(1999a). The studies were carried out in the context of a system whose components generated model texts, through which we confirmed that the laws of Zipf and Mandelbrot are appropriate for explaining the texts. On the basis of a Pearson System, we also obtained a unique function for the distribution of frequencies, with said distribution being a generalization of the above-mentioned laws. For the problem analyzed in this article, the text or text system constitutes a model of the cognitive development of individuals. We can thus infer the cognitive characteristics of different individuals by studying text systems.", "paper_title": "MODELLING OF STATISTICAL LAWS FOR TEXTS USING A PEARSON SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000261849200004"}
