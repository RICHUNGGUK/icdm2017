In this paper, we present a low-complexity, blind CFO estimator for OFDM systems with constant modulus (CM) signaling. Both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO) systems are considered. Based on the assumption that the channel keeps constant during estimation, we prove that the CFO can be estimated uniquely and exactly through minimizing the power difference of received data on the same subcarriers between two consecutive OFDM symbols; thus, the identifiability problem is assured. Inspired by the sinusoid-like cost function, curve fitting is utilized to simplify our algorithm. Performance analysis reveals that the proposed estimator is asymptotically unbiased and the mean square error (MSE) exhibits no error floor. We show that this blind scheme can also be applied to a MIMO system. Numerical simulations show that the proposed estimator provides excellent performance compared with existing blind methods.", "paper_title": "Blind carrier frequency offset estimation for constant modulus signaling based OFDM systems: algorithm, identifiability, and performance analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537700002"}
