This survey of techniques and testing results provides insight into our ability to successfully identify DoS flooding attacks. Although each detector shows promise in limited testing, none completely solve the detection problem. Combining various approaches With experienced network operators will most likely produce the best results.", "paper_title": "Denial-of-service attack-detection techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000234489600012"}
