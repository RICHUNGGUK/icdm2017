Specifically, we continue on the line of recent works by Belohlavek and Vychodil, which use intensifying hedges as a tool to reduce the size of a concept lattice. In this paper we use hedges as a reduction tool in the general framework of multi-adjoint concept lattices with heterogeneous conjunctors.", "paper_title": "Multi-adjoint concept lattices with heterogeneous conjunctors and hedges", "paper_id": "WOS:000342438500005"}
