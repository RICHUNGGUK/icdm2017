The performance of the original Population Monte Carlo algorithm is compared with a modified version that eliminates the influence of the transition particle via a double Rao-Blackwellisation. This modification is shown to improve the exploration of the modes through a large simulation experiment on posterior distributions of mean mixtures of distributions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
