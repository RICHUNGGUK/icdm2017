Video technologies including ultrahigh-definition TV ( more than 33M pixels) continue to advance, and future communication networks will become video-centric. The inefficiencies of current IP technologies, in particular, the energy consumption and throughput limitations of IP routers, will become pressing problems. Harnessing the full power of light will resolve these problems and spur the creation of future video-centric networks. Extension of optical layer technologies and coordination with new transport protocols will be critical; hierarchical optical path technologies and optical circuit/path switching will play key roles. Recent technical advances in these fields are presented.", "paper_title": "Optical Networking Technologies That Will Create Future Bandwidth-Abundant Networks [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000270407600010"}
