The proposed architecture consists of a conventional synchronous ADC, a timer and a peak detector. AD conversion is carried out only when input signal peaks are detected. To improve the accuracy of signal reconstruction, MINIMAX sampling is improved so that multiple points are captured for each peak, and its effectiveness is experimentally confirmed. In addition, power reduction, which is the primary advantage of the proposed signal-dependent ADC, is analytically discussed and then validated with circuit simulations.", "paper_title": "Signal-Dependent Analog-to-Digital Conversion Based on MINIMAX Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800008"}
