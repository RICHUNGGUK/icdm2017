Taking a specific cohesion criterion SCI, we performed massive evaluations of collocate cohesion in Oxford Collocations Dictionary. For three groups of modificative collocations (adjective-noun, adverb-adjective, and adverb-verb) SCI distributions proved to be one-peaked and compact, with rather close mean values and standard deviations. Thus we suggest a reliable numeric criterion for extraction of collocations from the Web.", "paper_title": "Web-based measurements of intra-collocational cohesion in Oxford collocations dictionary", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700010"}
