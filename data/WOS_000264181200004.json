In order to leap the trust barrier for the users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, we present a collaborative iTrust e-service for exploring proximal collective wisdom in the ad-hoc ubiquitous environment. By highlighting the homophily of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. Proximity thus enables ad-hoc e-service participants to contribute their strength for ubiquitous collective wisdom. Simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show significant improvement over traditional designs. The iTrust e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with the nearby user groups for establishing a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. It also facilitates and empowers the potential benefits of various ubiquitous e-service applications.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous collaborative iTrust service: Exploring proximity collective wisdom", "paper_id": "WOS:000264181200004"}
