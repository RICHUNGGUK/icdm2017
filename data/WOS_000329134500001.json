In this article, an MAC protocol has been proposed which will utilize the adaptive spreading code length technique to increase network performance for these applications. In this architecture, the system can automatically determine the time varying channel quality and set the optimum spreading code length to maximize the throughput while minimizing the energy usage. Due to this adaptive feature, the system is able to deliver reliable wireless service even in the harsh RF environment. The design of such a protocol is also backwards compatible to enable its employment in both traditional and advanced WSN scenarios. Finally, the proposed protocol has been implemented in a COTS WSN platform to obtain the experimental result, which demonstrates the ability of being implemented on typical resource constraints WSN devices. The experimental results have shown the efficiency advantages of the proposed MAC protocol delivering 139% higher throughput as well as having better energy performance than the standard IEEE 802.15.4 system.", "paper_title": "AS-MAC: Utilizing the Adaptive Spreading Code Length for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329134500001"}
