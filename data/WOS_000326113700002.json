On the one hand, the formal nucleus of pre-emptive Time Petri Nets (pTPNs) is used to support design and verification activities of the development process; on the other hand, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded (MARTE) systems is adopted to manage the documentation process prescribed by MIL-STD-498. The two cores are integrated by providing guidance for translation of UML-MARTE specifications into equivalent pTPN models, with specific reference to concurrency control and synchronization mechanisms. This permits to attain a smooth transition from the standard artifacts of MIL-STD-498 to pTPN models and analyses, facilitating deployment of the formal core of pTPNs with a limited impact on the industrial practice. The experience proves practical feasibility and effectiveness of the approach, comprising a step towards industrial applicability of formal methods and practices.", "paper_title": "Combining UML-MARTE and Preemptive Time Petri Nets: An Industrial Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700002"}
