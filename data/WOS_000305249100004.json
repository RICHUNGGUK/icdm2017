This toolchain is unique for several reasons. First, by using static code analysis techniques, it is able to predict both the typical case and bounds for resource usage, such as computational, memory (both static and dynamic), and energy requirements. Second, it provides a graphical user interface with configurable software building blocks which allows easy creation and customization of protocol stacks. Third, it targets low-cost, low-energy hardware, allowing the creation of low-cost systems. We demonstrate the RaPTEX toolchain by evaluating different design options for an experimental ultrasonic communication system for biotelemetry in extremely shallow waters. The power, size, mass, and cost constraints of this application make it critical to pack as much processing into the available resources as possible. The RaPTEX toolchain analyzes resource use, enabling the system to safely operate closer to the edge of the resource envelope. The toolchain also helps users with the rapid prototyping of communication protocols by providing users with quick feedback on resource requirements. We demonstrate the use and output of the toolchain. We compare the accuracy of its predictions against measurements of the real hardware.", "paper_title": "RESOURCE-FOCUSED TOOLCHAIN FOR RAPID PROTOTYPING OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305249100004"}
