Then, based on the moment generating function (MGF) and the Gauss-Chebyshev integration, a simple and accurate numerical method is presented to analyze the SER performance of the system with the new transmit scheme under the three commonly used modulations. Finally, computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Combined adaptive beamforming with space-time block coding for multi-antenna communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400011"}
