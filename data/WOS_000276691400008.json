The collaboration framework incorporates a web collaboration service, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, a building blackbox system (BBS), a geo-database, and a geographic information system (GIS). Through the integration of these technologies, the framework provides a collaboration medium for first responders, including civil engineers, to cohesively respond to disasters. Access to critical building information, such as construction documents, through the BBS supports assessments of building integrity during disaster response. Building assessment information is stored on RFID tags, which are accessible to first responders through digital devices via a wireless ad hoc network. With on-site assessment information shown on a digital map, decision makers locate, collect, and distribute critical resources through the GIS to first responders. In addition, the decision makers at distributed locations evaluate the incident through discussion sessions, hosted by the web collaboration environment, for integrated decision making. Test-bed simulations for the framework have been carried out with encouraging results at the training ground of the Illinois Fire Service Institute.", "paper_title": "Mobile Ad Hoc Network-Enabled Collaboration Framework Supporting Civil Engineering Emergency Response Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000276691400008"}
