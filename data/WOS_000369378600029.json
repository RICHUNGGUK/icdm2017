In cloud computing, it is mainly through the resource sharing and collaborative action to meet the demand for an unlimited access speed, unlimited storage space and a reliable resource protection for users. For the secure access resources among different domains in cloud network, today most Cloud Computing Systems provide data security and mutual authentication with asymmetric and traditional public key cryptography. For these researches, the authentication process is cumbersome, and the certificate management is complex, which would bring some inconvenience for mutual authentication among servers or users in a Hybrid Cloud. This paper provides a security authentication protocol among multiple domains. It adopts the direct product decomposition and linear mapping technology of cyclic group to achieve mutual authentication between members in multi-domain systems or heterogeneous networks. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes have the advantages of in security, computation consumption and Communication consumption. It is suitable for safety authentication in large-scale Cloud computing environment.", "paper_title": "Multi-domain Security Authentication Protocol for Hybrid Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000369378600029"}
