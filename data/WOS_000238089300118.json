Similarly, appropriately timed and clearly expressed emotion is a central required for believable interactive virtual humans. Presently, incorporating emotion into virtual humans is gain increasing attention in academia and industry. This strong interest is driven by a wide spectrum of promising applications in many areas such as virtual reality, e-learning, entertainment, etc. This paper discusses a system that allows the design of emotion for interactive virtual human. We introduce an emotion model of artificial psychology, in which the transition of emotion can be viewed as a Morkov process and the relation of between emotion and mood can be describes by Hidden Morkov Model (HMM). In order to demonstrate the approach, we integrate the emotion model into a system composed of voice recognition and a realistic facial model. Thus, the model can be used for generating a variety of emotional expression of autonomous, interactive virtual humans.", "paper_title": "Expression animation of interactive virtual humans based on HMM emotion model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300118"}
