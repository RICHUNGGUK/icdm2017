To utilize reaction-threshold diversity among the cells, we examined analog feedback in Euglena-based neurocomputing by solving a simple combinatorial optimization problem. The analog feedback was performed by blue light illumination to Euglena cells, where the intensity of the blue light was controlled using the Hopfleld-Tank algorithm with a sigmoid function. The solution patterns obtained with analog feedback had greater variations than those with digital feedback, implying that the solution-search capability of Euglena-based neurocomputing is enhanced by analog feedback. Moreover, the solutions obtained with analog feedback comprised one stable core-motive selection and additional flexible selections, which are associated with hesitation shown by humans when faced with a frustrated task. The study shows that using analog feedback in Euglena-based neurocomputing is promising in terms of incorporating the diversity of photoreactions of Euglena cells to enhance the solution-search capability for combinatorial optimization problems and to utilize the adaptive reaction of Euglena cells.
