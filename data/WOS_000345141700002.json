The purpose of the study is to develop a realistic 3D finite element (FE) model of the hemi-pelvis and to assess stress and strain distribution during a gait cycle. The FE modelling approach of the pelvic bone was based on CT scan data and image segmentation of cortical and cancellous bone boundaries. Application of hip-joint force through an anatomical femoral head having a cartilage layer was found to be more appropriate than a perfectly spherical head, thereby leading to more accurate stress-strain distribution in the acetabulum. Within the acetabulum, equivalent strains varied between 0.1% and 0.7% strain in the cancellous bone. High compressive (15-30MPa) and low tensile (0-5MPa) stresses were generated within the acetabulum. The hip-joint force is predominantly transferred from the acetabulum through the lateral cortex to the sacroiliac joint and the pubic symphysis. The study is useful to understand the load transfer within the acetabulum and for further investigations on acetabular prosthesis.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of a hemi-pelvis: the effect of inclusion of cartilage layer on acetabular stresses and strain", "paper_id": "WOS:000345141700002"}
