This article presents novel strategies for optimising semantic reasoning for realising semantic applications and services on mobile devices. We have developed the mTableaux algorithm which optimises the reasoning process to facilitate service selection. We present comparative experimental results which show that mTableaux improves the performance and scalability of semantic reasoning for mobile devices.
