More specifically, we shall propose an evolutionary algorithm, an estimation of distribution algorithm, and several memetic algorithms that differ in the local search used. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, the freely available yeast microarray dataset has been used. The results obtained have been compared with the algorithm proposed by Cheng and Church. Both in terms of the computation time and the quality of the solutions, the comparison reveals that a standard evolutionary algorithm and the estimation of distribution algorithm offer an efficient alternative for obtaining biclusters.", "paper_title": "Obtaining biclusters in microarrays with population-based heuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900011"}
