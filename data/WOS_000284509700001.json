It is a type of self-organizing production process, in which the scheduling of those shop floors must be synchronized, in terms of time and quantity. In this paper, we propose a time-synchronizing control policy for self-organizing shop floors based on the (max, +) system theory, prove the convergence of the synchronization algorithm, and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm by numerical experiments. Besides, a method of implementing the synchronizing control system based on the radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies is also proposed briefly.", "paper_title": "Time-synchronizing control of self-organizing shop floors for networked manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000284509700001"}
