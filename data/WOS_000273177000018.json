Signatures, interpretation structures and deduction systems are seen as multi-graphs (in-graphs). After defining a category freely generated by a in-graph. formulas and expressions in general can be seen as morphisms. Moreover, derivations involving rule instantiation are also morphisms. Soundness and completeness theorems are proved. As a consequence of the generality of the approach our results apply to very different logics encompassing, among others, substructural logics as well as logics with non-deteministic semantics, and subsume all logics endowed with an algebraic semantics,", "paper_title": "A Graph-theoretic Account of Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000273177000018"}
