Not to mention insightful physical knowledge, computational-aided molecular studies can expedite the synthesis of novel energetic materials through cost reduction labours and risky experimental tests. In this paper, quantitative structureproperty relationship based on multi-expression programming employed to correlate the formation enthalpies of frequently used nitro-energetic materials with their molecular properties. The simple yet accurate obtained model is able to correlate the formation enthalpies of nitro-energetic materials to their molecular structure with the accuracy comparable to experimental precision.", "paper_title": "Multi-expression programming based model for prediction of formation enthalpies of nitro-energetic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000314217800007"}
