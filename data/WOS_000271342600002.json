We propose a new class of schemes for such a system for the one-dimensional situations based on nonconservative fluxes preserving the steady-state solutions. We derive a second-order scheme using a splitting of the porosity function into a discontinuous and a regular part where the regular part is treated as a source term while the discontinuous part is treated with the nonconservative fluxes. We then present a classification of all the configurations for the Riemann problem solutions. In particularly, we carefully study the resonant situations when two eigenvalues are superposed. Based on the classification, we deal with the inverse Riemann problem and present algorithms to compute the exact solutions. We finally propose new Sod problems to test the schemes for the resonant situations where numerical simulations are performed to compare with the theoretical solutions. The schemes accuracy (first- and second-order) is evaluated comparing with a nontrivial steady-state solution with the numerical approximation and convergence curves are established.
