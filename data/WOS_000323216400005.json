Specifically, the normalized logarithm of the associated partition function (free energy) is shown to converge along any sequence of graphs whose random weak limit is a tree, and the limit is directly expressed in terms of the unique solution to a limiting cavity equation. On a Galton-Watson tree, the latter simplifies into a recursive distributional equation which can be solved explicitly. As an illustration, we provide a new asymptotic formula for the maximum size of a b-matching in the Erds-Renyi random graph with fixed average degree and diverging size, for any b is an element of N. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that correlation inequalities and unimodularity are combined together to yield a general proof of uniqueness of Gibbs measures on infinite trees. We believe that a similar argument is applicable to other Gibbs measures than those over spanning subgraphs considered here.
