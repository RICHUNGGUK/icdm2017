One procedure examines the effect of example-problem pairs when they are simultaneously presented to a participant. The other procedure involved studying an example and then removing it and having the participant solve a similar problem. Participants were assigned randomly to two above procedures. Cognitive load effects and learning outcomes were assessed. The results indicate that in the low prior knowledge group, learners who were simultaneously given examples and problems performed more effectively and efficiently, and reported significantly lower cognitive load than those who learned from example-problem pairs. In the high prior knowledge group, no significant difference was observed between the two procedures. This study provides empirical support for the process of learning from examples and problems simultaneously. It suggests that the effectiveness of certain instructional procedures in example-based learning depends upon the level of a learner's prior knowledge.", "paper_title": "Comparison of different approaches on example-based learning for novice and proficient learners", "paper_id": "WOS:000362201300001"}
