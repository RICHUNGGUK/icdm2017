Such datasets may be gene expression or any other high-throughput data collected in the same set of samples. The enrichment analysis is done in the context of pathway information, gene ontology or any custom annotation of the data. The results of the analysis consist of significant associations between profiled elements of one of the datasets to the annotation terms (e.g. miR-19 was associated to the cell-cycle process in breast cancer samples). The results of the enrichment analysis are visualized as an interactive Cytoscape network.", "paper_title": "ENViz: a Cytoscape App for integrated statistical analysis and visualization of sample-matched data with multiple data types", "paper_id": "WOS:000355672500026"}
