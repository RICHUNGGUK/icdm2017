The proposed iterative robust KPCA (rKPCA) links the iterative updating and robust estimation of principal directions. It inherits good properties from these two ideas for reducing the time complexity, space complexity, and the influence of these outliers on estimating the principal directions. In the asymptotic stability analysis, we also show that our iterative rKPCA converges to the weighted kernel principal kernel components from the batch rKPCA. Experimental results are presented to confirm that our iterative rKPCA achieves the robustness as well as time saving better than batch KPCA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
