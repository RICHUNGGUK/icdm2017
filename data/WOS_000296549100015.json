In this contribution, we present a generic and extensible modeling language that is suitable for different types of work processes. Further, an extension of the generic language that is specific to operational processes is introduced. Both the generic language and its extension are defined in form of an ontology. Moreover, modeling concepts are defined formally on different levels of detail. This allows for the formal representation of operational processes throughout the plant life cycle. The expressiveness of the modeling language is illustrated by a case study, in which an operational process of a liquefacient production process is represented on different levels of detail. This contribution also briefly introduces a modeling tool developed by our group for applying the modeling language in industrial practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
