The similarity search based on SimRank is an important operation for identifying similar vertices in a graph and has been employed in many data analysis applications. Nowadays, graphs in the real world become much larger and more dynamic. The existing solutions for similarity search are expensive in terms of time and space cost. None of them can efficiently support similarity search over large dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage random-walk sampling framework (TSF) for SimRank-based similarity search (e.g., top-k search). the preprocessing stage, TSE samples a set of one-way graphs to index raw random walks in a novel manner within 00111,) time and space, where N is the number of vertices and is the number of one-way graphs. The one-way graph can be efficiently updated in accordance with the graph modification, thus TSF is well suited to dynamic graphs. During the query stage, TSF can search similar vertices fast by naturally pruning unqualified vertices based on the connectivity of one-way graphs. Furthermore, with additional R-q samples, TSF can estimate the SimRank score with probability 1- 2e(-2 epsilon 2 RgRq/(1 - c)2) if the error of approximation is bounded by. Finally, to guarantee the scalability of TSF, the one-way graphs can also be compactly stored on the disk when the memory is limited. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that TSF can handle dynamic billion-edge graphs with high performance.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Similarity Search Framework for SimRank over Large Dynamic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000362281800003"}
