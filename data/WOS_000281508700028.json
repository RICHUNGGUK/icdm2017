We show how this framework can be used to formulate a cost effective job scheduling scheme based on a predetermined fair pricing strategy at the wireless access point. The pricing strategy formulates an incomplete information, alternating-offers bargaining game on two variables, such as price per unit resource and percentage of bandwidth allocated. The proposed cost-optimal job allocation scheme is for distributing grid computing jobs to the mobile nodes and considers the bandwidth constraints, the internal job (e.g., call processing) arrival rate at the nodes along with issues pertaining to node mobility. The simulation results point to the efficacy of our algorithm.
