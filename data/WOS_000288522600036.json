In order to improve drilling efficiency while preserving tool life, this study focuses on the design and implementation of an optimal fuzzy-control system for drilling force. This 49-rule controller is networked and operates on a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool. It is optimally tuned using a known maximum allowable delay to deal with uncertainties in the drilling process and delays in the network-based application. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed control strategy provides a good transient response (without, overshoot) and better error-based performance indices than the CNC working alone (uncontrolled), two versions of a PID controller and a 9-rule fuzzy controller.", "paper_title": "AN OPTIMAL FUZZY CONTROLLER FOR A HIGH-PERFORMANCE DRILLING PROCESS IMPLEMENTED OVER AN INDUSTRIAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600036"}
