The proposed method is the two-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional noise space decomposition method. It provides consistent estimators of the unknown parameters and they are non-iterative in nature. Two pairing algorithms, which help in identifying the frequency pairs have been proposed. It is observed that the mean squared errors of the proposed estimators are quite close to the asymptotic variance of the least squares estimators. For illustrative purposes two data sets have been analyzed, and it is observed that the proposed model and the method work quite well for analyzing real symmetric textures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
