Systems with reconfigurability have unique opportunities for adapting to such effects. Required, however, are low-cost, fine-grained methods for sensing physical parameters. This article presents powerful, novel approaches to online sensing, including methods for designing compact reconfigurable sensors, low-cost threshold detection, and several enhanced measurement procedures. Together, the approaches help enable systems to autonomously uncover a wealth of physical information. A highly efficient counter and improved ring oscillator are introduced, enabling an entire sensor node in just 8 Virtex-5 LUTs. We describe how variations can be measured in delay, temperature, switching-induced IR drop, and leakage-induced IR drop. We demonstrate the proposed approach with an experimental system based on a Virtex-5, instrumented with over 100 sensors at an overhead of only 1.3%. Results from thermally controlled experiments provide some surprising insights and illustrate the utility of the approach. Online sensing can help open the door to physically adaptive computing, including fine-grained power, reliability, and health management schemes for systems on a chip.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Sensing with Ring Oscillator Arrays for Healthier Reconfigurable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302282400001"}
