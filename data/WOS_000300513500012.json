Our method can be used for test generation for critical faults in component-based designs. Test generation for critical faults is done entirely using formal specifications and therefore the theory inherently guarantees that a generated test will be applicable to any implementation of the specifications. The theory makes fault analysis possible at an abstract level of design where the complete logic is not specified.", "paper_title": "Early Analysis of Critical Faults: An Approach to Test Generation from Formal Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300513500012"}
