To date, algorithms for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems have tended to mirror existing non-distributed global-search or local-search algorithms. Unfortunately, existing distributed global-search algorithms derive from classical backtracking search methods and require a total ordering over agents for completeness. Distributed variants of local-search algorithms (such as distributed breakout) inherit the incompleteness properties of their predecessors, or depend on the creation of new communication links between agents. In [5, 4) a new algorithm was presented designed explicitly for distributed environments so that a global ordering is not required, while avoiding the problems of existing local-search algorithms. This paper presents a significant improvement on that algorithm in performance and provability.", "paper_title": "Simple support-based distributed search", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600014"}
