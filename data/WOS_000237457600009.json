This paper proposes a trust-based privacy-preservation method for P2P data sharing. It adopts the trust relation between a peer and its collaborators (buddies). The buddy works as a proxy to send the request and acquire the data. This provides a shield under which the identity of the requester and the accessed data cannot be linked. A privacy measuring method is presented to evaluate the proposed mechanism. Dynamic trust assessment and the enhancement to supplier's privacy art discussed.", "paper_title": "Trust-based privacy preservation for peer-to-peer data sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000237457600009"}
