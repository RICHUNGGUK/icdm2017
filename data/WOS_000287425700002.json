Specifically, such a system allows us to solve four out of five problems recently advanced as counterexamples to the fundamental principle of universality in computation. The fifth counterexample, however, remains unassailable, indicating that universality in computation cannot he achieved, even with the help of such an extraordinary ally as time travel.", "paper_title": "Time Travel: A New Hypercomputational Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000287425700002"}
