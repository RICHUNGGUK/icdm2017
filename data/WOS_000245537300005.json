Special attention is paid to the moduli of the form 2(n) - 1 and 2(n) + 1. Different schemes of choice of these types of moduli and algorithms for conversion of arbitrary precision integers into the modular representation and back are considered. Results of experimental implementation of the described algorithms in the GMP system are discussed.", "paper_title": "Cunningham numbers in modular arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000245537300005"}
