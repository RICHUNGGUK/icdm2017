Obviously, the convergence of these algorithms is an essential issue in practical applications. This paper studies the convergence of a unified PCA and MCA algorithm via a corresponding deterministic discrete-time (DDT) system and some sufficient conditions to guarantee convergence are obtained. Simulations are carried out to further illustrate the theoretical results achieved. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
