Nevertheless,, interactive HPC entails a lot of new challenges that have to be solved - one of them addressing the fast and efficient data transfer between.a simulation back end and visualisation front end, as several gigabytes of data per second are nothing unusual for a simulation running on some (hundred) thousand cores. Here, a new approach based on a sliding window technique is introduced that copes with any bandwidth limitations and allows users to study both large and small scale effects of the simulation results in an interactive fashion.
