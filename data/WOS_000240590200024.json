In order to analyze the numerous executions that may happen while considering a set of synchronous systems whose clocks are non-perfect and that communicate through non-instantaneous channels, we define two new abstract domains. The Changes counting domain and the Integral bounding domain gap the imprecisions of the previously defined Constraint domain that occur because of these hardware imprecisions. We define a reduced product between these domains that allows a much more precise though sound analysis than the three analyses that may have been defined in each domain.", "paper_title": "Proving the properties of communicating imperfectly-clocked synchronous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240590200024"}
