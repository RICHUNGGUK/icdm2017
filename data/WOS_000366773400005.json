In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of CONNECTED INDUCED Pi-SUBGRAPH for decidable hereditary properties Pi, and give a nearly complete characterization in terms of whether Pi includes all complete graphs, all stars, and all paths. As a consequence, we obtain a complete characterization of the parameterized complexity of our problem when Pi is the family of H-free graphs for a fixed graph H with h >= 3 vertices: W[1]-hard if H is K-h, (K-h) over bar, or K-1,K-h-1; and FPT otherwise. Furthermore, we also settle the parameterized complexity of the problem for many well-known families Pi of graphs: FPT for perfect graphs, chordal graphs, and interval graphs, but W[1]-hard for forests, bipartite graphs, planar graphs, line graphs, and degree-bounded graphs.
