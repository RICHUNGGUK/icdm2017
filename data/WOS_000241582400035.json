However, there is a trade-off between generality and performance: larger bounds on the parameters yield worse time complexities. It is desirable to pay for more generality only by a constant factor in the running time, not by a larger degree of the polynomial. Algorithms with such a uniform polynomial time complexity are known as fixed-parameter algorithms. In this paper we determine whether or not fixed-parameter algorithms for constraint satisfaction exist, considering all possible combinations of the following parameters: the treewidth of primal graphs, the treewidth of dual graphs, the treewidth of incidence graphs, the domain size, the maximum arity of constraints, and the maximum size of overlaps of constraint scopes. The negative cases are subject to the complexity theoretic assumption FPT not equal W[1] which is the parameterized analog to P not equal NP. For the positive cases we provide an effective fixed-parameter algorithm which is based on dynamic programming on \"nice\" tree decompositions.", "paper_title": "Constraint satisfaction with bounded treewidth revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400035"}
