Both methods reach an optimal rate of convergence of the mean squared error of order O(n(-8/(8+d))), where d is the dimension of the underlying data set. In addition, they overcome the boundary effect and their values are always non-negative. Asymptotic properties like bias and variance are investigated. Moreover, the performance of both estimators is studied in Monte Carlo simulations and in two real data examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
