Driven by advanced Internet technologies and the growth of e-business activities, large amounts of information has already been created in XML format and stored in document management systems. However, many document management systems have not been fully utilizing XML structures to support effective document searching. In this paper, we discuss an efficient and effective approach to be layered on top of or embedded within a document management system in order to support searching XML documents with proximate querying based on structural similarity. As a core component, we propose a novel structural similarity measure and demonstrate it through extensive experiments that our measure brings significant improvement over previous methods, in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A novel structural similarity measure on XML data for integrated document management", "paper_id": "WOS:000249970500005"}
