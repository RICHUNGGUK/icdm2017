We encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall, synchronicity, no learning, and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems, a first-order extension of interpreted systems. We identify several monodic fragments of first-order temporal-epistemic logic and show their completeness with respect to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems.", "paper_title": "Interactions between Knowledge and Time in a First-Order Logic for Multi-Agent Systems: Completeness Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000308526200001"}
