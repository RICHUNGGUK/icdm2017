Three objectives are considered: (1) minimizing the maximum w'-weighted error; (2) minimizing the total w-weighted error subject to the constraint that the maximum w'-weighted error is minimized; (3) minimizing the maximum w'-weighted error subject to the constraint that the total w-weighted error is minimized. For these objectives, we give polynomial time algorithms with time complexity O(mn(4)), O(mn(4)) and O(kmn(4)), respectively, where k is the number of distinct w-weights. We also present alternative algorithms for the three objectives, with time complexity O(cmn(3)), O(cmn(3) + mn(4)) and O(kcmn(3)), respectively, where c is a parameter-dependent number.
