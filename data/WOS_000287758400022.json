This platform aims at unifying gene identifiers (ids) and performing gene set analysis. MADGene allows the user to perform inter-conversion of clone and gene ids over a large range of nomenclatures relative to 17 species. We propose a set of 23 functions to facilitate the analysis of gene sets and we give two microarray applications to show how MADGene can be used to conduct meta-analyses.", "paper_title": "MADGene: retrieval and processing of gene identifier lists for the analysis of heterogeneous microarray datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000287758400022"}
