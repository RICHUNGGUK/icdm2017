We call these transforms Polar Harmonic Transforms (PHTs). Unlike the well-known Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, the kernel computation of PHTs is extremely simple and has no numerical stability issue whatsoever. This implies that PHTs encompass the orthogonality and invariance advantages of Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, but are free from their inherent limitations. This also means that PHTs are well suited for application where maximal discriminant information is needed. Furthermore, PHTs make available a large set of features for further feature selection in the process of seeking for the best discriminative or representative features for a particular application.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Polar Harmonic Transforms for Invariant Image Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000277649100008"}
