This work addresses the optimal design (outfall locations) and optimal operation (level of oxygen discharges) of a wastewater treatment system. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a two-objective mixed design and optimal control problem with constraints on the states and the design and control variables. The two-objective problem is formulated as a single-objective problem through the use of the weighted sum method. The existence of the optimal solution is then demonstrated for an arbitrary set of weights and a first order optimality condition is obtained to characterize that solution. The numerical solution for a realistic case study posed in the ria of Vigo is also accomplished by using the combination of the control vector parametrization approach with a global non-linear programming (NLP) solver. Remark that, as the problem under consideration is two-objective, there is not an unique solution but a set of equivalent solutions, the Pareto solutions, requiring the involvement of a decision maker to select one solution from the set.
