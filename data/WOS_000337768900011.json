Cognitive scientists with varied backgrounds gathered in Berlin to report on and discuss expanding lines of research, spanning multiple fields but striving in one direction: to understand cognition with all its properties and peculiarities. A rich program featuring keynotes, symposia, workshops, and tutorials, along with regular oral and poster sessions, offered the attendees a vivid and exciting overview of where the discipline is going while serving as a fertile forum of interdisciplinary discussion and exchange. This report attempts to point out why this should matter to artificial intelligence as a whole.", "paper_title": "Report on the 35th Annual Cognitive Science Conference", "paper_id": "WOS:000337768900011"}
