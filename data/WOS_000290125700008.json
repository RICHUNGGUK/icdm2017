However, for normal 3D Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning, at least four receivers with an unblocked direct path to the transmitter are required. A requirement that is not always met. In this work, a novel method for TDOA positioning using only three receivers is presented. TDOA positioning with three receivers is possible by exploiting the knowledge of some of the indoor features, namely positions of big flat reflective surfaces, for example ceiling and walls. The proposed method was verified using data from a measurement campaign.", "paper_title": "TDOA UWB Positioning with Three Receivers Using Known Indoor Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700008"}
