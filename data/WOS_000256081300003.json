Biomechanical evaluations were performed on four polio patients by means of three-dimensional gait analyses and energy consumption studies. From the three-dimensional gait analysis on poliomyelitis patients, a considerable amount of knee flexion during the swing phase was observed in controlled-knee gait, which resulted in approximately 33% less energy consumption than in locked-knee gait. The developed electromechanical KAFO in this study was helpful in poliomyelitis patients having partial or complete paralysis of the lower extremity, providing both stability in the stance and free swinging of the knee. This unit was efficient in the transfer of energy.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical effect of electromechanical knee-ankle-foot-orthosis on knee joint control in patients with poliomyelitis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256081300003"}
