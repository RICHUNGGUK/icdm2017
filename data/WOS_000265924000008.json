In contrast to classical optical network design problems, it is typical of optical Grids that the destination of traffic (jobs) is not known beforehand. This leads to so-called anycast routing of jobs. For network dimensioning, this implies the absence of a clearly defined (source, destination)-based traffic matrix, since only the origin of Grid jobs (and their data) is known, but not their destination. The latter depends not only on the state of Grid resources, including network, storage, and computational resources, but also the Grid scheduling algorithm used. We present a phased solution approach to dimension all these resources, and use it to evaluate various scheduling algorithms in two European network case studies. Results show that the Grid scheduling algorithm has a substantial impact on the required network capacity. This capacity can be minimized by appropriately choosing a (reasonably small) number of server site locations: an optimal balance can be found, in between the single server site case requiring a lot of network traffic to this single location, and an overly fragmented distribution of server capacity over too many sites without much statistical multiplexing opportunities, and hence a relatively large probability of not finding free servers at nearby sites.", "paper_title": "On dimensioning optical grids and the impact of scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000265924000008"}
