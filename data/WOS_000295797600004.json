The authors first propose a broadcast-based infrastructure to address the challenges of efficient usages of composite M-services. They then define a few semantics for accessing broadcast based M-services and discuss the strategies of efficiently accessing M-services based on the semantics. The authors also propose several channel organization that are suitable for the broadcast-based M-service structure and provide analytical models for them. They conduct a comprehensive experimental study on the proposed access methods.", "paper_title": "Semantic-Based Access to Composite Mobile Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797600004"}
