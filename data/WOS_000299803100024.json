Successful numerical simulations are developed for the non-linear shear behavior of masonry joints and the non-linear behavior and ultimate strength of relatively weak Greek masonry piers; these are finally used, with the same materials and geometry, as infills in the R/C frames. A valid numerical model is proposed that can capture successfully the various observed non-linear response mechanisms that develop within the masonry infilled R/C frames when they are subjected to combined vertical and cyclic horizontal loads.
