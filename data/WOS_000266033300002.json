Targeting at this goal and jointly taking priority setting, fairness, and cross-layer design into account, four scheduling schemes designed for the QoS-oriented wireless LAN mainly based on concepts of deficit count and allowance are proposed in this paper to provide better QoS and fairness. Using multiple deficit count to interframe space (IFS) and allowance to IFS mappings for different priorities, enhanced distributed deficit round robin (EDDRR) and enhanced distributed elastic round robin (EDERR) schemes are designed to reduce (or even eliminate) possible collisions, while EDDRR with backoff interval and EDERR with backoff interval schemes still keep the backoff procedure but dynamically adjust backoff intervals for nonfailure events (the events excluding collisions and failed transmissions) depending on the priority setting and deficit count or allowance with a cross-layer design. Through extensive numerical examples, we show that the proposed schemes outperform the closest scheduling schemes in the literature and exhibit much better QoS as well as station-level and flow-level fairness.", "paper_title": "Design of Fair Scheduling Schemes for the QoS-Oriented Wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000266033300002"}
