To this end, optical packet/burst switching have been proposed, allowing more efficient use of the available fibre capacity. To resolve packet contention in the involved optical switches, Fibre Delay Lines (for delay assignment) and wavelength converters (for wavelength conversion) are used to reschedule the contending packets, by means of a scheduling algorithm. Existing algorithms are effective in minimizing packet loss when employed with an infinite number of converters, but generally perform poorly when the number of wavelength converters is small, as is the case in most switch prototype architectures. In this paper, several parametric cost-based scheduling algorithms for a limited number of wavelength converters are proposed that take scarcity of both FDLs and converters into account. Results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation show that these algorithms not only enable improved performance (in terms of packet loss probability), but also reduce the usage of the wavelength converters, and thus, the switch's overall energy consumption. The new algorithms are of the same implementation complexity as existing cost-based algorithms, and thus are of immediate value to switch designers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
