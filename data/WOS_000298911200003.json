In this paper, by using the information provided by the equality constraint, we transform the minimization problem with a single equality constraint in LS-SVM into an unconstrained minimization problem, then propose reduced formulations for LS-SVM. By introducing this transformation, the times of using conjugate gradient (CG) method, which is a greatly time-consuming step in obtaining the numerical solution, are reduced to one instead of two as proposed by Suykens et al. (1999). The comparison on computational speed of our method with the CG method proposed by Suykens et al. and the first order and second order SMO methods on several benchmark data sets shows a reduction of training time by up to 44%.
