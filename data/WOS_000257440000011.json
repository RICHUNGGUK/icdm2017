Unlike the multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) architecture, the new structure is insensitive to mismatch errors, and it does not reduce the stability of the loops. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Enhanced split-architecture delta-sigma ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000011"}
