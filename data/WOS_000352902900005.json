Individuals and small organizations can benefit from using state-of-the-art services and infrastructure, while large companies are attracted by the flexibility and the speed with which they can obtain the services. Service providers compete to offer the most attractive conditions at the lowest prices. However, the environmental impact and legal aspects of cloud solutions pose additional challenges. Indeed, the new cloud-related techniques for resource virtualization and sharing and the corresponding service level agreements call for new optimization models and solutions. It is important for computational intelligence researchers to understand the novelties introduced by cloud computing. The current survey highlights and classifies key research questions, the current state of the art, and open problems.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Evolutionary Computation for Resource Management of Processing in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000352902900005"}
