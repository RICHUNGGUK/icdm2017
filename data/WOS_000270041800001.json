We prove the universality of the QC(C), describe the underlying computational model and demonstrate that the QC(C) can be operated fault-tolerantly. In Sec. 2, we show that the QC(C) can be regarded as a simulator of quantum logic networks. In this way, we prove the universality and establish the link to the network model-the common model of quantum computation. We also indicate that the description of the QC(C) as a network simulator is not adequate in every respect. In Sec. 3, we derive the computational model underlying the QC(C), which is very different from the quantum logic network model. The QC(C) has no quantum input, no quantum output and no quantum register, and the unitary gates from some universal set are not the elementary building blocks of QC(C) quantum algorithms. Further, all information that is processed with the QC(C) is the outcomes of one-qubit measurements and thus processing of information exists only at the classical level. The QC(C) is nevertheless quantum-mechanical, as it uses a highly entangled cluster state as the central physical resource. In Sec. 4, we show that there exist nonzero error thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computation with the QC(C). Further, we outline the concept of checksums in the context of the QC(C), which may become an element in future practical and adequate methods for fault-tolerant QC(C) computation.", "paper_title": "MEASUREMENT-BASED QUANTUM COMPUTATION WITH CLUSTER STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000270041800001"}
