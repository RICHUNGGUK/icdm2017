The basic construction relies on three basic ingredients: a collection of time dependent completely positive maps, a completely positive trace preserving transformation and a waiting time distribution characterizing a renewal process. The relationship between this construction and a Lindblad dynamics is clarified by expressing the solution of a Lindblad master equation in terms of demixtures over different stochastic trajectories for the statistical operator weighted by suitable probabilities on the trajectory space.", "paper_title": "General structure of quantum collisional models", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900012"}
