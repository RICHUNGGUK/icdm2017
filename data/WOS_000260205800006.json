The function f is not known explicitly, but we show that it is strictly increasing and infinitely differentiable. Moreover, we give an explicit lower bound on f'(c). A key lemma is the following. Let PGW(lambda) denote a Galton-Watson tree having Poisson offspring distribution with parameter lambda Suppose that lambda* > lambda > 1. We show that PGW(lambda*) conditioned to survive forever stochastically dominates PGW(lambda) conditioned to survive forever.", "paper_title": "Growth of the Number of Spanning Trees of the Erdos-Renyi Giant Component", "paper_id": "WOS:000260205800006"}
