We investigate the analogue of the cop number for this game, which we call the lazy cop number. Lazy Cops and Robbers was recently introduced by Offner and Ojakian, who provided asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the lazy cop number of the hypercube. By coupling the probabilistic method with a potential function argument, we improve on the existing lower bounds for the lazy cop number of hypercubes.", "paper_title": "Lazy Cops and Robbers on Hypercubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362717800001"}
