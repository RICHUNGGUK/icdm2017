However, most of the existing OFDM peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes cannot be used in the OFDM-OQAM system directly. In this paper, a modified scheme called overlapped segmental clipping (OS-clipping) is proposed to deal with the high PAPR problem specifically in the OFDM-OQAM system. For the proposed OS-clipping scheme, the input signals are divided into a number of overlapped segments and then the clipping operation is processed on each segment. Simulation results show that the modified scheme used in the OFDM-OQAM system can provide better performance than conventional clipping scheme directly used in the OFDM-OQAM system, and even outperforms conventional clipping scheme applied in the OFDM system.", "paper_title": "Overlapped Segmental Clipping for the PAPR Reduction of the OFDM-OQAM system", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333200012"}
