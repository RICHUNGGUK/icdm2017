Some examples of the models used will be given to show how knowledge from around the world can be shared. The goal of this research is to provide new data-based Communication Models that can be used to achieve education with a global background. Our research has just begun, and we are currently working at the theoretical level. The models we discuss here will be examined in greater detail during the next stage of our work.", "paper_title": "Database, communication and creation - A research on cultural heritage-based educational models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900033"}
