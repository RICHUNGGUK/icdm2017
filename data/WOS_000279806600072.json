An objective function is formulated as a Conditional Random Field model, with terms assessing the consistency of faces with labels, and terms between labels of neighboring faces. The objective function is learned from a collection of labeled training meshes. The algorithm uses hundreds of geometric and contextual label features and learns different types of segmentations for different tasks, without requiring manual parameter tuning. Our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in results over the state-of-the-art when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark, often producing segmentations and labelings comparable to those produced by humans.", "paper_title": "Learning 3D Mesh Segmentation and Labeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600072"}
