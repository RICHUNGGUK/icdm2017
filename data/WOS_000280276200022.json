Our main result shows that if patterns may be mapped to words by arbitrary morphisms, then there exist infinite sets of words that do not have a descriptive pattern. This answers a question posed by Jiang et al. (Pattern languages with and without erasing, International Journal of Computer Mathematics 50 (1994)). Since the problem of whether a pattern is descriptive depends on the inclusion relation of so-called pattern languages, our technical considerations lead to a number of deep insights into the inclusion problem for and the topology of the class of terminal-free E-pattern languages.
