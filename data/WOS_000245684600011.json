Compared to conventional repeater insertion techniques, driver preemphasis saves repeater layout complexity and reduces power consumption by 12%-39% for data activity factors above 0.1. A driver circuit architecture using voltage-mode preemphasis technique was tested in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology for 10-mm long interconnects at 2 Gb/s.", "paper_title": "Voltage-mode driver preemphasis technique for on-chip global buses", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684600011"}
