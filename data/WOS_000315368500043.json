This methodology is based on the basic configuration of the flow directions structure in the DEM, which is stored in files where information about topological relations and other frequently used features are saved. Some basic functions for managing topological data that significantly simplify the source code programming are also presented and described. We develop an algorithm that runs the entire drainage network in a watershed in both directions, upwards and downwards, which is ideal for incorporating structural models of hydrological processes that occur in basins or assessing its characteristics. The main attribute of this method is that information about hydrological processes and properties is transmitted during the routing from one area to another of the basin. The information is used when developing models of these hydrological processes and transmitted throughout the basin. At the end of the article, using this methodology with the SHEE software is illustrated with some examples. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
