We study temporal coding with a desynchronizing mechanism, referred to as acceleration, that causes the units of the network to oscillate with higher phase velocity in case of stronger and/or more coherent input. Recently, it was demonstrated that combining synchronization with acceleration implies a competition for coherence that has a profound and favorable effect on the segmentation of overlapping patterns. Here, we demonstrate, first, an effect of coupling non-identical oscillators. Second, we discuss how including inhibitory couplings enforces the segmenting effect of acceleration. Third, we show how stronger couplings between the units of a pattern may support it in winning this competition for coherence. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
