The bridging approach has the benefits of syntactic methods: preserves structural relations and gives insights into the problem. Yet, it does not imply distance calculations and, thus, saves a non-trivial task-dependent design step. Instead it relies on statistical classification from many features. Our experiments concern a difficult problem of chemical toxicity prediction. The code and the data set are open-source. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
