In this paper, we propose a pipelined architecture using signed digit arithmetic for the VLSI efficient implementation of rotational radix-4 CORDIC algorithm, eliminating z path completely. A detailed comparison of the proposed architecture with the available radix-2 architectures shows the latency and hardware improvement. The proposed architecture achieves latency improvement over the previously proposed radix-4 architecture with a relatively small hardware overhead. The proposed architecture for 16-bit precision was implemented using VHDL and extensive simulations have been performed to validate the results. The functionally simulated net list has been synthesized for 16-bit precision with 90 nm CMOS technology library and the area-time measures are provided. This architecture was also implemented using Xilinx ISE9.1 software and a Virtex device. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
