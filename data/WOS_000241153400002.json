In this paper, a universal mathematical model of the JSS problem for apparel assembly process is constructed. The objective of this model is to minimize the total penalties of earliness and tardiness by deciding when to start each order's production and how to assign the operations to machines (operators). A genetic optimization process is then presented to solve this model, in which a new chromosome representation, a heuristic initialization process and modified crossover and mutation operators are proposed. Three experiments using industrial data are illustrated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve the JSS problem in a mixed- and multi-product assembly environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
