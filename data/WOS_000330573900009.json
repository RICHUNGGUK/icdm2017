The key point of this integration is the flat characteristic of the DC voltage of the CCC-HVDC, which provides the condition for the VSC to connect to the CCC DC link via a current regulator. The advantages of the proposed combined infeeding system are the requirement of only one DC line, and better dynamic responses. The structure of the proposed infeeding system, as well as its control system, is studied. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and its control strategy. Two other schemes for infeeding AC passive networks are studied to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Passive AC network supplying the integration of CCC-HVDC and VSC-HVDC systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330573900009"}
