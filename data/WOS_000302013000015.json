These approaches are based on the representation of the nonlinear system by a Takagi-Sugeno model. Two control laws are proposed requiring simultaneous estimation of the system states and of the occurring actuator faults. The first approach concerns the stabilization problem in the presence of actuator faults. In the second, the system state is forced to track a reference trajectory even in faulty situation. The control performance depends on the estimation quality; indeed, it is important to accurately and rapidly estimate the states and the faults. This task is then performed with an Adaptive Fast State and Fault Observer (AFSFO) for the first case, and a Proportional-Integral Observer (PIO) in the second. Stability conditions are established with Lyapunov theory and expressed in a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation to ease the design of FTC. Furthermore, relaxed stability conditions are given with the use of Polya's theorem. Some simulation examples are given in order to illustrate the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "NEW FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL STRATEGIES FOR NONLINEAR TAKAGI-SUGENO SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302013000015"}
