Enterprise risk management aims at minimizing the negative effects of uncertainty on the objectives, while at the same time promoting the potential positive effects. Process mining research has proposed a broad range of techniques and tools that could be used to effectively support the activities related to the different phases of risk management. This paper contributes to the process mining and risk management research by providing a full exploration of the applicability of process mining in the context of the eight components of the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The identified applications will be illustrated based on the risks involved in insurance claim handling processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
