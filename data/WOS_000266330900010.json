Error concealment (EC) techniques are often adopted at the decoder side to improve the quality of the reconstructed video. Under the conditions of a high rate of data packets that arrives at the decoder corrupted, it is likely that the incorrectly decoded macro-blocks (MBs) are concentrated in a connected region, where important spatial reference information is lost. The conventional EC methods usually carry out the block concealment following a lexicographic scan (from top to bottom and from left to right of the image), which would make the methods ineffective for the case that the corrupted blocks are grouped in a connected region. In this paper, a temporal error concealment method, adaptive error concealment order determination (AECOD), is proposed to recover connected corrupted regions. The processing order of an MB in a connected corrupted region is adaptively determined by analyzing the external boundary patterns of the MBs in its neighborhood. The performances, on several video sequences, of the proposed EC scheme have been compared with those obtained by using other error concealment methods reported in the literature. Experimental results show that the AECOD algorithm can improve the recovery performance with respect to the other considered EC methods.", "paper_title": "Recovering Connected Error Region Based on Adaptive Error Concealment Order Determination", "paper_id": "WOS:000266330900010"}
