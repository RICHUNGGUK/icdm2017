This paper concerns itself with the temporal aspect of the OSA. Over the years, a plethora of works have discussed the optimal access methods for the OSA environment. However, most of them have not considered the possible combination of a faster transmission rate and the assistance of a relay node in temporal spectrum sharing. In this paper, we affirm that the use of a faster transmission rate with the assistance of a relay (or relays) can be greatly beneficial in the temporal OSA environment. We propose a rate-relay adjustment scheme to dynamically exploit the nature of rate-relay. The scheme is composed of a receiver-based auto rate increase (R-ARI) scheme for rate adjustment, a relay selection scheme, and a rate limit scheme. The scheme takes into account the rate-relay adjustment and the PU activity factors. As demonstrated by simulation results, the use of a proper rate-relay adjustment scheme can lead to a gain in the secondary throughput and a lower primary collision percentage, as compared to the one hop optimal transmission rate scheme.", "paper_title": "Rate and relay diversity in temporal spectrum sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333232900007"}
