To this end, we determine the Euler method for both cases of H-differentiability. Also, the convergence of the proposed method is studied and the characteristic theorem is given for both cases. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method under generalized Hukuhara differentiability instead of suing Hukuhara differentiability.", "paper_title": "Euler method for solving hybrid fuzzy differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291253100001"}
