In this enterprise, a cognitive architecture is a domain-generic computational cognitive model that may be used for a broad multiple-level multiple-domain analysis of behaviour. It embodies generic descriptions of cognition in computer algorithms and programs. Developing cognitive architectures is a difficult but important task. In this paper, discussions of issues and challenges in developing cognitive architectures will be undertaken, and an example cognitive architecture (CLARION) will be described.", "paper_title": "The importance of cognitive architectures: an analysis based on CLARION", "paper_id": "WOS:000247086000004"}
