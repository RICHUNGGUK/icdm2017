More precisely, we prove that a team of two asynchronous agents, each endowed with a single identical pebble (that can be placed only on nodes, and with no more than one pebble per node), can locate the black hole in an arbitrary network of known topology; this can be done with I similar to(nlog n) moves, where n is the number of nodes, even when the links are not FIFO. These results are obtained with a novel algorithmic technique, ping-pong, for agents using pebbles.", "paper_title": "Ping Pong in Dangerous Graphs: Optimal Black Hole Search with Pebbles", "paper_id": "WOS:000298852300018"}
