They arise when the rate of change of a time-dependent process in its mathematical modeling is not only determined by its present state but also by a certain past state. Recent studies in such diverse fields as biology, economy, control and electrodynamics have shown that DDEs play an important role in explaining many different phenomena. In particular they turn out to be fundamental when ODE-based models fail. In this research, the solution of a delay differential equation is presented by means of a homotopy perturbation method and then some numerical illustrations are given. These results reveal that the proposed method is very effective and simple to perform. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
