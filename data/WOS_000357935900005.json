A mixed output feedback controller comprising of a static output feedback controller and a dynamic output feedback controller is developed for the system stabilisation. Based on the generalised Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) lemma, the frequency-domain inequalities can be converted into linear matrix inequalities which are numerically tractable. Compared with the existing full frequency approaches, better results are obtained. Moreover, the selection methods of the cut-off frequencies in both low and high frequency ranges are extensively studied with a view to reduce the conservativeness in output feedback control design. Simulation results suggest the asymptotic validity of the main results in this paper.", "paper_title": "Mixed output feedback of the finite frequency H-infinity control for singularly perturbed system", "paper_id": "WOS:000357935900005"}
