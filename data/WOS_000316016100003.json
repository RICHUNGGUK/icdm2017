However, it requires inductors in its output matching network that are inherently low Q components affecting efficiency and may require significantly large area in fully integrated implementation. In this paper a novel approach of implementing parallel circuit differential class-E amplifier is presented. Instead of using an inductor parallel to the transistor drain of each amplifier, a single capacitor at the single ended side of the balun provides the parallel inductance effect to the switching transistors. As a result, number of inductors required for circuit implementation is reduced which means reduced losses, less area and better tuning of reactance can be achieved. A test circuit is implemented in 0.13 mu m CMOS process. Measurement results verify the validity of the concept. The Power Amplifier achieves 22 dBm output power at 2.4 GHz from a 2.5 V with an overall Power Added Efficiency of 38 %.", "paper_title": "A parallel circuit differential class-E power amplifier using series capacitance", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100003"}
