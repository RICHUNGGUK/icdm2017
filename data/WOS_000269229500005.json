This method uses the molecular dynamics method of a generalized force model as a generation scheme to produce a microstructure with a pattern combining a variable aspect ratio and a variable microstructure orientation. This generation scheme can accommodate the needs of the subsequent optical design phase, and allows for easier optical optimization to reach the equal luminance condition. The scheme is incorporated into several new schemes to meet these needs, the most important of which is the cell division technique, which allows the adjustment of the microstructure density in each subdomain, or cell. In addition, the boundary treatments allow the precise control of the microstructure density in each cell and the ability to smooth the microstructure distribution across the cell boundary. Finally, we present an example of a backlight with one light emitting diode showing the integration of the generation scheme and the optical design phase in order to assess the validation of the proposed scheme.
