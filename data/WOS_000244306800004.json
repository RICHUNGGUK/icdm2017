There are four classes of connections identified in UMTS, which are the conversational, streaming, interactive, and background connections. To efficiently utilize radio bandwidth, the shared channel approach is proposed to deliver the packets for the interactive and background connections. This paper proposes a \"Shared-Channel Assignment and Scheduling\" (SCAS) algorithm to periodically allocate shared channels to serve interactive and background connections. We conduct formal mathematical proofs and simulation experiments to investigate the performance of the SCAS algorithm. We formally prove that with SCAS, a shared channel can be fully utilized (i.e., the utilization of a shared channel can be up to 100%) to serve the interactive connections. Our analysis indicates that compared with the previously proposed shared channel allocation and scheduling algorithms, there are less computation and communication overheads introduced in the SCAS algorithm. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that it is preferred to set up the Transmission Time Interval (TTI; that is, the unit of time interval for shared channel allocation) smaller to optimize the performance of the SCAS algorithm, including the shared channel utilization and the average waiting time of a connection before getting transmission service.", "paper_title": "Scheduling for time-division based shared channel allocation for UMTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000244306800004"}
