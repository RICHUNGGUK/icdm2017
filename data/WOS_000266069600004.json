Sensors are modeled using probability of detection. Due to environmental effects, this probability will not be constant over the entire region. We map this problem to a graph-search problem, and even though deterministic graph search is NP-complete, we derive a tractable optimal probabilistic search strategy. We do this by defining the problem as a dynamic game played on a Markov chain. We prove that this strategy is optimal in the sense of Nash. Simulations of an example problem illustrate our approach and verify our claims.", "paper_title": "Markovian Search Games in Heterogeneous Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000266069600004"}
