We argue that to refute the existence of such an asymptotically good family, it is sufficient to prove that the number of dual codewords of weight at most 3 is super-linear in the blocklength of the code and they are distributed \"naturally\". The main technical contribution of this paper is an improvement of the combinatorial lemma of Goldreich et al. (Comput Complex 15(3):263-296, 2006) which bounds the rate of 2-query locally decodable codes (LDCs) and is used in state-of-the-art rate bounds for linear LDCs. The lemma of Goldreich et al. bounds the rate of 2-query LDCs of blocklength n in terms of the corruption parameter delta(n)-this is the maximal fraction of corrupted codeword bits for which a (2-query) decoder can recover correctly every message bit (with high probability). Our combinatorial lemma gives non-trivial rate bounds for any corruption parameter delta(n) such that delta(n) . n = omega(1), whereas the previous lemma works only for corruption parameter delta(n) such that delta(n) . n >= log n. The study of LDCs with sublinear corruption parameter is also motivated by Dvir's (IEEE conference on computational complexity. IEEE Computer Society, pp 291-298, 2010) observation that sufficiently strong bounds on the rate of such LDCs imply explicit constructions of rigid matrices.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS LOWER BOUNDS ON LOCALLY TESTABLE CODES VIA DENSITY ARGUMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305119200004"}
