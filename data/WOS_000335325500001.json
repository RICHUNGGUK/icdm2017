However, collecting a lot of labeled training data in order to guarantee good performance requires much cost and time. For this reason, the semisupervised learning has been recently developed due to its superior performance despite using only a small amount of the labeled data. In this paper, we extend the standard support vector regression (SVR) to the semisupervised SVR by employing manifold regularization, which we call Laplacian SVR (LapSVR). The LapSVR is compared with the standard SVR and the semisupervised least square algorithm that is another recently developed semisupervised regression algorithm. The algorithms are evaluated for location awareness of multiple mobile robots in a WSN. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate location estimates than the other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Semisupervised Location Awareness in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Laplacian Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000335325500001"}
