Hydrogen bond coupling in sodium dihydrogen triacetate (SDHTA) is investigated as a model for the hydrogen bonded systems of the type O-H center dot center dot center dot O. The two-dimensional potential energy surface is derived from the full-dimensional one by selecting the relevant vibrational modes of the hydrogen bonds. The potential energy surfaces in terms of normal modes describing the anharmonic motion in the vicinity of the equilibrium geometry of SDHTA are calculated for the different species, namely, HH, HD, DH, and DD isotopomers. The ground state wave functions and their relation to the hydrogen bond structural parameters are discussed. It has been found that the hydrogen bonds in SDHTA are uncoupled, that is elongation of the deuterated hydrogen bond does not affect the non-deuterated one.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen bond coupling in sodium dihydrogen triacetate", "paper_id": "WOS:000340869400035"}
