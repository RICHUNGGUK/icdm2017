To develop, test and experiment on applied Artificial Intelligence, computer games are quickly becoming the ideal simulation test bed for the implementation of computer generated AI. The application of Artificial Intelligence algorithms create immersive game-play where human players can interact with non-player characters and interactions with the environment helps shape the way in which games are played. A-Star pathfinding utilizes a heuristic function implementing cost of moving through a virtual world, this actively affects how an agent responds to a situation and can alter its decision making. This paper describes the implementation of the A-Star algorithm combined with gameplay mechanics used to simulate multi-agent communication within a randomly generated game-world.", "paper_title": "Distribution of Artificial Intelligence in Digital Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000383757900001"}
