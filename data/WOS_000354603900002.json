While MCSs and related formalisms are inherently targeted for distributed settings, no truly distributed algorithms for their evaluation were available. We address this shortcoming and present a suite of such algorithms which includes a basic algorithm DMCS, an advanced version DMCSOPT that exploits topology-based optimizations, and a streaming algorithm DMCS-STREAMING that computes equilibria in packages of bounded size. The algorithms behave quite differently in several respects, as experienced in thorough experimental evaluation of a system prototype. From the experimental results, we derive a guideline for choosing the appropriate algorithm and running mode in particular situations, determined by the parameter settings.", "paper_title": "Distributed Evaluation of Nonmonotonic Multi-context Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354603900002"}
