However, most existing discretization methods cause inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can eliminate the inconsistencies caused during the course of discretization. The algorithm can be integrated into the discaretization algorithms that cannot avoid causing inconsistencies to eliminate the inconsistencies. Three data experimental results show that the algorithm is available.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for eliminating the inconsistencies caused during discretization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000018"}
