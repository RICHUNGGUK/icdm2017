The reasons why flow-awareness attracted so much attention are explained, and the current studies as well as the development history of the solutions are presented. The following features of the discussed architectures are compared: flow definition, classes of service, architecture, and signaling. Also, their pros and cons, complexity, and scalability, as well as perspectives are assessed.", "paper_title": "Flow Oriented Approaches to QoS Assurance", "paper_id": "WOS:000300322300005"}
