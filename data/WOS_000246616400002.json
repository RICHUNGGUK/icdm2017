Using a bioinspired methodology, we view an animal as a software agent, the foraging landscape as a spatial layout of temperature zones, and nutrients as errors between the desired and actual temperatures in the zones. Then, using foraging theory, we define a decision strategy for the agent that has an objective of reducing the temperature errors in order to track a desired temperature. We describe an implementation of a multizone temperature experiment, and show that the use of multiple agents defines a distributed controller that can equilibrate the temperatures in the zones in spite of interzone, ambient, and network effects. We discuss relations to ideas from theoretical ecology, and identify a number of promising research directions. It is our hope that the results of this paper will motivate other research on bioinspired methods based on behavioral ecology.", "paper_title": "Foraging theory for multizone temperature control", "paper_id": "WOS:000246616400002"}
