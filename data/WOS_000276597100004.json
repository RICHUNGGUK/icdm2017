We develop an operational semantics for a calculus of wireless systems. We present different Reduction Semantics and a Labelled Transition Semantics and prove correspondence results between them. Finally, we apply CWS to the modelling of the Alternating Bit Protocol, and prove a simple correctness result as an example of the kind of properties that can be formalized in this framework. A major goal of the semantics is to describe the forms of interference among the activities of processes that are peculiar of wireless systems. Such interference occurs when a location is simultaneously reached by two transmissions. The Reduction Semantics differ on how information about the active transmissions is managed. We use the calculus to describe and analyse a few properties of a version of the Alternating Bit Protocol. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
