In the nursing area, this technology is highly suitable due to the ubiquity in this profession. In this paper, we present a new version of Medea, a mobile system that provides storing the evolution of patients from handheld devices using the nursing viewpoint. Medea is relied on the Need Theory of Virginia Henderson, as patient valuation model, and the nursing taxonomies of NANDA, NIC and NOC, as patient care plan. In addition, the vital signs of patients have been integrated in the mobile application. The main complementary innovation of Medea is an expert system based on fuzzy temporal rules, which suggests diagnoses, interventions and outcomes from the patient valuation and the vital signs. This model takes into account the importance of the data and temporal dimension in the patient symptoms. Furthermore, the complexity of the nursing domain has been synthesized in a few concepts, which make possible the creation of rules in an easy way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
