In this paper, a new computing architecture - computing power services (CPS) - has been applied to utilize web services and business process execution language for overcoming the issues about flexibility, compatibility and workflow management. CPS is a lightweight web services based computing power-sharing architecture, and suitable for enterprise computing tasks which can be executed in the batch processes within a trusty network. However, a real-time load balance and dispatching mechanism is needed for distributed-computing architecture like CPS in order to handle computing resources efficiently and properly. Therefore, a fuzzy group decision-making based adaptive collaboration design for CPS is proposed in this paper to provide the real-time computation coordination and quality of service. In this study, the approach has been applied to analyze the robustness of digital watermark by filter bank selection and the performance can be improved in the aspect of speedup, stability and processing time. This scheme increases the overall computing performance and shows stability for the dynamic environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
