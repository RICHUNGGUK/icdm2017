However, traditional solutions based on packet sampling do not provide the flexibility required for these applications. For example, operators are often interested in observing as many unique flows as possible; however, random packet sampling is inherently biased towards large flows. Operators may also be interested in increasing the fidelity of flow measurements for a certain class of flows; such flexibility is lacking in today's packet sampling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called CLAMP that provides an efficient framework to implement class-based sampling. At the heart of CLAMP is a novel data structure we propose called composite Bloom filter (CBF) that consists of a set of Bloom filters working together to encapsulate various class definitions. In particular, we show the flexibility and efficacy of CLAMP by implementing a simple two-class size-based sampling. We also consider different objectives such as maximizing flow coverage and improving the accuracy of certain class of flows. In comparison to previous approaches that implement simple size-based sampling, our architecture requires substantially lower amounts of memory (up to 80x) and achieves higher flow coverage (up to 8x more flows) under specific configurations.
