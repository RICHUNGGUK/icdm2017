These include methods based on distances, centroid point, coefficient of variation, and weighted mean value. However, there is still no method that can always give a satisfactory result to every situation; some are counterintuitive and not discriminating. This paper presents an approach for ranking fuzzy numbers with integral value that is an extension of the index of Liou and Wang. This method, that is independent of the type of membership function used, can rank more than two fuzzy numbers simultaneously. This ranking method use an index of optimism to reflect the decision maker's optimistic attitude, but rather it also contains an index of modality that represents the neutrality of the decision maker. The approach is illustrated with numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A modification of the index of Liou and Wang for ranking fuzzy number", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351600002"}
