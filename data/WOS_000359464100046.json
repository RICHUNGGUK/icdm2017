A key challenge in designing three-party PAKE protocols is to prevent insider dictionary attacks, as evidenced by the flaws discovered in many published protocols. In this letter, we revisit Abdalla and Pointcheval's three-party PAKE protocol from FC 2005 and demonstrate that this protocol, named 3PAKE, is vulnerable to a previously unpublished insider offline dictionary attack. Our attack is dependant on the composition of 3PAKE and the higher-level protocol that uses the established session key.", "paper_title": "An Offline Dictionary Attack against Abdalla and Pointcheval's Key Exchange in the Password-Only Three-Party Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100046"}
