Because of the high computational complexity of ECC functions, dedicated hardware architecture is essential to provide sufficient ECC performance. Besides, crypto-ICs are vulnerable to side-channel information leakage because the private key can be revealed via power-analysis attacks. In this paper, a new heterogeneous dual-processing-element (dual-PE) architecture and a priority-oriented scheduling of right-to-left double-and-add-always EC scalar multiplication (ECSM) with randomized processing technique are proposed to achieve a power-analysis-resistant dual-field ECC (DF-ECC) processor. For this dual-PE design, a memory hierarchy with local memory synchronization scheme is also exploited to improve data bandwidth. Fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS technology, a 0.4-mm(2) 160-b DF-ECC chip can achieve 0.34/0.29 ms 11.7/9.3 mu J for one GF(p)/GF(2(m)) ECSM. Compared to other related works, our approach is advantageous not only in hardware efficiency but also in protection against power-analysis attacks.", "paper_title": "Efficient Power-Analysis-Resistant Dual-Field Elliptic Curve Cryptographic Processor Using Heterogeneous Dual-Processing-Element Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000329067400005"}
