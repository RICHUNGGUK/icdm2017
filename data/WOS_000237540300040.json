The benefit of this approach is that individuals accessing the filtered context cannot detect the presence of filtering, namely, filtering becomes imperceptible. This new approach is used as a basis for designing, implementing and evaluating a collaborative privacy-enhanced alibi phone, allowing user to imperceptibly conceal surrounding ambient sound from callers, while leaving callers unaware of this filtering.", "paper_title": "A collaborative privacy-enhanced alibi phone", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300040"}
