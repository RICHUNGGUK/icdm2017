Whereas standard Memetic Algorithms use local search methods to improve the evolutionary solutions, and thus fail when the local method stops working on the complete problem, the Divide-and-Evolve approach splits the problem at hand into several, hopefully easier, sub-problems, and can thus solve globally problems that are intractable when directly fed into deterministic OR algorithms. But the most prominent advantage of the Divide-and-Evolve approach is that it immediately opens up an avenue for multi-objective optimization, even though the OR method that is used is single-objective. Proof of concept approach on the standard (single-objective) Zeno transportation benchmark is given, and a small original multi-objective benchmark is proposed in the same Zeno framework to assess the multi-objective capabilities of the proposed methodology, a breakthrough in Temporal Planning.", "paper_title": "Divide-and-evolve: A new memetic scheme for domain-independent temporal planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228000021"}
