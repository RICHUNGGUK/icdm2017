The frequency hopping sequence sets and frequency hopping sequences obtained in this paper can be optimal with respect to the Peng-Fan bound and Lempel-Greenberger bound, respectively. Further, the length of sequences in the optimal frequency hopping sequence sets can be any odd integer larger than 3. Some of them have new parameters.", "paper_title": "Optimal Frequency Hopping Sequences of Odd Length", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500043"}
