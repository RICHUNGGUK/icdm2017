QoE-based transport optimizations attempt to look for optimal solutions to provide the best overall user experience for a group of users to leverage constrained network bandwidth. However, the design of these optimizations varies widely. An attractive idea is to deploy these optimizations together and expect more gains. In this article, we describe the interworking of several optimization approaches to analyze the feasibility of one single framework combining different approaches. We provide a first design of the joint framework that best leverages the advantage of each optimization approach.", "paper_title": "Analyzing the Combination of Different Approaches for Video Transport Optimization for Next Generation Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316809400003"}
