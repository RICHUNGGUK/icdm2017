A mixed method of code frequencies, coherence graphs, interviews, and a survey was used. The results revealed that the TeachNet debates included more cognitive presence codes that indicate higher levels of cognitive processing than in SL debates. The teams were significantly different from each other in the collaboration style for developing arguments and in the ways to use utterances associated with cognitive, social, and teaching presences, and the groups' collaboration style became more established with more experience with the tasks. The three critical factors-tool, tasks and group cohesion-that affect cognitive, teaching, and social presence are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
