However, these similarity functions are not equally applicable across all situations. Consequently, comparative analyses have been performed on the basis of different sets of fuzzy number pairs. In this paper we thoroughly review the similarity functions proposed in the literature, identify their properties and possible drawbacks and compare them on the basis of an extended set of fuzzy numbers.", "paper_title": "Similarity functions for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers: An improved comparative analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900031"}
