The simulator utilises boundary element (BE) technology to develop real-time realistic deformable models of the brain. The simulator incorporates the simulation of surgical prodding, pulling and cutting. Advanced features include the separation the cut surfaces by retractors and postcutting deformations. The experience of virtual surgery is enhanced by implementing 3D stereo-vision and the use of two hand-held force-feedback devices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
