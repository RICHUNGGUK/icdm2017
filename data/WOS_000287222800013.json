Design/methodology/approach - Adjoint variable method is employed to evaluate the sensitivity of individuals in evolutional processes. Findings - It is shown in the numerical examples, where the present method is applied to optimization of a superconducting energy storage system and C-shape magnet, that robust solutions are actually obtained which are insensitive to deviations in spatial sizes. Originality/value - Unlike usual optimization methods, the present method takes into account deviation in the design parameters due to production errors and long-term changes. Moreover, the present method is limited to about twice the computational cost of non-robust optimization methods.", "paper_title": "A robust optimization based on adjoint variable method", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800013"}
