A new routing protocol is presented according to the study on the influence of low-energy nodes in ad hoc networks. The novel routing protocol (energy sensing routing protocol, ESRP) is based on the energy sensing strategy. Multiple strategy routing and substitute routing are both adopted in this paper. Referring to the level of the residual energy and the situation of energy consumption, different routes are chosen for packets transmission. The local maintenance is adopted, which can reduce packets retransmission effectively when the link breaks. We focus on the network lifetime most in all performances. The evaluation is done in comparison with other routing protocols on NS2 platform, and the simulation results show that this routing protocol can prolong the network lifetime and balance energy consumption effectively.", "paper_title": "Energy and Link-State Based Routing Protocol for MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619600010"}
