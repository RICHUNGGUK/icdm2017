Design teams often provide the knowledge involving multiple disciplines in natural language at conceptual design stage. As a result, conflicts often arise during communications. To increase the efficiency of design process, it is necessary to avoid interpretation conflicts. This article presents a system framework to resolve terminology conflicts. First, a semantic hierarchical structure of knowledge is proposed. Knowledge is decomposed into terms and predicates. Second, a fuzzy knowledge fusion framework is proposed to identify and resolve terminology conflicts. The conflict is resolved by unifying the usage of terminologies. By using the fuzzy linguistic computational model based on extension principle to measure the similarity of terms, the terminology conflict problem is converted into a linguistic decision-making problem. Finally, the methodology is applied to a piece of automotive electronics knowledge. The best term to describe electronic control unit is identified.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Knowledge Fusion Framework for Terms Conflict Resolution in Concurrent Engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000290851700005"}
