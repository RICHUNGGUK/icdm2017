Thomas relating the structure of a concurrent system of interacting genes (represented by a signed directed graph called a regulatory graph) with its dynamical properties. We prove that the results in [10] are stable under projection, and this enables us to relax the assumptions under which they are valid. More precisely, we relate here the presence of a positive (resp. negative). circuit in a regulatory graph to a more general form of biological differentiation (resp. of homeostasis).", "paper_title": "On differentiation and homeostatic behaviours of boolean dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243595000008"}
