The graph P(k) denotes a path on k vertices. The l-COLORING problem is the problem to decide whether a graph can be colored with at most l colors such that adjacent vertices receive different colors. We show that 4-COLORING is NP-complete for P(8)-free graphs. This improves a result of Le, Randerath, and Schiermeyer, who showed that 4-COLORING is NP-complete for P(9)-free graphs, and a result of Woeginger and Sgall, who showed that 5-COLORING is NP-complete for P(8)-free graphs. Additionally, we prove that the precoloring extension version of 4-COLORING is NP-complete for P(7)-free graphs, but that the precoloring extension version of 3-COLORING can be solved in polynomial time for (P(2) + P(4))-free graphs, a subclass of P(7)-free graphs. Here P(2) + P(4) denotes the disjoint union of a P(2) and a P(4). We denote the disjoint union of s copies of a P(3) by sP(3) and involve Ramsey numbers to prove that the precoloring extension version of 3-COLORING can be solved in polynomial time for sP(3)-free graphs for any fixed s. Combining our last two results with known results yields a complete complexity classification of (precoloring extension of) 3-COLORING for H-free graphs when H is a fixed graph on at most 6 vertices: the problem is polynomial-time solvable if H is a linear forest; otherwise it is NP-complete.
