Our simulations take place in a recurrent network of spiking neurons with inhomogeneous synaptic weights. A spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule is combined with its \"opposite\", the \"anti-STDP\". A local regulation mechanism moreover maintains the postsynaptic neuron in the vicinity of a reference frequency, which forces the global dynamics to be maintained in a softly disordered regime. This approach is tested on a simple discrimination task which requires short-term memory: temporal pattern classification. We show that such temporal patterns can be categorised, and present tracks for future improvements. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
