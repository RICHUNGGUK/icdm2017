Experimental results on some artificial datasets and real-world datasets are provided, together with the comparisons between SFLS and other neighborhood-based classification methods, including nearest neighbor (NN), k-NN, NFL and some refined NFL methods. etc. It can be concluded that SFLS is a simple yet effective classification approach.
