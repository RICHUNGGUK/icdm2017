New algorithms are developed for minimization of structural compliance considering constraints on volume and buckling load factors. The SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) material model is employed and nodal relative densities are used as topology design variables. A new approach based on the eigenvalue shift and pseudo mode identification is proposed for eliminating the effect of pseudo buckling modes. Two-phase optimization algorithms are also proposed for achieving better optimized designs. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
