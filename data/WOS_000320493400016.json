In this article, conflicts in airport surface operations are defined, along with a methodology to model and analyze airport surface constraints. The conflict detection and resolution logic take advantage of properties of complex conflict networks for effective conflict detection and resolution. It is demonstrated and validated with the case of a modeled Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. Further research will also include validation of the conflict detection and resolution logic with real airport surface operations data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
