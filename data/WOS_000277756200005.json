We propose a categorization of 3D visualizations and, based on this categorization, evaluate two versions of a space-time cube that show discrete spatiotemporal data. The two visualization techniques used are a head-tracked stereoscopic visualization ('strong 3D') and a static monocular visualization ('weak 3D'). In terms of effectiveness and efficiency the weak 3D visualization is as good as the strong 3D and thus the need for advanced 3D visualizations in these kinds of tasks may not be necessary.
