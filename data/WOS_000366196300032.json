One of our significant contributions is to discover the critical role played by the conductance-based features for the successful prediction of virality. More specifically, we show that the second derivative of the conductance gives an early indication of whether the hashtag is going to go viral or not. We present a detailed experimental evaluation of the effect of our various categories of features on the virality prediction task. When compared to the baselines and the state-of-theart techniques proposed in the literature our feature set is able to achieve significantly better accuracy on a large dataset of 7.7 million users and all their tweets over a period of month, as well as on existing datasets.", "paper_title": "On the role of conductance, geography and topology in predicting hashtag virality", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300032"}
