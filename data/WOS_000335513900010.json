As extensions of the LP bound, we introduce novel general techniques proving formula size lower bounds, named a quasi-additive bound and the Sherali-Adams bound. While the Sherali-Adams bound is potentially strong enough to give a lower bound matching to the rectangle bound, we prove that the quasi-additive bound can surpass the rectangle bound. We also reveal that the quasi-additive bound is potentially strong enough to prove the matching formula size lower bound.", "paper_title": "BREAKING THE RECTANGLE BOUND BARRIER AGAINST FORMULA SIZE LOWER BOUNDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335513900010"}
