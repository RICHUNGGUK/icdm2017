The problem can be stated as follows: Given a Web page P consisting of n component items d(1), d(2),...,d(n) and each of the component items d(i) having J(i) versions d(i1), d(i2),... d(ut), for each component item d(i) select one of its versions to compose the Web page such that the fidelity function is maximized subject to the bandwidth constraint. We formulate this problem as a linear multi-choice knapsack problem (LMCKP). This paper transforms the LMCKP into a knapsack problem (KP) and then presents a dynamic programming method to solve the KP. A numerical example illustrates this method and shows its effectiveness.
