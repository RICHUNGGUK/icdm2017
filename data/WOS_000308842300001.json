They are characterized by separate layers of visible and hidden units, which are able to learn efficiently a generative model of the observed data. We study a \"hybrid\" version of RBMs, in which hidden units are analog and visible units are binary, and we show that thermodynamics of visible units are equivalent to those of a Hopfield network, in which the N visible units are the neurons and the P hidden units are the learned patterns. We apply the method of stochastic stability to derive the thermodynamics of the model, by considering a formal extension of this technique to the case of multiple sets of stored patterns, which may act as a benchmark for the study of correlated sets. Our results imply that simulating the dynamics of a Hopfield network, requiring the update of N neurons and the storage of N (N - 1)/2 synapses, can be accomplished by a hybrid Boltzmann Machine, requiring the update of N P neurons but the storage of only NP synapses. In addition, the well known glass transition of the Hopfield network has a counterpart in the Boltzmann Machine: it corresponds to an optimum criterion for selecting the relative sizes of the hidden and visible layers, resolving the trade-off between flexibility and generality of the model. The low storage phase of the Hopfield model corresponds to few hidden units and hence a overly constrained RBM, while the spin-glass phase (too many hidden units) corresponds to unconstrained RBM prone to overfitting of the observed data.
