Its center frequency, pole frequency, and gain are electronically programmable to accommodate both Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) and Terrestrial Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (T-DMB). The proposed solution avoids employing capacitor and resistor arrays leading to a compact design (0.51 mm(2)). It adopts minimum number of amplifiers for maintaining relatively low power consumption (2.55 mW). The experimental results obtained from a 0.18-mu m digital CMOS process show that the proposed design achieves spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of better than 65 dB and image rejection ratios of more than 38 dB.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Compact Polyphase Channel-Select Filters for Multistandard Broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500030"}
