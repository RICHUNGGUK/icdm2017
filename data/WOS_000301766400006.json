So the imbalanced data problem will arise in the field of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) prediction. In this article, we introduce two ensemble methods to solve the imbalanced data problem. These ensemble methods combine the based-cluster under-sampling technique and the fusion classifiers. And then we evaluate the ensemble methods using a dataset from Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) with 10-fold cross validation. All the prediction models achieve area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value about 95%. Our results show that the ensemble classifiers are quite effective in predicting PPIs; we also gain some valuable conclusions on the performance of ensemble methods for PPIs in imbalanced data.
