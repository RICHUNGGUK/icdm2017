As result traffic is becoming one of important problems in big cities in all over the world. Some of the traffic concerns are congestions and accidents which have caused a huge waste of time, property damage and environmental pollution. This research paper presents a novel intelligent traffic administration system, based on Internet of Things, which is featured by low cost, high scalability, high compatibility, easy to upgrade, to replace traditional traffic management system and the proposed system can improve road traffic tremendously. The Internet of Things is based on the Internet, network wireless sensing and detection technologies to realize the intelligent recognition on the tagged traffic object, tracking, monitoring, managing and processed automatically. The paper proposes an architecture that integrates internet of things with agent technology into a single platform where the agent technology handles effective communication and interfaces among a large number of heterogeneous highly distributed, and decentralized devices within the IoT. The architecture introduces the use of an active radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor technologies, object ad-hoc networking, and Internet-based information systems in which tagged traffic objects can be automatically represented, tracked, and queried over a network. This research presents an overview of a framework distributed traffic simulation model within NetLogo, an agent-based environment, for IoT traffic monitoring system using mobile agent technology.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Traffic Information System Based on Integration of Internet of Things and Agent Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000357579200006"}
