In 1991, Jozsef Beck was the first to demonstrate that a constructive variant can be given under certain more restrictive conditions, starting a whole line of research aimed at improving his algorithm's performance and relaxing its restrictions. In the present article, we improve upon recent findings so as to provide a method for making almost all known applications of the general Local Lemma algorithmic.", "paper_title": "A Constructive Proof of the General Lovasz Local Lemma", "paper_id": "WOS:000274379800007"}
