The present contribution only focuses on sequences in which the first step consists of a Michael addition. Recent developments of these new useful methodologies valuable for the selective construction of highly functionalized heterocycles of high synthetic value are surveyed.", "paper_title": "Current developments in Michael addition-based Multicomponent domino reactions involving 1,3-dicarbonyls and derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000238548900003"}
