Therefore, frequency spectrum must be efficiently utilized, as available frequency spectrum is limited. This paper proposes a channel allocation scheme with efficient bandwidth reservation, which initially reserves some channels for handoff calls, and later reserves the channels dynamically, based on the user mobility. The direction of user mobility may not be straight always, but the user may also go left, right or backwards. Thus, QoS can be improved, if the channel reservation is made based upon the user mobility and the location of the user. We devise here a new algorithm that deals with multiple traffic systems by modifying the existing DDCA algorithm [Krishna, P.V., Iyengar, N.Ch.S.N., 2008. Optimal channel allocation algorithm with efficient channel reservation for cellular networks. International journal of Communication Networks and Distributed Systems 1 (1), 33-51]. This algorithm reserves more channels for hot cells, less number of channels for cold cells and an average number of channels for the medium cells. Furthermore, we maintain queues for all types of calls. We model the system by a three-dimensional Markov Chain and compute the QoS parameters in terms of the blocking probability of originating calls and the dropping probability of handoff calls. The results indicate that the proposed channel allocation scheme exhibits better performance by considering the above mentioned user mobility, type of cells, and maintaining of the queues for various traffic sources, In addition, it can be observed that our approach reduces the dropping probability by using reservation factor.(C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
