Specifically the mutual information between a stochastic signal and a pure jump Levy process whose rate function depends on the signal is expressed in terms of a filtering error and the rate of change of this mutual information with respect to a parameter multiplying the rate function of the Levy process is expressed in terms of a smoothing error. These results generalize the analogous mutual information results for some Gaussian noise processes with additive stochastic signals.", "paper_title": "Mutual Information for Stochastic Signals and Levy Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100002"}
