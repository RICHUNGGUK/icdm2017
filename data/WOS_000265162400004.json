The method is devised based on the cross-entropy (CE) concept. Simulations comparing the new method with some widely used normalization techniques show that the proposed approach can achieve about 0.2 similar to 0.3 dB coding gain improvement on average while reducing up to about 1/2 similar to 2/3 iteration for decoding, but require much fewer and simpler computations.
