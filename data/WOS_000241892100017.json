This paper proposes an ant algorithm, called Direct Ant Colony Optimization (DACO), for the function optimization problem in continuous domain. In DACO, artificial ants generate solutions according to a set of normal distribution, of which the characteristics are represented by pheromone modified by ants according to the previous search experience. Experimental results show the advantage of DACO over other ACO based algorithms for the function optimization problems of different characteristics.", "paper_title": "Application of ACO in continuous domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100017"}
