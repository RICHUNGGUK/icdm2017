With this model, the capacity of the system for voice only users, data users only and mixed services is obtained. It is noticed that increasing the cell radius from 400 to 800 m reduces the uplink capacity for voice and data services. It is shown that the synchronous WCDMA will increase the uplink capacity by 16.9%. For the nonfading case. the uplink capacity is 12.5% higher than the uplink capacity with a fading channel.
