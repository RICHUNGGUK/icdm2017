It is the first concentration protocol for single-photon entangled states and it dose not require the two parties of quantum communication to know the accurate information about the coefficient alpha and beta of the less entangled states. Also, it does not resort to sophisticated single-photon detectors, which makes this protocol more feasible in current experiments. Moreover, it can be iterated to get a higher efficiency and yield. All these advantages maybe make this protocol have more practical applications in long-distance quantum communication and quantum internet.internet", "paper_title": "SINGLE-PHOTON ENTANGLEMENT CONCENTRATION FOR LONG-DISTANCE QUANTUM COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000276214700007"}
