Besides some factors such as contrast, texture and noise that affect the quality of the composition, color harmony between fore-and background is also an important factor that would affect the quality of the composition. However, in the previous image composition techniques, color harmony between fore-and background is seldom considered. In this paper, an optimization method is proposed to deal with the color harmonization problem that used in image composition. A cost function is derived from the local smoothness of the hue values, and the image is harmonized by minimizing the cost function. A new matching cost function is proposed to select the best matching harmonic schemes. Our approach overcomes several shortcomings of the existing color harmonization methods. We validate the performance of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with a variety of experiments.", "paper_title": "IMAGE COMPOSITION WITH COLOR HARMONIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000308321000003"}
