The knowledge for these methods has been transferred from design processes and methods used in the design of aircraft flight control systems to establish a modelling and design process for assessing the controllability of buildings. The paper describes a holistic approach to the modelling of the nonlinear and linear dynamics of the integrated building and its systems. This model is used to analyse the controllability of the building using Nonlinear Inverse Dynamics controller design methods used in the aerospace and robotics industry. The results show that this design approach can help the architects in their decisions on which building design and services to use. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how the same method can assist the control systems designer in developing complex control systems especially for buildings designed with a climate adaptive building (CAB) philosophy.
