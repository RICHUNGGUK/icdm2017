Live cell imaging is the process of non-invasively analyzing dynamic processes in living cells using state-of-the-art microscopy and computer vision techniques. Live cell imaging research provides exciting and novel insights into cell biology. In this paper, we present an overview of live cell imaging research and detail the role of computational image processing in live cell imaging.", "paper_title": "Live cell imaging: a computational perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118600003"}
