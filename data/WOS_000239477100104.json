In such a situation-based learning environment, the availability of enough appropriate learning situations is crucial for success. However, we experienced that often a collaborative usage of the system does not result in a large number of these critical situations. This paper introduces the idea of situation creators, intelligent agents who intentionally create specific situations for learners, into our 3D real-time simulation environment. These created situations challenge a learner much more and force him to react in order to master the driving knowledge.", "paper_title": "Using agents to create learning opportunities in a collaborative learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100104"}
