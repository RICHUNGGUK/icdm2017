Hence, pulsed latches are a promising option to reduce power for high-performance circuits. In this paper, to save power and compensate for timing violations, we fully utilize the intrinsic time borrowing property of pulsed latches and consider clock gating during pulsed-latch replacement. Experimental results show that our approach can generate very power efficient results.", "paper_title": "Pulsed-Latch Replacement Using Concurrent Time Borrowing and Clock Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000314677400007"}
