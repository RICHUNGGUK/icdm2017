To assure high-yield of data from busy clinicians, the design objectives included low response burden, the ability to collect complex real-time data in dynamic work environments, and automated data integration. Iterative user-centered design of custom interfaces resulted in a dynamic intuitive platform where branching logic was applied to present a series of survey questions dependent on the participant's responses. Over a 12-month period, 304 inpatient physicians and nurses completed (with minimal initial training) a total of 11,381 survey responses. For randomly timed repeated survey prompts, complete (73%) or partial (12%) responses were obtained in a median time of 96 s. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
