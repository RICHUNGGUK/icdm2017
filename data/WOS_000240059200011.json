Universal verifiability is a highly desirable property when signed documents need to be permanently non-repudiable so as to prevent dishonest signers from disavowing signatures they have produced. As a practical solution, we construct a new signature scheme where a valid signature should be generated by a couple of distinct signing keys. In the random oracle model, the signature scheme is provably secure in the sense of existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen message attacks assuming the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in the Gap Diffie-Hellman groups.", "paper_title": "How to generate universally verifiable signatures in ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240059200011"}
