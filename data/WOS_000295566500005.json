Dealing with unregistered image inputs, our task is to address at the same time SP identification, and detection of special soldering errors, called scooping. For this reason we introduce a novel Hierarchical Marked Point Process (HMPP) framework, which is able to handle the paste and scooping extraction problems simultaneously, so that the SPs and included scoops have a parent-child relationship. A global optimization process attempts to find the optimal configuration of entities, considering the observed data, prior knowledge, and interactions between the neighboring circuit elements. The proposed method is evaluated on a real PCB image set containing more than 3000 SPs and 600 scooping artifacts. A morphology-based baseline method is also introduced for the problem and used as reference for qualitative and quantitative comparison against the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
