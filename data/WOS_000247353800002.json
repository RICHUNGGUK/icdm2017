This problem generalizes many important Arc Routing Problems and also has some interesting real-life applications. The Branch & Cut method presented here is based on a cutting-plane algorithm that identifies violated inequalities of several classes of facet-inducing inequalities for the corresponding polyhedron. The whole procedure has been tested over different sets of instances and is capable of solving to optimality large-size instances of several routing problems defined on undirected, mixed, and windy graphs.
