A low-complexity interference mitigation technique is proposed to combat the effect of interference, which offers the potential for improved performance especially when high power jammers affect the reception. For practical implementation, an integrated navigation-communication network architecture is proposed, composed by an assistance network to aid code synchronization and an interference management system, augmenting the GNSS local component to enhance the system quality of service. Accordingly, an overall assistance network is proposed to estimate the interference characteristics and broadcast them to conventional terminals along with a rough time and frequency reference to improve code acquisition performance. Analytical and simulated results are provided, in the presence of binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation, showing the clear potential of assistance GNSS to significantly improve performance and reduce terminal complexity at the same time.", "paper_title": "Integrated NAV-COM Systems: Assisted Code Acquisition and Interference Mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469700006"}
