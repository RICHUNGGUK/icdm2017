The definitions of signatures and of signature trees are first given. Original operators on signatures are next presented, i.e., contraction, extension, pruning, addition, multiplication, and grafting. Attractive applications of signatures related to the modelling of fuzzy inference systems are suggested and discussed. An example is included to accompany the theoretical results.
