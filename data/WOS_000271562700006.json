Based on a study of cross boundary derivatives (those of S-patches are deduced herein), G(g)-continuity between all the above surfaces and the primary planar faces is achieved by a novel trick as a first step: assigning the vertex, some edge points and some face points to be the proper control points. This still leaves enough free parameters usable for changing the blending configuration. The new algorithm is illustrated with two practical examples involving miscellaneous vertices up to 6-edge convex-concave. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
