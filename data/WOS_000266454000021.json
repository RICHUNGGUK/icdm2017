The high-order spectral difference solver is based on unstructured quadrilateral grids. High-order curved wall boundary representation is developed for cylinders. Nine different spacings (center-to-center distance/diameter s = 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7. 2, 2.5, 3, 3.4 and 4) are investigated. The simulation results are compared to experimental results and other numerical results. As s increases, single bluff-body, flip-flopping, anti-symmetric and symmetric wake patterns are predicted.
