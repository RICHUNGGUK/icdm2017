To meet community needs for on-demand access while also maximizing global availability and runtime efficiency, the authors propose service-, container-, node-, and VO- level provisioning approaches based on a highly available dynamic deployment infrastructure. Their experiments with an image-processing application demonstrate their approach's efficiency and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Provisioning for dynamic instantiation of community services", "paper_id": "WOS:000253543000006"}
