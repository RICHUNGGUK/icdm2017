Inspired by the local tangent space alignment algorithm in [16] for nonlinear dimensionality reduction of manifolds, we propose a novel patch-learning method using locally affine patch mapping (LAPM) to solve the SR problem. This approach maps the patch manifold of low-resolution image to the patch manifold of the corresponding high-resolution (HR) image. This patch mapping is learned by a training set of pairs of LR/HR images, utilizing the affine equivalence between the local low-dimensional coordinates of the two manifolds. The latent HR image of the input (an LR image) is estimated by the HR patches which are generated by the proposed patch mapping on the LR patches of the input. We also give a simple analysis of the reconstruction errors of the algorithm LAPM. Furthermore we propose a global refinement technique to improve the estimated HR image. Numerical results are given to show the efficiency of our proposed methods by comparing these methods with other existing algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
