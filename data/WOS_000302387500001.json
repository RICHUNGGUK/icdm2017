We show that this temporal logic is expressively complete for the metric predicate logic Q2MLO, which is expressive, decidable and easy to use. In particular the Pnueli modalities P-n (X-1, ... , X-n), \"there is an increasing sequence t(1), ... , t(n) of points in the unit interval ahead such that t(i) satisfies X-i\", are definable in TL(U,S) with the counting modalities.
