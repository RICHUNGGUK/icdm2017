Necessary and sufficient conditions are given in the continuously differentiable case. The theory is applied to linear coarse grainings arising from partitioning the population space of a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA). Cases considered include proportional selection, binary tournament selection, ranking selection, and mutation. A nonlinear coarse graining for ranking selection is also presented. A number of results concerning \"form invariance\" are given. Within the context of GAs, the primary contribution made is the illustration of a technique by which coarse grainings may be analyzed. It is applied to obtain a number of new coarse graining results. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Differentiable coarse graining", "paper_id": "WOS:000240221500007"}
