In this paper, we present and evaluate OPENS DWN, a novel WiFi architecture based on an SDN/NFV approach. OPENSDWN exploits datapath programmability to enable service differentiation and fine-grained transmission control, facilitating the prioritization of critical applications. OPENS DWN implements per-client virtual access points and per-client virtual middleboxes, to render network functions more flexible and support mobility and seamless migration. OPENSDWN can also be used to out-source the control over the home network to a participatory interface or to an Internet Service Provider.", "paper_title": "Programming the Home and Enterprise WiFi with OpenSDWN", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200023"}
