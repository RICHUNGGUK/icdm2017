Specifically, CSI is not only beneficial to improve the capacity of the legitimate channel, but also can be used to degrade the performance of the eavesdropper channel. Thus, the secrecy rate increases accordingly. This letter focuses on the quantitative analysis of the ergodic secrecy sum-rate in terms of feedback amount of the CSI from the legitimate users in multiuser multi-antenna downlink networks. Furthermore, the asymptotic characteristics of the ergodic secrecy sum-rate in two extreme cases is investigated in some detail. Finally, our theoretical claims are confirmed by the numerical results.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis for Physical Layer Security in Multi-Antenna Downlink Networks with Limited CSI Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000010"}
