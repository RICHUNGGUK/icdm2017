So far, less discussion has been carried out for NCS from the view point of CPS. In this letter, the NCS with short delay is analyzed with cyber-physical integration. The sampling rate is depicted as one of the states in the state equations. The simulation results show that the cyber-physical integration not only adjusts the sampling rate to the states of the controlled physical system, but also adapts to the delay of the network. The averaged sampling rate and the stabilization time are smaller compared with the traditional NCS.", "paper_title": "Networked Control System with Delay Adaptive Cyber-Physical Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300022"}
