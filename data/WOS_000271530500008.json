In this regard first we introduce the notion of compatibility and strong compatibility in multialgebras and then we study congruences on multialgebras as a generalization of congruences in ordinary algebras. We investigate some of the important properties of lattices of congruences and strong congruences of multialgebras.", "paper_title": "Congruences of Multialgebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000271530500008"}
