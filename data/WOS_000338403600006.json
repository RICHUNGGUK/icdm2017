The proposed method is based on optimality criteria, but does not require gradient information and handles discrete variables. Based on benchmarking studies, FCD produces superior quality solutions to optimality criteria (>4%), but inferior to heuristic methods (<2%). FCD is approximately 10 x less computationally efficient than optimality criteria and 100x more efficient than heuristic methods. We present a successful industry application of FCD that yields cost savings of 19% compared to conventional design methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
