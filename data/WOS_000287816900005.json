A global cardinality constraint is an additional requirement that prescribes how many variables must be assigned a certain value. We study the complexity of the problem CCSP(Gamma), the constraint satisfaction problem with global cardinality constraints that allows only relations from the set Gamma. The main result of this paper characterizes sets Gamma that give rise to problems solvable in polynomial time, and states that the remaining such problems are NP-complete.", "paper_title": "THE COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL CARDINALITY CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287816900005"}
