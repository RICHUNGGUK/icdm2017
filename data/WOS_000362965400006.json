This problem can be formulated as a complex set covering problem. Compared to the classical set covering problems, the coverage area of each BS is unknown in advance. This makes that the selection of each BS location and configuration parameters is determined by the location and configuration parameters of the neighbor BSs. Accordingly, we will conduct a competition and cooperation model based on the re-covered area of the BSs to measure the relationship of the BSs. Then, an efficient genetic operation based on this model is proposed to generate new-quality solutions. Further, four BS configuration parameters, i.e., the antenna height, antenna tilt, sector orientation and pilot signal power, are taken into account as well. Since there are too many combination levels of the configuration parameters, an encoding method based on orthogonal design is presented to reduce the search space. Subsequently, we merge the proposed encoding method and genetic operation into the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) to solve the WCDMA network planning problem. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed encoding and genetic operation in comparison with the existing counterpart.", "paper_title": "Optimal WCDMA network planning by multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with problem-specific genetic operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362965400006"}
