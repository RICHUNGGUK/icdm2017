Some basic results from the area of finite time and practical stability are extended to linear, continuous, fractional order time-delay systems given in state-space form. Sufficient conditions of this kind of stability are derived for particular class of fractional time-delay systems. A numerical example is given to illustrate the validity of the proposed procedure.
