Its language features modal operators for obligation and permission, and for the realization of individual and collective actions. The logic is non-classical since it makes use of a paraconsistent and paracomplete negation connective. Moreover, it is non-monotonic due to its definition within the adaptive logics framework for defeasible reasoning. The logic is equipped with a defeasible proof theory and semantics.", "paper_title": "Non-monotonic reasoning with normative conflicts in multi-agent deontic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000345830800003"}
