Recent research has shown that OWL (Web Ontology Language) has a serious limitation on data types and does not support customized data types and predicates. Some work has been carried out to address this issue in crisp situations. In order to deal with fuzzy information in the Semantic Web, this paper proposes a new kind of fuzzy description logic F-SHIQ(G), which can support not only the representation and reasoning of fuzzy concept knowledge, but also fuzzy data information with customized fuzzy data types and customized fuzzy data type predicates. The syntax, semantics and reasoning algorithm of the F-SHIQ(G) are investigated in the paper, and its decidability, soundness, completeness and complexity of the reasoning algorithm are discussed in the paper also. For the reasoning for F-SHIQ(G), the paper adopts a traditional reasoning architecture for fuzzy data type reasoning and as a result, new fuzzy data type reasoners can be added without changing the fuzzy concept reasoner.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy description logic F-SHIQ(G)", "paper_id": "WOS:000336491200002"}
