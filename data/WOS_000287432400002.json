Minimization of the number of Steiner points is a common goal for three-dimensional boundary recovery. In this paper, this goal is achieved by using an enhanced Steiner point suppression procedure and introducing a small polyhedron reconnection operation. Combining the suppression procedure with Steiner point insertion and splitting, a complete three-dimensional constrained boundary recovery algorithm is presented, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in various numerical examples.
