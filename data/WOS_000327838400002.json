The paper describes a model that has been conceived for the development, maintenance and navigation of adaptive hypermedia systems. This model, called SEMantic, systemic and evolutionary model to develop HyPermedia systems (SEM-HP), includes an incremental design process, a layered architecture and an authoring tool integrated with a navigation tool. SEM-HP architecture is composed of four subsystems, which allow the separation of aspects related to knowledge representation, presentation, navigation and user adaptation. In addition, SEM-HP has a higher layer, which acts as a meta-system and allows a consistent evolution of the elements defined in each of the four subsystems, as well as their automatic co-evolution. Regarding user interaction, four alternative ways of navigating hypermedia information are supported. Finally, the paper shows the main results of two case studies carried out with the authoring and navigation tool, JSEM-HP, at the University of Granada, Spain.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary authoring tool for adaptive hypermedia with multimodal navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327838400002"}
