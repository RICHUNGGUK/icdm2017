Despite the well-known problems, mobile phone users often prefer thumb-based input method in their daily context of use. Without understanding input performance under realistic variability, design solutions may not address the problems adequately. This research aims to evaluate performance of one-handed thumb-based input compared to cradled finger-based input for the large number of users and varying task conditions. By investigating performance under a range of user-and task-variability, common patterns can be identified to help infer realistic performance in context of use. For this experiment, 259 participants were recruited balanced on gender and age. They performed user testing of moving an icon on a mobile touch-screen. Overall, the one-handed thumb input showed a 30% reduction in throughput compared to the cradled finger-based input, with significant reduction in speed and accuracy. Reduced throughput is attributed to inaccuracy rather than speed. In addition, the partial effects of touch position, dragging direction, and target size were investigated and quantified. In conclusion, performance could maintain constant throughput only for the finger-based input of limited task conditions, when realistic variability was introduced. Also, high variance of throughput for the thumb-based input led to poor conformity to Fitts's law. The findings have implications for design of thumb-based touch interface to offset performance reduction and characterizing performance measure for thumb-based input method.", "paper_title": "Performance Comparisons Between Thumb-Based and Finger-Based Input on a Small Touch-Screen Under Realistic Variability", "paper_id": "WOS:000366280200002"}
