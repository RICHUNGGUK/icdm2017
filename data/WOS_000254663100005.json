This process is characterized by currents directly induced inside the molten glass and by the cooling of all the crucible walls. In addition, a mechanical stirring device is used to homogenize the molten glass. This paper presents a global modelling of coupled phenomena that take place within the glass bath. Design/methodology/approach - Electromagnetic, thermal and hydrodynamic phenomena are modelled. The aim of this study is to develop strategy of coupled modelling between these aspects. The thermohydrodynamic calculations are achieved with the Fluent software (distributed by Fluent France) and the electromagnetic aspects are solved by the OPHELIE program based on integral methods (developed in EPM laboratory). Findings - Two configurations are considered: the first deals with thermal convection in an unstirred bath and the second takes into account the mechanical stir-ring. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that repartition of the joule power density within the molten glass is supposed to be not perturbed by the intrusive elements like the thermocouples or the stirrer. This assumption allows us to perform only axisymmetric calculations of induction effect. Originality/value - This paper present different strategy of coupling the thermohydrodynamic and direct induction phenomena taken place in the molten glass.", "paper_title": "Strategy of coupling to model physical phenomena within molten glass bath heated by direct induction", "paper_id": "WOS:000254663100005"}
