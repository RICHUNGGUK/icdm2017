In this paper, we propose an improved color separation method using fuzzy membership for feature implementation and a neural network for feature classification. In addition, we choose HLS color coordination. The HLS includes hue, light, and saturation. There are the most human-like color recognition elements. A proposed color recognition algorithm is applied to a line order detection system of harness. The detection system was designed and implemented as a testbed to evaluate the physical performance. The proposed color separation algorithm is tested with different kinds of harness line.", "paper_title": "Natural color recognition using fuzzification and a neural network for industrial applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300145"}
