The phenomenon of multistability and the nature of this circuit family systems are the key-points which lead to the explanation of this coexistence. For the need of this work, the most representative circuit of this circuits' family, the Chua oscillator, is used. Simulation results confirm this universality in the class of Chua's circuit family.", "paper_title": "AN UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON IN MUTUALLY COUPLED CHUA'S CIRCUIT FAMILY", "paper_id": "WOS:000332115500013"}
