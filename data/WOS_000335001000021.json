Its main purpose is to facilitate the quality control of a large number of such files before meta-analysis. Alternatively, it can be used by individual cohorts to check their own result files. QCGWAS is flexible and has a wide range of options, allowing rapid generation of high-quality input files for meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.", "paper_title": "QCGWAS: A flexible R package for automated quality control of genome-wide association results", "paper_id": "WOS:000335001000021"}
