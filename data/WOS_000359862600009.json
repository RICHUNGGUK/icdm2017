Thanks to the presence of the shunt capacitors, the effective capacitance of the line is enhanced, and the phase velocity of the structure can be made significantly smaller than the one of the unloaded line. The target is to achieve the layout of the slow-wave structure able to provide the required slow-wave ratio, characteristic (Bloch) impedance and electrical length (i.e., the usual specifications in the design of slow-wave transmission lines). To this end, a two-step synthesis method, based on the aggressive space mapping (ASM) algorithm, is proposed for the first time. Through the first ASM algorithm, the circuit schematic providing the target specifications is determined. Then, the second ASM optimizer is used to generate the layout of the structure. To illustrate the potential of the proposed synthesis method, three application examples are successfully reported. The two-step ASM algorithm is able to provide the layout of the considered structures from the required specifications, without the need of an external aid in the process.
