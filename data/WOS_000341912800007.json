If each is a convex polygon with at most vertices, then we show that the expected complexity of the union is . Our bounds hold in a more general model in which we are given an arbitrary multi-set of expansion radii, each a non-negative real number. We assign them to the members of by a random permutation, where all permutations are equally likely to be chosen; the expectations are now with respect to these permutations. We also present an application of our results to a problem that arises in analyzing the vulnerability of a network to a physical attack.", "paper_title": "Union of Random Minkowski Sums and Network Vulnerability Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000341912800007"}
