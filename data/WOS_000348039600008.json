However, current activation functions can not propagate error using gradient descent efficiently with the increment of the number of hidden layers. Current activation functions, e.g. sigmoid, have large saturation regions which are insensitive to changes of hidden neuron's input and yield gradient diffusion. To relief these problems, we propose a bi-firing activation function in this work. The bi-firing function is a differentiable function with a very small saturation region. Experimental results show that deep neural networks with the proposed activation functions yield faster training, better error propagation and better testing accuracies on seven image datasets.", "paper_title": "Bi-firing deep neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348039600008"}
