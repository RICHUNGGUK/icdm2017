The connection can be used to transfer decidability and undecidability results for important computational properties like reachability from one formalism to the other. Furthermore, it can be viewed as a vehicle to apply tools based on rewriting for the simulation and validation of specifications given in Mobile Ambients.", "paper_title": "Reachability analysis of fragments of mobile ambients in AC term rewriting", "paper_id": "WOS:000257204500004"}
