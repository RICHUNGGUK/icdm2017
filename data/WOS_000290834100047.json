The mathematical model of the flow is based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow in 3D with explicit algebraic Reynolds stress turbulence model (EARSM). The mathematical model is solved by artificial compressibility method with implicit finite volume discretization. The channels have constant square or circular cross-section, where the hydraulic diameter is same in order to enable comparison between these numerical simulations. First, developed flow in a straight channel of square cross-section is presented in order to show the ability of the used EARSM turbulence model to capture secondary corner vortices, which are not predicted by eddy viscosity models. Next the flow through channels with perpendicular branch is simulated. Methods of setting the flow rate are discussed. The numerical results are presented for two flow rates in the branch.
