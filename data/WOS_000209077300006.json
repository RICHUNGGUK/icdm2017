The non-membership of IFS is constructed with three different viewpoints viz., optimistic, pessimistic, and mixed. These constructions along with their indeterminacy factors result in S-shaped membership functions in the fuzzy counterparts of the intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming models. The solution methodology of Yang et al. [45], and its subsequent generalization by Lin and Chen [33] are used to compute the optimal solutions of the three fuzzy linear programming models.
