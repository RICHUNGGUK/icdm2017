First, an informal user specification for the coordinated operation of two vehicles is introduced. Second, a formal representation of the objects and relations of interest is presented, and the user requirements are mapped onto a formal specification. Third, the specification is transformed onto a control problem formulation. Finally, the problem is solved using techniques from dynamic optimization and generalizations of the problem are discussed.", "paper_title": "A set-valued framework for coordinated motion control of networked vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000244781300013"}
