Chen etal. proposed a secure and efficient protocol, based on a protocol proposed by Yang etal., which is resistant to guessing attacks on networks from which users' secret keys are easy to obtain. However, their scheme is time-consuming in the phases of ticket issuing and authentication. Furthermore, a malicious attacker can utilize the expired time, Texp, to launch a denial of authentication (DoA) attack, which is a type of denial of service attack. Because Texp is exposed to any user, it would be easy to launch a DoA attack that could make the scheme impractical. To resist against DoAs that the scheme of Chen etal. might suffer, we propose an improved scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography in this paper. Our scheme not only reduces time cost but also enhances security. The basis of the proposed scheme is the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. The operations of points of an elliptic curve are faster and use fewer bits to achieve the same level of security. Therefore, our scheme is more suitable for mobile devices, which have limited computing power and storage.
