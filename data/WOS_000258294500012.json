However, many real-world applications have a limited set of alternative services to choose from. The authors have developed a rule-based parameterization technique to convert components into reconfigurable services. Further, they have developed QoS analysis and decision-making techniques to select reconfigurable as well as regular services to compose the system.", "paper_title": "QoS-reconfigurable Web Services and compositions for high-assurance systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258294500012"}
