In this paper, a systematical, efficient HEVC decoding solution on general processors is provided, consisting of structure-level, data-level, and task-level approaches. First, a redesigned overall structure of a HEVC decoder with data redundancy reduction mechanism is introduced, which cuts down basic data operation cost and achieves an average decoding speedup of compared to the HM 10.0 decoder. On this basis, novel single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) algorithms such as low-complexity motion compensation, transpose-free transform, symmetric deblocking filter, and parallel-index sample adaptive offset are developed, which further parallelize the data operations of each decoding task and bring another decoding speedup. Finally, a frame-based task-level parallel framework is employed with a flexible entry scheme to efficiently support the simultaneous processing of multiple decoding tasks for different HEVC parallel strategies. The overall solution achieves decoding fps of 40-75 for 4k HEVC videos on the Intel i7-2600 3.4 GHz quad-core processor (4-thread decoding) and 35-55 for 720p videos on the ARM Cortex-A9 1.2 GHz duo-core processor (2-thread decoding). This proposal is the recommended cross-platform HEVC decoding solution of Intel, AMD, and Cisco, and has provided HEVC service to over 1500 million people in China via the Xunlei Kankan video client.", "paper_title": "Novel Efficient HEVC Decoding Solution on General-Purpose Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720300010"}
