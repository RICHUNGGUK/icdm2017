We utilize this approach to prove new results and also to derive some known results about biased Maker-Breaker games. In particular, we show that for b = o (root n), Maker can build a pancyclic graph (that is, a graph that contains cycles of every possible length) while playing a (1 : b) game on E(K-n). As another application, we show that for b = Theta (n/ln n), playing a (1 : b) game on E(K-n), Maker can build a graph which contains copies of all spanning trees having maximum degree Delta = O(1) with a bare path of linear length (a bare path in a tree T is a path with all interior vertices of degree exactly two in T).
