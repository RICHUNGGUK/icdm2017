This paper addresses these shortcomings and proves them through mathematical proofs instead of providing counter-examples. Applying our analyses will help other authors avoid some common errors when building their own ranking index functions. We use Asady's ranking index function (2010) as an example when we present our arguments and proofs and provide fully detailed analyses of two of the ranking index functions herein. Based on these analyses, an algorithm for detecting inconsistencies in ranking results is proposed, and numerical examples are given to illustrate our arguments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
