Two distributed control protocols are proposed under fixed undirected communication topology and fixed directed communication topology. Some sufficient conditions are obtained for the states of followers converging to the state of virtual leader globally exponentially. Rigorous proofs are given by using graph theory, matrix theory and Lyapunov theory. Simulations are also given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Distributed leader-following consensus for second-order multi-agent systems with nonlinear inherent dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363900007"}
