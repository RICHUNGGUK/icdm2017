The modulator consists of a series-shunt inductor peaking predriver stage and a multicascode postdriver stage. The postdriver stage integrates the proposed inductive intrinsic parasitic feedback network, the interstage series inductor-peaking scheme, and the auxiliary source degeneration structure. The chip is fabricated in 0.13-mu m mixed-signal 1P8M standard CMOS process with a die size of 900 x 800 mu m(2). The operation data rate of this design is measured up to 20-Gb/s with 3.7 V-PP S.E. output amplitude swing, driving 50-Omega resistive load with input signal less than 250 mV. The measured rise/fall time of the output electrical eye diagram is less than 20 ps and the total power consumption is 0.9 W with 1.2/4.0 V dual supplies.", "paper_title": "20-Gb/s CMOS EA/MZ Modulator Driver With Intrinsic Parasitic Feedback Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124200003"}
