Traditional cylinder detection methods cannot be applied directly due to the high computational complexity. In this paper, we explore the structural characteristics of point cloud in pipeline plants and define a structure feature. Based on the structure feature, we propose a hierarchical structure detection and decomposition method that reduces the difficult pipeline-plant reconstruction problem in IR3 into a set of simple circle detection problems in IR2. Experiments with industrial applications are presented, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed structure detection method.", "paper_title": "Cylinder Detection in Large-Scale Point Cloud of Pipeline Plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000323473800009"}
