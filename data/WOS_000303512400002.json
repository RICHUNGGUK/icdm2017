In this paper, the existence of a 4-SCGDD of type m(n) is determined for any even integer m, with some possible exceptions. A complete asymptotic existence result for k-SCGDDs of type m(n) is also obtained for all larger k and odd integer m. All these SCGDDs are used to derive new 2-D OOCs with the AM-OPPW restriction, which are optimal in the sense of their sizes.", "paper_title": "Semicyclic4-GDDs and related two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000303512400002"}
