J. Shin elaborates the diagrammatic logic of Peirce's Existential Graphs. Particularly, she provides translations from Existential Graphs to first order logic. Unfortunately, her translation is not in all cases correct. In this paper, the translation is fixed by means of so-called single object ligatures.", "paper_title": "Fixing shin's reading algorithm for Peirce's Existential Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625600009"}
