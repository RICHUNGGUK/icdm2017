The proposed protocol suite addresses several practical issues that arise when nodes equipped with two radio interfaces want to utilize available channels. The routing layer makes a hybrid channel assignment where one interface is fixed and the other is switchable. Based on that, the routing layer runs a shortest path routing algorithm augmented with channel diversity. The link layer implements a slotted structure to minimize broadcast overhead inherent to multi-channel networks. By using flow- and packet-level simulators, we make some important observations. First, a hybrid channel assignment is good for connectivity and amenable to shortest-path routing. Second, seeking a shortest-path can be a better routing strategy in terms of global system throughput than complex channel-diverse routing. Third, channel switching delay is not a throttling factor in terms of global system throughput.
