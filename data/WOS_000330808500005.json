The effects of this movement on the accuracy of CTP analysis has not been studied previously. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of head movement on CTP analysis summary maps using simulated phantom data. A dynamic digital CTP phantom dataset of 25 time frames with a simulated infarct volume was generated. Head movement was simulated by specific translations and rotations of the phantom data. Summary maps from this transformed phantom data were compared to the original data using the volumetric dice similarity coefficient (DSC). DSC for both penumbra and core strongly decreased for rotation angles larger than approximately 1A degrees, 2A degrees, and 7A degrees for, respectively, pitch, roll, and yaw. The accuracy is also sensitive for small translations in the z-direction only. Sudden movements introduced larger errors than gradual movement. These results indicate that CTP summary maps are sensitive to head movement, even for small rotations and translations. CTP scans with head movement larger than the presented values should be interpreted with extra care.", "paper_title": "The effect of head movement on CT perfusion summary maps: simulations with CT hybrid phantom data", "paper_id": "WOS:000330808500005"}
