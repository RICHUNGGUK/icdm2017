The feasible solution set is determined and compared with some common results in the literature. A necessary and sufficient condition and three other necessary conditions are presented to conceptualize the feasibility of the problem. It is shown that in general a lower bound is always attainable for the optimal objective value. Moreover, we prove that the optimal solution of the problem is obtained if the problem is defined by a non-decreasing or non-increasing function. An algorithm is presented to summarize the process and an example is described to illustrate the algorithm. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
