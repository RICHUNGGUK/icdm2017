Manipulation difficulty is also increased by nonintuitive crane-control interfaces. This paper describes a new interface that allows operators to drive a crane by moving a hand-held device (wand or glove) freely in space. A crane-mounted camera tracks the movement of the hand-held device, the position of which is used to drive the crane. Two control architectures were investigated. The first uses a simple feedback controller, and the second uses feedback and an input shaper. Two operator studies demonstrate that hand-motion crane control is faster and safer than using a standard push-button pendent control.", "paper_title": "Using Machine Vision and Hand-Motion Control to Improve Crane Operator Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000310147000016"}
