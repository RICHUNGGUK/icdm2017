A data relocation scheme that merges multiple banks to lower the area requirement and power dissipation of memory-based FFT architectures is proposed. The proposed memory-addressing method can effectively deal with singleport, merged-bank memory with high-radix processing elements. Compared with conventional memory-based FFT designs using dual-port memory, the derived architecture has better performance in terms of area and power consumption. The proposed scheme is extended to a cached-memory FFT architecture to further reduce power dissipation. An 8192-point cached-memory FFT processor is implemented for digital video broadcasting-terrestrial/handheld applications by using 0.18-mu m 1P6MCMOS technology. Experimental results show that the proposed memory scheme consumes 10.1%-29.3% less area and 9.6%-67.9% less power compared with those of the multibank design.", "paper_title": "Efficient Memory-Addressing Algorithms for FFT Processor Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500017"}
