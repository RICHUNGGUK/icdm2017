The integration reduces relative deviation among the cumulative plots so that the classical analytical procedure of defining the area between the plots as the total travel time can be applied. For quartile estimation, a slicing technique is proposed. The methodology is validated with real data from Lucerne, Switzerland and it is concluded that the travel time estimates from the proposed methodology are statistically equivalent to the observed values.", "paper_title": "Fusing Loop Detector and Probe Vehicle Data to Estimate Travel Time Statistics on Signalized Urban Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292367900004"}
