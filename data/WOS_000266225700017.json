These techniques are based on the addition to the original data matrix of the matrix of the Mahalanobis distances from the class centroids (or of the leverages, or of other distances). Then, the classical techniques of classification and class modeling are applied to the blocks of the predictors (original, added), separately or after fusion. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
