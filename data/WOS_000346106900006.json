For irregularity indices IRM1(G) and IRM2(G) of trees, unicyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic graphs, upper bounds as a function of vertex number n are given. Moreover, it has been proved, that if the Zagreb indices inequality M-2(G)/m >= M(1)G)/n is fulfilled for a connected graph G, then the relation IRM2(G)/m >= IRM(1)G)/n holds for G, as well. Tests performed on the sets of dual graphs of C-66 fullerene isomers verified that the topological invariant IRM2 has a good discriminatory power and can be successfully applicable to the stability prediction of fullerenes.", "paper_title": "An Analogue of Zagreb Index Inequality Obtained from Graph Irregularity Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900006"}
