With the distributed computing paradigm gaining more support and attention investigation of new models for distributed decision support systems is an important direction of research. This paper looks to expand the recently introduced model for situated DSS to address distributed and coordinated decision support. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, a prototypical application for lead time management has been implemented. Simulation experiments have been conducted to investigate the impacts of real-time information and information coordination on decision performance. Overall, the results support our expectation that both information delay and information coordination have significant impacts on decision performance.", "paper_title": "A FRAMEWORK FOR SITUATED DISTRIBUTED DECISION SUPPORT", "paper_id": "WOS:000290288300004"}
