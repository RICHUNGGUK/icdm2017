This data structure answers range reporting queries in time O(log n log log n + k log(epsilon) 2n/k+1) for any epsilon > 0 and k the size of the answer. Our data structure also supports emptiness and one-reporting queries in time O(log n log log n). The model of computation used in this paper is a unit-cost RAM model.", "paper_title": "A LINEAR SPACE DATA STRUCTURE FOR ORTHOGONAL RANGE REPORTING AND EMPTINESS QUERIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264215900001"}
