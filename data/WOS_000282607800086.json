Since measuring similarity between data objects is simpler than mapping data objects to data points in feature space, these pairwise similarity based clustering algorithms can greatly reduce the difficulty in developing clustering based pattern recognition applications. A web-based image clustering system has been developed to demonstrate and show the clustering power and significance of the proposed methods. Synthetic numerical data and real-world image collection are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on the prototype system. As shown as the web-demonstration, the proposed method, variance enhanced K-medoid model, groups similar images in clusters with various variances according to the distribution of image similarity values.
