As input, it requires a selection of model predictions, such as Higgs masses, branching ratios, effective couplings and total decay widths. HiggsBounds 2.0.0 then uses the expected and observed topological cross section limits from the Higgs searches to determine whether a given parameter scenario of a model is excluded at the 95% C.L. by those searches. Version 2.0.0 represents a significant extension of the code since its first release (1.0.0). It includes now 28/53 LEP/Tevatron Higgs search analyses, compared to the 11/22 in the first release, of which many of the ones from the Tevatron are replaced by updates. As a major extension, the code allows now the predictions for (singly) charged Higgs bosons to be confronted with LEP and Tevatron searches. Furthermore, the newly included analyses contain LEP searches for neutral Higgs bosons (H) decaying invisibly or into (non-flavour tagged) hadrons as well as decay-mode independent searches for neutral Higgs bosons. LEP searches via the production modes tau(+)tau H- and b (b) over barH, and Tevatron searches via t (t) over barH. Also, all Tevatron results presented at the ICHEP'10 are included in version 2.0.0. As physics applications of HiggsBounds 2.0.0 we study the allowed Higgs mass range for model scenarios with invisible Higgs decays and we obtain exclusion results for the scalar sector of the Randall-Sundrum model using up-to-date LEP and Tevatron direct search results. Program summary Program title: HiggsBounds Catalogue identifier: AEFF_v2_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEFF_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public Licence version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 74 005 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1 730 996 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 77, Fortran 90 (two code versions are offered). Classification: 11.1. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEFF_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 138 External routines: HiggsBounds requires no external routines/libraries. Some sample programs in the distribution require the programs FeynHiggs 2.7.1 or CPsuperH2.2 to be installed. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Determine whether a parameter point of a given model is excluded or allowed by LEP and Tevatron neutral and charged Higgs boson search results. Solution method: The most sensitive channel from LEP and Tevatron searches is determined and subsequently applied to test this parameter point. The test requires as input, model predictions for the Higgs boson masses, branching ratios and ratios of production cross sections with respect to reference values. Reasons for new version: This version extends the functionality of the previous version. Summary of revisions: List of included Higgs searches has been expanded, e.g. inclusion of (singly) charged Higgs boson searches. The input required from the user has been extended accordingly. Restrictions: Assumes that the narrow width approximation is applicable in the model under consideration and that the model does not predict a significant change to the signature of the background processes or the kinematical distributions of the signal cross sections. Running time: About 0.01 seconds (or less) for one parameter point using one processor of an Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 CPU at 2.40 GHz for sample model scenarios with three Higgs bosons. It depends on the complexity of the Higgs sector (e.g. the number of Higgs bosons and the number of open decay channels) and on the code version. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
