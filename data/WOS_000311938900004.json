In other words, the codewords are full-rank matrices of size k x n with entries in a finite field F-q. Spread codes are a family of optimal codes with maximal minimum distance. We give a minimum-distance decoding algorithm which requires O ((n - k)k(3)) operations over an extension field F(q)k. Our algorithm is more efficient than the previous ones in the literature, when the dimension k of the codewords is small with respect to n. The decoding algorithm takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the code, and it uses original results on minors of a matrix and on the factorization of polynomials over finite fields.", "paper_title": "AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH FOR DECODING SPREAD CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000311938900004"}
