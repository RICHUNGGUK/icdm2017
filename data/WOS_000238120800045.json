However, it currently lacks in spontaneous and energy efficient device communication which could make it more successful. To allow spontaneous networking, communication nodes should have the ability to timely discover each other. Moreover, in order to improve energy efficiency and increase battery lifetime the energy spent during discovery procedures should be minimized while guaranteeing high probability of successfully completing the discovery and the information transfer procedure. In this paper we derive performance considerations on the behavior of the system through experiments in a physical testbed where devices move while discovering nodes in their neighborhood and then exchange information. These considerations can be used for accurately model neighbor discovery process and information transfer in Bluetooth networks.", "paper_title": "Improving energy efficiency and responsiveness in bluetooth networks: A performance assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800045"}
