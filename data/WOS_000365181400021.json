This issue particularly affects Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and tends to make their use difficult. In this paper, we show a practical way to make Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), a classical feature extraction that is particularly useful in BCI, robust to non-stationarity. To do so, we did not modify the CSP method itself, but rather make the covariance estimation (used as input by every CSP variant) more robust to non-stationarity. Those robust estimators are derived using a classical importance-weighting scenario. Finally, we highlight the behavior of our robust framework On a toy dataset and show gains of accuracy on a real-life BC! dataset. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
