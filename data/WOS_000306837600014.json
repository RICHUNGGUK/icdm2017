Our analysis is focused on a general individual attack, i.e. entangle-ancilla attack. The sufficient and necessary condition for a successful eavesdropping operation is obtained, and a particular attack is presented, by which Eve can elicit the whole secret without being discovered. Finally we find the root of this loophole and give a possible improvement of this protocol accordingly.", "paper_title": "CRYPTANALYSIS OF THE QSDC PROTOCOL WITHOUT USING PERFECT QUANTUM CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000306837600014"}
