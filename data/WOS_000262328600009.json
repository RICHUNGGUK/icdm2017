All the minimal codewords of these codes are characterized according to their weights, which suggests that their,covering structures are determined. Finally, all the minimal access sets of the secret sharing schemes based on their dual codes are obtained.", "paper_title": "On the Covering Structures of Two Classes of Linear Codes From Perfect Nonlinear Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600009"}
