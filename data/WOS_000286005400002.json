The finite base fields F(q) are arbitrary, but their sizes should not grow too fast compared to the genus. For such families, the group structure and discrete logarithms can be computed in subexponential time of L(qg) (1/3, O(1)). The runtime bounds rely on heuristics similar to the ones used in the number field sieve or the function field sieve.", "paper_title": "An L(1/3) Discrete Logarithm Algorithm for Low Degree Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000286005400002"}
