We present a proof system for certifying the falsity of QCSP instances and develop its basic theory; for instance, we provide an algorithmic interpretation of its behavior. Our proof system places the established Q-resolution proof system in a broader context, and also allows us to derive QCSP tractability results.", "paper_title": "BEYOND Q-RESOLUTION AND PRENEX FORM: A PROOF SYSTEM FOR QUANTIFIED CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900008"}
