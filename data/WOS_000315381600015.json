We present axiomatizations of the monadic second-order logic (MSO), monadic transitive closure logic (FO(TC1)) and monadic least fixed-point logic (FO(LFP1)) theories of this class of structures. These logics can express important properties such as reachability. Using model-theoretic techniques, we show by a uniform argument that these axiomatizations are complete, i.e., each formula that is valid on all finite trees is provable using our axioms. As a backdrop to our positive results, on arbitrary structures, the logics that we study are known to be non-recursively axiomatizable.", "paper_title": "COMPLETE AXIOMATIZATIONS OF FRAGMENTS OF MONADIC SECOND-ORDER LOGIC ON FINITE TREES", "paper_id": "WOS:000315381600015"}
