In this regard, a general approach based on the generalized Fourier series expansion is applied. The obtained analytic solution is simplified in terms of a given set of orthogonal basis functions. The result is compared with the classical modal analysis technique which is widely used in the field of structural dynamics. It is shown that the result of the decomposition method leads to an exact closed-form solution which is equivalent to the result obtained by the modal analysis method. Some examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the present study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
