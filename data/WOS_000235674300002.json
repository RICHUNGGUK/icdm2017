Two important parameters are studied, which are helpful to describe a nonhomogeneous BDP X = X(t), t >= 0: the limiting mean value (namely, the mean length of the queue at a given time t) and the double mean (i.e. the mean length of the queue for the whole duration of the BDP). We find conditions of existence of the means and determine bounds for their values, involving also the truncated BDP X-N. Finally we present some examples where these bounds are used in order to approximate the double mean.", "paper_title": "Some universal limits for nonhomogeneous birth and death processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000235674300002"}
