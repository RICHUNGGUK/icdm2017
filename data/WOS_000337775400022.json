This paper introduces the medium mathematic systems, and establishes a novel image medium similarity measure between two pixels and that of between two image sets based on the measure of medium truth degree. Moreover, an image edge detection algorithm, an image matching algorithm and an image medium fidelity measure method governed by the medium similarity measure are discussed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed similarity measure is effective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
