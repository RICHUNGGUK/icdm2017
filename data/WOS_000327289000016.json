This paper considers a Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) based on a hybrid combination of Time Division Multiplexing (TOM) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). The time complexity of the DBA algorithm is typically O(n log n), where n denotes the number of ONUs. Since the maximum number of supported ONUs in an LR-PON can be as high as 2048, the computation time required for computing a schedule will be very high and directly impacts the overall network performance. In this paper, we have presented a grouping strategy to reduce the computation requirements. The number of ONUs is split into mutually exclusive groups with the OLT scheduling each group independently and in parallel. With the static grouping strategy every user is assigned to a group and the assignment of wavelength resources is fixed. However, with non-uniform loads, we observed that static grouping was not found to be suitable as the delay variation was significant across the groups. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic grouping and define three dynamic grouping heuristics that adapt to the current network load conditions and (re)allocate the ONUs and wavelength resources suitably. The proposed schemes have been compared in terms of delay variation and wavelength utilization. Of the three heuristics, ONU to Least Loaded wavelength group (OLL) and Least Wavelength Resources (LWR) heuristics balance the packet delay across ONUs assigned to different groups and Proportional Wavelength Usage (PWU) heuristic reduces power consumption by allocating fewer wavelength resources.
