QADPC classifies the input packets to the control plane by considering end terminal mobility and service type. Then, different capacities are assigned to each classified packet for prioritized processing. By means of Markov chains, QADPC is evaluated in terms of blocking probability and waiting time in the control plane. Analytical results demonstrate that QADPC offers high priority packets both lower blocking probability and less waiting time.", "paper_title": "A QoS-Aware Differential Processing Control Scheme for Open Flow-Based Mobile Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784500030"}
