(Des Codes Cryptogr 29:51-70, 2003) in relation to a quantum jump code. In this article, firstly, it is shown that an optimal t-SEED attaining a given upper bound is a large set of Steiner t-designs. Secondly, we present some recursive constructions of t-SEEDs. Moreover, an application to secret sharing scheme by utilizing the properties of a t-SEED is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Extremal properties of t-SEEDs and recursive constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000340681700007"}
