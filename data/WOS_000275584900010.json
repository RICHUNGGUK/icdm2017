In this work we investigate the performance of running parallel applications with communication among processors on the InteGrade grid. As costly communication on a grid can be prohibitive, we explore the so-called systolic or wavefront paradigm to design the parallel algorithms in which no global communication is used. To evaluate the InteGrade middleware we considered three parallel algorithms that solve the matrix chain product problem, the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, and the local sequence alignment problem, respectively. We show that these three applications running under the InteGrade middleware and MPI take slightly more time than the same applications running on a cluster with only LAM-MPI support. The results can be considered promising and the time difference between the two is not substantial. The overhead of the InteGrade middleware is acceptable, in view of the benefits obtained to facilitate the use of grid computing by the user. These benefits include job submission, checkpointing, security, job migration, etc. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Performance results of running parallel applications on the InteGrade", "paper_id": "WOS:000275584900010"}
