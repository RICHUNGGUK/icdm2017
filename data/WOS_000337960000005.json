A complete delay-decomposing approach is employed to construct a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Then, by utilizing a segmentation technique to consider the time-varying delay and its derivative and introducing some free-weighting matrices to express the relationship between the time-varying delay and its varying interval, some improved passivity criteria are derived. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Improved Conditions for Passivity of Neural Networks With a Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000337960000005"}
