De Fraysseix, Ossona de Mendez and Rosenstiehl proved that every planar graph admits a contact representation by triangles. We strengthen this in terms of a simultaneous contact representation by triangles of a planar map and of its dual. A primal-dual contact representation by triangles of a planar map is a contact representation by triangles of the primal and a contact representation by triangles of the dual such that for every edge , bordering faces and , the intersection between the triangles corresponding to and is the same point as the intersection between the triangles corresponding to and . We prove that every 3-connected planar map admits a primal-dual contact representation by triangles. Moreover, the interiors of the triangles form a tiling of the triangle corresponding to the outer face and each contact point is a corner of exactly three triangles. Then we show that these representations are in one-to-one correspondence with generalized Schnyder woods defined by Felsner for 3-connected planar maps.", "paper_title": "Triangle Contact Representations and Duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000304119600011"}
