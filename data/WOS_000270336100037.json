The subcodebook sizes of two classes are automatically adjusted in training iterations based on modified partial distortions that can be estimated incrementally. The proposed weighted learning rate updates the neuron efficiently no matter of how large the weighting factor is. Experimental results show that the new method achieves better quality of reconstructed edge blocks and more spread out codebook and incurs a significantly less computational cost as compared to the competing methods.
