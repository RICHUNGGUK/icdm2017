In particular, we focused on the (a) identity effect, (b) semantic interference effect, (c) semantic facilitation effect, and the semantic facilitation in categorization. Our model is based on integrate-and-fire neurons which are put in a network context featuring modular competition and cooperation at both intra- and intermodular level. A finely tuned balance of competition and cooperation is required to combine the mentioned effects in a coherent framework. We show that the mechanism for categorization must be functionally decoupled from the basic level mechanisms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
