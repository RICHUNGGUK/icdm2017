We propose to distinguish orchestration technology and orchestrable technology, to define orchestration as a combination of scripting and conducting, and to differentiate primo-scripting and run-time scripting. As a way to see how these different notions relate one to another, we take the example of CSCL scripts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
