This gives rise to a general framework of reverse-order and convolution subband structures in filterbank transforms, which we show to be well suited to the analysis of filterbank coefficients arising from sub-sampled or multiplexed signals. These results thus provide a means to understand time-localized aliasing and modulation properties of such signals and their subband representations-notions that are notably absent from the global viewpoint afforded by Fourier analysis-as well as signal recovery from sampled sequences based on their filterbank characterizations. The utility of filterbank rewirings is demonstrated by the closed-form analysis of signals subject to degradations such as missing data, spatially or temporally multiplexed data acquisition, or signal-dependent noise, the likes of which are often encountered in practical signal processing applications.", "paper_title": "Rewiring Filterbanks for Local Fourier Analysis: Theory and Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500030"}
