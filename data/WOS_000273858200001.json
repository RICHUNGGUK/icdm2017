Originally designed for writing user-defined constraint solvers, it is now recognized as an elegant general purpose language. Constraint Handling Rules related research has surged during the decade following the previous survey by Fruhwirth (J. Logic Programming, Special Issue on Constraint Logic Programming, 1998, vol. 37, nos. 1-3, pp. 95-138). Covering more than 180 publications, this new Survey provides an overview of recent results in a wide range of research areas, from semantics and analysis to systems, extensions, and applications.", "paper_title": "As time goes by: Constraint Handling Rules A survey of CHR research from 1998 to 2007", "paper_id": "WOS:000273858200001"}
