In this paper, a complete gauge field Lagrangian is proposed which couples the retinex equation with neurogeometrical models and solves the problem of modal completion, i.e. the pop up of the Kanizsa triangle. Euler-Lagrange equations are derived by variational calculus and numerically solved. Plausible neurophysiological implementations of the particle and field equations are discussed and a model of the interaction between LGN and visual cortex is proposed.", "paper_title": "A Gauge Field Model of Modal Completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000353563400006"}
