The majority of deep learning architectures described in the literature primarily focus on extracting spatial features. However, in real-world settings, capturing temporal dependencies in observations is critical for accurate inference. This paper introduces an enhancement to DeSTIN - a compositional deep learning architecture in which each layer consists of multiple instantiations of a common node - that learns to represent spatiotemporal patterns in data based on a novel recurrent clustering algorithm. Contrary to mainstream deep architectures, such as deep belief networks where layer-by-layer training is assumed, each of the nodes in the proposed architecture is trained independently and in parallel. Moreover, top-down and bottom-up information flows facilitate rich feature formation. A semi-supervised setting is demonstrated achieving state-of-the-art results on the MNIST classification benchmarks. A GPU implementation is discussed further accentuating the scalability properties of the proposed framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
