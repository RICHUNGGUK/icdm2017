However, one encounters the problem of space insufficiency if all possible views are materialized in advance. Reducing query time by means of selecting a proper set of materialized views with a lower cost is crucial for efficient data warehousing. In addition, the costs of data warehouse creation, query, and maintenance have to be taken into account while views are materialized. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms to select a proper set of materialized views, constrained by storage and cost considerations, to help speed up the entire data warehousing process. We derive a cost model for data warehouse query and maintenance as well as efficient view selection algorithms that effectively exploit the gain and loss metrics. The main contribution of our paper is to speed up the selection process of materialized views. Concurrently, this will greatly reduce the overall cost of data warehouse query and maintenance.
