Similar to classical codes, hashing bound approaching QECCs may be designed by exploiting a concatenated code structure, which invokes iterative decoding. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an extensive step-by-step tutorial for designing extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart-aided concatenated quantum codes based on the underlying quantum-to-classical isomorphism. These design lessons are then exemplified in the context of our proposed quantum irregular convolutional code (QIRCC), which constitutes the outer component of a concatenated quantum code. The proposed QIRCC can be dynamically adapted to match any given inner code using EXIT charts, hence achieving a performance close to the hashing bound. It is demonstrated that our QIRCC-based optimized design is capable of operating within 0.4 dB of the noise limit.", "paper_title": "The Road From Classical to Quantum Codes: A Hashing Bound Approaching Design Procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200011"}
