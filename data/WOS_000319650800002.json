In this paper, an enhanced voting-based consensus method was introduced and compared with other consensus clustering methods, including co-association-based, graph-based, and voting-based consensus methods. The MDDR and MUV data sets were used for the experiments and were represented by three 2D fingerprints: ALOGP, ECFP_4, and ECFC_4. The results were evaluated based on the ability of the clustering method to separate active from inactive molecules in each cluster using four criteria: F-measure, Quality Partition Index (QPI), Rand Index (RI), and Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI). The experiments suggest that the consensus methods can deliver significant improvements for the effectiveness of chemical structures clustering.", "paper_title": "Consensus Methods for Combining Multiple Clusterings of Chemical Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000319650800002"}
