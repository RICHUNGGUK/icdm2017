The main challenge is how to verify on-chip bus protocols efficiently. Although traditional simulation-based bus protocol monitors can check whether bus signals obey bus protocol or not. They are still lack of an efficient bus protocols verification environment such as FPGA-level or chip-level. To overcome the shortage, we propose a rule-based synthesizable AMBA AHB on-chip bus protocol checker, which contains 73 related AHB on-chip bus protocol rules to check AHB bus signal behaviors, and two corresponding verification mechanisms: an error reference table (ERT) and a windowed trace buffer, to shorten verification time.", "paper_title": "HPChecker: An AMBA AHB On-Chip Bus Protocol Checker with Efficient Verification Mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300011"}
