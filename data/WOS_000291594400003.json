While most prior works focused on the single source-destination scenario, it should be more realistic to consider how to induce cooperation among multiple source-destination pairs assisted by multiple relays. In such a case, multiple access interference (MAI) may present due to asynchronous transmissions of the users and relays. In this paper, a cooperative network architecture based on orthogonal complementary (OC) codes inherently immune to MAI is proposed. To efficiently utilize the scarce radio spectrum and codes, a centralized medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed to coordinate the code assignment and channel access among users and relays. We theoretically analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed OC coded cooperative network over multipath Rayleigh fading channel. The performance gain resulted from different numbers of relays is investigated, and compared with a time division multiple access (TDMA) based cooperative scheme. We show that the proposed OC coded cooperative network performs well in the presence of timing offset, and thus is well suited for asynchronous uplink transmission with cooperative relaying.
