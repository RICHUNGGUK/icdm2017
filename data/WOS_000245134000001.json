In this paper, we propose P2Cast - an architecture that uses a peer-to-peer approach to cooperatively stream video using patching techniques, while only relying on unicast connections among peers. We address the following two key technical issues in P2Cast: (1) constructing an application overlay appropriate for streaming; and (2) providing continuous stream playback (without glitches) in the face of disruption from an early departing client. Our simulation experiments show that P2Cast can serve many more clients than traditional client-server unicast service, and that it generally out-performs multicast-based patching if clients can cache more than 10% of a stream's initial portion. We handle disruptions by delaying the start of playback and applying the shifted forwarding technique. The threshold in P2Cast, i.e., the length of time during which arriving clients form a single session, can serve as a \"knob\" to adjust the balance between the scalability and the clients' viewing quality.", "paper_title": "P2Cast: peer-to-peer patching for video on demand service", "paper_id": "WOS:000245134000001"}
