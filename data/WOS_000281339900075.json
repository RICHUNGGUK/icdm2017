Using data mining technology to aid the data processing, information retrieval and knowledge generation process has become one of the critical missions to enterprise, so how to use data mining tools properly is user concern. Since not every user completely understand the theory of data mining, choosing the best solution from the functions which data mining tools provides is not easy. If user is not satisfied with the outcome of mining, communication with IT employees to adjust the software costs lots of time. To solve this problem, a selection model of data mining algorithms is proposed. By analyzing the content of business decision and application, user requirements will map to certain data mining category and algorithm. This method makes algorithm selection faster and reasonable to improve the efficiency of applying data mining tools to solve business problems.
