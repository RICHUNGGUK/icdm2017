In this paper, we propose a new method, called Boosted Ranking Model (BRM), for learning how to rank from training data. An important feature of the proposed method is that it is domain-independent and can thus be applied to a wide range of ranking domains. The main contribution of the new method is that it reduces the problem of learning how to rank to the much more simple, and well-studied problem of constructing an optimized binary classifier from simple, weak classifiers. Using that reduction, our method constructs an optimized ranking model using multiple simple, easy-to-define ranking models as building blocks. The new method is a unifying framework that includes, as special cases, specific methods that we have proposed in earlier publications for specific ranking applications, such as nearest neighbor retrieval and classification. In this paper, we reformulate those earlier methods as special cases of the proposed BRM method, and we also illustrate a novel application of BRM, on the problem of making movie recommendations to individual users.", "paper_title": "Boosted ranking models: a unifying framework for ranking predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300295600003"}
