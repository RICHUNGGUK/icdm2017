In this article, we focus on P2P file sharing applications, where spontaneous communities of users are studied and analyzed. We define a family of structures that we call \"Affinity Networks\" (or even Graphs) that show self-organized interest-based clusters. Empirical evidence proves that affinity networks are small worlds and shows scale-free features. The relevance of this finding is augmented with the introduction of a proactive recommendation scheme, namely DeHinter, that exploits this natural feature. The intuition behind this scheme is that a user would trust her network of \"elective affinities\" more than anonymous and generic suggestions made by impersonal entities. The accuracy of the recommendation is evaluated by way of a 10-fold cross validation, and a prototype has been implemented for further feedbacks from the users.", "paper_title": "A Peer-to-Peer Recommender System Based on Spontaneous Affinities", "paper_id": "WOS:000264443400004"}
