That is, we show that for all d and all there exists a bivariate form f such that f can be written as a linear combination of m dth powers of real linear forms and no fewer, and additionally all forms in an open neighborhood of f also possess this property. Equivalently we show that for all d and any there exists a symmetric real bivariate tensor t of order d such that t can be written as a linear combination of m symmetric real tensors of rank 1 and no fewer, and additionally all tensors in an open neighborhood of t also possess this property.", "paper_title": "Typical Real Ranks of Binary Forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000354710400006"}
