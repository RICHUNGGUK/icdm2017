We propose a novel distributed clustering approach for WSNs, which is termed as Hybrid Cluster-based Energy-efficient Protocol (HCEP) by using clustering as a key communication control technique. To measure the load distribution among nodes in a WSN, we quantify load balance by giving a load parameter for every node in a WSN. We then introduce a novel clustering function that takes into account a number of factors such as node degree, node residual energy and node initial energy. Based on the clustering function, we develop the framework of HCEP for implementation in WSNs. We design HCEP to incorporate two sorts of procedures in it, mainly the clustering procedures. Using the procedure, HCEP takes the advantage of load balance and uses localised coordination to enable energy efficiency and robustness for dynamic WSN networks, and thus it can prolong the network lifetime significantly. Simulation results verify that HCEP extends lifetime when communication radius changes within certain range and that the introduced balance parameter can be set to extend lifetime significantly.", "paper_title": "HCEP: a hybrid cluster-based energy-efficient protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280103700001"}
