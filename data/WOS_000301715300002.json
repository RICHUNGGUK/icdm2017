The filter is realized using on-chip spiral inductors and metalinsulatormetal capacitors and features an attenuation pole near the cutoff frequency leading to a sharper attenuation response. As well, it offers good matching properties in the passband. Space-mapping-based algorithm is used in the design/optimization of spiral inductors toward achieving high quality factors at the filter cutoff frequency. The realization of the proposed filter is compact in size, suitable for monolithic microwave integrated circuit applications, and exhibit broad upper stopband frequency characteristics.
