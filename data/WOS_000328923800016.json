As the states of neurons are usually difficult to be fully measured, a state estimation based approach is presented. First, a sufficient condition is derived such that the augmented system under consideration is globally exponentially stable. Then, by employing a decoupling technique, the gain matrices of the controller and state estimator are achieved by solving some linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a delayed neural network with chaotic behaviors is exploited to demonstrate the applicability of the developed result. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
