Especially, we provide a direct proof for an existing important result. Afterwards, the t-norm-based probabilistic decomposable measure is presented, in which the value of measure is characterized by a probability distribution function. Meantime, several examples are constructed to illustrate different notions, and then further properties are examined. Moreover, for a given Menger PM-space, a probabilistic decomposable measure can be induced by means of the resulting probabilistic Hausdorff distance. We prove that this type of measure is (sigma)-T-probabilistic subdecomposabIe measure for the strongest t-norm. Furthermore, we also prove that the class of all measurable sets forms an algebra. Finally, an outer probabilistic measure is induced by a class of probabilistic decomposable measures and the t-norm. Based on this kind of measure, a Menger probabilistic pseudometric space can be obtained for a non-strict continuous Archimedean t-norm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
