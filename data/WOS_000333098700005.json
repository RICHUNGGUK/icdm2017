First, sufficient conditions to assure the boundedness and global attractivity of the networks are derived. Using state-space decomposition and some analytic techniques, it is shown that the number of equilibria located in the saturation regions of the piecewise-linear activation functions of an n-neuron MCNN with time-varying delays increases significantly from 2(n) to 2(2n2+n) (2(2n2) times) compared with that without a memristor. In addition, sufficient conditions for the invariance and local or global attractivity of equilibria or attractive sets in any designated region are derived. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to elaborate the characteristics of the results in detail.", "paper_title": "Attractivity Analysis of Memristor-Based Cellular Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098700005"}
