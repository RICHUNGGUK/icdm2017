However, the storage of the biometric templates and/or encryption keys that are necessary for such applications is a matter of serious concern, as the compromise of templates or keys necessarily compromises the information secured by those keys. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which requires storage of neither biometric templates nor encryption keys, by directly generating the keys from statistical features of biometric data. An outline of the process is as follows: given biometric samples, a set of statistical features is first extracted from each sample. On each feature subset or single feature, we model the intra and interuser variation by clustering the data into natural clusters using a fuzzy genetic clustering algorithm. Based on the modelling results, we subsequently quantify the consistency of each feature subset or single feature for each user. By selecting the most consistent feature subsets and/or single features for each user individually, we generate the key reliably without compromising its relative security. The proposed method is evaluated on handwritten signature data and compared with related methods, and the results are very promising.", "paper_title": "Template-free biometric-key generation by means of fuzzy genetic clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000257824200005"}
