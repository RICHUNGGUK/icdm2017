By reviewing publicly available telemedicine systems through commonality and variability analysis, we have identified common design concerns and tried to provide a framework for supporting reuse-based development. Based on identified common design concerns, a generic model of conference-oriented telemedicine systems and layered architecture are illustrated as a basis for analyzing typical design problems encountered when developing similar systems. As the main part of our work, we have proposed seven commonly occurring design problems and realized a framework implementation to provide a general resolution to these design problems based on the generic model and layered architecture of conference-oriented telemedicine systems. Finally, the details of the proposed framework are explained and a comparison with related telemedicine systems is given.", "paper_title": "TeMeFr: Towards a reuse-based development for conference-oriented telemedicine systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237907900011"}
