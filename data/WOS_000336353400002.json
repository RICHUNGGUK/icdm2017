Objectives: Our objectives were to: 1) char; acterize older adult participant' perceived usefulness of in-home sensor data and 2) de; velop novel visual displays for sensor data from Ambient Assisted Living environments that can become part Of electronic health records. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community-dwelling older adult participants during three and six, month visit. We engaged partitipants in two design iterations by soliciting feedback about display types and visual displays of simulated data related to a fall scenario. Interview transcripts were analyzed to identify themes related to perceived usefulness of sensor data. Results: Thematic analysis identified three, themes: perceived usefulness of sensor data for managing health; factors that affect perceived usefulness of sensor data and; perceived usefulness of visual displays. Visual., displays were cited as potentially useful for family members and health care providers., Three novel visual displays were created based on interview results, design guidelines derived from prior AAL research, and principles of graphic design theory. Conclusions: Participants identified potential uses of personal activity data for monitoring health status and capturing early signs : of illness. One area for future research is to determine how visual displays of AAL data might be utilized to connect family members and health care providers through shared understanding of activity levels versus a more simplified view of self-management. Connecting informal and formal caregiving networks may facilitate better communitation between older adults, family members and health care providers for shared decision-making.", "paper_title": "Assessing Older Adults' Perceptions of Sensor Data and Designing Visual Displays for Ambient Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000336353400002"}
