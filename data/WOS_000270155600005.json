This index incorporates the variation of production items with respect to the target value and the specification limits preset in the factory. To estimate the loss-based index properly and accurately, certain frequentist and Bayesian perspectives have been proposed to obtain lower confidence bounds (LCBs) for providing minimum process capability. The LCBs not only provide critical information regarding process performance but are also used to determine whether an improvement was made in a capability index and by extension in reducing the fraction of non-conforming items. In this paper, under the assumption of normality, based on frequentist and Bayesian senses, several existing approaches for constructing LCBs of Cpm are presented. Depending on the statistical methods used, we then classify these existing approaches into three categories and compared them in terms of the coverage rates and the mean values of the LCBs via simulations. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are summarized with some highlights of the relevant findings.", "paper_title": "A comparison of methods for estimating loss-based capability index", "paper_id": "WOS:000270155600005"}
