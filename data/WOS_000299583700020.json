However, there are some limitations in that SPC requires linear, unimodal and single variable data and VM underestimates the deviations of predictors. In this paper, seven different machine learning-based novelty detection methods were employed to detect faulty wafers. The models were trained with Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) data to detect wafers having faulty metrology values. The real world semiconductor manufacturing data collected from a semiconductor fab were tested. Since the real world data have more than 150 input variables, we employed three different dimensionality reduction methods. The experimental results showed a high True Positive Rate (TPR). These results are promising enough to warrant further study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
