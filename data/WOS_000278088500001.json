For two-qubit pure states, the negativity is the same as the concurrence. For mixed states, using a simplified expression of concurrence in Wootters' measure of entanglement, we write the bounds of Verstraete et al.(1) as a function of some new parameters and we compare the both measures for a class of mixed states.", "paper_title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF NEGATIVITY AND CONCURRENCE BASED ON SPIN COHERENT STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088500001"}
