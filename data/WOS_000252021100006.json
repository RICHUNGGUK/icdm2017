The face area is divided into small regions from which local binary pattern (LBP) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single vector efficiently representing a facial image. Following the idea of local binary pattern, we propose a new feature extraction approach called multi-resolution LBP, which can retain both fine and coarse local micro-patterns and spatial information of facial images. The classification tasks in this work are performed by support vector machines (SVMs). The experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed method over both support gray faces and support Gabor faces on the CAS-PEAL face database. A higher correct classification rate of 96.56% and a higher cross validation average accuracy of 95.78% have been obtained. In addition, the simplicity of the proposed method leads to very fast feature extraction, and the regional histograms and fine-to-coarse description of facial images allow for multi-view gender classification.", "paper_title": "Multi-view gender classification using multi-resolution local binary patterns and support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000252021100006"}
