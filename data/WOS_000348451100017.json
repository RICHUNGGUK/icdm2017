By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that uses the information on the lower and upper bound of the delay sufficiently, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived by using the free-weighting matrices method for such Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy uncertain impulsive stochastic recurrent neural networks. The obtained conditions are expressed with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility can be checked easily by MATLAB LMI Control toolbox. Finally, the theoretical result is validated by simulations.", "paper_title": "Stability of uncertain impulsive stochastic fuzzy neural networks with two additive time delays in the leakage term", "paper_id": "WOS:000348451100017"}
