By analyzing the associated characteristic transcendental equation, the linear stability of the model is investigated and Hopf bifurcation is demonstrated. Some explicit formulae determining the stability and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation periodic solutions bifurcating from Hopf bifurcations are obtained by using the normal form method and center manifold theory. Finally, numerical simulations supporting the theoretical analysis are given. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
