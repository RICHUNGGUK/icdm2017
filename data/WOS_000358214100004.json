This paper proposes a visualization method for a 3D lunar model with texture. The method increases the speed of data transmission through the Internet by using texture divide-and-conquer techniques, view-dependent evaluation of texture piece visibility, and progressive transmission and reconstruction techniques. Using this method, the convergence problem in the polar regions is solved, and multilevel labels can be added and displayed. An Internet-based client/server architecture has been built and implemented, which can be interactively browsed on a client almost in real time. This work offers a popular application (i.e., using personal terminals and the Internet), and the proposed modeling and visualization method could be applied to most global space-exploration datasets.", "paper_title": "Internet-based interactive visualization method of 3D lunar model with texture", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100004"}
