The machine dynamically encodes its shape into description signals, and despite the randomness of cell updating, it is able to successfully construct copies of itself according to the description signals. Self-replication on asynchronously Updated cellular automata may find application in nanocomputers, where reconfigurability is an essential property, since it allows avoidance of defective parts and simplifies programming of such computers.", "paper_title": "Reliable self-replicating machines in asynchronous cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000249289300005"}
