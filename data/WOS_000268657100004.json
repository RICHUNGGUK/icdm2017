In TCP-Cherry, two new algorithms, Fast-Forward Start and First-Aid Recovery, have been proposed for congestion control. Our algorithms use supplement segments, i.e., low-priority segments to probe the available bandwidth in the network for the TCP connections along with carrying new data blocks. In this paper, we present our new congestion control scheme, TCP-Cherry and devise an analytical model for it. Our major contributions in this paper include the analytical model and equations for performance evaluation, validation of the analytical model through comparison between analytical and simulation results and devising a guideline to tune the buffer related parameters both at the sender as well as the receiver ends for optimum throughput performance. Experiments show that simulation results and the calculated throughput from our analytical model match quite closely, thereby verifying the appropriateness of the model. In addition, from analysis of simulation results, we discover that a buffer size at the receiver, rwnd, that is around four times maxcwnd, or the maximum congestion window at the sender side, is likely to maintain high throughput over a wide range of operating conditions.
