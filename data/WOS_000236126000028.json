We define two types of rate loss, the side-information rate loss and the multiresolotion rate loss, to measure the nonsuccessive refinability. The former compares the rates achievable by a given WZ-MRSC to the corresponding minimal rates achievable by single-resolution Wyner-Ziv codes, and the latter refers to the difference between the rates achievable by a given WZ-MRSC and the minimal achievable rates by any WZ-MRSC at the same resolution. We bound these two types of rate loss from above and show that the side-information rate loss and corresponding successive refinability largely depend on the side information, while there exist small universal constant upper bounds on the multiresolution rate loss that are generally independent of the side information.", "paper_title": "On the rate loss of multiresolution source codes in the Wyner-Ziv setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000028"}
