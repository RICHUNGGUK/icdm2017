They have been introduced by W. Knodel as gossip graphs for d = [log n]. A logarithmic algorithm for the minimum path problem in Knodel graphs is an open problem despite the fact that they are bipartite and highly symmetric. In this paper, we describe a logarithmic time two-approximation algorithm for the shortest path in the Knodel graph on 2(d) vertices with degree d. We also prove that for a subset of the set of vertices, the algorithm gives a minimum length path.
