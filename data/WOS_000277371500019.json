With experimentations, the method is thereafter evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is introduced to implement the distance-based strategy by using the coordinates. The users update their coordinates to the networking and the system computers which satellite and which beam can cover the user being called at real time. Findings - In managing the location of mobile users in mobile communication systems, the distance-based strategy has been proven to have better performance than other dynamic strategies, but difficult to implement. The approach introduced in this paper implements the distance-based strategy by using the coordinates. Originality/value - This method makes full use of the characters of the LEO system and refutes the apparent weakness that location management area is restricted by the establishment on the ground. The simulation result proves that this method is efficient.", "paper_title": "An adaptive distance-based location management of LEO system using coordinates approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500019"}
