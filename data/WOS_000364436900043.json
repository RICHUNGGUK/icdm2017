Apart from finding the minimum-cost tree and using metrics on the physical performance of the system, namely the Q-factor, this work investigates different node architecture designs including architectures with active and passive splitters and architectures with different receiver and transmitter designs. Different network engineering approaches are also utilized and are used to ascertain whether a multicast connection should be admitted to the network. \"Tree balancing techniques\" are used for routing the multicast sessions, aiming at maximizing the multicast connections that can be admitted to the network.
