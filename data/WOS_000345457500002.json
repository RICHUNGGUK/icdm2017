We study the relations between this new kind of event structures and Propositional Contract Logic. Provable atoms in the logic correspond to reachable events in our event structures. Furthermore, we show a correspondence between the configurations of this new brand of event structures and the proofs in a fragment of Propositional Contract Logic.", "paper_title": "Circular Causality in Event Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457500002"}
