Several new approaches and technologies are being considered as potential elements making up such a future mobile network, including cloud RANs, application of SDN principles, exploiting new and unused portions of spectrum, use of massive MIMO and full-duplex communications. Research on these technologies requires realistic and flexible experimentation platforms that offer a wide range of experimentation modes from real-world experimentation to controlled and scalable evaluations while at the same time retaining backward compatibility with current generation systems. Towards this end, we present OpenAirInterface (OAT) as a suitably flexible platform. In addition, we discuss the use of OAT in the context of several widely mentioned 5G research directions.", "paper_title": "OpenAirInterface: A Flexible Platform for 5G Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000343986300008"}
