In one specification state, one cell can be presented a kind of proteins, and we say that is a proteome. The proteome can be changed with different situations. In order to analyze the proteomics, the first step is that try to separate the proteins. The 2D-GE (Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis) is an important and useful tool for research. Today, biologists have access to the many image databases that exist online. Biologists are keenly interested in the information that might be discerned from. protein spots. Thus, quickly and efficiently finding such spots is an important job. In this paper, we attempt to find these spots based on 2D-GE images' features. We first use the image contrast to find the proteins' edges and, then we detect the protein spots by the edges. Our experiments yield good results for detecting protein spots in 2D-GE images.", "paper_title": "A SIMPLE METHOD FOR DETECTING PROTEIN SPOTS IN 2D-GE IMAGES USING IMAGE CONTRAST", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800021"}
