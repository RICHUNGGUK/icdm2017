The visualization will help experts as well as non-experts to link previously or isolated knowledge-items in their mental map with new insights. Our approach explicitly supports the process of linking knowledge-items with three concepts. At first, the representation of data items in an ontology categorizes and relates them. Secondly, the use of various visualization techniques visually correlates isolated items by graph-structures, layout, attachment, integration or hyperlink techniques. Thirdly, the intensive use of visual metaphors relates a known source domain to a less known target domain. In order to realize a scenario of these concepts, we developed a visual interface for non-experts to maintain complex wastewater treatment plants. This domain-specific application is used to give our concepts a meaningful background.
