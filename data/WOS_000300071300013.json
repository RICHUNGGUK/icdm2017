In this paper we propose a step towards improving this situation by providing an automated method based on range imaging for estimating the coarse head orientation of a construction equipment operator. This research utilizes commercially-available low resolution range cameras to measure the continuously changing field-of-view (FOV) of an equipment operator in outdoor construction. This paper presents a methodology to measure so-called dynamic blind spot maps. The dynamic blind spot map is then projected on a known static equipment blind spot map that already exists to each construction vehicle. A robust computational coarse head pose estimation algorithm and results to three different pieces of construction equipment and multiple operators are presented. The developed method has the potential in automatically determining the spaces around vehicles that are currently not in the field-of-view of the vehicle operator thus providing eventually additional means and technology for improving safety in construction.
