Marching cubes (MC) is the standard isosurface grid generation algorithm, and, whereas most triangles it generates are good, it almost always generates bad triangles. Here, we show how simple changes to MC can lead to a drastically reduced number of degenerate triangles, making it a more practical choice for isosurface grid generation.", "paper_title": "MARCHING CUBES WITHOUT SKINNY TRIANGLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000263526600013"}
