Most have suggested that it is reasonable to adopt the Haar & von Karman hypothesis in the slip line method. In this study, a general tangential stress coefficient is used instead of the Haar & von Karman hypothesis in the slip line method, and its effect on the earth pressure is discussed. We find that the hypothesis is reasonable when the soil behind the wall fails completely. Using earth pressures when the soil behind the wall begins to fail is better in practice. The earth pressure is expressed with earth pressure coefficients and the coefficients are presented in figures for practical use. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
