In addition, production capacity expansion requirements are also accounted for. The main feature of the paper is the development of a methodology for simultaneous analysis of process network integration alternatives in a multisite refining system through a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with the overall objective of minimizing total annualized cost. The State Equipment Network (SEN) representation was used for modeling the network as it provides a consistent modeling strategy and proper handling of units that operate under different operating modes. which is common in the refining industry. The integrated network design specifically addresses intermediate material transfer between processing units at each site. The performance of the proposed model was tested on several industrial-scale examples to illustrate the economic potential and trade-offs involved in the optimization of the network. The use of mathematical programming models on ail enterprise-wide scale to address strategic decisions considering various process integration alternatives yielded substantial benefits. These benefits not only materialize in terms of economic considerations. but also in terms of process flexibility and improvements in the understanding of the process interactions and systems limitations. Although the methodology was applied oil a network of refineries, it can be readily extended to cover any network of continuous chemical processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
