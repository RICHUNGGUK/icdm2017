This is primarily due to the fact that single parallel-architecture-based systems may not be sufficient to exploit the available parallelism with the running applications. Most security-aware applications end up in handling dependence tasks, also referred to as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), on these HDSs. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms for scheduling such DAGs in HDS fail to fully consider security requirements. In this paper, we systematically design a security-driven scheduling architecture that can dynamically measure the trust level of each node in the system by using differential equations. To do so, we introduce task priority rank to estimate security overhead of such security-critical tasks. Furthermore, we propose a security-driven scheduling algorithm for DAGs which can achieve high quality of security for applications. Our rigorous performance evaluation study results clearly demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing scheduling algorithms in terms of minimizing the makespan, risk probability, and speedup. We also observe that the improvement obtained by our algorithm increases as the security-sensitive data of applications increases.", "paper_title": "A Novel Security-Driven Scheduling Algorithm for Precedence-Constrained Tasks in Heterogeneous Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290867300009"}
