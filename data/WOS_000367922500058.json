Main obstacle for wide adoption of this technology is the concerns about its security and privacy issues. Many RFID authentication protocols have been proposed to provide desired security and privacy level for RFID systems. Recently, Benssalah et al. have proposed a chaotic map-based RFID security protocol. In this paper, we analyze the security of this protocol and discover its vulnerabilities. We show that message generation arises some weaknesses, and this protocol is vulnerable to tracking, tag impersonation, and de-synchronization attacks. The success probabilities of the proposed attacks are significant, and their complexities are polynomial. Furthermore, we propose an RFID authentication protocol. Our protocol utilizes the Chebyshev chaotic map hard problem and conforms to the EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 (EPC C1-G2) standard. Our protocol eliminates the weaknesses of the protocol of Benssalah et al.
