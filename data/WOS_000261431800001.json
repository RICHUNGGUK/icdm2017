In the present paper, we study the complexity of query evaluation on finite models for (various fragments of) inf-Datalog. We deduce a unified and elementary proof that global model-checking (i.e. computing all nodes satisfying a formula in a given structure) has 1. quadratic data complexity in time and linear program complexity in space for CTL and alternation-free modal mu-calculus, and 2. linear-space (data and program) complexities, linear-time program complexity and polynomial-time data complexity for L mu(k) (modal mu-calculus with fixed alternation-depth at most k).", "paper_title": "INF-DATALOG, MODAL LOGIC AND COMPLEXITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261431800001"}
