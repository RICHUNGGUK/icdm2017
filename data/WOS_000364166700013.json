Special attention is paid to the water and salt permeability constants (K-W, K-S) which affect the permeate and salt flux across the membrane. K-w and K-s are found to be strongly pressure-dependent for the batch system which is in-line with earlier observations for continuous RO systems. However, the most important findings of this work are the dependence of K-w and K-s on feed salinity, something that have never been observed or reported in the literature. In order to better qualify these observations, further experiments with the batch system are conducted with a constant feed salinity so that the operating condition resembles that of a continuous RO process.
