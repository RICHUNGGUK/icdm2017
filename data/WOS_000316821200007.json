In this setting a neighbour of the code is a vertex which differs in exactly one entry from some codeword. This paper examines codes with the property that some group of automorphisms acts transitively on the set of neighbours of the code. We call these codes neighbour transitive. We obtain sufficient conditions for a neighbour transitive group to fix the code setwise. Moreover, we construct an infinite family of neighbour transitive codes, with minimum distance delta = 4, where this is not the case. That is to say, knowledge of even the complete set of code neighbours does not determine the code.", "paper_title": "Neighbour transitivity on codes in Hamming graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316821200007"}
