However, to use these devices in an effective way, a precise modeling is required. in this sense, in this paper we consider a modified parameter identification method of large-scale magnetorheological dampers which are represented using the normalized Bouc-Wen model. The main benefit of the proposed identification algorithm is the accuracy of the parameter estimation. The validation of the parameter identification method has been carried out using a black box model of an MR damper in a smart base-isolated benchmark building. Magnetorheological dampers are used in this numerical platform both as isolation bearings as well as semi-active control devices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
