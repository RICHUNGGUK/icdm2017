A new Iterative Multi-label Propagation (IMP) algorithm for relational learning in multi-label data is proposed. Based on the information of the already categorized videos and their relations to other videos, the system assigns suitable categories-multiple labels to the unknown videos. The MapReduce approach to the IMP algorithm described in the paper enables processing of large datasets in parallel computing. The experiments carried out on 5-million videos dataset revealed the good efficiency of the multi-label classification for videos categorization. They have additionally shown that classification of all unknown videos required only several parallel iterations.", "paper_title": "Relational large scale multi-label classification method for video categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626800005"}
