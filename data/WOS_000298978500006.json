The paper uses a new type of objects blinking fractals that are not covered by traditional theories considering dynamics of self-similarity processes. It is shown that both traditional and blinking fractals can be successfully studied by a recent approach allowing one to work numerically with infinite and infinitesimal numbers. It is shown that blinking fractals can be applied for modeling complex processes of growth of biological systems including their season changes. The new approach allows one to give various quantitative characteristics of the obtained blinking fractals models of biological systems.", "paper_title": "Using Blinking Fractals for Mathematical Modeling of Processes of Growth in Biological Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298978500006"}
