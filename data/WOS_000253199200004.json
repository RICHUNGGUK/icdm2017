Of particular importance is the presented upper bound on the size of a maximal partial spread of H(3,q(2)). For q = 2,3, the presented upper bound is sharp. For q = 3, our results confirm via theoretical arguments properties, deduced by computer searches performed by Ebert and Hirschfeld, for the largest partial spreads of H(3,9). An overview of the status regarding these results is given in two summarizing tables. The similar results for the classical symplectic and orthogonal polar spaces are presented in De Beule et al.
