In this circuit, a cascode and cascade topology with modified input matching are designed in the frequency range of 3- 5 GHz. Choosing a common-gate technique presents greater flatness in broadband gain in the wide band frequency at the less than -3 dB input reflection coefficient. This approach allowed obtaining a flat broadband gain of 16.7 +/- 0.15 dB with an input reflection coefficient less than -5 dB, an output reflection coefficient less than -6 dB, and a noise figure less than 4.3 dB. It uses only 0.9 V voltage supply at 0.18 mu m technology and consumes 13 mW (excluding buffer).", "paper_title": "A 0.9V CMOS 3-5 Ghz broadband flat gain low-noise amplifier for ultra-wide band receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000324924500006"}
