Our conclusion is that Domberger's theory appears to be a useful lens for understanding IT outsourcing, and that further research using purpose-collected data is therefore warranted. Phrased differently, Domberger's four types of benefit of contracting - namely Specialization, Market Discipline, Flexibility, and Cost Savings - appear to be a good way of summarizing senior IT managers' explanations of why their organizations chose to outsource IT. The paper also conducts a preliminary test of the extent to which these four factors explain the purchasing organization's satisfaction with IT outsourcing.", "paper_title": "Does Domberger's theory of 'The Contracting Organization' explain why organizations outsource IT and the levels of satisfaction achieved?", "paper_id": "WOS:000248448300006"}
