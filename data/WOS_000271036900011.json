The power of DNA computing comes from the fact that it has great potential of massive data storage and processing computation over data in parallel. In this paper, an algorithm for solving the minimum finding problem is proposed in theory with a randomized scheme - the broadcasting scheme on the broadcast communication model. Our method is a novel strategy for optimization in DNA computing, since it can tolerate some chemistry reaction and experiment errors. The less errors are, the less the number of required iterations is. A series of computer simulations are also performed and analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm and the designed experiment.", "paper_title": "ERROR-TOLERANT MINIMUM FINDING WITH DNA COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900011"}
