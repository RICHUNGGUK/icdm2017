Such information is of great value for biologists in studying cellular processes and diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Existing approaches like RLIMS-P are mainly rule based. The performance lays much reliance on the completeness of rules. We propose an SVM-based system known as MinePhos which outperforms RLIMS-P in both precision and recall of information extraction when tested on a set of articles randomly chosen from PubMed.", "paper_title": "MinePhos: A Literature Mining System for Protein Phoshphorylation Information Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000296782200027"}
