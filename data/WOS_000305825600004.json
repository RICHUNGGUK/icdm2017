Post-translational modification (PTM) identification is a challenging problem in tandem mass spectral analysis. Results: In this article, we define two scoring functions for identifying peptides/proteins with PTMs from MS/MS spectra: match scores and diagonal scores, as well as two spectral identification problems based on the two scores. We propose several index-based algorithms for the two problems. Both theoretical and experimental analyses show that the index-based algorithms significantly improve on speed when compared with existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Speeding up tandem mass spectral identification using indexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305825600004"}
