This paper mainly deals with attribute reductions of an inconsistent decision information system based on a dependence space. Through the concept of inclusion degree, a generalized decision distribution function is first constructed. A decision distribution relation is then defined. On the basis of this decision distribution relation, a dependence space is proposed, and an equivalence congruence based on the indiscernibility attribute sets is also obtained. Applying the congruences on a dependence space, new approaches to find a distribution consistent set are formulated. The judgement theorems for judging distribution consistent sets are also established by using these congruences and the decision distribution relation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
