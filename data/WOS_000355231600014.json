In this paper, we propose the Trust value-based Local Mobile P2P (TLoMP) scheme, which is suitable for mobile P2P contents sharing based on trust values to reduce contents server traffic. After constructing a contents-sharing group based on trust values among mobile nodes which request identical multimedia contents from its server, this scheme attempts to reduce contents server traffic to improve the quality of services through contents sharing. We demonstrated that the TLoMP scheme reduces the contents server traffic more efficiently in terms of the total server bandwidth usage, comparing with the cluster-based protocol, through simulation. Especially, our scheme showed more improved performance than the existing protocol when mobile nodes are clustered more densely.", "paper_title": "A trust value-based scheme for efficient contents sharing over mobile P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600014"}
