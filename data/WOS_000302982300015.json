The present study analyzes in a controlled laboratory experiment how information presentation in three alternative formats (table, history graph and dance graph) influences the negotiators' behavior and negotiation outcomes. The results show that graphical information presentation supports integrative behavior and the use of non-compensatory strategies. Furthermore, information about the opponents' preferences increases the quality of outcomes but decreases post-negotiation satisfaction of negotiators. The implications for system designers are discussed. 0 (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
