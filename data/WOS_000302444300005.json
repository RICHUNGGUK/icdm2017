(We also consider its completely symmetric analog.) We discretize the initial-boundary-value problem for these systems, corresponding to homogeneous Difichlet boundary conditions on the velocity variable at the endpoints of a finite interval, using fully discrete Galerkin-finite element methods of high accuracy. We use the numerical schemes as exploratory tools to study the propagation and interactions of solitary-wave solutions of these systems, as well as other properties of their solutions.
