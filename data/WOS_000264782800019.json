This paper uses grey related analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory to deal with this fuzzy group decision making problem. First, in the individual aggregation, grey related analysis is employed as a means to reflect uncertainty in multi-attribute Models through interval numbers. Second, in the group aggregation, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) rule of combination is used to aggregate individual preferences into a collective preference, by which the candidate alternatives are ranked and the best alternative(s) are obtained. The proposed approach uses both quantitative and qualitative data for international supplier selection. It provides alternative tools to evaluate and improve supplier selection decisions in art uncertain global market.
