By employing the inequality b(m+1) Pi(k=1) b(k)(qk) <= 1/r Sigma(m)(k=1) q(k)b(k)(r) + (1/r)b(m+1)(r), (b(m+1) >= 0, bk >= 0, q(k) > 0 with 1 + Sigma(m)(k=1) q(k) = r, k = 1,..., m), applying homotopic mapping and conk= structing a new Lyapunov functional method,, we present some new criteria ensuring globally exponential stability and the existence of periodic oscillatory solution. These results are helpful to design globally exponential stability and periodic oscillatory for BAM neural network with delays. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
