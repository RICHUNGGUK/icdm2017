However, the agent-based computation and high-level interaction protocols foster the modem computation and distributed information processing successfully. The multi-agent system (MAS) plays an important role in the analysis of the human-interaction theory and model building. This study focuses on the formal description of MAS, the conflict-resolving mechanisms and the negotiation in MAS. The communication between agents has some special requirements. One of them is asynchronous communication. Used communication sequence process (CSP) to descript a model of agents communication with shared buffer channel. The essence of this model is very suitable for the multi-agents communication, so it is a base for our next step job. Based on the communication model, explored the distributed tasks dealing method among joint intention agents and with description of relation between tasks we give a figure of agents' organization. Agents communicate with each other in this kind of organization. The semantics of agent communication is another emphasis in this paper. With the detailed description of agents' communication process, given a general agent automated negotiation protocol based on speech act theory in MAS, then we use CSP to verify this protocol has properties of safety and liveness, so prove it is logic right. At last a frame of this protocol's realization was given.", "paper_title": "A novel multi-agent automated negotiation model based on associated intent", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100067"}
