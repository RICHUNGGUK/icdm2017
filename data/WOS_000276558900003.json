Two turbulence models are used: the Launder Sharma low-Reynolds number k-epsilon model and a non-linear extension sensitive to the anisotropy of turbulence. The Reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and obstacle side is Re =2.2 x 10(4). The present numerical results have been obtained using a finite volume code that solves the governing equations in a vertical plane, located at the lateral mid-point of the channel. The pressure field is obtained with the SIMPLE algorithm. A bounded version of the third-order QUICK scheme is used for the convective terms. Comparisons of the numerical results with the experimental data indicate that a preliminary steady solution of the governing equations using the linear k-epsilon does not lead to correct flow field predictions in the wake region downstream of the square cylinder. Consequently, the time derivatives of dependent variables are included in the transport equations and are discretized using the second-order Crank Nicolson scheme. The unsteady computations using the linear and non-linear k-epsilon models significantly improve the velocity field predictions. However, the linear k-epsilon shows a number of predictive deficiencies, even in unsteady flow computations, especially in the prediction of the turbulence field. The introduction of a non-linear k-epsilon model brings the two-dimensional unsteady predictions of the time-averaged velocity and turbulence fields and also the predicted values of the global parameters such as the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient to close agreement with the data.
