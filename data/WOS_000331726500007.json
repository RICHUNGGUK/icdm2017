To avoid subjectivity in diagnosis, we propose an ontology driven decision support method which is an automated procedure for diagnosing MCI through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this approach, we encode specialized MRI knowledge into an ontology and construct a rule set using machine learning algorithms. Then we apply these two parts in conjunction with reasoning engine to automatically distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). The rule set is trained by MRI data of 187 MCI patients and 177 normal controls selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using C4.5 algorithm. By using a 10-fold cross validation, we prove that the performance of C4.5 with 80.2% sensitivity is better than other algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian network (BN) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, and C4.5 is suitable for the construction of reasoning rules. Meanwhile, the evaluation results suggest that our approach would be useful to assist physicians efficiently in real clinical diagnosis for the disease of MCI. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
