The conventional operational transconductance amplifers (OTAs)-comparator is replaced with a Schmitt trigger to significantly reduce the delay. This Schmitt trigger is implemented by a differential structure operating in the subthreshold region to generate a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) hysteresis. Both the voltage reference and the current source are made PTAT as well. The proposed oscillator can be made ultra-low power and have excellent frequency stability over process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation.", "paper_title": "Relaxation Oscillator Exploiting PTAT Hysteresis of Differential Schmitt Trigger", "paper_id": "WOS:000363784800003"}
