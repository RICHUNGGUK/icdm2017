However, the SIP-NEMO handoff delay has been shown to be more than 320 ms, which is intolerable for real-time services. In this paper, we focus on reducing the SIP-NEMO handoff delay. We design a soft handoff mechanism for SIP-NEMO and implement a test-bed for it with soft handoff support. The experimental results indicate that our SIP-NEMO with soft handoff support can effectively reduce the handoff disruption time from those of SIP-NEMO without soft handoff and MIPv4-NEMO with fast handover. Thus, our proposed soft handoff mechanism for SIP-NEMO can improve the handoff performance so it can meet the delay requirements of real-time multimedia applications.
