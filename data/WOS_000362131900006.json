We also show the existence of infinite additive-cube-free words on several ternary alphabets. To achieve this, we give sufficient conditions for a morphism to be k-abelian-n-power-free (resp. additive-n-power-free), and then we give several morphisms which respect these conditions. Additionally, all our constructions show that the number of such words grows exponentially. As a corollary, we get a new lower bound of 3(1/19) = 1.059526 ... for the growth rate of abelian-cube-free words. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
