In this system, a pair (E-s, E-pb) of elliptic curves over F(2)161 is constructed with the following properties: (i) the Gaudry-Hess-Smart Weil descent attack reduces the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in E-s(F(2)161) to a hyperelliptic curve DLP in the Jacobian of a curve of genus 7 or 8, which is computationally feasible, but by far not trivial; (ii) E-pb is isogenous to E-s; (iii) the best attack on the ECDLP in E-pb(F(2)161) is the parallelized Pollard rho method. The curve E-pb is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve E-s is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.", "paper_title": "An elliptic curve trapdoor system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234310800005"}
