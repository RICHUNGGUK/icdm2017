We use a new aggregation operator that uses the uncertain weighted average (UWA) and the uncertain induced ordered weighted averaging (UIOWA) operator in the same formulation. We call it the uncertain induced ordered weighted averaging - weighted averaging (UIOWAWA) operator. We study some of the main advantages and properties of the new aggregation such as the uncertain arithmetic UIOWA (UA-UIOWA) and the uncertain arithmetic UWA (UAUWA). We study its applicability in a multi-person decision making problem concerning the selection of holiday trips. We see that depending on the particular type of UIOWAWA operator used, the results may lead to different decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
