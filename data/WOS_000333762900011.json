In contrast to existing relaxations, we can handle the combination of nonconvex data terms with coupled regularizers such as l(2)-regularizers. The key idea is to consider a collection of hypersurfaces with a relaxation that takes into account the entire functional rather than separately treating the data term and the regularizers. We provide a theoretical analysis, detail the implementations for different functionals, present run time and memory requirements, and experimentally demonstrate that the coupled l(2)-regularizers give systematic improvements regarding denoising, inpainting, and optical flow estimation.", "paper_title": "Convex Relaxation of Vectorial Problems with Coupled Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000333762900011"}
