We give slightly improved lower bounds on the covering radii of extremal doubly even self-dual codes of lengths 64, 80 and 96. The covering radii of some known extremal doubly even self-dual [64, 32, 12] codes are determined.", "paper_title": "On the covering radii of extremal doubly even self-dual codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707400006"}
