The introduction of social interactions, which influence the decisions of individual agents, leads to a generalization of the quantum decision theory (QDT) developed earlier by the authors for separate individuals. The generalized approach is free of the standard paradoxes of classical decision theory. This approach also explains the error-attenuation effects observed for the paradoxes occurring when decision makers, who are members of a society, consult with each other, increasing in this way the available mutual information. A precise correspondence between QDT and classical utility theory is formulated via the introduction of an intermediate probabilistic version of utility theory of a novel form, which obeys the requirement that zero-utility prospects should have zero probability weights.", "paper_title": "Role of Information in Decision Making of Social Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000362479800010"}
