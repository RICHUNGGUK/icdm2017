In this paper, we investigate the attribute reduction in decision systems based on a congruence on the power set of attributes and present a method of determining congruence classifications. We can obtain the reducts of attributes in decision systems by using the classification. Moreover, we prove that the reducts obtained by the congruence classification coincide with the distribution reducts in decision systems.", "paper_title": "Rough set attribute reduction in decision systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500020"}
