Hasselblad's history illustrates how digital technology emerges in various high-end niche applications and later enters the mainstream markets and displaces incumbents. The Hasselblad case exemplifies how incumbent firms encounter difficulties when such technologies render their skills and products obsolete.", "paper_title": "Hasselblad and the Shift to Digital Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000293981300006"}
