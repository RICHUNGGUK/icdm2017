In the second part, a study concerning the constructive process and the geometrical non-linearity on the previous models is developed. Firstly we consider the procedure to include various construction stages in the finite element formulation of a structural problem. Then a geometrical non-linear analysis is applied to the two global models of the temple, the historical model of 1927 state and the actual state model, comparing the results obtained with the linear ones and explaining the problems encountered. Afterwards, a hypothetical constructive process is applied to the global models by means of the geometrical non-linearity, verifying and explaining the importance of this type of analyses in the obtained numerical results, especially in the Regina Martirum dome. Finally, applying the non-linear staged construction, the effects of an excavation ditch made in 1996 on the temple are considered. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
