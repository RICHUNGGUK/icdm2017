For every alpha > 0 there exists a constant C - C(alpha) such that the following holds for all r >= Cp-n/2 and for almost all sets R of size r of F-p(n). Let A be any subset of R of size at least alpha r; then A contains a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression. This is an analogue of a hard theorem by Kohayakawa, Luczak and Rodl. The proof uses a version of Green's regularity lemma for subsets of a typical random set, which is of interest in its own right.", "paper_title": "On the Distribution of Three-Term Arithmetic Progressions in Sparse Subsets of F-p(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000294432800011"}
