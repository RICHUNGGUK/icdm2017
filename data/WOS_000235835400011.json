Their use was based more on engineering intuition than on deep mathematical treatment. Here we collect several criteria that a fuzzy controller should satisfy in order to represent the meaning of the rule base. Surprisingly, these conditions are often ignored and violated. Sometimes this is caused only by wrong design, but there are cases when the principle of the controller does not admit to satisfy these criteria. We discuss them in more detail and formulate conclusions for selection of an appropriate type of fuzzy controller.", "paper_title": "Mathematical aspects of fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835400011"}
