The suggested method is capable of continuously delivering the most relevant spam emails from the collection of all spam emails that are reported by the members of the network. Mail servers could implement the anti-spam technology by using the \"black lists\" that have been already recognized. Two main concepts are introduced, which defines the behavior-based characteristics of spam and to continuously identify the similar groups of spam when processing the spam streams. Experiment results using real-world datasets reveal that the proposed technology is reliable, efficient and scalable. Since no single technology can achieve one hundred percent spam detection with zero false positives, the proposed method may be used in conjunction with other filtering systems to minimize errors.", "paper_title": "Artificial immune system inspired behavior-based anti-spam filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000244954400004"}
