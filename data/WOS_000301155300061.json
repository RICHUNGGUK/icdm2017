The ANLP is a NP-hard problem where a set of distributed terminals, with distinct rate demands, must be assigned to a variable number of concentrators subject to capacity constraints. We consider the possibility of choosing between different concentrator models is given in order to provide service demand at different cost. The ANLP is relevant in communication networks design, and has been considered before within the design of MPLS networks, for example. The approach we propose to tackle the ANLP problem consists of a hybrid Grouping Harmony Search (GHS) algorithm with a local search method and a technique for repairing unfeasible solutions. Moreover, the presented scheme also includes the adaptation of the GHS to a differential scheme, where each proposed harmony is obtained from the same harmony in the previous iteration. This differential scheme is perfectly adapted to the specifications of the ANLP problem, as it utilizes the grouping concept based on the proximity between nodes, instead of being only based on the grouping concept. This allows for a higher efficiency on the searching process of the algorithm. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in synthetic instances show that this proposal provides faster convergence rate, less computational complexity and better statistical performance than alternative algorithms for the ANLP, such as grouping genetic algorithms, specially when the size of the scenario increases. We also include practical results for the application of GHS to a real wireless network deployment problem in Bizkaia, northern Spain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
