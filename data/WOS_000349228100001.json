In this paper, we propose a heuristic global static routing algorithm to mitigate traffic congestion on two-layer complex networks. The proposed routing algorithm extends the relevant static weighted routing algorithm in the literature [Y. Zhou, Y. F. Peng, X. L. Yang and K. P. Long, Phys. Sci. 84, 055802 (2011)]. Our routing path is constructed from a proper assignment of edge weights by considering the static information of both layers and an adjustable parameter alpha. When this routing algorithm is adopted on BA-BA two-layer networks with an appropriate parameter alpha, it can achieve the maximum network traffic capacity compared with the shortest path (SP) routing algorithm and the static weighted routing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Improved efficient static weighted routing strategy on two-layer complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349228100001"}
