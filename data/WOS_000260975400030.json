Those authors showed that certain tiling problems could be encoded by regular languages, which lead automatically to generating functions and other combinatorial information on tilings. We introduce a method of simplifying the DFA's recognizing these language, which leads to bijective proofs of certain tiling identities. We apply these ideas to some other tiling problems, including three-dimensional tilings and tilings with triangles and rhombi. We also study graph-theoretic variations of these tiling problems.
