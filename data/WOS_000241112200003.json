In this paper, a novel method of visualization of video content is proposed. First of all, the content is segmented into shots, and then a spatio-temporal color signature of shots, based on color distribution in the frames, is proposed. This spatio-temporal color signature serves as a basis for graph clustering and graph visualization tools. Those, integrated in a platform for visualization of huge graphs, Tulip, supply an exciting graph-based navigation interface for multimedia content. The results obtained on feature documentaries are promising.", "paper_title": "DAG-based visual interfaces for navigation in indexed video content", "paper_id": "WOS:000241112200003"}
