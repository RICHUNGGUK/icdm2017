We show that Maker, occupying one edge in each of his turns, can build a spannng tree, even if Breaker occupies b < (1 - o(l)) . n/In n edges in each turn. This improves a result of Beck, and is asymptotically best possible as witnessed by the Breaker-strategy of Chvatal and Erdos. We also give a strategy for Maker to occupy a graph with minimum degree c (where c = c(n) is a slowly growing function of it) while playing against a Breaker who takes b <= (1 - o(l)) . n/In n edges in each turn. This result improves earlier bounds by Krivelevich and Szabo. Both of our results support the Surprising random graph intuition: the threshold bias is asymptotically the same for the game played by two \"clever\" players and the game played by two \"random\" players.
