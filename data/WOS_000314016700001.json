Medium resolution structures both from cryoEM and X-ray crystallography show the general topology of the protein and positions of helices in parts of DNA-PKcs. EM-Fold, an algorithm developed for building protein models into medium resolution density maps has been used to generate models for the heat repeat-like \"Ring structure\" of the molecule. We were able to computationally corroborate placement of the N-terminus of the domain that supports a previously published hypothesis. Targeted experiments are suggested to test the model.
