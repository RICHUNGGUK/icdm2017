However, existing models have been limited by challenges such as handling of multiple datasets, parameter definition and the calibration procedures in the modeling process. Bayesian network (BN) formalisms provide an alternative method to address the drawbacks of these existing models. This study proposes a hybrid model that integrates BNs, CA and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to model land use change. The transition rules of the CA model are generated from a graphical formalism where the key land use drivers are represented by nodes and the dependencies between them are expressed by conditional probabilities extracted from historical spatial datasets. The results indicate that the proposed model is able to realistically simulate and forecast spatio-temporal process of land use change. Further, it forms the basis for new synergies in CA model design that can lead to improved model outcomes.", "paper_title": "Coupling Bayesian networks with GIS-based cellular automata for modeling land use change", "paper_id": "WOS:000241576100015"}
