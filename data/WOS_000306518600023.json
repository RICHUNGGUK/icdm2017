Transmitters are assumed to transmit independent data streams on a limited number of channel modes which limits the rank of transmit covariance matrices. An approximation for the spectral efficiency in the interference-limited regime as a function of link-length, interferer density, number of antennas per receiver and transmitter, number of transmit streams, and path-loss exponent is derived. It is found that targeted-receiver CSI, which can be acquired with low overhead in duplex systems with reciprocity, can increase spectral efficiency several fold, particularly when link lengths are large, node density is high, or both. Additionally, the per-link spectral efficiency is found to be a function of the ratio of node density to the number of receiver antennas, and it can often be improved if nodes transmit using fewer streams. These results are validated for finite-sized systems by Monte-Carlo simulation and are asymptotic in the regime where the number of users and antennas per receiver approach infinity.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Spectral Efficiency of Multiantenna Links in Wireless Networks With Limited Tx CSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600023"}
