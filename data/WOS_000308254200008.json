The switching properties were induced by redox means. Both oxidation and reduction stimulus have been considered, and calculations have been performed both for the complexes and for the free benzo[c]thiophene derivative ligand in order to elucidate the role played by the organometallic fragment on the second-order NLO properties of these complexes. B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and M06 functionals were used for our calculations. The results show some important. structural changes upon oxidation/reduction that, are accompanied by Significant differences on the corresponding second-order NLO properties. TD-DFT calculations show that these differences. on the second-order NLO response upon oxidation/reduction are due to a change in the charge transfer. pattern, in which the organometallic iron and ruthenium moieties. play an important role. The calculated static hyperpolarizabilities were found to be strongly functional dependent. CAM-B3LYP, however, seems to predict- more reliable structural and optical data as well as hyperpolarizabilities when compared to experimental data. The Use of this functional predicts that the studied complexes can be viewed as acting as redox second-order NLO switches, in particular using oxidation stimulus. The beta(tot) value of one-electron oxidized species is at least similar to 8.3 times (for Ru complex) and similar to 5.5 times (for Fe complex) as large as that of its nonoxidized counterparts.", "paper_title": "Switchable Nonlinear Optical Properties of eta(5)-Monocyclopentadienylmetal Complexes: A DFT Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000308254200008"}
