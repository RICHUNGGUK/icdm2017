This may yield a Nash equilibrium with unbounded Coordination Ratio [E. Koutsoupias, C. Papadimitriou, Worst-case equilibria, in: 16th Annual Symposium oil Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, STACS, vol. 1563, 1999. pp. 404-413; T. Roughgarden, E Tardos, How bad is selfish routing? in: 41st IEEE Annual Symposium of Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, 2000, pp. 93-102]. A Leader can decrease the coordination ratio by assigning flow alpha r on M, and then all Followers assign selfishly the (1 - alpha)r remaining flow. This is a Stackelberg Scheduling Instance (M, r, alpha), 0 <= alpha <= 1. It was shown [T. Roughgarden, Stackelberg scheduling strategies, in: 33rd Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC, 2001, pp. 104-113] that it is weakly NP-hard to Compute the optirnal Leader's strategy. For any such network M we efficiently compute the minimum portion beta(M) of flow r > 0 needed by a Leader to induce M's optimum cost, as well as her optimal strategy. This shows that the optimal Leader's strategy on instances (M, r, alpha > beta(M)) is in P. Unfortunately, Stackelberg routing in more general nets can be arbitrarily hard. Roughgarden presented a modification of Braess's Paradox graph, Such that no strategy controlling ar flow can induce <= 1/alpha times the optimum cost. However, we show that our main result also applies to any s-t net G. We take care of the Braess's graph explicitly, as a convincing example. Finally, we extend this result to k commodities.
