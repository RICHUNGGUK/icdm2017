Such projects are characterized by tens of thousands of tasks, which are consequently burdensome and difficult to plan manually. This is true to the point that in many shipyards only a low level of detail is used and poor planning is generally performed. The proposed approach is called computer-aided activity planning (CAAP), and an application in the yachting industry is shown to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, the so-called outfitting planning problem is faced. The CAAP system, taking into account the available shipyard resources and the knowledge on the building rules is able to automatically define, sequence, and schedule the activities of the whole outfitting process acting as a \"planning configurator\". Moreover, it allows the industry-specific knowledge to be stored, maintained and shared within the (extended) organization. Owing to these \"building blocks\", plans can be defined accurately and in a shorter time starting from pre-defined templates, with particular impact on lead times whenever variations to complex projects are needed. Finally, to verify the actual capabilities of the approach, the CAAP was implemented within a prototypical software called NautiCAAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
