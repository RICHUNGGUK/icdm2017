It uses particle filters to predict UAV trajectories taking into account the model of the UAV and of the atmospheric conditions and also considering uncertainties. A waypoint generation module computes intermediate waypoints in order to ensure that the trajectory achieves the required levels of safety (avoids forbidden zones) and mission achievement (passes through way-zones). The method has been applied to collection of data from wireless sensor network and has been validated in the airfield of Bollullos in the Spanish province of Seville.", "paper_title": "Data Retrieving From Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network Nodes Using UAVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000281669500006"}
