We extend the Balanced method to introduce a class of stable strong order 1.0 numerical schemes for solving stochastic ordinary differential equations. We derive convergence results for this class of numerical schemes. We illustrate the asymptotic stability of this class of schemes is illustrated and is compared with contemporary schemes of strong order 1.0. We present some evidence on parametric selection with respect to minimising the error convergence terms. Furthermore we provide a convergence result for general Balanced style schemes of higher orders.", "paper_title": "Stable strong order 1.0 schemes for solving stochastic ordinary differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000308234600002"}
