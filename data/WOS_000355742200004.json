One of the benefits of service-oriented architecture is enabling the composition of services and composing value-added services, which are called composite services. A challenging problem of trust management in composite services is how to propagate the consumers' perceptions of composite services to their component services. Due to the opaque nature of service composition, the consumer does not know the underlying components of a composite service. Therefore, a consumer can only provide a single feedback rating for the composite service. In this paper, we propose a fair approach for propagating the user's rating to component services by considering both the past behavior trend of each component service and the internal ratings among component services. The proposed approach is capable of propagating trust in both horizontal and vertical composition, without the need of monitoring component services.", "paper_title": "A method for fair propagation of user perceptions for trust management in composite services", "paper_id": "WOS:000355742200004"}
