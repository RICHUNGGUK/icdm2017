SKIMS designs and implements a cooperative, cross-layer security system for mobile devices. Detection mechanisms as well as a proactive and reactive defense of attacks are core components of this project. In this demo, we show a comprehensive proof-of-concept of our approaches, which include entropy-based malware detection, a mobile honeypot, and spontaneous, socio-inspired trust establishment.", "paper_title": "Vitamin C for your Smartphone: The SKIMS Approach for Cooperative and Lightweight Security at Mobiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600041"}
