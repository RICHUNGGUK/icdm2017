In addition, the model also supports the detection of the consistency problems existed in dynamic architecture. In the end, the mapping from SA to DLL is discussed, and an example of a complete architecture model of Pipeline-Filter style is described.", "paper_title": "A DDL-based software architecture model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500051"}
