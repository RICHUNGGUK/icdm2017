Since UML models include domain knowledge in themselves, which was verified by domain experts, it is helpful to use these models as when we start to construct domain ontology. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting ontological concepts, properties, restrictions and instances from UML models. We compare the UML metamodel with the OWL metamodel, and define transformation rules for constructing OWL-encoded ontology. We expect that the generated ontology plays a role of an early stage model for ontology development.", "paper_title": "A metamodel-based approach for extracting ontological semantics from UML models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200040"}
