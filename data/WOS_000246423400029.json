Even when the trained network performs adequately, it is very difficult to understand its operation. In this letter, we use the mathematical equivalence between ANNs and a specific fuzzy rule base to extract the knowledge embedded in the network. We demonstrate this using a benchmark problem: the recognition of digits produced by a light emitting diode (LED) device. The method provides a symbolic and comprehensible description of the knowledge learned by the network during its training.", "paper_title": "Knowledge extraction from neural networks using the all-permutations fuzzy rule base: The LED display recognition problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000246423400029"}
