However, the linearisation processing of the FEKF introduces truncation error, which degrades the estimation precision. In order to reduce the error, a new iterated fuzzy extended Kalman filter (IFEKF), based on the FEKF and the maximum a posteriori estimation, is proposed in this article. Compared with the FEKF, the proposed algorithm can be used not only to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty, but also to reduce the truncation error and to estimate the states more accurately. With an algebraic example and a passive location simulation, it is shown that the IFEKF has better estimation precision than that of the FEKF.", "paper_title": "An iterated fuzzy extended Kalman filter for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278010100011"}
