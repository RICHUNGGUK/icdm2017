This paper presents a derivation method for real-time systems with realistic constraints on their behaviour. We develop a high-level interval-based logic that provides flexibility in an implementation, yet allows algebraic reasoning over multiple granularities and sampling multiple sensors with delay. The semantics of an action system is given in terms of interval predicates and algebraic operators to unify the logics for an action system and its properties, which in turn simplifies the calculations and derivations.
