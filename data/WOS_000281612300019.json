In this paper we present a novel approach of an indirect adaptive control using hierarchical fuzzy CMAC neuronal networks. We show the full design and the stability analysis of this new structure. Experiment results are obtained via our prototype of the ball and plate system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
