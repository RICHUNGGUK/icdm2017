We work within the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions paradigm and show how an agent may use concepts suggested by Artificial Immune Systems to dynamically change its intentions in response to a dynamically changing environment. We illustrate these ideas with teams of agents who must either compete or cooperate in the context of simple artificial games in order to fulfil their specific desires. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
