For systems with (vector) relative degrees, we propose a kind of compensators which can compensate for the accumulated output deviation completely caused by quantization. The proposed compensators are capable of keeping the differences of the input-output responses between the systems with quantized inputs and the original systems without considering quantization within certain small bounds. Simulations show that the compensators in this paper are robust with respect to model uncertainties, disturbance and measurement noise and can significantly improve the input-output responses of systems with both input quantization and packet dropouts.", "paper_title": "On the design of compensator for quantization-caused input-output deviation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289902100011"}
