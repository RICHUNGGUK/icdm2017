This abstraction is formalized within the applied pi-calculus by using an equational theory which characterizes the cryptographic semantics of secret share. We also present an encoding from the equational theory into a convergent rewriting system, which is suitable for the automated protocol verifier ProVerif. Based on that, we verify the threshold certificate protocol in ProVerif.", "paper_title": "A Finite Equivalence of Verifiable Multi-secret Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572700001"}
