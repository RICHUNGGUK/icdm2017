This ensures that a choreography once specified can be deployed and executed in every workflow system within a Grid environment. It is likely that the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) will have the corresponding broad support in the industry. In order to become first class citizens in the Grid, choreographies have to comply with the resource framework. We therefore suggest steps to make BPEL compliant with the resource framework. As a result, features of BPEL such as extended transactions will be available in a Grid environment.
