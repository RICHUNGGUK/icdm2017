An achievable rate region and an outer bound to the capacity region of a class of interference channels were obtained in previous work by Telatar and Tse as unions over all possible input distributions. In contrast to that previous work on the MIMO IC, a simple and an explicit achievable coding scheme are obtained here and shown to have the constant-gap-to-capacity property and in which the sub-rates of the common and private messages of each user are explicitly specified for each achievable rate pair. The constant-gap-to-capacity results are thus proved in this work by first establishing explicit upper and lower bounds to the capacity region. A reciprocity result is also proved which is that the capacity of the reciprocal MIMO IC is within a constant gap of the capacity region of the forward MIMO IC.", "paper_title": "The Capacity Region of the MIMO Interference Channel and Its Reciprocity to Within a Constant Gap", "paper_id": "WOS:000321928500006"}
