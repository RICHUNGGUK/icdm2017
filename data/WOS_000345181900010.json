We investigate payoff guarantees that are expressed in terms of the extremity of the upcrossings. We obtain an exact and elegant characterisation of the guarantees that can be achieved. Moreover, we derive a simple canonical strategy for each attainable guarantee. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Buy low, sell high", "paper_id": "WOS:000345181900010"}
