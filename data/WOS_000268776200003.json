Because multiple-access interference is a major limiting factor for the WiMAX mesh network, Multi-channel transmission can eliminate the interference and improve the throughput of the network. The efficiency of Multi-channel transmission can be affected by the scheduling and channel assignment algorithm. To reap the full performance potential of WiMAX architecture, we propose a new combined centralized scheduling and channel assignment algorithm called ALS-DSATUR (Active Link Scheduling-Degree of SATURation) for use in a Multi-channel Single-transceiver WiMAX mesh network. the proposed scheme can reduce the length of scheduling, particularly for insufficient channels with high network node density, and considerably improve the base station's aggregate throughput to improved mobile magement effacy.", "paper_title": "On Centralized Scheduling and Channel Assignment Scheme for WiMAX Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268776200003"}
