The GIMFs, which are defined on the basis of GIMSs, play a very important part in the entire process of the development of the calculus theory for GIMSs. After the discussion of some basic results related to the continuities, derivatives and differentials of GIMFs, in this paper, two kinds of indefinite integrals are proposed and some fundamental properties are investigated.", "paper_title": "Indefinite integrals of generalized intuitionistic multiplicative functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000364507600004"}
