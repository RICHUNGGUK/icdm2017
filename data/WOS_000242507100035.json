However. due to L limited power budget of MSs (Mobile Stations) or the increase in ICI (Inter-Cell Interference), a required QoS (Quality of Service) may not be maintained. This paper addresses an optimal LCRTD (Loading Control based on Region-Time Division) over multi-cell environments for an efficient uplink QoS control. In the LCRTD scheme, a cell is divided into several regions by utilizing an optimization approach under QoS constraints. and users in each region are allowed to send their data at the allocated time slots. In the simulation, it is demonstrated that a decrease of 26% in the transmit power can be obtained.", "paper_title": "Optimal loading control based on region-time division for uplink broadband cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100035"}
