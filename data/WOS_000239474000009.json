However, the digital signature enabled approach is too costly for MANET due to the computation overheads. In addition, due to the diversity of different routing protocols, a universal scheme that suits all MANET routing systems does not exist in the literature. Specifically, an authentication scheme for the AODV routing is believed to be not suitable to the DSR routing. In this paper, we first introduce an efficient ID-based online/offline scheme for authentication in AODV and then provide a formal transformation to convert the scheme to an ID-based online/offline multisignature scheme. Our scheme is unique, in the sense that a single ID-based online/offline signature scheme can be applied to both AODV and DSR routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Online/Offline signatures and multisignatures for AODV and DSR routing security", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474000009"}
