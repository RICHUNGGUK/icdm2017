Using a statistical mechanics approach, cellular automata dynamical classes were approximated for cellular automata defined on genus-0, genus-1 and genus-2 2-manifolds. A distribution-free equality test for empirical distributions was applied to identify cases in which Wolfram classes were distributed differently across topologies. This result implies that global structure and local dynamics contribute to the long term evolution of cellular automata.", "paper_title": "The Dynamics of Cellular Automata on 2-Manifolds is Affected by Topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000364606800001"}
