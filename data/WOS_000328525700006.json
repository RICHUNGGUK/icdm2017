In the construction phase and in order to digitally fabricate sheet metal roof panels, the contractor has to measure end-to-end dimensions of boundaries of every roof plane with a certain level of accuracy (i.e., errors less than +/-2 cm). This is necessary to be able to cut sheet metal coil such that different pieces perfectly fit together. Obtaining these measurements using the exiting roof surveying methods could be costly in terms of equipment, labor, and/or worker exposure to safety hazards. This paper presents a video-based surveying framework as an alternative method which is simple to use, automated, less expensive, and safe. When using this framework, the contractor collects video streams with a calibrated stereo camera set. The captured data is processed to automatically generate a 3D wire-diagram of the target roof. Measurements from the wire-diagram are saved in a digital file (XML format) which could be loaded into an on-site sheet metal folding and cutting machine. Experimental analyses demonstrate applicability of the proposed framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
