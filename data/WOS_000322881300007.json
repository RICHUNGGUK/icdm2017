In this sense, they generalize the classical families of Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi, and include as a special case the family of CPRS orthogonal polynomials introduced by Cariena et al. (J. Phys. A 41:085301, 2008). We formulate the following conjecture: every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system is related to a classical system by a Darboux-Crum transformation. We give a proof of this conjecture for codimension 2 exceptional orthogonal polynomials (X-2-OPs). As a by-product of this analysis, we prove a Bochner-type theorem classifying all possible X-2-OPSs. The classification includes all cases known to date plus some new examples of X-2-Laguerre and X-2-Jacobi polynomials.", "paper_title": "A Conjecture on Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000322881300007"}
