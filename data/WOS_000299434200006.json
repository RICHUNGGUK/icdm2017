Finite element models of a four-unit FPP were generated. An extreme condition was simulated, using only two immediately loaded implants in order to derive recommendations for possible clinical application. Straight and 20 degrees-angled abutments and bonded or sliding contact between the bridge and abutment were simulated. In addition, two models were generated with two completely osseointegrated implants. A 150 N load to the prosthesis at a 458 angle to the long axis of each implant was applied. Minor differences were observed in implant displacements, stress and strain distributions of the two abutment designs. However, bone loading exceeded the physiological limits, including a risk of bone atrophy. A considerable decrease in implant displacements and bone loading was observed in the osseointegrated cases. An FPP supported by only two implants cannot be recommended for immediate loading.", "paper_title": "Finite element investigation of implant-supported fixed partial prosthesis in the premaxilla in immediately loaded and osseointegrated states", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434200006"}
