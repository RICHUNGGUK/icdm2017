However, until now, the power-drain rate of mobile nodes is very high in comparison with the available power of portable batteries. To reduce the energy consumption of mobile nodes, we present an integrated IP paging protocol (IIPP) by integrating the IP-layer paging protocol based on Mobile IPv4 regional registration (MIPRR) with a power save mechanism. IIPP reduces the frequency of signaling messages between mobile nodes and networks. When not sending or receiving data for a certain time, mobile nodes enter power save mode (PSM), and consume very low power. We formulate analytical models and carry out simulations to evaluate the proposed IIPR The results show that, compared to MIPRR, IIPP significantly reduces the average power consumption of the mobile node and signaling overheads in the network.
