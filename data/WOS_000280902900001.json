The set of vertices in G with maximum (minimum) distance is the antimedian (median) set of a graph G. It is proved that for arbitrary graphs G and J and a positive integer r >= 2, there exists a connected graph H, such that G is the antimedian and J the median subgraphs of H, respectively, and that d(H)(G,J) = r. When both G and J are connected, G and J can in addition be made convex subgraphs of H. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
