Numerous design methodologies and tools have been proposed, mostly targeting custom very large scale integration (VLSI) chips. The advent of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has attracted many researchers to incorporate previously acquired knowledge and experience in designing VLSI chips, to this new technology. This paper addresses the issue of the implementation of regular algorithms into FPGAs and presents a novel design tool for the implementation of RIAs, formulated as dependence graphs (DGs), on systolic arrays. Furthermore, a platform scheme for the systolic arrays hardware realization is proposed.", "paper_title": "A NEW PLATFORM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULAR ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS INTO FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296629700001"}
