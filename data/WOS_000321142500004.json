The proposed system integrates patient health monitoring, status logging for capturing various problems or symptoms met, and social sharing of the recorded information within the patient's community, aiming to facilitate disease management. A prototype is implemented on a mobile device illustrating the feasibility and applicability of the presented work by adopting unobtrusive vital signs monitoring through a wearable multisensing device, a service-oriented architecture for handling communication issues, and popular microblogging services. Furthermore, a study has been conducted with 16 hypertensive patients, in order to investigate the user acceptance, the usefulness, and the virtue of the proposed system. The results show that the system is welcome by the chronic patients who are especially willing to share healthcare information, and is easy to learn and use, while its features have been overall regarded by the patients as helpful for their disease management and treatment.", "paper_title": "A Pervasive Health System Integrating Patient Monitoring, Status Logging, and Social Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000321142500004"}
