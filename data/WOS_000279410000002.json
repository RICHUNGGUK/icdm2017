A cost functional representing the balance of the regulated quantities with different weights and interaction parameter N (Lorentz force) has been constituted, where the regulated quantities related with flow and force are taken as targets of regulation and the Lorentz force, (as interaction parameter N), is taken as a control input. Based on the cost functional and Navier-Stokes equations, the corresponding adjoint equations have been derived and the sensitivity of the cost functional is found to be a simple function of the adjoint stream function in the adjoint field. For the different regulations, the forms of optimal control rules are similar while the adjoint equations are different. The receding-horizon predictive control setting is employed to discuss the optimal control problems. Under the action of optimal N(t), the flow separation is suppressed fully, so that the oscillations of drag and lift are suppressed and the total drag coefficient decreases dramatically. For the different regulations, the control effects have some differences due to the different values of optimal inputs corresponding to the different adjoint flow fields. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
