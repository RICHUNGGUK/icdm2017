The work reported here focuses on modelling the Wireless Internet traffic using realistic traffic traces collected over wireless networks and forecasting the end-to-end QoS parameters for the networks. A measurement framework is set-up to collect the QoS parameters and a traffic model is designed based on Hidden Markov Model considering joint distribution of End to End Delay (E2ED or d), Inter-Packet Delay Variation (IPDV) and Packet Size. States are mapped to the four traffic classes namely conversational, streaming, interactive, and background. The model is validated by forecasting QoS parameters and the results are shown to be within the tolerance limit.", "paper_title": "A joint parametric prediction model for wireless internet traffic using Hidden Markov Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700010"}
