Our parallel approach is based on a multilevel ILU preconditioner which preserves the mathematical semantics of the sequential method in ILU-PACK. We exploit the parallelism exposed by the task tree corresponding to the nested dissection hierarchy (task parallelism), employ dynamic scheduling of tasks to processors to improve load balance, and formulate all stages of the parallel PCG method conformal with the computation of the preconditioner to increase data reuse. Results on a CC-NUMA platform with 16 processors reveal the parallel efficiency of this solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
