However, recent research showed the possibility of digital controllers with several advantages such as robustness, fast design time, and high flexibility. Since DC-DC converted output voltage is analog in nature, an analog-to-digital interface circuit is always essential even in digital PWM controllers. A simple and efficient delta-sigma modulator is used as a conversion circuit in our silicon implementation. Measurement results show good voltage regulations.", "paper_title": "Digital PWM controller with one-bit noise-shaping interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000239755000002"}
