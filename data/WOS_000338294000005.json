We prove that for all sufficiently large k, there exist two constants epsilon(k) >= sigma(k) > 0, with epsilon(k) -> 0 as k -> infinity, such that asymptotically almost surely any k-regular subgraph of G(mk) has size between (1 - epsilon(k))vertical bar Ck vertical bar and (1 - sigma(k))vertical bar Ck vertical bar, where C-k denotes the k-core of G(mk).", "paper_title": "The First k-Regular Subgraph is Large", "paper_id": "WOS:000338294000005"}
