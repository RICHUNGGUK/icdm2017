Design/methodology/approach - Based on sample data and the unchangeable principle of the slab volume in the rolling process, the predictive MAS control models were set-up. They are width broad MAS predictive model, width broad MAS control model, gaugemeter automatic gauge control (GM-AGC) model, and plates tracking model. After the models were tuned, the rolling test was implemented at LinFen Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. Findings - It is found that by accurately predictive online modeling of MAS methods, the plan view pattern control can be applied in plate mills. Research limitations/implications - As the rolling process is in high temperature, the plan view pattern is difficult to be detected. Normally, the real-time abnormity distortion cannot be obtained. Practical implications - The test results showed that the crop losses are reduced and the product yield is greatly increased. Originality/value - This paper presents an accurately predictive online modeling of MAS method.", "paper_title": "The application research of plan view pattern control in plate rolling", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100017"}
