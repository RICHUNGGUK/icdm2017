In such systems, the output represented by a fuzzy set sometimes needs to be transformed into a scalar value, and this task is known as the defuzzification process. Several analytic methods have been proposed for this problem, but in this paper, firstly the researchers introduce a novel parametric distance between fuzzy numbers and secondly suggest a new approach to the problem of defuzzification, using this distance. This defuzzification can be used as a crisp approximation with respect to fuzzy quantity. By considering this and with benchmark between fuzzy numbers, we can present a method for evaluating. The method can effectively evaluate various fuzzy numbers and their images and overcome the shortcomings of the previous techniques.", "paper_title": "Designing an algorithm for evaluating decision-making units based on neural weighted function", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100010"}
