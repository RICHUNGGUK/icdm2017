Formally, GXL represents typed, attributed, directed, ordered graphs which are extended to represent hypergraphs and hierarchical graphs. This flexible data model can be used for object-relational data and a wide variety of graphs. An advantage of GXL is that it can be used to exchange instance graphs together with their corresponding schema information in a uniform format. i.e. using a common document type specification. This paper describes GXL and shows how GXL is used to provide interoperability of graph-based tools. GXL has been ratified by reengineering and graph transformation research communities and is being considered for adoption by other communities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
