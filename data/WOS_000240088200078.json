Under this model, objects can be coherent on different subsets of dimensions if these objects follow a certain time-delayed relationship. Such a cluster can discover the cycle time of gene expression, which is essential in revealing the gene regulatory networks. This work is missed by previous research. A novel algorithm is also presented and implemented to mine all the significant td-clusters. Experimental results from both real and synthetic microarray datasets prove its effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Mining time-delayed coherent patterns in time series gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200078"}
