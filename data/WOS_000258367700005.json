UEML is expected to be a pivot language in order to manage the large amount of enterprise modelling languages and then to increase the interoperability in the domain of enterprise modelling. This paper is focused on I one of the more illuminating aspects of UEML: the comparison of the constructs of the enterprise modelling language. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose an approach allowing to provide some help concerning the identification of whose constructs are needed in UEML. This approach is based on the language meta-modelling, by using Unified Modelling Language (UML) language, and on the set theory. It is applied on a simple example of model translation between the SADT activity and the GRAI activity of GRAI nets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
