In contrast with the cylindrical fintie-difference time-domain method, not only can it remove the stability condition restraint, but also make the numerical dispersion independent of the time-step size. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
