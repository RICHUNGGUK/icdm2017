Motivated by minimizing the WESS to control the expected sample sizes, we develop the method of double sequential mixture likelihood ratio test (2-SMLRT) for one-sided composite hypotheses. It is proved that the 2-SMLRT is asymptotically optimal on S and its stopping time is finite under some conditions. The 2-SMLRT is general and includes the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and the double sequential probability ratio test (2-SPRT) as special cases. Simulation studies show that compared with the SPRT and 2-SPRT, the 2-SMLRT has smaller WESS and relative mean index with less or comparable expected sample sizes when the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis holds.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic optimality of double sequential mixture likelihood ratio test", "paper_id": "WOS:000336834100014"}
