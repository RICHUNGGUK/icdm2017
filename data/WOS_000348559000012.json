Moreover, we also obtain some theorems which are analogous version of the uniqueness theorems of meromorphic functions sharing some values on the whole complex plane given by Yi and Cao.", "paper_title": "The admissible function and non-admissible function in the unit disc", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559000012"}
