A feminist perspective was used as a theoretical guide for the research process. This was an Internet intervention study among 122 nurses working with cancer patients. Nurses' acceptance of the decision support computer program was measured using the Questionnaire for user Interaction Satisfaction. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. including analysis of variance and correlation analyses. There were significant differences in the total scores of user satisfaction by sex. religion, ethnicity. job title, and specialty. The results suggest that nurses do welcome decision support systems and that nurses' sociodemographic and professional characteristics should be considered in the development of decision support systems.", "paper_title": "Nurses' acceptance of the decision support computer program for cancer pain management", "paper_id": "WOS:000236300700004"}
