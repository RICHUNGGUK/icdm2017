By differentiating both the output error signal and the two sides of the state equation, an augmented error system is constructed, which contains the error signal, the state vector and the derivative of the state vector. Then the performance index function is introduced and the control problem is solved by optimal control theory. Thus the optimal preview control input for the original time-varying system is found. The proposed controller includes the previewable future signal, so the response speed is accelerated. Meanwhile, the integrators in the controller make the output vector track the target signal better. The numerical simulations illustrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "PREVIEW CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF LINEAR CONTINUOUS TIME-VARYING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317851500008"}
