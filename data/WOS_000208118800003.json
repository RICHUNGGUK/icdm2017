The algorithm involves (1) generation of a \"reference\" frame, (2) estimation, for each incoming video frame, of a local image displacement map with respect to the reference frame, (3) segmentation of the displacement map into two classes: stationary and moving objects; (4) turbulence compensation of stationary objects. Experiments with both simulated and real-life sequences have shown that the restored videos, generated in real-time using standard computer hardware, exhibit excellent stability for stationary objects while retaining real motion.", "paper_title": "Real-time stabilization of long range observation system turbulent video", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118800003"}
