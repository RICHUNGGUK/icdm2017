In this case the surface in question is characterized by some boundary configuration whereby the resulting surface conforms to a fourth order linear elliptic Partial Differential Equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation of a quadratic functional defined by a norm. In particular, the paper deals with surfaces generated as explicit Bezier polynomial solutions for the chosen Partial Differential Equation. To present the explicit solution methodologies adopted here we divide the Partial Differential Equations into two groups namely the orthogonal and the non-orthogonal cases. In order to demonstrate our methodology we discuss a series of examples which utilize the explicit solutions to generate smooth surfaces that interpolate a given boundary configuration. We compare the speed of our explicit solution scheme with the solution arising from directly solving the associated linear system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
