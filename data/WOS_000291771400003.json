In this study, we achieve this goal by enclosing two opposite settings on the discrete logarithm problems (DLP) simultaneously: the first setting is that DLP over Z(p0) (where p(0) - 1 is smooth) is used to encode messages, while the second setting is that DLP over Z(p) (where p - 1 is non-smooth, i.e., containing large prime factors) is used to encrypt plaintexts. Then, based on the proposed scheme, novel protocols for secure data aggregation in wireless sensor networks are presented. Finally, taking Paillier's factoring-based additively homomorphic encryption schemes as the reference framework, we present detailed performance comparisons and further enhancement.
