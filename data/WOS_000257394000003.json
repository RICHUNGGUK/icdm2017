A new source for the multiplicity of the weight-type fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) is proposed, which can generalize the weight coefficients of WFRFT to contain two vector parameters M, N is an element of Z(M). Therefore a generalized fractional Fourier transform can be defined, which is denoted by the multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform (MPFRFT). It enlarges the multiplicity of the FRFT, which not only includes the conventional FRFT and general multi-fractional Fourier transform as special cases, but also introduces new fractional Fourier transforms. It provides a unified framework for the FRFT, and the method is also available for fractionalizing other linear operators. In addition, numerical simulations of the MPFRFT on the Hermite-Gaussian and rectangular functions have been performed as a simple application of MPFRFT to signal processing.", "paper_title": "The multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000003"}
