Existing digital imaging technologies in hardware and software make it easy for site engineers to take numerous photographs of \"interesting\" processes and activities on a daily basis. The resulting photographic data are evidence of the \"as-built\" project, and can therefore be used in a number of project life cycle tasks. However, the task of retrieving the relevant photographs needed in these tasks is often burdened by the sheer volume of photographs accumulating in project databases over time and the numerous objects present in each photograph. To solve this problem, the writers have recently developed a number of complementary techniques that can automatically classify and retrieve construction site images according to a variety of criteria (materials, time, date, location, etc.). This paper presents a novel complementary technique that can automatically identify linear (i.e., beam, column) and nonlinear (i.e., wall, slab) construction objects within the image content and use that information to enhance the performance of the writers' existing construction site image retrieval approach.", "paper_title": "Shape-based retrieval of construcction site photographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251800400003"}
