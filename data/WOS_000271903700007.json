With the increasing popularity of the extensible markup language (XML) as a standard for information interchange on the Internet, XML is commonly used as an underlying data model for P2P applications to deal with the heterogeneity of data and enhance the expressiveness of queries. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently locating relevant XML documents in a P2P network, where a user poses queries in a language such as XPath. We have developed a new system called psiX that runs on top of an existing distributed hashing framework. Under the psiX system, each XML document is mapped into an algebraic signature that captures the structural summary of the document. An XML query pattern is also mapped into a signature. The query's signature is used to locate relevant document signatures. Our signature scheme supports holistic processing of query patterns without breaking them into multiple path queries and processing them individually. The participating peers in the network collectively maintain a collection of distributed hierarchical indexes for the document signatures. Value indexes are built to handle numeric and textual values in XML documents. These indexes are used to process queries with value predicates. Our experimental study on PlanetLab demonstrates that psiX provides an efficient location service in a P2P network for a wide variety of XML documents.", "paper_title": "Locating XML Documents in a Peer-to-Peer Network Using Distributed Hash Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000271903700007"}
