The TCPSO incorporating tent-map chaos, which can avoid trapping to local minima and improve the searching performance of standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to perform the nonlinear optimization to enhance the convergence and accuracy. Numerical simulations of two benchmark functions are used to test the performance of TCPSO. Furthermore, simulation on a nonlinear plant is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "New chaotic PSO-based neural network predictive control for nonlinear process", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900023"}
