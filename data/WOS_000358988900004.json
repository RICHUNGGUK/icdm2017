To consider how to efficiently determine the relationships between characters, we focus on the appearance of each character during movie play and analyze the characters' relationships to build a CoCharNet, a social network, to determine characters' relationships in a movie. In this paper, we propose an innovative method which extracts and analyzes characters' relationships based on social network measurement and evaluation.", "paper_title": "CoCharNet: Extracting Social Networks using Character Co-occurrence in Movies", "paper_id": "WOS:000358988900004"}
