The multiplier consists of one level of signed digit adder plus multiplexer through a precomputation. We design the multiplier with the improved signed digit adder using SAMSUNG STD 130 0.18 mu m 1.8 V CMOS Standard Cell Library and compare to multipliers with other previous adders. The proposed modular multiplier can be applied to public key cryptosystems based on integer arithmetic such as RSA, DSA or ECC. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
