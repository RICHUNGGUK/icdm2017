The proposed algorithm is formulated by combining TBCG algorithm with a data-reusing scheme that is realized by processing blocks of data in an overlapping manner, as in the optimum block adaptive shifting (OBAS) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the block conjugate gradient shifting (BCGS), TBCG and Toeplitz-OBAS (TOBAS) algorithms in both convergence rate and tracking property of input signal conditioning.
