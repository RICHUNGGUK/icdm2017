Recently, there has been increasing interest and research on a variety of C-probe graph classes, such as interval probe graphs, chordal probe graphs and chain probe graphs. In this paper we focus on chordal-bipartite probe graphs. We prove a structural result that if B is a bipartite graph with no chordless cycle of length strictly greater than 6, then B is chordal-bipartite probe if and only if a certain \"enhanced\" graph B* is a chordal-bipartite graph. This theorem is analogous to a result on interval probe graphs in Zhang (1994) 1181 and to one on chordal probe graphs in Golumbic and Lipshteyn (2004) [11]. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
