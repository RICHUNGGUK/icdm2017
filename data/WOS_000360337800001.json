The social networking enables to set up relations among the people (called actors) who share common interests, activities or connections. An actor or a person plays a predominant role in sharing social networking services, hence optimal modelling of an actor is essential. An actor model must be defined with several issues concerning to interests, activities, devices used, etc. In this paper, we present a generic actor model for a professional social network (GAMPSON) by considering actor's personally identifiable information, professional information, activity, social status, etc. The designed GAMPSON is tested over professional social networks such as agriculture social network and museum social network, where GAMPSON generates unique actors associated with the agriculture and museum social network, and renders relations among the actors. Results demonstrated that it is simple and accurate to generate actors and their relations in any social network along with provision of information over database.", "paper_title": "A method of designing a generic actor model for a professional social network", "paper_id": "WOS:000360337800001"}
