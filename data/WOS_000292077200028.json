The objective is to minimize the makespan. For 1 <= t < 4/3 and t >= 2, we obtain lower bounds t+1/2 and 4/3 on the optimal solution, respectively, which match the upper bounds given by He and Zhang (1999) in [2]. For 4/3 <= t < 2, we prove that a lower bound on the optimal solution is max{4t+4/3t+4, 2t/t+1} and design an algorithm with a competitive ratio equal to this lower bound. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
