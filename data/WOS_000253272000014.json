The basic idea is to assign different weight values to different discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients such that the SVM training algorithm. learns the decision?, surface according to the relative importance of DCT coefficients in the training data set. The weight values used in SVM training are based on the energy distribution characteristic of each image subblock. Simulation results show it achieves better reconstruction quality than the standard JPEG and SVM-based compression algorithms.", "paper_title": "Support vector machine with adaptive parameters in image coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272000014"}
