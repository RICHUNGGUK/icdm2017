The operational principle of this unique structure is discussed, its most important formulas are derived and its outstanding performance is verified by simulation in TSMC 0.18 A mu m standard CMOS technology. Owing to the cutting-edge structure, the proposed circuit demonstrates a very low power consumption of 0.74 mW and a wide tuning range of 83 dB. The proposed structure benefits from linear-in-dB and constant bandwidth specifications. The linear-in-dB gain range of structure is about 70 dB. The structure draws about 413 A mu A from 1.8 V power supply and regarding this low power consumption, it shows a lower and upper 3-dB cutoff frequencies of 8 Hz and 8.1 MHz, respectively. Process and temperature variation analysis of the circuit is also investigated through Monte Carlo and corner case analysis in order to verify the well-robustness of the structure. The transient sinusoidal response analysis is also done to verify the proposed VGA's stability.", "paper_title": "A 0.74 mW, linear-in-dB, constant bandwidth, variable gain amplifier based on zero-pole repositioning technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458100013"}
