The competitive coding scheme, one representative coding-based method, first convolves the palmprint image with a bank of Gabor filters with different orientations and then encodes the dominant orientation into its bitwise representation. Despite the effectiveness of competitive coding, few investigations have been given to study the influence of the number of Gabor filters and the orientation of each Gabor filter. In this paper, based on the statistical orientation distribution and the orientation separation characteristics, we Propose a modified fuzzy C-means cluster algorithm to determine the orientation of each Gabor filter. Since the statistical orientation distribution is based on a set of real palmprint images, the Proposed method is more suitable for palmprint recognition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves higher verification accuracy while compared with that of the original competitive coding scheme and several state-of-the-art methods, such as ordinal measure and RLOC. Considering both the computational complexity and the verification accuracy, competitive code with Six Orientations would be the optimal choice for palmprint recognition.
