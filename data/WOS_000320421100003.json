All the nodes in the network are classified into two levels: cluster head nodes and cluster member nodes, so there are three kinds of authentication between them. To satisfy the requirements of each kind, two authentication protocols are proposed: constant-sized traceable Ring Signature based authentication protocol and self-updating one-time password mutual authentication protocol. The analysis shows that the whole process of authentication does not need the participation of the third trusted party, which is fully self-organizing, and the anonymity is also achieved. Due to the cluster structure, the network has better scalability.", "paper_title": "AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR CLUSTER-STRUCTURED AD HOC NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100003"}
