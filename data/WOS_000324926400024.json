These are applications where data and computation are distributed among several devices and where, in principle, all the devices can exchange data and share the computational results of the group. In this paper we propose a declarative approach to distributed computing whereby distributed algorithms and communication models can be (i) specified as action theories of fluents and actions; (ii) executed as collections of distributed state machines, where devices are abstracted as (input/output) automata that can exchange messages; and (iii) analysed using existing results on connecting causal theories and Answer Set Programming. Results on the application of our approach to different classes of network protocols are also presented.", "paper_title": "A declarative approach to distributed computing: Specification, execution and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324926400024"}
