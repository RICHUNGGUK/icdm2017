These materials exhibit narrow bandstop and broad bandpass transmission properties at both horizontal and vertical electric-field polarizations. A 117% increase in the unloaded quality factor is experimentally observed for these materials. The center frequency is approximately 0.45 THz, with a 3-dB bandwidth of 0.52 THz from 0.20 to 0.72 THz at normal incidence. The measured average insertion loss is 0.5 dB with a ripple of 1 dB. These results show that double-layer S-shaped MMs are effective in designing tunable terahertz devices.", "paper_title": "Terahertz narrow ban.dstop, broad bandpass filter using double-layer S-shaped metamaterials", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500012"}
