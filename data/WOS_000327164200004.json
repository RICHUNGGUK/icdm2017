Such sequences arise, for example, in the solution of systems of linear or nonlinear equations by fixed-point iterative methods, and lim(n ->infinity)X(n) are simply the required solutions. In most cases of interest, these sequences converge to their limits extremely slowly, or even diverge. One practical way to make the sequences {X-n} converge more quickly is to apply to them vector extrapolation methods. In this work, we review two polynomial-type vector extrapolation methods that have proved to be very efficient convergence accelerators; namely, the minimal polynomial extrapolation (MPE) and the reduced rank extrapolation (RRE). We discuss their derivation, describe the most accurate and stable algorithms for their implementation along with the effective modes of usage, and present their convergence and stability theory. We also discuss their close connection with the method of Arnoldi and GMRES, two well known Krylov subspace methods for linear systems. Finally, we discuss some of their applications to different large-scale problems, such as solution of large-scale systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, computation of the PageRank of the Google matrix, and summation of vector-valued power series.
