His method involves two computation and two uncomputation phases. This paper proposes an optimization of Bennett's simulation that requires only half of the computation and uncomputation steps for a class of injective programs. A practical consequence is that the reversible simulation runs twice as fast as Bennett's simulation. The proposed method is demonstrated by developing lossless encoders and decoders for run-length encoding and range coding. The range-coding program is further optimized by conserving the model over the text-generation phase. This paper may thus provide a new view on developing efficient reversible simulations for a certain class of injective functions.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Reversible Simulation of Injective Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000294316100002"}
