The proposed method combines elementary siphons with a characteristic structure-based method to prevent deadlocks and enforce liveness to the net class under consideration. The characteristic structure-based method is further advanced in this work. It unveils and takes a full advantage of an intrinsically live structure of generalized Petri nets, which hides behind the arc weights, to achieve the liveness enforcement without any external control agent such as monitors. This hybrid method can identify and remove redundant monitors from a liveness-enforcing supervisor designed according to existing policies, improve the permissiveness, reduce the structural complexity of a controlled system, and consequently save the control implementation cost. Several examples are used to illustrate this method.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Liveness-Enforcing Policy for Generalized Petri Net Models of Flexible Manufacturing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317613400008"}
