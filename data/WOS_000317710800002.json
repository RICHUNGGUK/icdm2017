The use of stochastic processes consistent with these properties has opened new research fields in network performance analysis and particularly in simulation studies, where the efficient synthetic generation of samples is one of the main topics. In this paper, we describe an efficient and online generator of the correlation structure of the fractional Gaussian noise process.
