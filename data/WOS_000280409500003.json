A recipient vehicle verifies the message integrity by checking if data received from both channels are matched Compared with the popular public-key based security systems, the proposed approaches arc much simpler and cheaper to implement. especially during the initial transition stage when a mature VAN FT network infrastructure does not exist.", "paper_title": "Secure traffic data propagation in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280409500003"}
