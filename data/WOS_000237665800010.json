These rules try to obtain soft matches between candidate entities found in text and instances contained in a wide-scope gazetteer, and avoid the need for coding large sets of rules by exploiting lexical similarities. Using this matching procedure, SIEMES generates a set of classification hypotheses based solely on internal evidence, which may be disambiguated in a later step by relatively simple rules based on contextual clues. We explain SIEMES architecture and its named-entity identification and classification procedure. We also briefly discuss the results of the participation of SIEMES in HAREM, the named-entity evaluation contest for Portuguese, and describe future work.", "paper_title": "SIEMES - A named-entity recognizer for Portuguese relying on similarity rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800010"}
