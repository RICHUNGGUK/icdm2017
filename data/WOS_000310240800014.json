The initial conformation of each peptide within the binding site of the integrin was determined by docking the ligand to the reactive site of the integrin crystal structure with the aid of docking software FRED. The subsequent QM/MM MD simulations of the complex structures show that these eight cyclic RGD-peptides have a generally similar interaction mode with the binding site of the integrin to the cyclo(RGDf-N[M]V) analog found in the crystal structure. Still, there are subtle differences in the interactions of peptide ligands with the integrin, which contribute to the different inhibition activities. The averaged QM/MM protein-ligand interaction energy (IE) is remarkably correlated to the biological activity of the ligand. The IE, as well as a three-variable model which is somewhat interpretable, thus can be used to predict the bioactivity of a new ligand quantitatively, at least within a family of analogs. The present study establishes a helpful protocol for advancing lead compounds to potent inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Correlation between biological activity and binding energy in systems of integrin with cyclic RGD-containing binders: a QM/MM molecular dynamics study", "paper_id": "WOS:000310240800014"}
