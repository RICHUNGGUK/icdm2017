It shows that rigorous solutions require solving multidimensional Fredholm integral equations of the first kind in the situation where not only the right-hand side of the equation is an approximation, but the operator in the equation is also de fined approximately. Using Stefanuyk-Vapnik theory for solving such ill-posed operator equations, constructive methods of empirical inference are introduced. These methods are based on a new concept called V-matrix. This matrix captures geometric properties of the observation data that are ignored by classical statistical methods.", "paper_title": "V-Matrix Method of Solving Statistical Inference Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000369887300002"}
