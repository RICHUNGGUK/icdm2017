A full implementation is presented built around an iterative method known as 'residual minimisation-direct inversion of the iterative subspace' (RM-DIIS) to be used to solve many similar eigenproblems in a self-consistency cycle. The method is more efficient than direct methods and exhibits superior scaling on parallel supercomputers.
