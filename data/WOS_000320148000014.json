In this version update, germanium potential parameters are introduced and constraints based on the coordination, average coordination and the total bond angle distribution are implemented. Other additional changes include a constraint on three member ring formation, a constraint on porosity and an extension to handle systems with up to three different elements. Program Summary Program title: HRMC version 2.0 Catalogue identifier: AEAO_v2_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAO_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 94759 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 751023 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 90. Computer: Any computer capable of running executables produced by the Fortran 90 compiler. For example, the code runs in Windows 7, once compiled with the GNU Fortan 95 compiler. Operating system: Unix, Windows. RAM: Depends on the type of empirical potential. used, number of atoms and which constraints are employed. Typically below 2 GB for a system with a few thousand atoms. Classification: 7.7. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEAO_v1_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 542 Nature of problem: Atomic modeling using a combination of empirical potentials, fits to experimental data and other chemically or physically motivated constraints. Solution method: Single move Metropolis Monte Carlo method used to minimize total energy and discrepancy between simulation and experimental data. Reasons for new version: Extension of capabilities from old version. Summary of revisions: Inclusion of Stillinger-Weber parameters for germanium, inclusion of a bond angle distribution constraint, inclusion of more general coordination, average coordination and porosity/volume constraints. Variable step sizes are now supported. Extension to systems containing up to three elements. New quench schemes to control constraint weighting throughout the simulation have been included. Constraints to forbid three member ring formation have been developed. There are changes to the input/output structure. Running time: 1000 s for a test run on a Intel Xeon 2.93 GHz-Nehalem series processor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
