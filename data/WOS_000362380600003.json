In this paper, we study a new image sensing technique, called compressive image sensing (CIS), with computational complexity O(m(2)), where m denotes the length of a measurement vector y = phi x, which is sampled from the signal x of length n via the sampling matrix phi with dimensionality m x n. CIS is basically a variation on compressive sampling. The contributions of CIS include: (i) reconstruction speed is extremely fast due to a closed-form solution being derived; (ii) certain reconstruction accuracy is preserved because significant components of x can be reconstructed with higher priority via an elaborately designed phi; and (iii) in addition to conventional 1D sensing, we also study 2D separate sensing to enable simultaneous acquisition and compression of large-sized images.
