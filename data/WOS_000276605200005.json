(Neurosci Lett 455:145-149, 2009) showed a divergence in the spike rates of two types of population spike events, representing the putative activity of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA1 area of an animal model for temporal lobe epilepsy. The divergence in the spike rate was accompanied by a shift in the phase of oscillations between these spike rates leading to a spontaneous epileptic seizure. In this study, we propose a model of homeostatic synaptic plasticity which assumes that the target spike rate of populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain is a function of the phase difference between the excitatory and inhibitory spike rates. With this model of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we are able to simulate the spike rate dynamics seen experimentally by Talathi et al. in a large network of interacting excitatory and inhibitory neurons using two different spiking neuron models. A drift analysis of the spike rates resulting from the homeostatic synaptic plasticity update rule allowed us to determine the type of synapse that may be primarily involved in the spike rate imbalance in the experimental observation by Talathi et al. We find excitatory neurons, particularly those in which the excitatory neuron is presynaptic, have the most influence in producing the diverging spike rates and causing the spike rates to be anti-phase. Our analysis suggests that the excitatory neuronal population, more specifically the excitatory to excitatory synaptic connections, could be implicated in a methodology designed to control epileptic seizures.", "paper_title": "Effects of phase on homeostatic spike rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000276605200005"}
