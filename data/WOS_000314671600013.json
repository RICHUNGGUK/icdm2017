In this paper, we exploit the dynamic evolving phenomenon of power distribution networks covering its growth, reconnection and shrinking characteristics from the network topology perspective, and attempt to produce a novel dynamic evolving model through introducing the locating probability and shrinking mechanism. The proposed modeling approach is assessed and validated through extensive numerical simulation experiments for a range of standard IEEE power test systems. The statistical results reveal that the node degree distribution of the power network follows the power-law distribution and the node removal probability of the network dynamic has a significant impact on the network evolvement and robustness. Such macroscopic topological findings can greatly benefit the power distribution network operators (DNOs) from many aspects, including network planning, vulnerability analysis, fault prediction and cost-effective reinforcement.
