The load balancing solution allows providers to make better use of their resources, soften the need for over-provision, and help tolerate abrupt load peaks. In this paper, we propose a new load balancing solution that reduces service response times by applying a protocol for the reservation of remote resources. This protocol prevents the overload of remote servers by limiting the amount of load each server can redirect to the others. We describe a middleware that supports this protocol by managing the trade of resources among a set of servers, allowing them to share their spare capacity in a transparent way. We also present the results of a large set of simulations that encompass an exhaustive set of workload scenarios based on realistic internet traffic models.", "paper_title": "On the Use of Resource Reservation for Web Services Load Balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000356295800005"}
