In the bufferless DWDM switching technology, burst loss that should be minimized is the key design parameter. One of the critical design issues in OBS network is how to plan the optimal routing path in order to minimize burst dropping due to network resource contention. This study proposes the burst frequent-pattern tree (BFP-Tree) approach to pre-determine a suitable routing path in the OBS network. The BFP-Tree approach essentially is a learning-based mechanism that is able to determine a suitable transmission path from the historical network transaction data. The experiment results show that the successful rates of routing paths obtained by the BFP-Tree approach are able to converge to those of the optimal results.", "paper_title": "A frequent-pattern approach for optical networks routing planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000265924000004"}
