Unfortunately, the Square Tiling Problem was shown to be NP-hard. A 1/2-approximation is known. We show that if the tile alphabet is fixed and finite, there is a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the Square Tiling Problem with approximation ratio of (1 - epsilon/2 log n) for any given epsilon <= 1. Another topic handled in this paper is the NP-hardness of the Tiling problem with an infinite alphabet. We show that when the alphabet is not bounded, even the decision version for rectangles of size 3n is NP-Complete. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
