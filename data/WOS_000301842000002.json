The more complex a task is, the higher the cognitive demands for performing the task. Components of task complexity impose demands on the mental efforts of users. This article proposes a general approach to evaluate the complexity of computer-based tasks. The proposed principles of complexity evaluation and measures of complexity provide a proper basis for optimization, modification, and enhancement of the software design process. Experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed method for both the design of man-machine systems and human-computer interfaces. The suggested methods and principles of complexity assessment derive from systemic-structural activity theory.", "paper_title": "Complexity Evaluation of Computer-Based Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301842000002"}
