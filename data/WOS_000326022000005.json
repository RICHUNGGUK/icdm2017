The effects of Doppler shift f(d) on channel capacity are analysed. The main contribution of this work is to model intercarrier interference as a function of f(d) and symbol duration T-s. Two diversity techniques are considered (i) maximal ratio combining (MRC) and (ii) selective combining (SC). Three adaptive policies are combined with MRC and SC to estimate the following channel capacity: (i) optimal rate adaptive; (ii) optimal power and rate adaptive; and (iii) channel inversion with fixed rate adaptive. Closed-form expressions and bounds on channel capacity employing different diversity techniques are derived. Simulation results are given.
