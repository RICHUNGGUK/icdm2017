There are two major differences between our algorithm (GISCT in short) and the ISCT algorithm proposed by Wang [C.M. Wang, Y.H. Huang, A novel color transfer algorithm for image sequences, Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 20(6) (2004) 1039-1056]. The first major difference is the algorithm employed for color transfer between still images. We propose a new color transfer algorithm (NCT) to eliminate the appearance of over-transformation, which occurs when the input image and reference image are not compatible. Experimental results show that the NCT algorithm produces outcomes that are better than those rendered by the ISCT algorithm. The second major difference is that we present a generalized color variation curve (GCVC), providing more flexible control for color transfer over in-between images. The GCVC allows a user to select a desirable number of frames as reference images, on which color transfer is performed using the new NCT algorithm. A B-spline curve is then automatically generated, representing a GCVC to interpolate color statistics for in-between images. Experimental results show that the new GISCT algorithm is able to automatically render an image sequence where the color characteristics are borrowed from both the source and reference images. The GISCT algorithm generates results in several seconds with more visually plausible effects than those produced by Wang's ISCT algorithm. Most importantly, our GISCT algorithm can synthesize a new image sequence by using colors from multiple reference images under user-specified weights. The image sequence thus rendered shows versatile color variations, and produces a visually plausible appearance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
