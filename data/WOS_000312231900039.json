Data were collected from middle school students at a rural pueblo school and an urban Hispanic-serving school, through in-field observation, content analysis of game-based tutoring-learning interactions, and achievement test. Findings suggested that game-based tutoring is dynamic in terms of its timing, initiation, content, style, and tutee reaction created. There was an improvement in students' state test performance at the pueblo school after the game-based tutoring program, but the improvement was not statistically significant at the urban school. The study can serve as a catalyst for insight and further research of using educational gaming as an instructional artifact to augment other instructional approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
