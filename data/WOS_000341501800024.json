In particular, it shows how discrete event simulation can be used at the point of signing a long-term service contract to assess whether a service delivery system will be able to comply with the contractual terms over time. This study also proposes a methodology based on the Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the service demand in a context where the installed base evolves dynamically over time. Such a methodology has been used to verify the discrete event simulation model. This research is based on real data from a leading global supplier of human to machine electronic controls operating in the aerospace industry. This supplier has recently signed a major contract for the provision of several devices and related services. These devices will be installed on aircrafts progressively entering service over the next seven years.", "paper_title": "Applying discrete event simulation to the design of a service delivery system in the aerospace industry: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800024"}
