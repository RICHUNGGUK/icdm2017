Cortical representation by the medial axis (MA) is an attractive candidate for maintaining the constancy of a wide range of arbitrary shapes. Recent physiological studies have reported that neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) show a response to two-dimensional (2D) MAs, and those in the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to three-dimensional (3D) MAs. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the transformation of 2D to 3D MAs. As a first step toward investigating the cortical mechanism, we have proposed as a hypothesis that a pair of monocular 2D MAs is fused to generate a 3D MA. We examined the computational plausibility of the hypothesis; specifically, whether an energy-based fusion model is capable of generating 3D MAs. We generated blob-like, physiologically plausible 2D MM, and used a standard energy model to detect the disparity between a pair of 2D MM. The model successfully generated 3D MM for a variety of objects that included typical shape characteristics. A reconstruction test showed that the computed 3D MAs captured the essential structure of the objects with reasonable accuracy and view invariance. These results indicate that the fusion of monocular blob-like 2D MAs is capable of generating a reasonable 3D MA within the framework of the energy model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
