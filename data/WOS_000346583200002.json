The authors construct a two-round simplified version of DES that contains all the DES components and show that its set of encryption permutations is not a group under functional composition, it is not a pure cipher, and its set of encryption permutations does not generate the alternating group. They present a non-statistical proof that for n <= 4 the set of n-round Feistel permutations over an arbitrary group do not constitute a group under functional composition.", "paper_title": "A Simplified and Generalized Treatment of DES-Related Ciphers", "paper_id": "WOS:000346583200002"}
