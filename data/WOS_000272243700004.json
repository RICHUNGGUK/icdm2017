Our system allows Grid users to share remote GPUs, which are traditionally dedicated to local users who directly see the display output. The key contribution of the paper is to develop this novel system for non-dedicated environments. We first show criteria for defining idle GPUs from the Grid users' point of view. Based on these criteria, our system uses a screensaver approach with some sensors that detect idle resources at a low overhead. The idea for this lower overhead is to avoid GPU intervention during resource monitoring. Detected idle GPUs are then selected according to a matchmaking service, making the system adaptive to the rapid advance of GPU architecture. Though the system itself is not yet interoperable with current desktop Grid systems, our idea can be applied to screensaver-based systems such as BOINC. We evaluate the system using Windows PCs with three generations of nVIDIA GPUs. The experimental results show that our system achieves a low overhead of at most 267 ms, minimizing interference to local users while maximizing the performance delivered to Grid users. Some case studies are also performed in an office environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in terms of the amount of detected idle time.", "paper_title": "A Resource Selection System for Cycle Stealing in GPU Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000272243700004"}
