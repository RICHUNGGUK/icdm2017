A dataset consisting of 35 xanthones was employed for the present analysis. A set of 132 topological, geometrical, and electronic descriptors representing various structural characteristics was calculated for each of 497 unique carbon atoms in the dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-ranking and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used as descriptor selection and model building methods, respectively. Analyses of the results revealed a correlation coefficient and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.998 and 1.42 ppm, respectively, for the prediction set.", "paper_title": "Principal component analysis-ranking as method for the simulation of 13 C nuclear a variable selection ma netic resonance spectra of xanthones using artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247608400004"}
