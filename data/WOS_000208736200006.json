The case applies mainstream simulation methodologies up to the delivery of results and a success model to facilitate the analysis of the case's impact and success. With the use of modern marketing principles we extended our case model to a balanced integrated framework that encompasses good simulation modelling practice with new marketing principles. We suggest that simulation modelling should follow world market reality and become more balanced towards a customer service perspective, by working on the deficiencies of the current manufacturing-centred model.", "paper_title": "Marketing health care simulation modelling: towards an integrated service approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000208736200006"}
