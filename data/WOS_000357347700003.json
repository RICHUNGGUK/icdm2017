It provides predictability when exploiting temporal reuse in array data structures, i.e. it allows an accurate WCET analysis, which is required in real-time systems. With our hardware proposal, compiler transformations that exploit such reuse (essentially tiling) can be safely applied. Moreover, our proposal has other features of particular interest to embedded systems, where a set of well-tuned applications run in a hardware platform which may be constrained in size, complexity and energy consumption. In order to test the most uncommon features of the FAFBs (predictability and effectiveness with a small size), we perform a worst-case analysis on several kernel algorithms for embedded and real-time computing, showing the interaction between tiling and our hardware architecture. Our results show that the number of data cache misses is reduced between 1.3 and 19 times on such algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
