The SMAC platform, which has been developed as Integrated Project (IP) of the 7th ICT Call under the Objective 3.2 \"Smart components and Smart Systems integration\" addresses the challenges of the integration of heterogeneous and conflicting domains that emerge in the design of Smart Systems. SMAC includes methodologies and EDA tools enabling multi-disciplinary and multi-scale modelling and design, simulation of multi-domain systems, subsystems and components at different levels of abstraction, system integration and exploration for optimization of functional and non-functional metrics. The article presents the preliminary results obtained by adopting the SMAC platform for the design of a limb tracking smart system. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
