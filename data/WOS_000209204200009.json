We get some properties of implication operators on the set of V-irreducible elements. And furthermore the implication operators on the linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic fuzzy lattice are discussed. The proposed system can better express both comparable and incomparable information. Also it can deal with both positive and negative evidences which are represented by linguistic truth values at the same time during the information processing system.", "paper_title": "Implication operators on the set of V-irreducible element in the linguistic truth-valued intuitionistic fuzzy lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204200009"}
