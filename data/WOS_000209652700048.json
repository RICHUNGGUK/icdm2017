The database contains two corpora: 1) doodles and 2) pseudo-signatures, which are simplified finger-drawn versions of the handwritten signature. The dataset includes genuine samples and forgeries, produced under worst-case conditions, where attackers have visual access to the drawing process. Statistical and qualitative analyses of the data are presented, comparing doodles and pseudo-signatures to handwritten signatures. Time variability, learning curves, and discriminative power of different features are also studied. Verification performance against forgeries is analyzed using state-of-the-art algorithms and benchmark results are provided.", "paper_title": "The DooDB Graphical Password Database: Data Analysis and Benchmark Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000209652700048"}
