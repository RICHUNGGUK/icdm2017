A popular recursive design methodology backstepping is employed to systematically construct feedback control laws and associated Lyapunov functions. The significance of this paper is to make best use of available signals, avoid unnecessary parameterization, and minimize the node number of neural networks as on-line approximators. The design assures that all the signals in the closed loop are semi-globally uniformly, ultimately bounded and the outputs of the system converges to a tunable small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. Novel parameter tuning algorithms are obtained on a more practical basis.", "paper_title": "Implementable adaptive backstepping neural control of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000129"}
