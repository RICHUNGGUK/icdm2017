The system, GAMBAL for the Exploration of Video Sequences (GAMBAL-EVS), segments video sequences, extracting an image for each shot, and then clusters such images and presents them in a visualization system. The system allows the user to find similarities between images and to proceed through the video sequences to find the relevant ones.", "paper_title": "Image clustering for the exploration of video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000235459500013"}
