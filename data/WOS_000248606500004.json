Our main focus is query modification: a query transformation approach which works by revising the preference relation in the query. We provide a detailed analysis of the cases where the order-theoretic properties of the preference relation are preserved in the revision. We consider a number of different revision operators: union, prioritized and Pareto composition. We also formulate algebraic laws that enable incremental evaluation of preference queries. Finally, we consider two variations of the basic framework: finite restrictions of preference relations and weak-order extensions of strict partial order preference relations.", "paper_title": "Database querying under changing preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000248606500004"}
