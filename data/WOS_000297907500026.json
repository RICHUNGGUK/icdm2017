The numerical solutions are approximated by linear combinations of a family of particular elastostatic solutions called bases. Displacements and stresses for the bases are in closed form. This method is equivalent to a displacement discontinuity method with a continuous piecewise linear density function. Three numerical examples are presented to study the accuracy of the BEM. The results show this method can deal with in-boundary stress without special treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
