In our previous work, we have already proposed an efficient fingerprint recognition algorithm using Phase-Only Correlation (POC), and developed commercial fingerprint verification units for access control applications. The use of Fourier phase information of fingerprint images makes it possible to achieve robust recognition for weakly impressed, low-quality fingerprint images. This paper presents an idea of improving the performance of POC-based fingerprint matching by combining it with feature-based matching, where feature-based matching is introduced in order to improve recognition efficiency for images with nonlinear distortion. Experimental evaluation using two different types of fingerprint image databases demonstrates efficient recognition performance of the combination of the POC-based algorithm and the feature-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "Score-Level Fusion of Phase-Based and Feature-Based Fingerprint Matching Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000276761000004"}
