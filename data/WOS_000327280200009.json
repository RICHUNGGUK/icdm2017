Origami is labor-intensive and requires a high skill level to generate two-dimensional (2D) objects that pop-up into realistic 3D objects. However, this special feature makes designing an origami architecture procedure challenging. This paper provides a novel algorithm to create an origami paper card from a 3D model with a user-specified folding line. The algorithm segments the 2D shape from a 3D model and creates layers of the pop-up paper card using a directed acyclic graph. After applying layers to the layout, the algorithm creates connections between layers, and then outputs the origami layout. Based on a directed acyclic graph, the algorithm computes a class of paper architectures containing two sets of layers and connections that approximate the input geometry while guaranteeing that a pop up card is physically realizable. The proposed method is demonstrated with a number of paper pop-ups, and physical experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Origami Pop-up Card Generation from 3D Models Using a Directed Acyclic Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200009"}
