Using power laws for the different rates of this model, we recover the shape of the polymerization rate using experimental data. The technique used is inspired from [15], where the fragmentation dependence on prion strains is investigated. Our improvement is to use power laws for the rates, whereas [15] used a constant polymerization coefficient and linear fragmentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
