Crawling techniques developed for traditional Web applications are not sufficient for crawling RIAs. The inability to crawl RIAs is a problem that needs to be addressed for at least making RIAs searchable and testable. We present a new methodology, called \"model-based crawling\", that can be used as a basis to design efficient crawling strategies for RIAs. We illustrate model-based crawling with a sample strategy, called the \"hypercube strategy\". The performances of our model-based crawling strategies are compared against existing standard crawling strategies, including breadth-first, depth-first, and a greedy strategy. Experimental results show that our model-based crawling approach is significantly more efficient than these standard strategies.", "paper_title": "A Model-Based Approach for Crawling Rich Internet Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000339623400007"}
