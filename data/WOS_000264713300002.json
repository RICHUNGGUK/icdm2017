The governing equations were solved with a finite Volume method. The numerical model was validated with available experimental data. Numerical results of exit thrust showed good agreement with experimental data except at very low Reynolds numbers. For parametric Studies oil the effect of geometric scaling, the nozzle throat diameter wits varied from 10 to 0.1 mm, whereas throat Reynolds number was varied from 5 to 2000. A correlation has also been developed to calculate the specific impulse at specified throat diameter and Reynolds number. The effect of different gases on the specific impulse of the nozzle. Such as helium, nitrogen, argon and carbondioxide, was also examined.
