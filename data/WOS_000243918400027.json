Some less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria are established by considering the additional useful terms, which were ignored in previous methods, when estimating the upper bound of the derivative of Lyapunov functionals and introducing the new free-weighting matrices. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "New delay-dependent stability criteria for neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000243918400027"}
