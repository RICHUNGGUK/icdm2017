However, due to high volumes of traffic, flow records need to be sampled before they are gathered. Current techniques for producing sampled flow records are either focused on selecting flows from which statistical estimates of traffic volume can be inferred, or have simplistic models for applications. Such sampled flow records are not suitable for many applications with more specific needs, such as ones that make decisions across flows. As a first step towards tailoring the sampling algorithm to an application's needs, we design a generic language in which any particular application can express the classes of traffic of its interest. Our evaluation investigates the expressive power of our language, and whether flow records have sufficient information to enable sampling of records of relevance to applications. We use templates written in our custom language to instrument sampling tailored to three different applications-BLINC, Snort, and Bro. Our study, based on month-long datasets gathered at two different network locations, shows that by learning local traffic characteristics we can sample relevant flow records near-optimally with low false negatives in diverse applications.", "paper_title": "A generic language for application-specific flow sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000255732000003"}
