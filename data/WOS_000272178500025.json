Note that the known formulae of shape and topological derivatives for elliptic problems in bounded domains do not apply to the periodic framework. We consider a general notion of periodicity, allowing for an arbitrary parallelepiped as periodicity cell. Our calculations are useful for optimizing periodic composite materials by gradient type methods using the topological derivative jointly with the shape derivative for periodic problems. Important particular cases of functionals to minimize/maximize are presented. A numerical algorithm for optimizing periodic composites using the topological and shape derivatives is the subject of a second paper (Barbarosie and Toader, Struct Multidiscipl Optim, 2009).", "paper_title": "Shape and topology optimization for periodic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500025"}
