In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of its CNOT-optimality. We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonical nature of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least 2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost;, which holds even if ancilla qubits are available.", "paper_title": "On THE CNOT-COST OF TOFFOLI GATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937600008"}
