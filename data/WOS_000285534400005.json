Our algorithm decreases the computation time significantly by applying integer arithmetic on floating-point data in the IEEE-754 standard or similar formats. We conducted experiments with synthetic data on a 32-processor Linux cluster; in the case of the internal sort alone, the Giga-byte sorting achieved approximately fivefold speedups. Furthermore, the sorting achieved twofold or greater improvements over the typical parallel sort method, network of workstations (NOW)-sort. Moreover, the sorting scheme performance is independent of the computing platform. Thus, our sorting method can be successfully applied to binary search, data mining, numerical simulations, and graphics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
