The most expensive arithmetic operation in ECC is division, which is performed by multiplying the inverse of a multiplicand. The proposed architecture is highly regular, expandable, and has reduced latency and hardware complexity. The proposed architecture can be efficiently used in the hardware design of crypto-coprocessors. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
