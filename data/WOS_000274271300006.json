These advanced techniques have great impacts on the capacity and radio resource management (RRM) schemes. In this paper, the UL capacity and load models specified for TD-SCDMA systems are proposed, in which the impacts from SA and MUD techniques are considered, and the UL load can be estimated based on the total received power in the base station. According to the proposed theoretical capacity and load evaluation models, the call admission control (CAC) strategies suitable for TD-SCDMA systems are presented. Since there are two kinds of SA schemes (i.e., tracking beam antenna (TBA) and switched beam antenna (SBA)) utilized in TD-SCDMA systems, the efficient CAC algorithms suitable for these two SA schemes are designed and evaluated, which are based on principles of the interference increase estimation. All simulation results show that the proposed CAC strategies can work efficiently and improve performances of TD-SCDMA systems dramatically.
