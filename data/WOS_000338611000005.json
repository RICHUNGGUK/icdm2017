Our proposed method is able to extract useful priori information and incorporate it into a modified iterative thresholding algorithm for fast casual reconstruction of MR images from highly undersampled k-space data. Through extensive experimental results we show that our proposed method achieves superior reconstruction quality, while having a lower computational complexity and memory requirements compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.
