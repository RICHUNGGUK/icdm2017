The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method was used to remove redundant variables, then sequential forward selection (SFS) and sequential backward selection (SBS) methods were used to extract informative features. It had been demonstrated that sequential forward selection (SFS) and sequential backward selection (SBS) methods were useful tools for variable selection. As a special cross-validation method, leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) method was used to test the generalization and reliability of the model obtained. By using the SVM, the support vector classification (SVC) model was obtained, with a classification accuracy of 94%. And the prediction accuracy of activities of the Src kinase inhibitors is 92.4% in LOOCV method. The results show that SVM method could be employed to SAR modeling with much improved duality and predictability.", "paper_title": "Classification of Src Kinase Inhibitors Based on Support Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000268267100010"}
