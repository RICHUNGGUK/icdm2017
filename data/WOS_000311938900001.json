The algorithms are based on viewing the affine reflection group as a semi-direct product of a crystallographic finite reflection group and its coroot lattice. The proposed lattice cosets method gives an explicit method for drawing a trellis diagram representation of ARGC. The complexities of these two decoding methods, as well as the trade-offs between them, are discussed.", "paper_title": "DECODING AFFINE REFLECTION GROUP CODES WITH TRELLISES", "paper_id": "WOS:000311938900001"}
