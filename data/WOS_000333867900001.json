Various multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are now available to help those organizations in choosing the best decisive course of actions. In this paper, the applicability of weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is explored as an effective MCDM tool while solving eight manufacturing decision making problems, such as selection of cutting fluid, electroplating system, forging condition, arc welding process, industrial robot, milling condition, machinability of materials, and electro-discharge micro-machining process parameters. It is observed that this method has the capability of accurately ranking the alternatives in all the considered selection problems. The effect of the parameter A. on the ranking performance of WASPAS method is also studied.", "paper_title": "Applications of WASPAS Method in Manufacturing Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000333867900001"}
