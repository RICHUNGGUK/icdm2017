Indeed, after nearly three decades of surgical robotics research, many prototypes have been built, some have been technically validated, but just few found their way in the OR. Therefore, some causes that might influence the successful transfer of emerging surgical robotics technologies into hospitals and clinics are discussed in this work. On that account, a framework for the design of surgical robots that is well suited for research centers is also presented. Such framework provides a base approach for structuring surgical robotics developments in order to comply with European medical device regulations. Finally, an example case of a robot controller for a teleoperated surgical system is provided. The latter controller was successfully integrated during the ARAKNES project for Single Port Laparoscopy (SPL), carried out under the European Union's 7th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development.
