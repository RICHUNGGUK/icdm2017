These techniques have two main applications: simulating sparse Hamiltonians and implementing black-box unitary operations. In particular, we give the best known simulation of sparse Hamiltonians with constant precision. Our method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number of nonzero elements in a column) and the evolution time t, whereas previous methods had complexity scaling as D-4 and were superlinear in t. We also consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a black-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for performing an explicitly specified N x N unitary operation use (O) over tilde (N-2) elementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with bounded error using O(N-2/3 (log log N)(4/3)) queries to its matrix elements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most unitaries can be performed with only (O) over tilde(root N) queries, which is optimal.", "paper_title": "BLACK-BOX HAMILTONIAN SIMULATION AND UNITARY IMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000004"}
