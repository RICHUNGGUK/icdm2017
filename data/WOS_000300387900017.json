The algorithm is construct from three collision-based dynamical systems: Hardy-Pomeau-Pazzis (HPP) model, rotary element (RE) model and billiard-particle model. Both the HPP and RE model are efficient and can support parallel computing; the billiard-particle is an excellent model for round key expansion. These models are revised to best suits image encryption. Analyses and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory properties of randomness and sensitivity.
