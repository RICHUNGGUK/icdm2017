These techniques focus on the noise current reduction in wideband ring VCOs. Two PLLs embedding such VCOs were implemented, in 0.18 mu m and 0.13 mu m CMOS technologies, under 1.8V and 1.2 V supply voltages respectively. The maximum improvement was observed for a 1.8V PLL running at 160MHz and consuming 1.6mW, which phase noise was reduced from -81.4 dBc/Hz to -88.4 dBc/Hz.", "paper_title": "Low power and low jitter wideband clock synthesizers in CMOS ASICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600044"}
