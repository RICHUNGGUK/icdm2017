Therefore, these systems are required to be equipped with fault-tolerant mechanisms to ensure that the system will keep running in a degraded mode. Normally, the faulty components are coalesced into fault regions, which are classified into two major categories: convex and concave regions. In this paper, we propose the first solution to calculate the probability of occurrences of common fault patterns in torus and mesh interconnection networks which includes both convex (vertical bar-shaped, square-shaped) and concave (L-shaped, T-shaped, +-shaped, H-shaped) regions. These results play a key role when studying, particularly, the performance analysis of routing algorithms proposed for interconnection networks under faulty conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
