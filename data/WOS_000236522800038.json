Little detailed documentation on these algorithms has been published. However, a careful examination of the highlighted hit terms coupled with a comparison of results from small variations in query language reveal much additional, useful information about these algorithms. An understanding of how these algorithms work can lead to better search results and explain many unexpected results, including differing hit counts for singular versus plural query words and phrases.", "paper_title": "SciFinder Scholar 2006: An empirical analysis of research topic query processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236522800038"}
