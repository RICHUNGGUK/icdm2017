With a vested interest in unlocking these potential benefits, extensive work has been conducted on developing technologies to process, integrate, and extract value from the data. However, exposing the value in this data is achieved via sharing the data in a secure and controllable environment. To that end, the authors present the Web Observatory, a Web platform with an architecture capable of harvesting, querying, and analyzing multiple real-time and historic heterogeneous data, while providing data owners access control to their resources.", "paper_title": "Building a Real-Time Web Observatory", "paper_id": "WOS:000364339800006"}
