Let delta(u, v) denote the distance between vertices u, v is an element of V. An algorithm is said to compute all-pairs t-approximate shortest-paths/distances, for some t (>=) 1, if for each pair of vertices u, v is an element of V, the path/distance reported by the algorithm is not longer/greater than t . delta(u, v). This paper presents two extremely simple randomized algorithms for computing all-pairs nearly 2-approximate distances. The first algorithm requires an expected O(m(2/3) n log n + n(2)) time, and for any u, v is an element of V reports a distance no greater than 2 delta(u, v) + 1. Our second algorithm requires an expected O(n(2) log(3/2) n) time, and for any u, v is an element of V reports a distance bounded by 2 delta(u, v) + 3. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
