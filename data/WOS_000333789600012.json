However, initially deploying and ensuring a mobile ad-hoc network in real and complex environments is an arduous task since the strength of the connection between two nodes (i.e., robots) can change rapidly in time or even disappear. An extension of the Particle Swarm Optimization to multi-robot applications has been previously proposed and denoted as Robotic Darwinian PSO (RDPSO). This paper contributes with a further extension of the RDPSO, thus integrating two research aspects: (i) an autonomous, realistic and fault-tolerant initial deployment strategy denoted as Extended Spiral of Theodorus (EST); and (ii) a fault-tolerant distributed search to prevent communication network splits. The exploring agents, denoted as scouts, are autonomously deployed using supporting agents, denoted as rangers. Experimental results with 15 physical scouts and 3 physical rangers show that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution faster and more accurately using the EST approach over the random deployment strategy. Also, a more fault-tolerant strategy clearly influences the time needed to converge to the final solution, but is less susceptible to robot failures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
