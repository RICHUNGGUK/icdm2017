The emergence of Real Simple Syndication, or RSS feeds, and email alerting systems provided users with alternative services. To assist users with adopting these technologies, a service utilizing aggregate feeds to the library's electronic journal content was created and made available through LibGuides. Libraries can reestablish current awareness services using existing technologies to increase awareness and usage of library-provided electronic journal content. The current awareness service presented is an example of how libraries can build basic current awareness services utilizing freely accessible technologies.", "paper_title": "Creating a Current Awareness Service Using Yahoo!
