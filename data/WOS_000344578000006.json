The assembly of the constitutive parts of the connection requires the inclusion of contact definitions in the model. In addition, the material non-linearity including the influence of the spatial stress distribution should be taken into account where appropriate. Here a complex model of a beam-to-column dowel connection is presented. Experiments on the analysed connection were performed within the framework of the European project SAFECAST (Performance of Innovative Mechanical Connections in Precast Building Structures under Seismic Conditions). Several material and interaction parameters were investigated and the influence of each of them was evaluated. The set of parameters which gave the best match with the experiments was chosen.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear finite element modelling of centric dowel connections in precast buildings", "paper_id": "WOS:000344578000006"}
