Inputs are assumed to occur in a fluid fashion whereas outputs occur at a unit rate so long as the corresponding storage is non-empty. The distribution properties of the storage levels {Z(1)(t), Z(2)(t)} are derived at finite time as well as in stationary regime. We first investigate this process embedded at the successive switching points. This process is Markovian with independent components. In continuous time the components {Z(1)(t), Z(2)(t)} are also independent for each finite t, but are dependent in stationary regime.", "paper_title": "A two-fluid storage model with Levy inputs and alternating outputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000245889100001"}
