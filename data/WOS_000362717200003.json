Recently, several geographic routing protocols are proposed for 3D wireless sensor networks. Each of them, however, cannot guarantee packet delivery or demands a long routing path to turn around a hole. In this paper, we first introduce a method of constructing a guide to the navigation on the surface of a hole. Subsequently, a geographic routing protocol termed the Greedy-Guide_Navigation-Greedy protocol (GGNG) that can always route a packet to turn around a hole with the help of the guide is proposed. GGNG guarantees packet delivery and can be extended toward a mobile sensor network in a limited 3D space. Simulations show that the path stretch of each routing protocol to GGNG in approximately 90% of the cases is between 1.02 and 189.24. In addition, the number of messages transmitted by a node surrounding a hole in the guide construction is approximately three.
