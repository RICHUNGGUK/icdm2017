During off-line processing, the close interactions between characters are precomputed by expanding a game tree, and these are stored as data structures called interaction patches. Then, during run-time, the system spatio-temporally concatenates the interaction patches to create scenes where a large number of characters closely interact with one another. Using our method, it is possible to automatically or interactively produce animations of crowds interacting with each other in a stylized way. The method can be used for a variety of applications including TV programs, advertisements and movies.", "paper_title": "Interaction Patches for Multi-Character Animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100008"}
