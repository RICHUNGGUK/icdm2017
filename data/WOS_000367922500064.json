In current multi-authority ABE schemes, the scale of attribute universe employed in encryption is restricted by various predefined thresholds. In this paper, we propose an unbounded multi-authority ciphertext-policy ABE system without such restriction. Our scheme consists of multiple attribute authorities (AAs), one central authority (CA), and users labeled by the set of attributes. Each AA governs a different universe of attributes and operates separately. Moreover, there is no cooperation between the CA and AAs. To provide the private keys for a user, the AAs first issue partial attribute-related keys according to the attributes; the CA then issues identity-related keys and links these attribute-keys with the user's global identifier. Both the identity-related and the linked attribute-related keys will be used in decryption. The proposed multi-authority ciphertext-policy ABE scheme can support arbitrary linear secret sharing scheme as the access policy. Performance analysis and security proof indicate that our scheme is efficient and secure.
