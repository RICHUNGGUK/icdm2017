It is shown that the resulting category E(L, M)-FC is a Cartesian closed topological category, which can embed the category E(L, M)-FTop of enriched (L, M)-fuzzy topological spaces as a reflective subcategory. Also, it is proved that the category of topological enriched (L, M)-fuzzy convergence spaces is isomorphic to E(L, M)-FTop and the category of pretopological enriched (L, M)-fuzzy convergence spaces is isomorphic to the category of enriched (L, M)-fuzzy quasi-coincident neighborhood spaces.", "paper_title": "Enriched (L, M)-fuzzy convergence spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700009"}
