Numerous approaches to develop possible stope layouts have been introduced. However, owing to the size and complexity of the problem, these approaches do not guarantee an optimal solution in three-dimensional space. This article proposes a new heuristic algorithm that incorporates stope size variation for solving this complex and challenging optimisation problem. A case study demonstrates the implementation of the algorithm on an actual ore body model. In a validation study, the proposed algorithm generates 10.7% more profitable solution than the commercially available Maximum Value Neighbourhood (MVN) algorithm.
