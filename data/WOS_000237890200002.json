However this complexity together with the largely covert relation between the parameters and the behavior of the agent is also the main hindrance in the goal oriented design of a behavior system. This paper presents a general approach to the self-regulation of dynamical systems so that the design problem is circumvented. We consider the controller (a neural network) as the mediator for changes in the sensor values over time and define a dynamics for the parameters of the controller by maximizing the dynamical complexity of the sensorimotor loop under the condition that the consequences of the actions taken are still predictable. This very general principle is given a concrete mathematical formulation and is implemented in an extremely robust and versatile algorithm for the parameter dynamics of the controller. We consider two different applications, a mechanical device called the rocking stamper and the ODE simulations of a \"snake\" with five degrees of freedom. In these and many other examples studied we observed various behavior modes of high dynamical complexity.", "paper_title": "Rocking stamper and jumping snakes from a dynamical systems approach to artificial life", "paper_id": "WOS:000237890200002"}
