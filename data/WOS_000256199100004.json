Many applications call for exhaustive generation of permutations subject to various constraints or imposing a particular generating order. In this paper we present generating algorithms and combinatorial Gray codes for several families of pattern avoiding permutations. Among the families under consideration are those counted by Catalan, large Schroder, Pell, even-index Fibonacci numbers and the central binomial coefficients. We thus provide Gray codes for the set of all permutations of {1,..., n} avoiding the pattern tau for all tau epsilon G(3) and the Gray codes we obtain have distances 4 or 5. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
