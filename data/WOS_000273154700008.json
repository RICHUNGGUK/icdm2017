It states that, two local unitary equivalent stabilizer states are also local Clifford equivalent. If this conjecture were true, the local equivalence of stabilizer states would be extremely easy to characterize. Unfortunately, however, based on the recent progress made by Gross and Van den Nest, we find that the conjecture is false.", "paper_title": "THE LU-LC CONJECTURE IS FALSE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154700008"}
