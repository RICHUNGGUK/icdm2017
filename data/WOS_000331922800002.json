Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of \"Big Data\". System of Systems (SOS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today's SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable \"Big Data\". Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called \"Data Analytics\", which uses statistical and computational intelligence (Cl) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation (such as genetic algorithms), Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of \"Big Data\" to a manageable size and apply these tools to (a) extract information, (b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and (c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the \"Big Data\". This paper demonstrates how to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. The subject material for this demonstration is using data analytics to generate a model to forecast produced photovoltaic energy to assist in the optimization of a micro grid SoS. Tools like fuzzy interference, neural networks, PCA, and genetic algorithms are used. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
