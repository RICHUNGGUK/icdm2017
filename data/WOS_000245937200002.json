Specifically, we show how language change can be explained by using a new variant of membrane systems: Dynamic Meaning Membrane Systems (DMMS). By using DMMS, we model the main concepts of semantics and explain the three basic types of changes in meaning: broadening, narrowing and shift. Finally, we relate the membrane systems' application to language evolution with the suggested application of the so-called cultural grammar systems to the same topic. Collaboration between the two frameworks may provide a useful formalism that, due to its naturalness and simplicity, might offer interesting results in a discipline traditionally far away from any formalization.", "paper_title": "Dynamic meaning membrane systems: An application to the description of semantic change", "paper_id": "WOS:000245937200002"}
