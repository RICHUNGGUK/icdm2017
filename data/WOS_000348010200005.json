In this paper, we propose and set up CU-Simulator, a parallel radio channel simulator to enhance the performance for simulating data packet transmission in WSNs using NVIDIA's CUDA-enabled GPU parallel computing architecture. First, the node positions are simulated on GPU. Second, we propose an efficient data structure for acceleration, called CUDA-quad-trees, residing in the fast on-chip memory of GPU, to organize sensor nodes in such a manner that the detection of possible transmitters is facilitated. Third, a CUDA parallel radio channel simulating engine is established. Experimental results show that CU-Simulator has a super-linear scalability and greatly outperforms a CPU implementation with up to 452.07-times speedup on an HP Z800 workstation with a NVIDIA Tesla C2070 card and an Intel Xeon Core-quad CPU.", "paper_title": "CU-Simulator: A Parallel Scalable Simulation Platform for Radio Channel in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348010200005"}
