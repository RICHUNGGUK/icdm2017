Properties of such codes are here studied, determining among other things parameters of certain subcodes. A utilization of these properties makes a computer-aided classification of the optimal binary one-error-correcting codes of lengths 12 and 13 possible; there are 237 610 and 117 823 such codes, respectively (with 27 375 and 17 513 inequivalent extensions). This completes the classification of optimal binary one-error-correcting codes for all lengths up to 15. Some properties of the classified codes are further investigated. Finally, it is proved that for any m >= 4, there are optimal binary one-error-correcting codes of length 2(m) - 4 and 2(m) - 3 and that cannot be lengthened to perfect codes of length 2(m) - 1.", "paper_title": "On Optimal Binary One-Error-Correcting Codes of Lengths 2(m)-4 and 2(m)-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000031"}
