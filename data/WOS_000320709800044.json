This representation is also shown to apply to cases when the impairing noise is compound Gaussian. Using this general result, it is proved that the symbol error rate is completely monotone if the rank of its constellation matrix is either one or two. Further, a necessary and sufficient condition for the complete monotonicity of the symbol error rate of a constellation of any dimension is also obtained. Applications to stochastic ordering of wireless system performance are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A Representation for the Symbol Error Rate Using Completely Monotone Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800044"}
