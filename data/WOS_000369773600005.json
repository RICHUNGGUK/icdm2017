First previous results for exponential smoothing in L-1 are generalized using the regression quantiles, including a generalization to more parameters. Then a method based on the classical sign test is introduced that should deal not only with outliers but also with level shifts, including a detection of change points. Properties of various approaches are investigated by means of a simulation study. A real data example is used as an illustration.", "paper_title": "EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING BASED ON L-ESTIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000369773600005"}
