The system relies on two modalities for accessing images - automated image annotation and NNk image network browsing. The user supplies the initial query in the form of one or more keywords and is then able to locate the desired images more precisely using a browsing interface.", "paper_title": "A large scale system for searching and browsing images from the World Wide Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500063"}
