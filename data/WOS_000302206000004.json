New encoding scheme is implemented with appropriate objective function. This approach in most cases keeps the feasibility of individuals by using specific representation and modified genetic operators. The numerical experiments were carried out on the standard data sets known from the literature and results were successful comparing to two other recent heuristic for solving RCSP", "paper_title": "A Genetic Algorithm for the Routing and Carrier Selection Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000302206000004"}
