We calculate the geometrical and the mechanical parameters of the axoneme, and compared them with experimental data. We make predictions about nonlinear shapes, including possible solitary waves in the curvature, which can explain certain swimming patterns of the cells. (C) 2009 IMACS Published by Elsevier B.V.
