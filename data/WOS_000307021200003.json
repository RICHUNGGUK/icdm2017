The main goal of the paper is to foster the process of e-learning simulation by providing students and teachers with effective and comprehensive tools for creating, storing and executing discrete system simulation models. For these purposes the FONWEBGPSS application was developed and integrated into the e-learning system Moodle. The integration is implemented on three levels: users, processes and learning resources. The integration of users and processes is performed by synchronizing data in both systems. The integration of learning resources is performed by adjusting and implementing the IEEE LOM profile for learning simulation. In order to evaluate the impact of the proposed solution on the learning simulation outcome, research has been performed within the undergraduate course Simulation and simulation languages at the University of Belgrade. Research results indicate that students achieve better results in learning simulation when using FONWEBGPSS application integrated into the e-learning system than learning in a traditional way.", "paper_title": "Web-based Environment for Learning Discrete Event Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307021200003"}
