Accurate benchmark results are provided for steady solutions as well as for periodic solutions around the critical Reynolds number. Numerous comparisons with the results available in the literature are given. The first Hopf bifurcation is localized by a study of the linearized problem. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
