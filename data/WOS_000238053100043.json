The data used were extracted from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary database of disordered speech. The linear prediction coefficients are used as input to the pattern recognition problem. Two techniques are developed. The first technique is an optimal linear classifier design, while the second one is based on the dual-space linear discriminant analysis. Two experiments were conducted in order to assess the performance of the techniques developed namely the detection of vocal fold paralysis for male speakers and the detection of vocal fold edema for female speakers. Receiver operating characteristic curves are presented. Long-term mean feature vectors are proven very efficient in detecting the voice disorders yielding a probability of detection that may approach 100% for a probability of false alarm equal to 9.52%.", "paper_title": "Detection of vocal fold paralysis and edema using linear discriminant classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100043"}
