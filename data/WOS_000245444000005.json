The two major parties in Grid, namely, resource consumers who submit various applications, and resources providers who share their resources, usually have different motivations when they join the Grid. These incentives are presented by objective functions in scheduling. Economic grid QoS scheduling algorithm adopt both application-centric and resource-centric scheduling objective function aim to optimize the performance of each individual grid user and the performance of the grid resources. The economic cost and profit are considered by grid users and resource providers respectively. Objective functions and QoS scheduling optimization algorithms are proposed. QoS scheduling optimization is decomposed into two sub optimizations of grid user's cost and grid resource provider's profit by utilizing dynamic programming. QoS scheduling algorithm is an interactive process in economic market coordinating grid users and grid resource providers to achieve optimal QoS scheduling. Experiments are to compare the proposed economic QoS scheduling with three partial optimisation approaches, which only consider one criterion.", "paper_title": "A pricing approach for grid resource scheduling with QoS guarantees", "paper_id": "WOS:000245444000005"}
