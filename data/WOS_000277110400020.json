This idea has spawned the developing field of affective tutoring systems (ATSs) ATSs are ITSs that are able to adapt to the affective state of students However. ATSs are not widely employed in the tutoring system market In this paper, a survey was conducted to investigate the critical factors affecting learner's satisfaction in ATSs based on an ATS developed by us. The results revealed that learner's attitude toward affective computing, agent tutor's expressiveness, emotion recognition accuracy, number of emotions recognized by agent tutor, pedagogical action and easy of the use of the system have significant influence on learner's satisfaction The results indicate institutions how to further strengthen the ATSs' implementation.
