The reason for choosing credibility measure is given. Several mathematical definitions of risk of an investment in the portfolio are introduced. Some credibilistic portfolio selection models are presented, including mean-risk model, mean-variance model, mean-semivariance model, credibility maximization model, alpha-return maximization model, entropy optimization model and game models. A hybrid intelligent algorithm for solving the optimization models is documented. In addition, as extensions of credibilistic portfolio selection approaches, the paper also gives a brief review of some hybrid portfolio selection models.", "paper_title": "A review of credibilistic portfolio selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000269419700003"}
