In this paper, we propose to eliminate the send-side copy when an application buffer is reused frequently. We show that it is more efficient to register the application buffer and use it for data transfer. The idea is examined for small message transfer protocols in MVAPICH2, including RDMA Write and Send/Receive based communications, one-sided communications and collectives. The proposed protocol adaptively falls back to the current protocol when the application does not frequently use its buffers. The performance results over InfiniBand indicate up to 14% improvement for single message latency, close to 20% improvement for one-sided operations and up to 25% improvement for collectives. In addition, the communication time in MPI applications with high buffer reuse is improved using this technique.", "paper_title": "Exploiting application buffer reuse to improve MPI small message transfer protocols over RDMA-enabled networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297347400004"}
