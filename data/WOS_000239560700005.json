We model facial expressions as isometries of the facial surface and find the correspondence between two faces as the minimum-distortion mapping. Generalized multidimensional scaling is used for this goal. We apply our approach to texture mapping onto 3-D video, expression exaggeration and morphing between faces.", "paper_title": "Facetoface : An isometric model for facial animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700005"}
