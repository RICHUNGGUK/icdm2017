Their successful implementation primarily on difficult and complicated optimization problems, stresses their upcoming importance in the broader area of artificial intelligence. NII techniques take advantage of the way that biological systems deal with real-world situations. Specifically, they simulate the way real biological systems, such as the human brain, ant colonies and human immune system work, when solving complex real world situations. In this survey paper, we briefly present a number of selected NII approaches and we point particular suitable areas of application for each of them. Specifically, five major categories of nature inspired approaches are presented, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), DNA computing, artificial immune systems and membrane computing. Applications include problems related to optimization (financial, industrial and medical), task scheduling, system design (optimization of the system's parameters), image processing and data processing (feature selection and classification). We also refer to collaboration between NII techniques and classical AI methodologies, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, etc. The current survey states that NII techniques are likely to become the next step in the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence tools.", "paper_title": "NATURE-INSPIRED INTELLIGENCE: A REVIEW OF SELECTED METHODS AND APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776300001"}
