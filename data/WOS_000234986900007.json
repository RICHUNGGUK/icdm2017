The algorithm, FFTSVD, is Green's-function-independent for low-frequency kernels and efficient for inhomogeneous problems. FFTSVD is a multiscale algorithm that decomposes the problem domain using an octree and uses sampling to calculate low-rank approximations to dominant source distributions and responses. Long-range interactions at each length scale are computed using the FFT. Computational results illustrate that the FFTSVD algorithm performs better than precorrected-FFT (pFFT)-style algorithms or the multipole-style algorithms in FastCap.", "paper_title": "FFTSVD: A fast multiscale boundary-element method solver suitable for bio-MEMS and biomolecule simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234986900007"}
