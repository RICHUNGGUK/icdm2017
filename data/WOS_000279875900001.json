For these general measures we introduce a notion of independence and study its main properties in order to compare it with classical definitions present in the literature. The particular case of Wiener-Shannon information measure is taken in consideration and the links between the provided independence for information measures and the independence for the underlying probability are analyzed.", "paper_title": "INDEPENDENCE AND CONDITIONAL DECOMPOSABLE INFORMATION MEASURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000279875900001"}
