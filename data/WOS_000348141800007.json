For multiuser and multipath fading environments, both intersymbol interference and multiple-access interference must be considered. We propose narrowband and wideband antennas and Wiener code filter for MIMO OFDM-CDMA systems. The proposed receivers are updated symbol-by-symbol to achieve low computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed Wiener code filter can improve the system performance for the proposed adaptive antennas. The wideband antenna can achieve better error-rate performance than that of the narrowband antenna when multipath effect exists. The convergence rate of the recursive least squares antennas is faster than that of the least mean square antennas.
