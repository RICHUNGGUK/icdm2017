Our algorithm incorporates other discriminant information to train KNN classifier. This new KNN scheme is also applied in a community detection algorithm for mobile-aware service: First, as the edges of networks, the social relation between mobile nodes is quantified with social network theory; second, we would construct the mobile nodes optimal path tree and calculate the similarity index of adjacent nodes; finally, the community dispersion is defined to evaluate the clustering results and measure the quality of community structure. Promising experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for recognition and detection tasks.", "paper_title": "SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING OF K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS USING A NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SELF-CONTAINED CRITERION IN FOR MOBILE-AWARE SERVICE", "paper_id": "WOS:000325277900003"}
