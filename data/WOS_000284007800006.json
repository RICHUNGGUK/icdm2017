This would lead to redundant traffic and P2P network partition in mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We propose an approach to construct an efficient unstructured P2P overlay over MANET using underlying cluster-based routing (CBRP). One of the peers in the P2P network is used as a root-peer to connect all peers. Each peer maintains connection with physically closer peers such that it can reach the root-peer. The peer constructs a minimum-spanning tree consisting of itself, its directly connected neighbor peers and 2-hop away neighbor peers to remove far away redundant links and to build an overlay closer to the physical network. Due to on-demand nature of inter-cluster routing of CBRP, the positioning algorithm for MANET is used to retrieve the file by a peer from the source peer via shorter path in the physical network. We can show by simulation that our approach performs better in comparison with the existing approach.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Overlay for Unstructured P2P File Sharing over MANET using Underlying Cluster-based Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000284007800006"}
