The corresponding emphasis function can be written as a product of a factor that measures the quadratic error and a factor related to the proximity to the classification border; this fact opens the door to explore the potential advantages provided by using adjustable combined forms of these factors. In this paper, we introduce a principled procedure to select the combination parameter each time a new learner is added to the ensemble, just by maximizing the associated edge parameter, calling the resulting method the dynamically adapted weighted emphasis RA (DW-RA). A number of application examples illustrates the performance improvements obtained by DW-RA.", "paper_title": "A dynamically adjusted mixed emphasis method for building boosting ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000252516700002"}
