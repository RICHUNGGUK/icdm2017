The algorithm uses fast nondominated sorting procedure, communication between the colony members and a simple chemotactical strategy to change the bacterial positions in order to explore the search space to find several optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is validated using 11 benchmark problems and implementing three different performance measures to compare its performance with the NSGA-II genetic algorithm and with the particle swarm-based algorithm NSPSO.
