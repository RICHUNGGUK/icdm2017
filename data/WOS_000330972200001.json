It is well known that there is a tiling of R (n) by crosses for all n. AlBdaiwi and the first author proved that if 2n+1 is not a prime then there are non-congruent regular (= face-to-face) tilings of R (n) by crosses, while there is a unique tiling of R (n) by crosses for n=2,3. They conjectured that this is always the case if 2n+1 is a prime. To support the conjecture we prove in this paper that also for R (5) there is a unique regular, and no non-regular, tiling by crosses. So there is a unique tiling of R (3) by crosses, there are tilings of R (4), but for R (5) there is again only one tiling by crosses. We guess that this result goes against our intuition that suggests 'the higher the dimension of the space, the more freedom we get'.", "paper_title": "Tiling R-5 by Crosses", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972200001"}
