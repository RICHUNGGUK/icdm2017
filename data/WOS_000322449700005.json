The method works in two alternating phases. In the first, the compute phase, the circuit is awake and active, operating briskly at a greater-than-nominal supply voltage which causes tasks to complete more quickly. In the second, the idle phase, the circuit is power-gated and put to sleep, enabling BTI recovery. Since the wakeful stage works at an elevated supply voltage, it results in greater aging than operation at the nominal supply voltage, but the sleep state involves a recovery that more than compensates for this differential. We demonstrate, both at the circuit and the architectural levels, that at about the same performance, this approach can result in appreciable BTI mitigation, thus reducing the guardbands necessary to protect against aging, which results in power savings over the conventional design.", "paper_title": "Employing Circadian Rhythms to Enhance Power and Reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000322449700005"}
