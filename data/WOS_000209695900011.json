Compared with the original SUS algorithm, the proposed user selection algorithm achieves the same performance, but with significantly less complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can make a good tradeoff between performance and complexity for the MU-MIMO system with ZFBF.", "paper_title": "Simplified Semi-Orthogonal User Selection for MU-MIMO Systems with ZFBF", "paper_id": "WOS:000209695900011"}
