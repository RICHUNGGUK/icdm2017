This study integrates quality function deployment (QFD), management techniques to optimise product-design investment, process improvement, and phase-into meet customer requirements and company goals. QFD uses systematic multi-level development and evaluation to translate customer requirements into the design of product characteristics and manufacturing processes that will satisfy the customer and minimise potential failure costs. 'Process management', which is one of the pivotal Six Sigma implementation criteria, is used to construct an 'integrated product and process development' (IPPD) model by product type to enhance the effectiveness of QFD. This model, combined with a company's customer satisfaction strategy and QFD techniques, provides process management through built-in IPPD and appropriate changes in organisational culture. This paper presents a case study from the semiconductor industry to demonstrate the model's applicability and suitability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
