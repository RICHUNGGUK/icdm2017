The location and amount of meiotic DSBs can be examined by using a common molecular biological technique called Southern blotting, but only a subset of the total DSBs can be observed; only DSB fragments still carrying the region recognized by a Southern blot probe are detected. With the assumption that DSB formation follows a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, we propose two estimators of the total number of DSBs on a chromosome: (1) an estimator based on the Nelson-Aalen estimator, and (2) an estimator based on a record value process. Further, we compared their asymptotic accuracy.", "paper_title": "Estimating the Number of Double-Strand Breaks Formed During Meiosis from Partial Observation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311955700002"}
