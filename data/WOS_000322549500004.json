Modelling of this problem has become an important research topic recently. This paper revokes AdaBoostSeq multi-label classification algorithm and examines it in order to check its robustness properties. It can be stated that AdaBoostSeq is able to result with quite stable Hamming Loss evaluation measure regardless of the size of input and output space.", "paper_title": "Boosting-based Multi-label Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000322549500004"}
