We define a measure of the information recall and show that our new associative memory is able to recall more than twice as much information as a Hopfield network. The extra efficiency of our associative memory is all the more remarkable as it uses only bits while the Hopfield network uses integers.", "paper_title": "Efficient and robust associative memory from a generalized Bloom filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000305951000005"}
