Listeners reported that their perceived attention allocation increased consistently as speech intelligibility for sentences decreased from 100% to 75%. In this study, self-perceptions of attention allocation peaked between 75% and 80% intelligibility. These results support the conclusion that listeners experience a considerable perceptual load as they attempt to comprehend the messages of persons whose speech has relatively high intelligibility but distorted due to dysarthria.
