Among its latest outcomes, the proposals to communicate heterogeneous systems and integrate external tools into existing LMSs stand out. This paper describes the adoption of these recent IMS specifications to integrate external tools and applications into the Game.Tel learning platform. Although Game.Tel was originally designed to support game-based learning in a multi-device environment, this paper will demonstrate how the IMS specifications have allowed us to easily integrate a wide range of existing applications with a clear potential for education and training.", "paper_title": "Design of Flexible and Open Learning Management Systems using IMS Specifications.
