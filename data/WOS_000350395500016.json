Nevertheless, most discussed issues in recommendation system research domain are the cold-start problem. In this paper we proposed a novel approach to address this problem by combining similarity values obtain from a movie \"Facebook Pages\". To achieve this, we first compute users' similarity according to the rating cast on our Movie Rating System. Then, we combined similarity value obtain from user's genre interest in \"Like\" information extracted from \"Facebook Pages\". Finally, all the similarity values are combined to produce a new user's similarity value. Our experiment results show that our approach is outperformed in cold-start problem compared to the benchmark algorithms. To evaluate whether our system is strong enough to recommend higher accuracy recommendation to users, we also conducted prediction coverage in this research work.", "paper_title": "Alleviating the cold-start problem by incorporating movies facebook pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000350395500016"}
