In this work, we propose a new block cipher scheme, AKF, based on a Feistel structure with alternating keys but resistant against related key attacks. AKF leads constructions of lightweight block ciphers suitable for resource restricted devices such as RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes. Using AKF we also present a software oriented lightweight block cipher, ITUBEE, especially suitable for wireless sensor nodes. We show that ITUBEE has a better performance than most of the ciphers which were compared in a recent work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
