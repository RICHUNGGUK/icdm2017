Recent advances in photonic integration technology are paving the way for a disruptive step in the design. Of these networks. We present spinet, an optical interconnection network architecture designed for implementation using photonic integration, providing an end-to-end photonic path while completely avoiding optical buffering. spinet resolves contentions through message dropping, but facilitates message recovery using a novel physical-layer acknowledgment protocol.", "paper_title": "Building ultralow-latency interconnection networks using photonic integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000249654900003"}
