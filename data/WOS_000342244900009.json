We propose an extension of Arakawa's classical finite difference scheme for fluid flow in the vorticity-stream function formulation to a high order discontinuous Galerkin approximation. In addition, we show numerical simulations that demonstrate the accuracy of the scheme and verify the conservation properties, which are essential for long time integration. Furthermore, we discuss the massively parallel implementation on graphic processing units. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
