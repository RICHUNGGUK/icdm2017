Our scheme shows how to \"convert\" a static network into a dynamic distributed hash table(DHT)-based P2P network such that all the good properties of the static network are guaranteed with high probability (w.h.p). Applying our scheme to a cube-connected cycles network, for example, yields a O(logN) degree connected network, in which every search succeeds in O(logN) hops w.h.p., using O(logN) messages, where N is the expected stable network size. Our scheme has an constant storage overhead (the number of nodes responsible for servicing a data item) and an O(logN) overhead (messages and time) per insertion and essentially no overhead for deletions. All these bounds are essentially optimal. While DHT schemes with similar guarantees are already known in the literature, this work is new in the following aspects: (1) It presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the scheme under a general stochastic model of churn and shows the above guarantees; (2) The theoretical analysis is complemented by a simulation-based analysis that validates the asymptotic bounds even in moderately sized networks and also studies performance under changing stable network size; (3) The presented scheme seems especially suitable for maintaining dynamic structures under churn efficiently. In particular, we show that a spanning tree of low diameter can be efficiently maintained in constant time and logarithmic number of messages per insertion or deletion w.h.p.", "paper_title": "Stochastic analysis of a churn-tolerant structured peer-to-peer scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000313413100001"}
