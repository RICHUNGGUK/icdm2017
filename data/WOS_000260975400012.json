We are interested in some variants motivated by bin packing problems. Specifically we consider open-end coloring, cardinality constrained coloring, coloring with vector constraints and finally a combination of both the cardinality and the vector constraints. We construct competitive algorithms for each of the variants. Additionally, we present a lower bound of 24/7 for interval coloring with bandwidth, which holds for all the above models, and improves the current lower bound for the standard interval coloring with bandwidth problem.
