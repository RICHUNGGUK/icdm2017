The time-varying delays contain a large delay period (LDP), which is often present in practical control systems. Such descriptor system with LDP has been modeled as a switched descriptor system with delay, which may include an unstable subsystem caused by large delay bound. By adopting the switching technique and constructing a novel Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, stability criteria are proposed under the restriction frequency and the rate of LDP to ensure that the descriptor system is regular, impulse free and exponentially stable. Finally, an integrated circuit example and a numerical simulation are given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
