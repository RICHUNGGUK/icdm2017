Engineers have proposed many identity based authentication schemes for remote login systems in past decades. In recent years, the security mechanism for the dynamic identity of legal user appearance has become a new technology in the field of network communications. This novel technology has allowed us to conduct a more secure remote user authentication scheme using a smart card, in which the well-designed module has remedied the system drawback of a static identity based authentication scheme. However, many kinds of authentication schemes need a system of synchronized clocks to withstand replay attacks and achieve mutual authentication, and most of them cannot propose a lightweight mechanism to reduce implementation complexity and achieve computation efficiency. Therefore, we propose a new dynamic identity based authentication scheme using three-way challenge-response strategy to achieve mutual authentication without a system of synchronized clocks. It completely prevents various attacks, supports the session key agreement, and offers the functionality advantages. As a result, the proposed scheme seems to be more secure and suitable for remote communication environment with low computation consumption and better security attributes.", "paper_title": "A Secure Dynamic Identity Based Remote User Authentication Scheme Using Secret Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900009"}
