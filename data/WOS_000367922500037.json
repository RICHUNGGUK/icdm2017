Identity-based cryptography is more convenient than public key infrastructure-based cryptography in certificate management. As a result, identity-based signcryption has been studied extensively, and many efficient and provably secure constructions have been proposed. However, most of these schemes are based on intractability assumptions from number theory, and these assumptions have been threatened by the booming quantum computation. Therefore, a recent trend in cryptography is to construct cryptosystems that are based on lattice-based intractability assumptions because of their plausible features of quantum attack resistance. In this paper, several identity-based signcryption schemes from lattice hardness assumptions are proposed. In the standard model, these schemes are indistinguishable against inner adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and strongly unforgeable against inner chosen message attacks. In our construction, it does not matter whether the original encryption scheme used to construct signcryption is deterministic or probabilistic; the resulted signcryption schemes can reach IND-CCA2 security. To achieve this, we carefully combine three techniques-the identity-based encryption from lattice due to Agrawal-Boneh-Boyen (EUROCRYPT 2010), the framework of lattice-based short signature due to Boyen (Public Key Cryptography 2010), and the Canetti-Halevi-Katz (abbr. CHK) technique, with necessary and tailored optimization-for transforming an (l + 1)-level indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attack secure hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) into an l level IND-CCA2 secure HIBE scheme. In addition, our security proof also contains a more efficient simulation tool that might have separate interest in cryptographic applications.
