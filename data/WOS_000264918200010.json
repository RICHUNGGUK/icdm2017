Using the Poincare map and the properties of the Lambert W function, we prove the sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of semi-trivial solutions and positive periodic solutions. Numerical results are carried out to illustrate the feasibility of our main results. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
