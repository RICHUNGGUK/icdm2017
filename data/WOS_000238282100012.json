Attention is focused on formulating the design of robust fault detection filter as H. filtering problem and designing the adaptive threshold. The existence condition of the above filters, which can guarantee the prescribed performance index, is established by means of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "An LMI approach to robust fault detection filter design for uncertain state-delayed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100012"}
