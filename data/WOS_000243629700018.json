This paper proposes a new dynamic satellite bandwidth allocation technique (Predictive Resource Reservation Access, PRRA) which is based on accurate videoconference traffic prediction. Our work is combined with another work on data traffic modeling and prediction and is shown to provide very good throughput and delay results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
