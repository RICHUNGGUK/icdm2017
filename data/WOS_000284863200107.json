Most users and software are mainly focused in content dissemination and group works, but the possibilities that Internet LMSs could offer go further. Some recent approaches use semantic web to improve the capabilities and user experiences in e-learning by mean of artificial intelligence and knowledge management techniques. In this work, we develop a procedure to achieve the integration of different e-learning systems, and to give semantics to entities and relations in the database of LMSs by mean of ontologies. This integration could ease the dissemination of learning resources and knowledge from the databases of the Learning Management Systems. Moreover, the semantic interpretation of database schemes would allow to find precise information quickly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
