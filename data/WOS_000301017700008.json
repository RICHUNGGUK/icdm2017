One of the most practical approaches for preventing such crimes is the installation of cameras in ATMs to capture the facial images of users for follow-up criminal investigations. However, this approach is vulnerable in cases where a criminal's face is occluded. Therefore, this paper proposes a system which assesses the recognizability of facial images of ATM users to determine whether their faces are severely occluded. The proposed system uses a component-based face candidate generation and verification approach to handle various facial postures and acceptable partial occlusions. Element techniques are implemented via grayscale image-based methods which are robust against illumination conditions compared to skin color detection approach. The system architecture for achieving both high performance and cost-efficiency is proposed to make the system applicable to practical ATM environments. In the experiment, the feasibility of the proposed system was evaluated using a large-scale facial occlusion database consisting of 3168 image sequences including 21 facial occlusions, 8 illumination conditions, and 2 acquisition scenarios. Based on the results, we drew up the guidelines of recognizability assessment systems for ATM applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
