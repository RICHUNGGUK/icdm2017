Specifically, cross-layer operation across the PHYsical layer (PHY), the Data Link layer (DL) and even the NETwork layer (NET) is exemplified for improving the energy efficiency of the entire system. Moreover, the philosophy of Opportunistic Routing (OR) is reviewed for the sake of further reducing the system's energy dissipation with the aid of optimized Power Allocation (PA). The system's end-to-end throughput is also considered in the context of a design example.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Aided Energy-Efficient Routing Design for Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360315700002"}
