The twisted GFSR and the Mersenne twister are famous recent examples. Besides the period length, the statistical quality of these generators is usually assessed via their equidistribution properties. The huge-period generators proposed so far are not quite optimal in this respect. In this article, we propose new generators of that form with better equidistribution and \"bit-mixing\" properties for equivalent period length and speed. The state of our new generators evolves in a more chaotic way than for the Mersenne twister. We illustrate how this can reduce the impact of persistent dependencies among successive output values, which can be observed in certain parts of the period of gigantic generators such as the Mersenne twister.", "paper_title": "Improved long-period generators based on linear recurrences modulo 2", "paper_id": "WOS:000238273300001"}
