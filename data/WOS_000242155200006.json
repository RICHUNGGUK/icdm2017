We advocate that, for multi-agent simulation, this dynamism must be modeled explicitly as part of the simulated environment, preferably using concepts and constructs that relate to the real world. In this paper, we describe such concepts and constructs, and we provide a formal framework to unambiguously specify their relations and meaning. We apply the formal framework to model a dynamic RoboCup Soccer environment and elaborate on how the framework poses new challenges for exploring the modeling of environments in multi-agent simulation.", "paper_title": "Modeling dynamic environments in multi-agent simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242155200006"}
