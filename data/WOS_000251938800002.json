Apart from network technology advances, the design and implementation of robust and efficient CDNs in large-scale computing environments call for paradigms and software technologies which are able to support the core functionalities of CDNs, namely distribution, management, discovery, and delivery of content. Agent, GRID, and P2P computing paradigms and technologies have already demonstrated their suitability in supporting the development of high-performance systems over large-scale, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. Therefore the combined use of all three paradigms and technologies which are characterized by dynamism, robustness, and intelligence, is expected to increase the effectiveness and boost the efficiency of future CDNs. In this paper, we present UPGRADE-CDN, an experimental component-based platform which jointly uses P2P, GRID, and Agent based mechanisms for client request redirection, CDN monitoring, and content delivery.
