Different types of interactions are obtained enabling the deterministic transfer and teleportation of composite quantum systems for arbitrary subsystem dimension and for arbitrary numbers of subsystems. The subsystems may become entangled in the transmission in which case the protocols can serve generalized teleportation based information processing as well as storage and transmission functions. We explore the cases of two qubits and two qutrits in detail, obtaining a maximally entangling mapping of the composite systems and discuss the use of a continuous variable bus.", "paper_title": "TELEPORTATION OF COMPOSITE SYSTEMS FOR COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000261782200001"}
