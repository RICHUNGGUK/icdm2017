The probes included the derivatives of dansyl, bimane, pyrene, benzofurazan, nonaphthalene, coumarin, anthracene and fluorescein. with the wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 600 nm. The Heuristic Method (HM) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs) were employed to construct linear and nonlinear prediction models, respectively. The proposed linear models for lambda(ex) and lambda(em) contain five descriptors with the squared correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.888 and 0.897, respectively Better prediction results were obtained from RBFNN model, with the squared correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.948 and 0.939 for lambda(ex) and lambda(em) respectively.
