We introduce the basic OWA operator and look at some cases of the generalized OWA operator. We next look at the issue of importance weighted mean aggregation. We provide a generalized formulation using a fuzzy measure to convey information about the importances of the different arguments in the aggregation. We look at some different measures and the associated importance formulation they manifest. We further generalize our formulation by allowing for the inclusion of an attitudinal aggregation function. This allows us to implement many different types of aggregation including Max, Min and Median. Finally we provide a simple parameterized formulation for generalized class of mean operators.
