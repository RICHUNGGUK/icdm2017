We focus on the synchronization of the motion of the machines, and using the nature of wireless, we propose a new wireless control scheme for maintaining the synchronization performance under packet loss conditions. In the proposed scheme, each controlled object (plant) utilizes control information destined for all plants, and the main controller also utilizes state information of all plants. The additional information of the other controller-plant pairs is used to compensate lost information. As an example of the controlled plants, rotary inverted pendulums, which move synchronously with wireless connections in their control-feedback loops, are considered. Numerical examples confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme from the view-point of the synchronization of the motion of the plants.", "paper_title": "A Wireless Control System with Mutual Use of Control Signals for Cooperative Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000302834500004"}
