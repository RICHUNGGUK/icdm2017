However, their design complexity is very high, and raises additional problems, i.e. the definition of a suitable programming model, an efficient memory organization, and the need for ways to optimize application performance. In this paper, we propose a complete development process, which addresses these problems by complementing the current SoC (System-on-Chip) development process with additional steps to support parallel programming and software optimization. This work explains systematically problems and solutions to achieve a FPGA-based MPSoC following our systematic flow and offering tools and techniques to develop parallel applications for such systems.
