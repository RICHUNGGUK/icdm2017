Such recognition is difficult due to high dimensionality of the data and large spatial and temporal variations in the same action. We decompose the high dimensional 3-D joint space into a set of feature spaces where each feature corresponds to the motion of a single joint or combination of related multiple joints. For each feature, the dynamics of each action class is learned with one HMM. Given a sequence, the observation probability is computed in each HMM and a weak classifier for that feature is formed based on those probabilities. The weak classifiers with strong discriminative power are then combined by the Multi-Class AdaBoost (AdaBoost.M2) algorithm. A dynamic programming algorithm is applied to segment and recognize actions simultaneously. Results of recognizing 22 actions on a large number of motion capture sequences as well as several annotated and automatically tracked sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Recognition and segmentation of 3-D human action using HMM and multi-class AdaBoost", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400028"}
