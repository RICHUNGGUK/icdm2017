The methodology provides a monotonic sequence of convex polyhedra, converging from the interior to the convex domain. If the latter is non-empty, a simple algorithm is proposed, that yields a sequence of polytopes converging uniformly to the restriction of the convex domain to any user-specified bounding box. The algorithm is illustrated for a pair of planar and a spatial Bezier configuration.", "paper_title": "A discrete methodology for controlling the sign of curvature and torsion for NURBS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649000005"}
