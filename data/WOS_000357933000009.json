With an appropriate augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) formulated, the convex combination method is utilised to estimate the derivative of the LKF. Some new delay-dependent exponential stability criteria for such systems are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which involve fewer matrix variables and have less conservatism. Finally, two illustrative numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our obtained results.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent exponential stability for uncertain neutral stochastic neural networks with interval time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000357933000009"}
