It should control the transmitted programs that can be accessed by the authorized subscribers. Thus, the subscribers can be charged, and any illegal access can be prevented. Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are an enabling technology for ubiquitous access to the Internet and a low-cost alternative to extend the Internet as compared with other wireless networks. This paper proposes a CA mechanism for ubiquitous VoD services based on WMNs. The scheme guarantees mutual authentication, privacy, and anonymity and also resists spoofed service provider attack, spoofed user attack, replay attack, message modification attack, illegal content distribution, and service repudiation.
