The conjunction of such two paradigms generates a new promising one, called pervasive grid computing, where mobile users can use handheld devices to access abundant resources and services in the grid. In this paper, a novel software partitioning algorithm is presented, which is suitable for pervasive grid to optimally allocate software components between a mobile device and one or more servers, with the goal of saving the resources of mobile devices. The algorithm takes into account component mobility constraints to not only prevent violating execution requirements of the application, but also to fully exploit component mobility, replication and rebinding to conserve more resources as compared to previous works. Another distinguishing feature of the algorithm is its generality, which can be applied to minimize network bandwidth usage, response time and energy consumption, respectively or simultaneously. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
