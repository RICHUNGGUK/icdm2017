The Bessel unit plays the role of \"three-in-one\": a delay line, an amplifier and a filter. Results of hardware experiments and numerical simulation are presented. Depending on the parameters of the nonlinear unit the oscillator operates either in a one-scroll or two-scroll mode. Two positive Lyapunov exponents, found at larger values of the negative slopes of the nonlinear function, characterize the oscillations as hyperchaotic.", "paper_title": "HIGHER-ORDER CHAOTIC OSCILLATOR USING ACTIVE BESSEL FILTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000278097900009"}
