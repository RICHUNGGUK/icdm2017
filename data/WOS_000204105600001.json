The historical evolution of copyright in common-law countries shows that, despite the balanced approach rooted in the legislation since the very beginning, legislators have constantly expanded the scope and duration of the protection offered to intellectual and artistic creations. This trend significantly reduces the potential of the digital revolution for a more democratic dissemination of information and knowledge. In this context, librarians should advocate a strong public domain and the extension of fair dealing to digital documents.", "paper_title": "A very short history of copyright: Adopting the user's perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000204105600001"}
