Due to the high compression ratio of H. 264/AVC, it is often common that an entire coded picture is packetized into one packet. Thus the loss of a packet may result in the loss of the whole video frame. Currently, most of the frame concealment methods are mainly for 2-D video transmission. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient frame concealment algorithm for depth image-based 3-D video transmission, which is able to provide accurate estimation for the motion vectors of the lost frame with the help of the depth information. Simulation results show that it is highly effective and significantly outperforms other existing frame recovery methods by up to 2.91 dB.", "paper_title": "Efficient Frame Concealment for Depth Image-Based 3-D Video Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000304166700023"}
