Therefore most simulations are limited to rather unrealistic small or medium sized networks (typically hundreds of neurons). In this paper, some methods for the fast simulation of large SNN are discussed. Our results equally amongst others show that event based simulation is an efficient way of simulating SNN, although not all neuron models are suited for an event based approach. We compare some models and discuss several techniques for accelerating the simulation of more complex models. Finally we present an algorithm that is able to handle multi-synapse models efficiently.", "paper_title": "Accelerating event based simulation for multi-synapse spiking neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100079"}
