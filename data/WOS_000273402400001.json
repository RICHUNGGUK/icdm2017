In the three-dimensional space, the objective function is to lexicographically minimize the x-moves, then the y-moves and finally the z-moves. The 2D and 3D cases are first studied and solved as a shortest path problem. Then the approach is generalized to the d-dimensional case.", "paper_title": "Lexicographically minimizing axial motions for the Euclidean TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000273402400001"}
