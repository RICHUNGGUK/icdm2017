These algorithms are based on mixture representations of these copulas using Laplace transforms. While in principle the approach applies to all nested Archimedean copulas, in practice the approach is restricted to certain cases where we are able to sample distributions with given Laplace transforms. Precise instructions are given for the case when all generators are taken from the Gumbel parametric family or the Clayton family; the Gumbel case in particular proves very easy to simulate.", "paper_title": "Sampling nested Archimedean copulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000257030600007"}
