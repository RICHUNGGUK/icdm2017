Leading edge mobile embedded systems usually support not only one FEC standard, but multiple FEC standards in order to adapt to various wireless communication standards. In this paper, we propose two-stage configurable decoder model (2-Stage CDM) for multiple FEC standards for Viterbi and Turbo coding which have a variation under the constraint length, coding rate, etc. Proposed decoder model realizes a decoder instance which supports dedicated multiple FEC standards, and rapid design for domain specific decoder is realized. Proposed decoder model is configurable in two stages: at hardware generation time and at runtime, and designers can easily specify these specifications by various design parameters. Experimental results show proposed two-stage configurable decoder model supports various domain specific FEC decoder including existing decoder, and the decoder instances based on proposed 2-Stage CDM have sufficient throughput for each communication standard and reasonable area overhead compared with existing decoder.", "paper_title": "Two-Stage Configurable Decoder Model for Domain Specific FEC Decoder Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800021"}
