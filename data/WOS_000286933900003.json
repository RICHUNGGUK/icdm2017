A zero is used to obtain the stability and a coarse buffer is added to reduce the settling time. The numbers of switches and resistors, which are used for the charge recycling and stability, respectively, are greatly reduced. An experimental prototype 6-bit source driver with five-level seven-phase charge recycling implemented in a 0.35-mu m CMOS technology demonstrates that the dc current consumption is only 830 mu A for 262,144 colors and 102 mu A for 512 colors, dynamic power saving is 70%, and the settling time, which includes the charge-recycling and data driving, is within 25 mu s. The area overhead is only 130 x 1380 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A TFT-LCD source-driver IC with charge-recycling technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900003"}
