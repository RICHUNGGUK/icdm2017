However, there are many obstacles to the application of this technology. One of the more challenging is the reconfiguration of SN-embedded VNs to adapt to varying demands. To address this problem, we propose a service level objective (SLO)-sensitive VN reconfiguration (VNR) method. A Bayesian network learning and probabilistic reasoning-based approach is proposed to automatically localise reconfiguration points and generate VN resource requests. To determine an optimal reconfiguration solution, we design a heuristic VNR algorithm with a virtual node and virtual link swapping strategy. We validate and evaluate this algorithm by conducting experiments in a high-fidelity emulation environment. Our results show that the proposed approach can effectively reconfigure a VN to adapt to a changed SLO. A comparison shows that our reconfiguration algorithm outperforms existing solutions.
