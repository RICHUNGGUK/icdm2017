Specific multiband devices to which G-NRI-TLs have been applied are discussed: both a dual-band coupled-line coupler operating at 2.7 and 4.7 GHz and a printed single-ended all-pass cell with two pairs of right- and left-handed bands are explained. The details of how each may be fabricated in a fully-printed layout are provided and simulated and measured results are given. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
