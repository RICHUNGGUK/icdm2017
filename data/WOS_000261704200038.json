Bifurcation theory and stability analysis is applied to determine how the number and stability of steady-states depend on dilution rate and feed composition for Klebsiella pneumoniae feeding on mixed glucose-xylose substrates. The biological system is analyzed using a cybernetic modeling approach. We propose a numerical strategy which enables us to determine all possible steady-states for a given set of operating conditions. The algorithm exploits the polynomial nature of the equations. Results for a model without maintenance are compared to the predictions of a model with maintenance. It is shown that the model without maintenance effects and constitutive enzyme synthesis rate admits spurious steady-state solutions, which disappear when these effects are taken into account. In both cases multiple steady-states are observed over a range of dilution rates. In addition, the model with maintenance also predicts dynamic instability in the form of self-sustained oscillations. We have also investigated the effect of various parameters on the region of multiplicity to determine operating conditions which would enable experimental verification of our predictions.
