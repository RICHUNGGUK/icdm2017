Future directions in this line of applied research are suggested The introduced methodology illustrates how the analysis of human information processes and psychological experiments can contribute to the evaluation of engineering applications (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Human cognition in manual assembly: Theories and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000280510900008"}
