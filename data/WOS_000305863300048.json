The mass transport parameters, such as effective diffusion coefficient, retardation factor and diffusion accessible porosity, are estimated from observed diffusion data by inverse analysis. Recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to develop inverse model for estimating these parameters that alleviated existing limitations in the inverse analysis. However, PSO solver yields different solutions in successive runs because of the stochastic nature of the algorithm and also because of the presence of multiple optimum solutions. Thus the estimated mean solution from independent runs is significantly different from the best solution. In this paper, two variants of the PSO algorithms are proposed to improve the performance of the inverse analysis. The proposed algorithms use perturbation equation for the gbest particle to gain information around gbest region on the search space and catfish particles in alternative iterations to improve exploration capabilities. Performance comparison of developed solvers on synthetic test data for two different diffusion problems reveals that one of the proposed solvers, CPPSO, significantly improves overall performance with improved best, worst and mean fitness values. The developed solver is further used to estimate transport parameters from 12 sets of experimentally observed diffusion data obtained from three diffusion problems and compared with published values from the literature. The proposed solver is quick, simple and robust on different diffusion problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
