The results showed that the Taguchi method might result in identifying incorrectly some insignificant factors as significant. In conclusion, Taguchi's quality engineering concepts are valuable, but his statistical tools, including: signal-to-noise ratio, testing at F value of four and pooling-up techniques, are found inefficient tools for robust design.", "paper_title": "Alpha mistake of Taguchi method with L-18 array for STB type QCH using simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735800006"}
