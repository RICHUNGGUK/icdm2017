In this paper, we discuss a project to develop a system that supports mobile wireless devices for visiting nurses, in place of an existing paper-based system. The wireless system allows nurses to securely access, update and query a central database containing patient information. One of the applications developed for this project is supplies management, where nurses can, during regular client visits, order replenishment stock to be delivered to the site by a supplier. We describe the detailed development of an \"As-Is\" business process map, leading to a significantly improved \"To-Be\" process to realize the expected benefits. A model of the ordering/logistics process was also developed, to evaluate supply service policy options that could further optimize supplies management.", "paper_title": "Supply Management for Home Healthcare Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000262383500005"}
