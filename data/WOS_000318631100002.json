While software product lines can be implemented efficiently using feature-oriented programming, verifying each product individually does not scale, especially if human effort is required (e. g., as in interactive theorem proving). We present a family-based approach of deductive verification to prove the correctness of a software product line efficiently. We illustrate and evaluate our approach for software product lines written in a feature-oriented dialect of Java and specified using the Java Modeling Language. We show that the theorem prover KeY can be used off-the-shelf for this task, without any modifications. Compared to the individual verification of each product, our approach reduces the verification time needed for our case study by more than 85 %.", "paper_title": "Family-Based Deductive Verification of Software Product Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000318631100002"}
