In this paper we review and evaluate the Simple Host (SH) traffic management mechanism that enables QoS provisioning within source-routed loss-less interconnect networks. SH provides statistical QoS guarantees for brokered multimedia traffic while supporting limited amounts of unbrokered background traffic. The results obtained from simulation show how to configure SH to provide statistical QoS based on jitter and latency requirements in an efficient manner.", "paper_title": "A statistical approach to traffic management in source routed loss-less networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300020"}
