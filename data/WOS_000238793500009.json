It is intended as a powerful tool in tire design and development complementary to experimental investigations. A contact model specially suited for the contact pairing rubber and rough road is developed. Subsequent changes of the model geometry in the course of the simulation allow for the reproduction of abrasion effects. The simulations are carried out by means of the Finite Element Method in a thermo-mechanically coupled manner. Exemplary simulation results are presented for 2D as well as 3D models of rubber tread blocks. By incorporation of sipes and by consideration of parallelogram shaped bases, a close approach to realistic tread patterns is achieved. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
