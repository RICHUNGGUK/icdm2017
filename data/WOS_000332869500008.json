By this link, an upper bound on the size of a 2-D (m x n, k, rho)-OOC with AM-OPPTS property is derived. Afterwards, we employ combinatorial methods to construct infinitely many 2-D (m x n, k, 1)-OOCs with AM-OPPTS property, whose existence was previously unknown. All these constructions meet the upper bounds with equality and are thus optimal.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial constructions for optimal 2-D optical orthogonal codes with AM-OPPTS property", "paper_id": "WOS:000332869500008"}
