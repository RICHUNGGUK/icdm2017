The method is in the form of derivative back-projection filtering with compensation of affine transformations on a local basis. Computer simulations showed the proposed method significantly reduces image artifact due to nonrigid motion. Therefore, with very little motion artifact, the proposed method allowed us to reconstruct images from projections over about one motion cycle, resulting in reduced image noise level down to 40% of the current level.", "paper_title": "Motion compensated fan-beam reconstruction for nonrigid transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257583600005"}
