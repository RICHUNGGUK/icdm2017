This paper presents two strategies to analyze attacks by intermediate spoofing attackers to identify the weaknesses of such attacks. The analyses lead to a code and carrier phase consistency detection method with simulation results showing that this method can indicate the receiver when spoofing has occurred. The method can be used by most receivers, is inexpensive, and requires only a small software upgrade.", "paper_title": "Intermediate Spoofing Strategies and Countermeasures", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529500006"}
