An incompressible viscous fluid fills the space inside the channel. Analytical and numerical solutions are developed for the momentum and energy equations. The viscous dissipation effects are taken into account. Graphs for pertinent flow parameters are sketched and discussed. Comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions indicates an excellent agreement. It is noticed that behaviors of Prandtl and Eckert numbers on the temperature are qualitatively similar.
