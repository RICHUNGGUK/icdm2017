After raising antibodies against histamine, they were characterized and used for ELISA measurements. Optimal detection conditions were determined for the histamine quantification by ELISA method. The present study investigates the derivatization step of the histamine by chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU). Five factors (2 qualitative: nature of the solvent and nature of the antibodies and 3 quantitative: pH, % of solvent and time of derivatization) have been considered. Optimal reaction conditions were established by calculation of a validated model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
