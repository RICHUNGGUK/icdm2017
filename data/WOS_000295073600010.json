Digital analysis of pathological voices can be an effective and non-invasive tool for the detection of such alterations. This paper proposes a wavelet-based method to distinguish between normal and disordered voices. Wavelet filter banks are used in conjunction with support vector machines, as feature extractors and classifiers, respectively. Orthogonal filter banks are implemented using a highly efficient structure known as \"lattice\" that parameterizes filter banks and produces a few parameters. The overall problem is to find these parameters such that perfect classification is achieved. To search for such parameters, a genetic algorithm with a fitness function corresponding to the classification result is applied. Simulation is done on the KAY database (a comprehensive database including 710 normal and pathological voice signals, developed by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Voice and Speech Lab), and one additional test set. It is observed that a genetic algorithm is able to find the filter bank parameters such that a 100% correct classification rate is achieved in classifying normal and pathological voices when the test is performed on both databases.
