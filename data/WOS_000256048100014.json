And, under what interpretations can modem mathematics and the theory of computer science be kept as completely as possible? Design/methodology/approach - The paper sets out the foundation for the system. Findings - Here, the logical foundation for the mathematical system of potential infinities is given. Originality/value - The logical calculus, which will be used as the tool of deduction in the PIMS, is established. This new tool of reasoning is a modification of the classical two-value logical calculus system.", "paper_title": "Mathematical system of potential infinities (II) - formal systems of logical basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100014"}
