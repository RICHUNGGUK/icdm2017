It is intended to be \"testing in proof engineering\". Although the realizability interpretation as well as the functional interpretation based on limit-computations were introduced as means for proof animation, they were unrealistic as an architectural basis for actual proof animation tools. We have found a game theoretic semantics corresponding to these interpretations, which is likely to be the right architectural basis for proof animation.", "paper_title": "Can proofs be animated by games?", "paper_id": "WOS:000248423100004"}
