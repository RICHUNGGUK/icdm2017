The model under consideration is more general than those investigated in most existing literature. By establishing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the delay differential inequality with impulsive initial conditions, boundary conditions and LMI, we obtain two concise and sufficient conditions ensuring global mu-stability of the impulsive reaction-diffusion cellular neural networks with mixed delays. The newly obtained criteria are concerned with the reaction-diffusion coefficients and the regional feature. However, they are independent of boundaries of variable time delays. Several corollaries are also presented. Finally, three concrete numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our main results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
