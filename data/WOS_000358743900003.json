Among the approaches proposed in the literature, the linear parameter varying (LPV) and Takagi-Sugeno (TS) paradigms have proved to be successful in dealing with the different trials that the analyzer, or the designer, of a gain-scheduled control system has to face. Despite the strong similarities between the two paradigms, research on LPV and TS systems has been performed in an independent way and some results that could be useful for both paradigms were obtained only for one of them. However, in recent works, some clues that there is a very close connection between LPV and TS worlds have been presented. The present paper openly addresses the presence of strong analogies between LPV and TS models, in an attempt to establish a bridge between these two worlds, so far considered different. In particular, this paper addresses the modeling problem, presenting two methods for the automated generation of LPV and TS systems, and introducing some measures in order to compare the obtained models. A mathematical example is used to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
