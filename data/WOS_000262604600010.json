More importantly, a conventional nonlinear array receiver is often associated with a high computational complexity that undermines its applicability in practice. In this paper, we present a new approach to adaptive beamforming receiver that provides superior performance in antenna array overloading and in the presence of correlated signals with a low complexity. In particular, the proposed receiver requires a small data-record size to estimate the beamformer weights, which is beneficial in applications with fast fading channels. Simulation examples illustrate the performance improvement of the proposed array receiver when it is compared to the conventional beamformers.
