Our goal is to develop useful tools in dance education such as a creation-support system for ballet teachers and a self-study system for students. The algorithm for automatic composition was integrated to create utilitarian choreographies. As a result of an evaluation test, we verified that the created choreographies had a possibility to be used in the actual lessons. This system is valuable for online virtual dance experimentation and exploration by teachers and choreographers involved in creative practices, improvisation, creative movement, or dance composition.", "paper_title": "Automatic composition and simulation system for ballet sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000245503600003"}
