But a new, more serious challenge has appeared on the scene: an attempt by Peter Smith to prove CTT. His reasoning is an ingenious \"squeezing argument\" that makes crucial use of Kolmogorov-Uspenskii (KU) machines. We analyze Smith's case, and in light of three objections find it wanting. We end by briefly pointing to our next steps in a thorough evaluation of all published attempts to prove CTT.", "paper_title": "In Defense of the Unprovability of the Church-Turing Thesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287425700003"}
