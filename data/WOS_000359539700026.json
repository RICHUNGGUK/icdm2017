While their carbon C3H2 analogs favor classical alkene, allene, and alkyne type bonding, these Si and Ge derivatives are more polarizable and can favor \"highly electron delocalized\"? and \"non-classical\"? structures. The lowest energy Si2CH2 and Ge2CH2 isomers, 1-Si and 1-Ge, exhibit two sets of 3-center 2-electron (3c-2e) bonding; a pi-3c-2e bond involving the heavy atoms (C-Si-Si and C-Ge-Ge), and a sigma 3c-2e bond (Si-H-Si, Ge-H-Ge). Both 3-Si and 3-Ge exhibit pi and sigma-3c-2e bonding involving a planar tetracoordinated carbon (ptC) center. Despite their highly electron delocalized nature, all of the Si2CH2 and Ge2CH2 isomers considered display only modest two pi electron aromatic character (NICS(0)(pi zz) = - -6.2 to -8.9 ppm, computed at the heavy atom ring center) compared to the cyclic-C3H2 (-13.3 ppm).", "paper_title": "Bonding, aromaticity, and planar tetracoordinated carbon in Si2CH2 and Ge2CH2", "paper_id": "WOS:000359539700026"}
