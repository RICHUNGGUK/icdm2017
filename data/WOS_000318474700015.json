We design two new feature descriptors for higher feature descriptiveness, namely the rotation-invariant Gabor-local binary patterns (RGLBP) texture descriptor and multi-coordinate histogram of oriented gradients (MCHOG) gradient descriptor. Together with intensity features, each image patch is then labeled based on its feature approximation from reference image patches. And a new patch-adaptive sparse approximation (PASA) method is designed with the following main components: minimum discrepancy criteria for sparse-based classification, patch-specific adaptation for discriminative approximation, and feature-space weighting for distance computation. The patch-wise labelings are then accumulated as probabilistic estimations for region-level classification. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available ILD database, showing encouraging performance improvements over the state-of-the-arts.", "paper_title": "Feature-Based Image Patch Approximation for Lung Tissue Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000318474700015"}
