In this article, the authors address the fact that being a language, not merely an interface (and simultaneously schema-free), MashQL faces a particular set of challenges. In particular, the authors propose and evaluate a novel technique for optimizing queries over large data sets to allow instant user interaction.", "paper_title": "Querying the Data Web The MashQL Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000277183900009"}
