When the heuristic of the current state is updated, this change is propagated consistently up to k states. Applying this idea to HLRTA*, we have developed the new HLRTA*(k) algorithm, which shows a clear performance improvement over HLRTA*. Experimentally, HLRTA*(k) converges in less trials than LRTA*(k), while the contrary was true for these algorithms without propagation. We provide empirical results showing the benefits of our approach.", "paper_title": "Propagating updates in real-time search: HLRTA*(k)", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100040"}
