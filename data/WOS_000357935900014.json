The equations under consideration are more general, whose transition jump rates matrix Q is not precisely known. Sufficient conditions for testing the stability of such equations are established, and some numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our results are presented.", "paper_title": "Moment exponential stability analysis of Markovian jump stochastic differential equations with uncertain transition jump rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000357935900014"}
