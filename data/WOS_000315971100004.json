Through modeling the access of PUs and multiple classes of SUs as continuous-time Markov chains, we analyze the overall system performance with consideration of a grade-of-service guarantee for both the PUs and the SUs. In addition, two new call admission control (CAC) strategies are devised in our models to enhance the maximum admitted traffic of SUs for the system. Numerical results show that the proposed heterogeneous-prioritized policy achieves higher maximum admitted traffic for SUs. The trade-off between the system's serving capability and the fairness among multiple classes of SUs is also studied. Moreover, the proposed CAC strategies can achieve better performance under max-sum, proportional, and max-min fairness criteria than the conventional CAC strategies.
