Considering the incoherence problem in such sparse-aperture ISAR (SA-ISAR) systems, we concentrate on the study of a coherent processing method in this work. Based on an all-pole model, the incoherence parameters between abutting sub-apertures can be effectively estimated. After coherence compensation, an optimization-based SAISAR imaging approach is provided from the view of statistics. Simulation and real data experiments validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposals.", "paper_title": "Coherent processing for ISAR imaging with sparse apertures", "paper_id": "WOS:000306597400014"}
