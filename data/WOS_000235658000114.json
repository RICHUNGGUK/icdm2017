The concept of workflow views provides a convenient interface for advanced business transactions across enterprise boundaries. However, until now there is little work discussing the implementation issue of workflow views. In this paper, we present a light-weighted implementation model for workflow views, which advocates an easy-to-deploy approach to implement workflow view functions based on existing WFMSs without breaking their integrity. Via this approach, enterprises can equip their workflow systems with the versatile workflow views in an efficient and economical way.", "paper_title": "A light-weighted approach to workflow view implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000114"}
