The architecture is shown to incorporate many properties of natural immune systems, including diversity, self-organization, dynamic adaptation, multi-layered structure, lightweight and disposable components as well as distributed computation. INIAIS is a general artificial immune system architecture that could, in principle, be applied to several domains. In this paper, INIAIS is applied to computer security domain in the form of a network intrusion detection system called INIAIS-NIDS. INIAIS-NIDS is described and shown to; be effective at detecting intrusions, be capable of some automated intrusion response, have increased robustness in intrusions detection, provide improved efficiency of the detection process as a whole, and able of maintaining low false positive rates.", "paper_title": "An Architecture for an Integrated Innate and Adaptive Artificial Immune System (INIAIS - A Novel AIS Architecture)", "paper_id": "WOS:000327681300003"}
