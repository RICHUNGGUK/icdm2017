For successful technology transfer, identification of high-value technologies is a fundamental task. In particular, identifying future promising patents is important, because most technology transfer transactions are aimed at acquiring technologies for future uses. This paper proposes a new approach to identification of promising patents for technology transfer. We adopted TRIZ evolution trends as criteria to evaluate technologies in patents, and Subject-Action-Object (SAO)-based text-mining technique to deal with big patent data and analyze them automatically. The applicability of the proposed method was verified by applying it to technologies related to floating wind turbines. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
