While there is little prior knowledge on the datasets, the proposed iterative imputation method, which impute each missing value several times until the algorithms converges in each model, utilize a substantially useful amount of information. Additionally, this information includes occurrences involving missing values as well as capturing the real dataset distribution easier than the parametric or nonparametric imputation techniques. Experimental results show that the author's imputation methods outperform the existing methods in terms of imputation accuracy, in particular in the situation with high missing ratio.", "paper_title": "Estimating Semi-Parametric Missing Values with Iterative Imputation", "paper_id": "WOS:000280603100001"}
