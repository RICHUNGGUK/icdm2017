Conventionally, researchers adopted linear composition of secrets to resist terrorist fraud attacks. Recently, Peris-Lopez et al. studied the weaknesses of previous RFID distance-bounding protocols and proposed that non-linear composition of secrets and inclusion of more random nonce could help RFID resist key disclosure attack and terrorist fraud attack. In this paper, we will show that non-linear composition of secrets cannot help enhance the security actually.
