The Web's natural semantic heterogeneity presents problems, however - namely, redundancy and ambiguity. The authors' ontology matching, clustering, and disambiguation techniques aim to bridge the gap between syntax and semantics for Semantic Web construction. Their approach discovers and represents the intended meaning of words in Web applications in a nonredundant way, while considering the context in which those words appear.", "paper_title": "Semantic Heterogeneity Issues on the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000308123100010"}
