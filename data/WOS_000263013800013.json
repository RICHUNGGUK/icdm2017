Genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are combined to improve the computing performance in this method. The chromosomes of the multicast tree are represented by tree structure coding to save the time of conversion between encoding space and solution space. A new population initialization method is used to make sure that every chromosome in initial population is reasonable multicast tree without loops. The adaptive crossover probability is used to improve the evolutionary efficiency. The simulation results show that this method has high speed of convergence and search capability. And the problem of least-cost QoS multicast routing is solved effectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
