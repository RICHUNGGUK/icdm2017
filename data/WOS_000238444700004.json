For constant coefficient problems with grid-aligned flow and semi-periodic boundary conditions, we show that the two-grid iteration matrix can be reduced via a set of orthogonal transformations to a matrix containing individual 4x4 blocks. This enables a trivial computation of the norm of the iteration matrix demonstrating rapid convergence in the case of both small and large mesh Peclet numbers, where the streamline-diffusion discretisation is used in the latter case. We also demonstrate that these results are strongly correlated with the properties of the iteration matrix arising from Dirichlet boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "Fourier analysis of multigrid for a model two-dimensional convection-diffusion equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238444700004"}
