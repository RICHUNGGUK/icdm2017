Among the most popular measures is the Synchronization Likelihood which provides a non-linear estimate of the statistical dependencies between the activity time courses of different brain areas. One aspect which has limited a wider use of this algorithm is the fact that it is very computationally and memory demanding. In the present work we propose new implementations and parallelizations of the Synchronization Likelihood algorithm with significantly better performance both in time and in memory use. As a result both the amount of required computational time is reduced by 3 orders of magnitude and the amount of memory needed for calculations is reduced by 2 orders of magnitude. This allows performing analyses that were not feasible before from a computational standpoint.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Implementation of the Synchronization Likelihood Algorithm for Functional Connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000355263700010"}
