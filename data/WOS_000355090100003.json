The modified AHP (MAHP) is able to deal with quantitative factors that are statistics of five individual gene ranking methods: two-sample t-test, entropy test, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test, and signal to noise ratio. The most prominent discriminant genes serve as inputs to a range of classifiers including linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, probabilistic neural network, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron. Gene subsets selected by MAHP are compared with those of four competing approaches: information gain, symmetrical uncertainty, Bhattacharyya distance and ReliefF. Four benchmark microarray datasets: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer, prostate and colon are utilized for experiments. As the number of samples in microarray data datasets are limited, the leave one out cross validation strategy is applied rather than the traditional cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant dominance of the proposed MAHP against the competing methods in terms of both accuracy and stability. With a benefit of inexpensive computational cost, MAHP is useful for cancer diagnosis using DNA gene expression profiles in the real clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
